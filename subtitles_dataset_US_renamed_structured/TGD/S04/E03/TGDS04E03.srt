1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,532
Hello. I'm Freddie Highmore.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,400
The following episode
portrays our hope for the future.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,535
A future where no one
will have to wear masks

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,876
or take other steps to
stay safe from COVID.

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,412
Until then, please protect
yourself and others.

6
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,152
I'm Jordan Allen. My
first year in med school,

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,485
I designed an ankle brace

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,618
that monitors the extent of
immobilization via a phone app.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,059
When I licensed it to Bioventus,

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,723
I was able to pay off
over half my student loans.

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,290
John Lundberg.

12
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,496
I've worked every summer since I
was 16 at Camp Hope Heartland,

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,436
a summer program
for kids with cancer

14
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,064
in Des Moines, where I grew up.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,006
Asher Wolke.

16
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,341
Uh, when I was 18, I left
the Hasidic community

17
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,971
that I was raised in.

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,039
I realized if there
really was a God,

19
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,812
it had to be a cruel being

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,581
that I felt nothing
but contempt for.

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,514
That's also when I
decided to go to med school,

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,081
and start dating men.

23
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,622
I'm Olivia Jackson.
I'm 25. From Chicago.

24
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,463
I play ragtime piano
alone in my apartment.

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,136
Is that interesting?

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,335
Will Hooper.

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,845
Uh, technically, I'm
a professional athlete.

28
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,078
Although in a sport
nobody pays attention to,

29
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,982
and the stipend barely
covers our training expenses,

30
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,987
but I'm on the U.S.
National Rowing Team.

31
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,548
Men's Eight.

32
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,992
Hey, I'm Enrique.

33
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,818
I spent last summer
in Costa Rica,

34
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:38,093
where I learned to surf, which
I'm totally obsessed with now.

35
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:43,633
Uh, I had a pretty interesting
encounter with a saltwater crocodile.

36
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,705
I just thought it was a big...

37
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,071
Why are you wearing a swimsuit?

38
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,572
They're actually
hybrid board shorts.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,944
I like to work hard, and it's easier
to do when you're comfortable.

40
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,084
Plus, I think the casual
dress puts patients at ease.

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,195
Uh, and Dr. Lim said
that the shorts were fine.

42
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,233
Hospital policy
requires all residents to...

43
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,828
He's not a resident.
He's a resident applicant.

44
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,032
One of six finalists
for four openings.

45
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,905
Now, they'll be
shadowing for two days.

46
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,753
Give them the grand
tour, show them the ropes.

47
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,322
Feel free to turn up the heat,
see how they react under pressure.

48
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,781
You will be responsible
for supervising them,

49
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,342
so I want your totally honest input
before I make any final decisions.

50
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,014
- Those shorts...
- Eh, let's call them strike one.

51
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,058
Oh. And in addition
to being an Olympian,

52
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,388
Will Hooper is a Rhodes

53
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,156
and graduated top of
his class at Stanford.

54
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,222
- He is very handsome.
- He's very full of himself.

55
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,028
He's ranked first by
every top program,

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,695
so whatever you can do
to recruit him to ours, do it.

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,832
- I can already give you my input on the...
- Don't judge a book by its board shorts.

58
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,885
- You wanted to see me?
- Good morning.

59
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,346
Sorry. Good morning.

60
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,948
What'd I do wrong?

61
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,119
I just wanted to check in, see
how the new role was coming along.

62
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,218
Honestly?

63
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,056
You could start a new supervisor-resident
relationship with a lie.

64
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,193
That's always fun.

65
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,866
Internal medicine is...

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
boring.

67
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,905
Between smokers
and obese diabetics,

68
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,572
seems like all I'm doing is
protecting people from themselves.

69
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,585
As a surgical resident, you
never treated drunk drivers

70
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,918
or extracted random
objects from guys'...?

71
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,390
- I get it. People are stupid.
- Not my point, but true.

72
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,396
Not the same adrenaline rush,

73
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,898
but internal medicine
can be rewarding.

74
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,132
Given time, if you're patient.

75
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,803
Thanks.

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,900
That is not how I thought
this meeting was gonna go.

77
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,036
I thought one of the nurses
complained about me.

78
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,240
Wasn't just one.

79
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,515
If it happens again,

80
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,417
this meeting will go exactly
how you thought it would.

81
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,234
Sorry. I should've just
canceled the appointment.

82
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,668
You were right.

83
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,736
Dizziness went away

84
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,049
as soon as I stopped drinking
coffee and Red Bull all day.

85
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,302
No worries.

86
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,174
- Can you lie flat on your back, please?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,238
You get that scar in a fire?

88
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,313
Sort of.

89
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,647
A homemade Roman
candle when I was 12.

90
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:47,745
You'd be surprised how many of us
at the firehouse were pyros as kids.

91
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,783
I made a potato gun for
my sixth-grade science fair.

92
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,450
Almost got me
kicked out of school.

93
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,257
You'll have to come visit us
sometime. You'd fit right in.

94
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,293
- You see something?
- Don't talk. Just breathe normally.

95
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,269
You have a large tumor
on the wall of your heart.

96
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,771
Cancer?

97
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,042
I don't know.

98
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,608
But you're definitely gonna
need surgery. As soon as possible.

99
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,976
I appreciate you letting me share
your case with the whole class.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,437
No problem. I stopped being shy
after the hundredth time I had to do this.

101
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,633
I'll be using a version of
Lejour's technique I've adapted.

102
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,972
We'll divide the breast
into three pedicles

103
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,478
and then redistribute the
tissue and insert saline implants

104
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,605
to correct the tuberous
breast deformity.

105
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,049
Why would you want breast
implants? You're beautiful.

106
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,177
And your breasts look
fine just the way they are.

107
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,085
No, no, they don't.

108
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,124
The base is constricted,

109
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,988
horizontal
development is deficient,

110
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,687
and the nipple-areola complex...

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,591
Murphy.

112
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,153
It's okay. He's right.
That's why I'm here.

113
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,863
Thank you. I know that
you're trying to be nice.

114
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,734
My friends and family have
been telling me for years,

115
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,797
"You're beautiful
just the way you are."

116
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,070
But I don't feel beautiful.

117
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,443
You're 17. Every girl
your age feels like that.

118
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,038
That can't be true.

119
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,448
Tuberous breast
deformity is a rare condition.

120
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,112
We're not going to
debate a personal decision

121
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,553
the patient's already made.

122
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,249
I've been thinking
about this since I was 13.

123
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,352
Every time I look in the mirror.

124
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,023
I'm about to start
college, and there's no way

125
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,863
that I'm gonna begin this
new chapter until I'm fixed.

126
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,059
Great.

127
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,104
You thinking median
sternotomy or right thoracotomy?

128
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,872
I'm thinking I should finish
my review of the imaging.

129
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,311
Sure. No rush.

130
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,940
Actually, there is a bit of a
rush. But you know what I mean.

131
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,886
So, newbies. What
up? Where you all from?

132
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,547
- Like hometowns or...?
- Med schools.

133
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,989
- Why would I care where you grew up?
- Stanford.

134
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,617
- Uh, NYU.
- Harvard.

135
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,822
- Preferred specialties?
- Ortho. All the way.

136
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,896
Neuro.

137
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,162
I'm planning a dual specialty in
neonatal and pediatric oncology.

138
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,463
Impressive. Also unlikely.

139
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,767
I know it's a ton of work, but
I'm pretty good at multitasking.

140
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,898
In med school, I did
a combined MD/PhD...

141
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,499
- What's your mom do?
- My mom?

142
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,306
- Don't stall. Just answer.
- She teaches high-school French.

143
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,579
- Homemaker.
- Surgeon.

144
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,173
Ouch. Dad?

145
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,719
- Also a surgeon.
- Double ouch. And yours?

146
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,846
- Hasidic rabbi.
- You've left the nest.

147
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,913
Actually, the whole forest.

148
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,449
And yours obviously
works on Wall Street.

149
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,429
But not a trader. I'm
guessing an M&A lawyer.

150
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,496
How do you know?

151
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,023
She's read your résumé,
researched your social media.

152
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,194
She's probably run
a credit check too.

153
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,034
And you're under 50 but wear
Brooks Brothers button-downs.

154
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,300
Are you done yet?

155
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,468
Left thoracotomy
with a possible incision

156
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,638
into the right atrium and
interatrial septum as needed.

157
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,772
Left atrial approach

158
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,112
through Sondergaard's
groove makes more sense.

159
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,378
Not to me.

160
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,618
- He's my patient.
- But you're not a surgeon.

161
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,055
Which is why there's no
reason for you to be grilling them

162
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,649
or picking the approach.

163
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,627
Stop worrying about
protecting your turf.

164
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,734
Stop stepping all over it.

165
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,821
You're looking at tests
I did for my patient.

166
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,490
How am I stepping
all over your turf?

167
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,899
I think what Dr. Browne
is trying to say is,

168
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,631
given there's no perfect
approach, maybe it's best to defer

169
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,639
to the surgical department's
recommendation.

170
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,036
Did he just mansplain?

171
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,640
- Not at all. I was just...
- So you're just gonna do it again?

172
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,840
- No, I'm just trying to...
- Shut up.

173
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,581
We're gonna go in
through a left thoracotomy.

174
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,087
Not my preference,
but it'll work.

175
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,450
What were you thinking?
You thought you'd impress me

176
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,519
by undermining the patient's
confidence in my judgment?

177
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,656
I'm sorry. That
wasn't my intent.

178
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,324
And you're supposed
to be a mentor now,

179
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,495
modeling professional behavior,
not making it worse, Murphy.

180
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,769
She questioned your
surgical plan, I defended it.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,742
- How can we both be wrong?
- I don't need you to defend me.

182
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,942
And I never want to have a
surgical debate in front of a patient.

183
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,374
We're not in front
of the patient now.

184
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,844
The patient's breasts are
small and a bit asymmetrical,

185
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,220
but no woman's breasts
are perfectly shaped.

186
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,995
You're wearing Prada shoes
and a Dolce & Gabbana blouse,

187
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,806
which cost more than
most med students' rent,

188
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,458
so clearly you understand

189
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,262
your appearance has
a tremendous impact

190
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,357
on how people treat you.

191
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,963
There's a difference between
nice clothes and a major surgery.

192
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,501
And I also understand the
cosmetic surgery industry

193
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,909
is dominated by male
physicians with a sexist bias.

194
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,945
I've invited you to observe
as a learning opportunity.

195
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,892
So I'd suggest less
lecturing and more listening.

196
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,354
We'll access the
tumor via an incision

197
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,423
in the chest wall
between your ribs.

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,060
It'll be an easier recovery
than if we opened your sternum.

199
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,731
Are you sure you don't
want us to call your family

200
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,829
before we put you under?

201
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,636
Why? So they can
freak out and worry?

202
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,668
I'd rather give them the
good news when it's over.

203
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,009
It is going to be
good news, right?

204
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,048
With a bit of cardiac rehab
and a positive attitude,

205
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,483
which I know you have,

206
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,146
you'll be back sliding
down the fire pole in no time.

207
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,484
Our firehouse has stairs.

208
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,784
Hmm. Bummer.

209
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,819
It's a social media group
where we all pretend to be ants.

210
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,496
Why?

211
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,222
Because ants don't care
about politics, sports teams,

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,633
or anything else people
get so savage about.

213
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,366
Male ants develop
from unfertilized eggs,

214
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,568
which means they don't have
a father and can't have sons,

215
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,737
but they do have grandfathers
and can have grandsons.

216
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,906
Interesting. And confusing.

217
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,951
Is it just me, or are those
doctors watching us?

218
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,452
They're the new
resident applicants.

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,719
They're here so Park, Claire and
I can evaluate them for Dr. Lim.

220
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,691
So why are they
standing over there?

221
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:04,955
Park had a video chat with Kellan,
and I had a real lunch with you.

222
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,798
Shaun, you can't just have
them stand there while you eat.

223
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,668
Part of being a good
boss is being a good host,

224
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,832
so you need to
introduce them to people.

225
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,637
Like me. Right now.

226
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,308
Come here, please.

227
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,250
Dr. Allen, Dr. Lundberg,
Dr. Guerin, this is my girlfriend, Lea.

228
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,256
She runs the IT
department now. Okay.

229
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,656
Nice to meet you
all. Please join us.

230
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,694
Shaun's been telling
me all about you.

231
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,424
Mm. No, I haven't.

232
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,433
So I hope Shaun's not
being too hard on you.

233
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,730
No, he's been great.

234
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,534
And the case we're
observing is really interesting.

235
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,837
We're correcting a 17-year-old
girl's tuberous breasts

236
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,604
with saline implants.

237
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,272
Dr. Allen told Dr. Andrews
it was unethical.

238
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,279
He got mad.

239
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,408
I didn't say it was
unethical. I just...

240
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,382
I suppose I shouldn't
have interfered.

241
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,389
Well, I don't know what
a tuberous breast is,

242
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,426
but I think implants
are way overrated.

243
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,821
That's because your
breasts are excellent.

244
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,095
Thank you. That's
exactly my point.

245
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,363
Mine aren't huge,

246
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,305
but every guy who's ever seen them
up close and personal has been thrilled.

247
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,033
I definitely was.

248
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,874
I am thrilled by every
part of your body.

249
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,210
Sorry, my bad. Total TMI.

250
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,981
I'm not even bothered
by your adenoidal voice.

251
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,420
Except when you talk to
your mom on the phone.

252
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,287
But I just put on headphones.

253
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,827
At least you'll know he'll
be a totally honest boss.

254
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,317
The incision is
extended superiorly

255
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,020
to meet the atriotomy, and then
the interatrial septum is opened up.

256
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,044
Retractor.

257
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,472
A Carpentier retractor is used
to visualize the mitral valve.

258
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,781
That will allow a
clear view of the tumor.

259
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,080
Can we turn the channel?

260
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,121
Color commentary's
getting a bit annoying.

261
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,987
With the right
atrium opened obliq...

262
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,094
How's Team Browne?
Any early standouts?

263
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,494
Jackson's a bit
timid, but smart.

264
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,930
Wolke is definitely
enthusiastic.

265
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,764
And your star recruit is...

266
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,105
pretty full of himself.

267
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,505
I'm looking for surgeons,
and according to his recs,

268
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,475
he can dissect and
suture like a pro.

269
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,469
I thought you were
also looking for our input.

270
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,640
He's ranked first by
every top program.

271
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,116
You really think they're
all wrong and you're right?

272
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,378
So, what brings
you all to the biz?

273
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,255
Had my ACL
reconstructed in high school,

274
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,157
both my rotators in college.

275
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,854
I love the idea of fixing people,
helping them be the best they can be.

276
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,601
Surgeons are the ones
with the God complex, right?

277
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,231
I have that.

278
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,605
I spent my life speaking
Yiddish and studying the Talmud

279
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,338
and not shaving
the sides of my hair

280
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,539
because someone up
there supposedly cares.

281
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,042
But then I realized...

282
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,879
no one's up there.

283
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,486
No one cares.

284
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,183
No benevolent higher power
is going to save us, so...

285
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,162
we have to save each other.

286
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,394
Can you top that?

287
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,231
- Definitely not.
- Try anyway.

288
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,764
You're obviously smart. You've
got two degrees from Harvard.

289
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,205
My parents are Harvard alums,
so I'm sure that helped me get in.

290
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,710
You're not gonna get hired
by undermining your own ex...

291
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,075
Something went wrong.

292
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,114
They nicked a pulmonary artery.

293
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,777
If they had, Browne
would be suctioning,

294
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,649
instead of Lim reaching
in with her hands.

295
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,871
What are they doing now?

296
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,925
Nothing.

297
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,057
We can't access the tumor

298
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,240
without compromising his
entire cardiac outflow tract.

299
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,857
What about going in
the way I suggested?

300
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,195
The median sternotomy.

301
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,429
The tumor's too far back.
We need to close him up.

302
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,511
Proton beam radiation
would be too toxic to the heart.

303
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,344
Well, so is immunotherapy.

304
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,578
We can't access the
entire tumor surgically,

305
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,120
and we can't kill it without
killing his heart along with it.

306
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,786
What if we cut out the
parts we can access

307
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,416
and try our luck with
chemo on what's left?

308
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,226
IV doxorubicin and ifosfamide
might slow the growth,

309
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,389
give him a few more months.

310
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,059
I'm not sending my patient
home with just a few extra months.

311
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,260
It's better than nothing.

312
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,530
- What about a transplant?
- Not an option.

313
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,629
Heart tumors are
a contraindication.

314
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,231
What if we transplant
his own heart?

315
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,177
If we take it totally out of his chest,
we'd have access to the posterior heart.

316
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,771
We could excise the tumor,
fix the defect left behind,

317
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,848
and then put it back in.

318
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,747
Cool.

319
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,286
Not cool. At least with a
normal heart transplant,

320
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,082
you'd be getting
a healthy heart.

321
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,385
Her idea keeps the risk
of removing the heart

322
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,756
and adds the risk that the
heart we'd be putting back in

323
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,092
has just been severely compromised,
having had a tumor cut out of it.

324
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,860
He's young, and the part of his
heart not infiltrated with tumor is strong.

325
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,796
Do a cardiac MRA

326
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,362
and see if the tumor's
infiltrated the coronary arteries.

327
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,635
If it hasn't, Morgan's
idea could work.

328
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,732
I'll schedule it.

329
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,277
Dr. Murphy is dividing
the breast parenchyma

330
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,646
into three pedicles.

331
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,377
Anyone know where this
technique is derived from?

332
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,011
Breast reduction surgery.

333
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,111
That's right.

334
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,057
And why would I use a
breast reduction technique

335
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,991
to make the patient's
breasts larger?

336
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,189
The technique
frees up the tissue.

337
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,526
You can bring the pedicles
together to make the breasts smaller

338
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,037
or spread them out over an
implant to make them larger.

339
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,399
Very good.

340
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:50,170
And now I'm going to turn the sound
off. Don't worry, nothing's wrong.

341
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,008
I just wanna talk about you
behind your backs for a little bit.

342
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,643
So first impressions. Murphy?

343
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,550
I like Dr. John Lundberg.

344
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,382
I haven't even
heard him speak yet.

345
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,448
He has the highest USMLE scores.

346
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,652
And that's important to you?

347
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,423
Yes. It shows he has a
broad knowledge of medicine.

348
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,525
What is important to you?

349
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,901
Well, I'm more interested in what
they can do with their knowledge.

350
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,770
Which is why, so far, I'm most
impressed with Jordan Allen.

351
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,178
No. No. You said
she undermined you.

352
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,406
Which takes courage

353
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
and an assertiveness
that will serve her well.

354
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,610
Then why did you tell
her to stop lecturing you?

355
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,385
It's easier to teach an
aggressive resident restraint

356
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,754
than a passive one
to assert themselves.

357
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,260
How about you, Park?
What's important to you?

358
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,561
I want to know who I can stand
to be around for 80 hours a week.

359
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,295
One thing I learned as a cop,
you don't really know a person

360
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,394
until you've had a
few drinks with them.

361
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,744
LAD and circumflex look clean.

362
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:04,147
What's with the right coronary?
It looks narrowed at the origin.

363
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,913
It's a bit narrow, but
looks like a normal variant.

364
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,249
Yeah, but it seems hazy,

365
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,257
like there could be
some tumor infiltration.

366
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,586
What do you guys think?

367
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,357
- Us?
- Yeah. Come take a look.

368
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,665
I guess...

369
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,340
- It's angiogenesis of the left...
- Stop.

370
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,165
Interrupting a female coworker is
almost as annoying as mansplaining.

371
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,502
This isn't a rowing race.

372
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,543
You don't always
have to speak first.

373
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,871
I... do not love
the interruption.

374
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,511
But... I like the enthusiasm.

375
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,347
What were you gonna say?

376
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,949
First, uh, I'm not sexist.

377
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,520
Of course not.

378
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,257
He's shifting from right-
to left-dominant circulation

379
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,924
to feed blood to the tumor.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,332
- Angiogenesis.
- I doubt it.

381
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,666
Surgery showed his tumor
extending to the right as well.

382
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,000
What were you gonna say?

383
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,206
The pulmonary artery is
right behind that vessel.

384
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,839
It's causing radiographic
scatter in this area.

385
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,110
The haze is just an artifact.
His arteries are clean.

386
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,346
- I think she's right.
- Hmm.

387
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,319
Your idea might just work.

388
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,764
If you invert the sutures
and bury them under the skin,

389
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,595
the scar will be invisible.

390
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,533
No one will ever
know we were here.

391
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,166
Nice work, both of you.

392
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,837
Her BP's dropping.

393
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,673
Push fluids, start IV pressors.

394
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,873
Check for bleeding. She's in
V-tach. Move in the crash cart.

395
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,517
No bleeding. No hematomas.

396
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,087
Charging.

397
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,179
Clear.

398
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,066
Sinus rhythm. Her
BP is stabilizing.

399
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,030
Get her to the ICU.

400
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,335
I want post-op labs, CTA chest,

401
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,375
and full 24-hour
cardiac telemetry.

402
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,307
We need to figure out
what just happened.

403
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,221
She's stable, but diffuse
delta wave slowing,

404
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,689
minimal brain activity.

405
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,854
An undiagnosed metabolic disorder
could've caused an adverse reaction

406
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,987
to the anesthesia.

407
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,724
Yeah, but her pre-op
labs were all normal.

408
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,891
It's gotta be some sort
of hidden heart condition.

409
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,297
You're big on opinions.
How are you with ideas?

410
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,564
What would you do next?

411
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,073
I'd check train-of-fours

412
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,111
and reverse the
paralytics with neostigmine.

413
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,373
If Dr. Murphy's right,
she should wake up.

414
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,577
Smart. But risky. The
meds will stress her heart.

415
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,778
If Park's right, she
could arrest again.

416
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,251
I saw a similar case
last year in Borneo.

417
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,816
- You interned at a hospital in Borneo?
- Uh, no.

418
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,886
I volunteered at an
orangutan rescue foundation.

419
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,064
Our guide, a local
villager, fell out of a tree.

420
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,193
He was like 80 feet up.

421
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,533
How is falling out
of a tree similar

422
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,802
to a patient arresting during
breast reconstruction surgery?

423
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,605
Well, he broke his back, but
when we got him to the hospital,

424
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,838
I found he also had heart
damage from rheumatic fever

425
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,973
and metabolic abnormality
from iodine deficiency.

426
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,585
It's rare here, but
it's common there.

427
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,052
We only realized it when we
ran a nuclear perfusion scan

428
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,144
of his entire body.

429
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:30,846
Good catch.

430
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,519
But a scan that extensive
requires multiple radioactive tracers.

431
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,113
You think her heart
could handle that?

432
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,664
Not tonight. I'll get
consent from the mom.

433
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,161
We'll do it first
thing in the morning.

434
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:46,172
Once we confirm atrial closure,
we'll put the heart back in.

435
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,902
Dr. Lim will reconnect the aorta
and the superior venous connections,

436
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,671
while I connect the inferior.

437
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,976
During my sub-internship, I
assisted on multiple heart transplants.

438
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,054
Even sutured the
atrial cuff in one.

439
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,147
I got to scrub in on a
liver transplant once.

440
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,653
- The patient died.
- What'd you learn?

441
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,491
That bile duct leaks are a lot
harder to detect than bleeds.

442
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,189
Good. Next time I'd lead with
that instead of the patient's death.

443
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,798
- Are you all done yet?
- Why?

444
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,328
Dr. Park wants everyone
to join him in the break room.

445
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,409
I'm Alex Park.

446
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,473
I'm a former amateur
martial-arts competitor

447
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,018
who once thought it'd be fun

448
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,919
to spar with a pro boxer
visiting my dad's gym.

449
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,187
And that guy was,
uh, Mike Tyson.

450
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,359
Who's Mike Tyson?

451
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,865
Uh, guy from <i>The Hangover.</i>

452
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,162
With the tiger and
the tattoo on his face.

453
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,869
Nice. You've just revealed
you're crazy and old.

454
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,339
I've seen the musical
<i>Wicked</i> over 50 times.

455
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,278
The San Francisco tryout,
Broadway, Chicago...

456
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,078
I've even seen a friend's
boyfriend's niece play Glinda

457
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,515
at Stagedoor summer camp.

458
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,013
Nerd. Next.

459
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,527
I'm Claire Browne. Um...

460
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,428
I love music, but hate musicals.

461
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,125
And, um, I don't...

462
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,764
I don't really like to talk about
myself, so it's Shaun's turn, yeah.

463
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,707
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy.

464
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,406
I used to not like music,

465
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,609
but my girlfriend, Lea,
she changed my mind.

466
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:41,381
I also like to watch the
Weather Channel on TV.

467
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,412
And...

468
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,426
ooh, I think pickles
are disgusting.

469
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,464
Cops know how to manage up.
Managing down's another story.

470
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,969
Well, he's mature, thoughtful,
doesn't have an ego.

471
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,396
Neither does Murphy, but
do you think that qualifies him

472
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,100
to supervise first-years?

473
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:07,541
Well, Murphy's smart, brutally honest,
has no regard for social convention.

474
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,741
- Hmm.
- It works for Bill Belichick.

475
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,516
The Patriots are the most
corrupt, dishonest organization

476
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,780
in the history of the NFL.

477
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,786
Well, the Seahawks suck.

478
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,317
So how's your
experience been here?

479
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,652
It's been good.

480
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,159
Did you consider any other
programs, or was this your first choice?

481
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,636
This was my only choice.

482
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,772
Why do you hate God?

483
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:40,276
Oh. Uh, actually, I don't
believe there is a God.

484
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:45,314
I thought maybe it was because
you believed he hated homosexuals.

485
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:49,789
I don't think this is something that
we should be discussing at work.

486
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,855
Mm.

487
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,552
Why not?

488
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,356
Well, because it's... personal.

489
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,302
Do you have a boyfriend?

490
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,635
I'm sorry, but you can't ask
that question in a workplace.

491
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,164
Dr. Park, he wants
us to get to know you.

492
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,735
How can I do that without
asking personal questions?

493
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,382
I have a girlfriend, and
she is very important to me.

494
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,748
It affects my life in every way.

495
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,079
Probably should've
thought of that

496
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,613
before you told her how
much her voice annoyed you.

497
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:30,162
I said it didn't bother me.
It... It was a compliment.

498
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:33,324
What I heard is you
criticizing her voice,

499
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,334
and you bringing
her mother into it.

500
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,696
You're in trouble.

501
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,210
What about Browne?

502
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,178
She may have as much
problem being a leader as Murphy,

503
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,614
and without his gifts.

504
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,778
She has her own gifts.

505
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,514
Yeah, dealing with
patients and their families.

506
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,421
But with her colleagues,
she can be insecure.

507
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,218
Her assertiveness has
always been a question mark.

508
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,354
They've all got areas
that need improving,

509
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:06,058
but I've gotten to know Browne a
bit better these past few months.

510
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,229
She's stronger than she looks.

511
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,737
When's the last time you saw
anyone dig a ditch in a suit?

512
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,604
Surgeons don't dig ditches.

513
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,701
They help people at the most
vulnerable time in their life.

514
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,806
And you shouldn't
take the responsibility on

515
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,542
if you're not fully
committed to it.

516
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,547
You're entering a new
phase in your career,

517
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,950
a position of authority.

518
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,387
Maybe my clothes are
making you feel disrespected.

519
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:35,224
But the truth is, I just hate wearing
anything that makes me feel like...

520
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:37,562
a suit.

521
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,800
Great news. I was able to get
Sowinski on anesthesia for tomorrow.

522
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,632
Uh, why? What happened to Foley?

523
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,303
Nothing. I just think
Sowinski's better.

524
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,239
And we definitely
need the A-team on this.

525
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,434
Yeah, I agree.

526
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,603
Which is why I went out
of my way to get Foley.

527
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,772
But Foley doesn't do
well under pressure.

528
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,213
- Remember that ti...
- Morgan.

529
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:57,914
You need to butt out.

530
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,918
You're not a surgeon.
This is not your job.

531
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:04,420
My job is to help my patient
through the entire treatment process.

532
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,619
The best anesthesiologist for
transplant surgery is Sowinski.

533
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,133
I've already cleared it with
Lim, so that's who it's gonna be.

534
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,823
Deal with it.

535
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,435
Are you mad at me?

536
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,141
I said your voice
doesn't bother me.

537
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,715
It was a compliment.

538
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,585
Actually, what you said is that
you love my breasts so much

539
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,750
that with the help of
noise-canceling headphones,

540
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,226
you're willing to put up
with my annoying voice.

541
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,386
Yes.

542
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,488
Not a compliment.

543
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:48,966
Oh.

544
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,098
- So you are mad at me?
- I'm not mad, Shaun.

545
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,531
I'm just busy trying to keep
like a billion bots and hackers

546
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:55,573
out of our network.

547
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,144
Actually, no, I'm not
doing that. Gonna go home.

548
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:05,344
You want to have some tequila,
stat? We also have some pizza left.

549
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,912
- No. I don't want tequila or pizza.
- That must mean you're mad.

550
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:14,619
I'm just upset. And confused.

551
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,629
And I really don't think there
is anything you can do about it,

552
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,064
so you just need to stop
trying and leave me alone.

553
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:34,010
- She's not mad at me.
- She's definitely mad at you.

554
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,913
She doesn't usually
hide what she thinks.

555
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,575
She's not mad at him.

556
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,214
She knows how
he is, how he talks.

557
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,789
She's mad at
herself. And scared.

558
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,925
We all have stuff that
we're insecure about.

559
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,967
That's why it's so
risky falling in love.

560
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,618
We all hope that when
we let our guard down,

561
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,931
it's for the one person
that doesn't see our flaws.

562
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,774
So, what do I do?

563
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,311
You were being honest.
You can't apologize that away.

564
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,253
You gotta figure out what she needs
to feel secure in the relationship again.

565
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,283
Don't look at me. I'm single.

566
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,555
It's not my place to
comment on your personal life.

567
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,258
You have an
opinion. Let's hear it.

568
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:27,832
Fine.

569
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,159
Can you zoom in
on her skull base?

570
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,534
I can, but why?

571
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,665
We're worried about her heart
and metabolic abnormalities.

572
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,436
We shouldn't be. Not anymore.

573
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,572
You and Dr. Murphy
were both wrong.

574
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,116
She doesn't have a
cardiac or metabolic issue.

575
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,345
She has poor blood flow
in the artery supplying blood

576
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,513
to the area of her brain
that controls consciousness.

577
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:52,387
A small clot in her
artery of Percheron.

578
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,485
If we don't remove it fast,
she's never going to wake up.

579
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,574
That's amazing.

580
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,870
No, it's not.

581
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,912
The heart's totally outside
of the body and still beating.

582
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,744
It's like it has a
mind of its own.

583
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,250
She should've started
the reimplantation by now.

584
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,082
Is everything okay, Dr. Lim?

585
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,952
The tumor had tendrils
invading the right atrial wall.

586
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,424
We took so much tissue to get a
clear margin, there's not enough left

587
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,518
to reconstruct his
heart's inflow chambers.

588
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,892
How about expanded PTFE graft?

589
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,074
There's not enough atrial
remnant to attach the graft.

590
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,361
You can use the septal wall.

591
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,311
He's got dense
conduction fibers there.

592
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,212
- It could cause heart arrhythmias.
- Not if you...

593
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,515
He's got low arterial pressure.

594
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,317
He's springing leaks
at the cannulation sites.

595
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,537
It's a bleeding disorder
caused by prolonged bypass.

596
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,169
You need to get his
heart back in ASAP.

597
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,078
Morgan, we can't put the heart
back in with two missing chambers.

598
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,399
It's a rare complication,

599
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,688
but a blood clot is
a risk in any surgery.

600
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,104
It's too deep in the
brain for open surgery.

601
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,427
If we go rooting around in
there, we'd damage the PCA.

602
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,521
We'd kill her.

603
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,592
We could inject a
dissolving agent into the clot.

604
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,662
There's a 50% probability
it won't fully dissolve,

605
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,571
which could leave her
with permanent weakness

606
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,869
and cognitive difficulties.

607
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,934
Assuming she wakes up at all.

608
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,716
We need to remove the
clot with a stent retriever.

609
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,852
If we rupture the
posterior cerebral artery,

610
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,413
she'll die on the table.

611
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,527
Or total recovery.

612
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:41,597
That's how she came into this
hospital. That's how she's leaving.

613
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,128
Prep her for stent retrieval.

614
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,942
Hanging platelets and
fresh frozen plasma.

615
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,807
His pressure is
still in the toilet.

616
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,540
But the bleeding
is slowing down.

617
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:55,808
Not for long.

618
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,009
Small intestine submucosa
has the right compliance

619
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,608
to shape the
chamber walls, but...

620
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,448
There isn't enough to
cover that much area.

621
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,115
Use too little and he'll
have heart failure in a month.

622
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,987
I know. That's the "but."

623
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,336
How thick is his deep fascia?
If it's over 2 millimeters...

624
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,761
Morgan, get out.

625
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,059
- I'm sorry. I'll be quiet.
- No, you won't. You can't.

626
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,794
So leave the OR gallery.

627
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,203
Now.

628
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,778
We need 2.6-millimeter-thick
tissue with perfect compliance

629
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,339
for arterial filling and
contractile pressures.

630
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,614
If it was just the valve, we'd
use a bovine pericardial graft.

631
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,555
But cow heart tissue is not durable
enough to do an entire chamber.

632
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,615
But pig bladder
tissue is just right.

633
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,186
I've used it for bladder
reconstructive surgeries,

634
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,456
but never hearts.

635
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,828
Let's rebuild the
entire atrial walls with it.

636
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,076
Get down to the
tissue procurement lab

637
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,262
and get 200 centimeters
of porcine bladder tissue.

638
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,042
Her EEG delta waves
are slowing further.

639
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,811
She only has one vessel
feeding her thalamus.

640
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,385
That's why the clot
landed where it did.

641
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,390
I'm approaching the
artery of Percheron.

642
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,386
I'm one millimeter
from the clot.

643
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,459
Stop right there.

644
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,429
If we disrupt this clot, we could
cause a shower of emboli into her brain.

645
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,218
Deploying the retriever.

646
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,561
- EEG just went flatline.
- Calm down. I'm almost...

647
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,470
Got it.

648
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,904
Blood's flowing
through the artery.

649
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,504
Her brain tracing's
looking better.

650
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,348
This should fill the gap between
the inferior and superior vena cava

651
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,417
when the new
chambers get sewn in.

652
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,792
Where's that graft?

653
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,596
I need more sponges. The
bleeding is getting worse.

654
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,376
Ah, he's tanking.

655
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Can you push epi?

656
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,730
I already did. He's maxing out.

657
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,998
I'm running out of ways
to keep his pressure up.

658
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,802
I got it. They had
205 centimeters of it.

659
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,599
Thank you.

660
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,571
If you want to gown up, you
can watch from down here.

661
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,307
Definitely. Thanks.

662
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,614
I thought telling her how much I
love her in front of other people

663
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,984
would make her feel good.

664
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:52,752
But Dr. Guerin said I made
her feel insecure and scared.

665
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,789
Women are sensitive.

666
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,553
When commenting on their flaws,

667
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:00,121
total honesty is a
high-risk procedure.

668
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,598
That sounds sexist.

669
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,261
Aren't men also
insecure about their flaws?

670
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:07,602
Men are much, much worse.
And also, we're really stupid.

671
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,234
Okay, what can I do now?

672
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,869
I've already said
my stupid stuff.

673
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,971
I don't want her to
be upset with me.

674
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,307
I have a thought.

675
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,086
I think this run of sutures
will hold it to the annulus,

676
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,316
but I'm worried about leaks.

677
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,918
We can put a second row of pledgeted
sutures to make sure it's hemostatic.

678
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,758
That is unreal.

679
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,595
It's a work of art.

680
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,896
Now let's get it back in

681
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,164
while we can still get
him off bypass alive.

682
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,301
Reperfusing the heart.

683
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:51,172
We've got a rhythm.

684
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:20,902
Hey.

685
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,878
There was a complication
during the reconstruction surgery.

686
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,819
A clot, which caused
you to lapse into a coma.

687
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,952
We performed a second surgery
on your brain, which was successful.

688
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,085
Um...

689
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,424
You're gonna be fine.

690
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,888
But my breasts?

691
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:43,696
The clot occurred after we
finished inserting the implants.

692
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,905
I think you're gonna be
very pleased with the results.

693
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,769
Thank you.

694
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,243
Yeah.

695
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,883
I think I'm sorry.

696
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,187
Dr. Guerin said I should
never say anything

697
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,924
that might sound
negative to a girlfriend.

698
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:17,196
And Dr. Glassman said total
honesty is a high-risk procedure

699
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,002
with a girlfriend.

700
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,234
It's better to show my
love than try to explain it.

701
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:30,774
But I want to be
totally honest with you.

702
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,818
I don't like your body...

703
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,719
because it's excellent.

704
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,728
I like it because it's yours.

705
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,467
And I love hearing you talk.

706
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,128
When I hear your voice,

707
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,865
especially when I've
had a difficult day,

708
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,738
I find it comforting.

709
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,143
Now I want to hug you. Can I?

710
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,449
I'd like that.

711
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,456
I love you.

712
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,225
Thank you...

713
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,570
for your total honesty.

714
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,277
Your surgery went well.

715
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,144
With some time and rehab, you
should be back to work in a month.

716
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,682
Thank you.

717
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,213
Don't thank me.
Thank your surgeon.

718
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,614
She did all the important stuff.

719
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,690
Lim's golden boy is in.
Nothing we can do about that.

720
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,663
So that leaves three openings.

721
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,962
The thought of working with Will
Hooper for the next two years...

722
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,128
If Dr. Lim thinks he'll
be a good resident,

723
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,967
I'm sure she has good reasons.

724
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:03,805
She probably thinks arrogance
is helpful to a surgeon.

725
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,810
Well, we could try
to change her mind.

726
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,142
Nah, she asked us to
evaluate the applicants, not her.

727
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,047
She asked us to
be totally honest.

728
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,175
Yeah, "totally honest"
is a relative term

729
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,652
when you're telling your
boss she's totally wrong.

730
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,358
So Hooper's in. Who else?

731
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:24,487
Dr. Andrews likes
Dr. Jordan Allen.

732
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,087
I do too.

733
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,723
She's confident, driven.

734
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,279
She won't take a
lot of hand-holding,

735
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,428
and keeping Andrews
happy keeps us happy.

736
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,336
- Mm.
- That leaves two more. Who's next?

737
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:39,338
Asher Wolke is very
up-front about who he is.

738
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,275
I like that.

739
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:41,870
He's definitely eager.

740
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,608
And he couldn't be
more open to learning.

741
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,207
Ah, agree. That leaves one more.

742
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,052
John Lundberg.

743
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:53,248
Smart, professional,
mature. He's a no-brainer.

744
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,192
Lundberg's in.

745
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,717
Lundberg's out.

746
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,231
He stopped by my
office before he left,

747
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,266
said he's no longer interested.

748
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,461
He said you all
were unprofessional.

749
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,863
Drinking at work.

750
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,974
Asking inappropriate
questions. Dating drama.

751
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,438
Mm-hm. So who's your alt?

752
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,779
Olivia Jackson or Board Shorts?

753
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,119
Olivia knows her stuff,
but she's a bit insecure.

754
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,414
Her answers
sound like questions.

755
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:29,154
I like Board Shorts.
He's sensitive.

756
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,320
Like a woman.

757
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,961
I vote for both of them.

758
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:41,104
That's not an option.
We don't have the budget.

759
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,432
Hooper is the worst.

760
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,242
The person I said was the best?

761
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,908
He is arrogant and obnoxious.

762
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,282
If he works here, we'll
hate him, the work will suffer,

763
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,789
and we'll either kill
patients or we'll kill him.

764
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,093
And there is no way
that you don't see that,

765
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,462
which makes me think...

766
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,635
you do.

767
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,037
This was a test.

768
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,004
You just wanted to see
if we'd be totally honest.

769
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,274
Well done.

770
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,817
Hooper is definitely the worst.

771
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,409
I only let him shadow as
a favor to a board member.

772
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,547
I figured I'd give him a second
chance after his obnoxious interview.

773
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,318
And also do a little experiment.

774
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,295
So...

775
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,198
it's Jordan,

776
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,169
Asher, Olivia and Enrique.

777
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:51,341
To the next phase of
your surgical training.

778
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,843
You helped pick them.

779
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,505
As senior residents, it's now
your job to help train them.

780
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,308
And don't take this
responsibility lightly,

781
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:01,512
because if you don't train
them well, people will die.
