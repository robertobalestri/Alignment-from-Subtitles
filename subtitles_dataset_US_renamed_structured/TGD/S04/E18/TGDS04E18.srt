1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,867
- <i>Previously:</i> - Can I help you?

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,202
My name's Miles
Browne. I'm your father.

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,469
Go home. I think
you're having a stroke.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,542
I have terminal cancer.

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,080
I waited for you and you left.

6
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,581
I thought about you every day.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,712
It's good we're not roommates
anymore 'cause I couldn't do this.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,023
Having sex doesn't make us a
thing. You need to see other women.

9
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,893
- Why? I don't really want to...
- No excuses.

10
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,022
Do you want to come
back to my place for more?

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,761
Just sleeping with you isn't good for
me. I want to give Heather a chance.

12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,939
- Thanks for cooking.
- Mm-hm.

13
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,840
And the new skillet. The
chicken was delicious.

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,777
What'd I tell you?
Cast iron kicks ass.

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,305
Wait till you sear a steak in it.
You won't believe the difference.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,543
I'll definitely try it.

17
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,182
So you up for a movie?

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,248
Actually, I thought
maybe we could just... talk.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,591
Well, we spent
all night talking.

20
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,587
Yeah, about our jobs,
the news, the weather.

21
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,299
But...

22
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,467
we, uh...

23
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,034
never really talked
about the past.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,837
We did. When you
were at the hospital.

25
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,642
Barely.

26
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,375
Have you forgiven me?

27
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,922
You know, I...

28
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,291
I'd rather just watch a movie.

29
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,385
- Claire, I don't...
- If you want to join, great.

30
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,930
If not, let's just
call it a night.

31
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,326
Okay. Movie it is.

32
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,361
Okay.

33
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,105
- How'd your presentation go?
- It was...

34
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,947
long.

35
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,975
Didn't you do laundry yesterday?

36
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,180
I'm not doing laundry. I'm
packing. For our camping trip.

37
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,958
We've done nothing
but work for three weeks.

38
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,994
And neither of
us feels... better.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,997
A weekend in the woods
isn't going to change anything.

40
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,056
Not to mention you can't
even sleep on a couch,

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,897
much less outside on the ground.

42
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,630
I agree,

43
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,673
it's going to be a challenge,
but that's the point.

44
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,108
The further outside our
comfort zones we go,

45
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,474
the more distracted we'll be.

46
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,302
Whoa, man! It's me,
okay? Don't shoot!

47
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,436
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

48
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,174
Can you put the
gun down, please?

49
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,749
I opened the door and the
alarm went off, it's broken.

50
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,285
Oh, thank God.

51
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,650
- Man.
- I thought somebody, uh...

52
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,022
Hi.

53
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,058
Hi.

54
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,864
It's not loaded.

55
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,858
Yeah, good.

56
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,200
No, no, not good. I...

57
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,139
store this loaded. Always.

58
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,300
I unloaded it.

59
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,240
For this exact reason.
You could've killed me.

60
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,373
And if you had been an
intruder, you could've killed me.

61
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,782
I'm not an intruder.
I'm me. Hello!

62
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,721
You had the gun
pointed right at my head!

63
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,986
No, I was aiming center mass.
My finger wasn't even on the trigger.

64
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,323
Thank you very much for
the apology, appreciate it.

65
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,394
Apology?

66
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,525
What in the world would make
you think that it was okay...

67
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,759
to unload my gun?

68
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:59,967
You almost shot me center mass,
okay? But by all means, don't apologize!

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,100
I did not almost shoot you!

70
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,235
And if you don't stop
with the apology...

71
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,675
I'm going to bed.

72
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,681
Alone.

73
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,257
The discoloration is a
deeper red than her last exam.

74
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,298
- And it's warm to the touch.
- Ow.

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,601
Sorry. How long
has it been tender?

76
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,403
Uh... About a week.

77
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,637
Well, it's not a bruise
or muscle strain.

78
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,646
The AV malformation's growing,

79
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,311
which is why I've been
recommending surgery since she was 5.

80
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:47,150
- And I've agreed every time.
- It's the first time there's been pain.

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,122
And the meds and the nutritional
supplements have been working.

82
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,214
No, they haven't.

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,817
And puberty will accelerate
the growth even more,

84
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,329
which puts her at a high risk
for spontaneous hemorrhage.

85
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,526
Turtleneck sweaters are
definitely not the solution any longer.

86
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,897
She needs the surgery.

87
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,300
When?

88
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,035
We can admit her
and start the prep now.

89
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,976
Awesome.

90
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,142
I hate turtlenecks.

91
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,319
Your EKG's normal, cholesterol's low,
and I didn't see any concerning moles.

92
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,754
I wear SPF 50 every day.

93
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,257
There was one thing.

94
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,851
I noticed that you previously
had been on antidepressants.

95
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,658
I stopped taking
those nine months ago.

96
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,608
They didn't help, and I found an
alternative therapy that's working great.

97
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,658
Wonderful. Cognitive
behavioral therapy?

98
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,565
No.

99
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,661
Uh, I'm injecting
a psilocybin serum

100
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,400
that I make from hallucinogenic
mushrooms I grow in my basement.

101
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,874
Okay, that's... crazy. You
need to stop that immediately.

102
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,815
There's tons of studies
online that show that psilocybin

103
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,114
causes dopamine surges
that treat depression.

104
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,120
And even more studies
that show that people

105
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,985
who self-medicate
with street drugs

106
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,457
end up more depressed,
addicted and sometimes even dead.

107
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,120
I spent a year researching
mushroom cultivation

108
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,322
and learning how to
extract the psilocybin.

109
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,491
And most importantly, this is the
first treatment that's ever worked.

110
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,095
I've never felt better.

111
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,905
At least let me do
some additional tests

112
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,780
to make sure there
aren't adverse side effects.

113
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,711
Sure. I'm always open
to new information.

114
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,084
Good morning.
How can I help you?

115
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,123
We're here to camp
at Yosemite Creek.

116
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,386
Great. You have a reservation?

117
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,258
- Reservation?
- Campsites are reservation only.

118
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,555
That's not true.

119
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,100
There are 27 first-come,
first-serve campsites.

120
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,830
There were 27
campsites at 6 a.m.

121
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,897
By 6:45, they were all taken.

122
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,874
- Need you to turn the car around.
- No, we need to go camping.

123
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,003
Sir...

124
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,173
- I understand you're upset, but...
- No, you don't understand

125
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,876
- at all why...
- Shaun, it's okay.

126
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,112
We'll find another place
to camp. Thank you.

127
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,522
Tighten up. Now work
from the outside in.

128
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,725
Eliminate any arterial feeders.

129
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,669
This would be a lot easier if they'd
let me do this seven years ago.

130
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,933
It's not their fault.
They're scared of surgery

131
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,474
for their 12-year-old child.

132
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,301
They're arrogant. And stubborn.

133
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,179
You're quiet.

134
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,115
Oh, sorry.

135
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,675
Well, I was actually thinking
about my own parents.

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,115
Miles thinks that we
should "deal with the past,"

137
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,158
so there's not a
barrier between us.

138
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,928
Things have been going pretty good.
You know, why mess with success?

139
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,558
I agree. When it comes to parents,
some things, in fact many things,

140
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,101
should just be left unsaid.

141
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,831
Says the guy who doesn't
have a relationship with his.

142
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:54,204
Yeah. Because I said things
that should have been unsaid.

143
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,140
Well, I agree with Miles.

144
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,974
I mean, it's not gonna be
an easy conversation, but...

145
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,576
wounds that aren't
treated get worse.

146
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,461
There's blood in her ET tube.

147
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,420
Must be a bleeder in the airway.

148
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,013
Retract the wound.

149
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,325
The research on psilocybin for
drug-resistant depression is promising.

150
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,025
Apex of the lungs look clear.

151
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,144
There's a difference between
"promising" and "proven."

152
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,330
Not to mention a drug
made by professionals

153
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,169
versus some guy growing
mushrooms in his basement.

154
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,638
You're the most skeptical guy I
know about alternative medicine,

155
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,770
- but this you agree with?
- I'm not surprised.

156
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,549
- That Park's a total hypocrite?
- That you two disagree.

157
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,184
You never agree on anything.

158
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,721
I think you just...

159
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,384
enjoy arguing with each other.

160
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,693
You need to get closer.

161
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,527
Can you focus on
the left inferior lobe?

162
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,430
- What is that?
- A lesion.

163
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,200
A fungal lesion.

164
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,178
This isn't camping,
it's tailgating.

165
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:17,054
There's trees, a place we
can pitch a tent and build a fire.

166
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,951
It smells like gasoline.

167
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,363
Oh.

168
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,293
I think their generator
might have a leak.

169
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,296
Just what you want
right next to a campfire.

170
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,333
We have a view of the lake.

171
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,641
It's pretty, isn't it?

172
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,281
Yeah.

173
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,431
We had to abort the laser
surgery due to a bleed,

174
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,239
but she's conscious and
stable now in post-op recovery.

175
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,803
The AVM infiltrated too
deep into the upper lobe

176
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,473
of the lung to
ablate with the laser.

177
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,450
We'll have to go back in and remove
her collarbone for better access.

178
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,584
Another surgery?
To remove her bone?

179
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,386
We'll put it back after
we excise the AVM.

180
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,791
She'll have to wear a
brace until the bone heals.

181
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,887
Vascular malformations
are chameleons.

182
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,228
It's hard to tell where
abnormal blood vessels end

183
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,596
and normal ones begin.

184
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,228
Well, you were all a lot more confident
in your assessment this morning.

185
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,465
- We want to take our daughter home.
- Yeah.

186
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,937
- Now.
- I'm sorry. That's not possible.

187
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,103
The laser surgery caused
weakening in the AVM,

188
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,238
which means it could
rebleed at any time.

189
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,255
Okay.

190
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
Okay.

191
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,597
You're lucky. If you'd
scheduled your physical later,

192
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,257
your liver and lungs
would be failing.

193
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,766
And after the surgery?

194
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,461
What about my depression?

195
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,202
You're asking if you can continue
a treatment that's killing you?

196
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,240
Before I started the
psilocybin injections...

197
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,806
I was miserable.

198
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,441
I couldn't sleep,

199
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,951
I barely ate.

200
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,452
I can't bear to face
that darkness again.

201
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,726
I don't know if it's the
psilocybin or placebo effect,

202
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,062
or something else
neither of us understands.

203
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,235
But if you found
the light once...

204
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,536
you can find it again.

205
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,326
Okay.

206
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,920
It's a nice fire.

207
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,588
I used the teepee method.

208
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,676
I'm thinking open thoracotomy
and midline laparotomy.

209
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,086
We might be able to use
minimally invasive scope surgery

210
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,155
to get the big lesions

211
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,489
and attack the rest
post-operatively with anti-fungals.

212
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,460
More like minimally effective.

213
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,519
Better to be aggressive,
take them out at once.

214
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,861
That's a huge operation
with a long, painful recovery.

215
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,298
He has a huge problem.

216
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,201
This lesion looks like it
extends behind the liver.

217
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,666
You're the senior surgical resident.
You need to start making these calls.

218
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,769
I'm not so sure about that.

219
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,741
I'm sorry, but I question
Dr. Park's objectivity

220
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,117
when it comes to
Dr. Reznick's ideas.

221
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,521
I don't care where an idea comes from,
and I don't appreciate you accusing me...

222
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,615
It wasn't an accusation.

223
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:16,493
- Then what would you call it?
- A respectful and sincere question.

224
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,522
What's the answer?

225
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,037
My objective opinion is...

226
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,403
a minimally invasive
approach is best.

227
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,410
Okay.

228
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,547
I want it all mapped out with
a 3D reconstruction simulation

229
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,743
before we go in there.
We'll operate in the morning.

230
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,121
It's actually kind of soothing.

231
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,057
It reminds me of the dripping
faucet in our old apartment.

232
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,158
- The sound helped me fall asleep.
- Hmm.

233
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,267
I loved that building.

234
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,931
It's where we had our first hug.

235
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,539
Definitely not soothing.

236
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,914
This might help.

237
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,586
You brought earplugs
to a camping trip?

238
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,291
Sometimes you snore.

239
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,927
Thank you.

240
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,605
Mm. Ooh!

241
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,746
That's it, I give up.

242
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,121
I have a repair kit.

243
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,821
I don't want to fix things,
Shaun. I just want to go home.

244
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,227
Don't want to go home.

245
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,404
If you want to stay in a cold,
wet, leaky tent, go ahead.

246
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,964
But I am sleeping in the car.

247
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,160
Ah, 29:32.

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,995
I used to do sub-25
on recovery days.

249
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,101
Hey, you have time to grab
a quick bite before you go in?

250
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,101
I was actually thinking, uh...

251
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,443
maybe we could talk.

252
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,779
I would love that.

253
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,662
Well, the last time I
saw you, before you left...

254
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,692
I screamed at you because
you missed my birthday party.

255
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,629
And for the longest time,

256
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,901
I thought if I
could just tell you...

257
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,707
I was sorry, that
you'd come back.

258
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,043
It wasn't you, Claire.

259
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,143
None of it.

260
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:28,188
I mean, you... were a great kid.

261
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,156
So smart and thoughtful.

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,726
How could you just disappear?

263
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,901
Things between your mother
and I were such a mess.

264
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,796
One night, she was
having one of her episodes.

265
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,675
Told me...

266
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,375
I was worthless.

267
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,580
The only thing I was
good for was money.

268
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,256
I said, "Okay. If that's all you
want, that's all I'm gonna give you."

269
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,592
I sent her a check every month,
never saw or spoke to her again.

270
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,568
It was mean and petty.

271
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,632
- Pathetic.
- We never got any money.

272
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,902
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,875
I sent monthly support
until you finished college.

274
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,483
I worked two jobs.

275
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,783
I took out a loan to pay
for tuition and our rent.

276
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,993
Look...

277
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,159
I sent more than enough
for rent, for clothes, for food.

278
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,435
She stole my
money from my child.

279
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,836
- The child you totally abandoned.
- No, not totally.

280
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,067
It's not my fault she
squandered that money.

281
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,736
It's not your fault I
grew up without a father?

282
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,378
Without any social life

283
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,881
because I was so busy
being a mom to my own mom?

284
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:07,447
The woman that you walked out
on when things stopped being fun?

285
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,751
Okay, listen, I'm sorry,
okay? I didn't mean for this

286
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,087
- to become an argument.
- No, you're not sorry.

287
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:15,322
If you were, you wouldn't be
blaming her, using her as an excuse.

288
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,827
You took off...

289
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,865
because you were too weak to
do what a father is supposed to do.

290
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,133
To take care of
me. To protect me.

291
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,607
And now you're
back when it's easy?

292
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,710
When I don't need a father?

293
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,983
No, you know what? Forget it.

294
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,076
- Claire...
- Look, just don't... Don't call.

295
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,348
Don't come to the door.
Just leave me alone.

296
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,869
I thought this would be helpful.

297
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,530
I was wrong.

298
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,503
We can go home.

299
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,246
Well...

300
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,114
Why don't we do the
hike you planned first?

301
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,921
Is that what you want?

302
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,748
Is that what you want?

303
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,259
I think so.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,401
Okay, new plan.

305
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,904
Blueberry pancakes. Then hike.

306
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,137
Then back home to our
warm and cozy and dry bed.

307
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,813
Divide the sternal
attachment of the SCM.

308
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,648
And done.

309
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,255
Removing the medial clavicle.

310
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,594
You have the talk?

311
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,222
- Yeah.
- I never said it would be easy.

312
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,734
You can't excise a tumor
without some bleeding.

313
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,963
Some tumors are inoperable.

314
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,401
He wants to be forgiven.

315
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,078
I... I just can't.

316
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,337
He doesn't deserve it.

317
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,208
Well, it's not the kid's
job to make the parents

318
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,752
feel good about themselves.

319
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,756
This mat of vessels is
invading the upper lung tissue.

320
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,021
- How deep does it go on your end?
- I can see underneath the apex,

321
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,359
but can't tell what's tumor
and what's subclavian artery.

322
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,192
We can't get this out without pulling
out the whole upper lobe of her lung.

323
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,264
Parents are not
going to like that.

324
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,337
No, I'll go.

325
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,434
They don't trust you.

326
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,204
- That's not your problem.
- It shouldn't be the patient's either.

327
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,472
I'll have a better chance
of getting their consent.

328
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,155
Brought some pastries.

329
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,096
Uh, I'm good.

330
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,967
I... I'm sorry that I, uh...

331
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,844
unloaded the gun
without telling you.

332
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,981
Thank you.

333
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,345
I, uh... I appreciate that.

334
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,820
I know that you're
nervous around guns,

335
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,985
which is all the more reason that
you should just leave mine alone.

336
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,760
Maybe there's a better
way to deal with this?

337
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,426
So, what if we kept your gun
in your nightstand, like always,

338
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,061
but we keep the
ammunition in another room?

339
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,640
So your idea of a
compromise is that

340
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,337
I agree to do what you've been
doing behind my back all along?

341
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,342
An intruder is not
gonna wait for me

342
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,509
to collect my bullets from
the guest room closet.

343
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,382
My house is not that big.

344
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,648
I'm so confused. You still
have to run up the stairs

345
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,553
and get the thing either way.

346
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,160
Do you ever notice that
whenever we're talking

347
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:44,857
about something related to
the home that we both share,

348
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:49,698
that you always refer
to it as your house?

349
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,768
I do?

350
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,364
This isn't about gun safety.

351
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,401
This is about your house and your
rules, and your wanting to control me.

352
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,380
You don't trust me to make
decisions about my own life.

353
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,644
I'm just trying to find a
way to make you feel safe.

354
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,813
I don't need you,
or any other man,

355
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,483
to find a way to
make me feel safe.

356
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,894
Walk here.

357
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,230
Oh, thank you.

358
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,306
It's actually pretty
outside the campground.

359
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,552
Another half mile and
we can see the lake.

360
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,087
You're really cute. I
want to take a picture.

361
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,952
Go stand on that log.

362
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,655
I'll get you from a low angle.

363
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,425
A hero angle because
you're my hero.

364
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,603
Okay.

365
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,473
Okay, a smidge to the left.

366
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,212
Shaun!

367
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,307
Are you okay?

368
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,077
Oh, my God, you are not okay.

369
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,399
Okay...

370
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,836
- On the count of three. Ready?
- Mm-hm.

371
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,400
One, two...

372
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,901
You were supposed to
wait until I got to three!

373
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,140
I know. But in the movies, they
always go early to catch you off guard.

374
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,080
You don't need the element of
surprise to reduce a dislocated ankle.

375
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,639
Okay, but did it work?

376
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,044
Yes. You...

377
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,582
You relocated it correctly.

378
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,655
- Damn.
- But...

379
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,225
my toes are still
dusky and numb.

380
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,926
The posterior
tibial artery's torn.

381
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,061
I thought it was just pinched.

382
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,808
If circulation isn't restored, I'll
have permanent tissue damage,

383
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,673
maybe even have to
have my foot amputated.

384
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,941
This is not a problem. I can

385
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,450
run to where I can get a
cell signal and call 911.

386
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,850
It'll take at least two
hours for you to run back

387
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,047
- to the campground.
- I'm faster than I look.

388
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,024
You told me you used to skip phys-ed
class because you hated running.

389
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,583
- I can hate it and still be good at it.
- No.

390
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,723
My pocketknife is
as sharp as a scalpel.

391
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,632
The tent repair kit
has nylon thread,

392
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,933
and you can use a fishhook
as a suturing needle.

393
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,370
You are obviously delirious

394
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,465
because there's no way
in hell I'm doing surgery.

395
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,203
It's not a complicated
procedure.

396
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,869
For a surgeon, which I'm not!

397
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,675
I'll guide you step
by step. Okay?

398
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,273
It'll just take two sutures.
I've seen you hem your pants.

399
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,581
An artery is not
a pair of jeans.

400
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,280
There's tequila in my backpack.

401
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,588
You'll need to sterilize the
incision, and I will need anesthesia.

402
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,855
- Shaun, I...
- Tequila! Stat!

403
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,491
We thought you
were certain before.

404
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,091
I know you're scared
and this is confusing.

405
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,400
We brought her in with
some minor inflammation.

406
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,133
No, the inflammation
was not minor.

407
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,306
What we are proposing
would reduce her lung capacity,

408
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,040
but she can still
live a normal life.

409
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,515
No. We're taking her someplace
else. We're gonna get a second opinion.

410
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,109
We can't cut out part
of our daughter's lung.

411
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,749
She'd never forgive us.

412
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,487
And maybe she shouldn't.

413
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:42,424
You were wrong to refuse the
surgery that Dr. Lim proposed years ago.

414
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,192
Are...?

415
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,761
Are you trying to guilt
us into agreeing with you?

416
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,834
You are guilty.

417
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,835
Ava is in this situation

418
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,106
because you were too afraid
to make a tough decision,

419
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,478
and now you are trying
to blame everyone else

420
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,211
because you can't deal with
the guilt of having messed up.

421
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,250
You need to stop thinking

422
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,792
about what is gonna make
you feel like a good parent

423
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,419
and start thinking about
what your daughter needs.

424
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,306
Careful with that anesthesia.

425
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,419
I need you coherent enough
to guide me through this.

426
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,246
Don't worry, I've calculated
the proper dosage...

427
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,486
No. No, not like that.

428
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,649
The scalpel goes on the left of
the tray, sponges on the right.

429
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:41,853
- Needle driver and sutures in the middle.
- Okay, got it.

430
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,093
Okay.

431
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,291
And might I suggest not
barking instructions at me?

432
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,833
I'm freaked out enough already.

433
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,493
I'll do my best.

434
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,569
Even with the tequila,

435
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,643
when you cut into my
ankle, I'll be in extreme pain,

436
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,334
which can cause irritability.

437
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,673
- I can't do this.
- You have to.

438
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,110
The worst that could happen

439
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,240
is you mess it up and cause
permanent damage to my foot,

440
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,013
which is exactly what will
happen if you don't do it.

441
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,348
Okay. Tequila, stat.

442
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,930
Suction.

443
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,626
That enough?

444
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:27,364
Perfect. Mediastinum's cleared.
Now, on to the lung lesions.

445
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,469
I'm having a problem
maneuvering in here.

446
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,535
There's too much peritoneal
scarring from the fungal deposits.

447
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,776
- Can you cut at it sharply?
- I'm too close to the common bile duct.

448
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,549
Need help?

449
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,716
Morgan was right.

450
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,449
There's no way to remove
all the lesions laparoscopically.

451
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,226
All right. Let's pull the
scopes and open him up.

452
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,804
Okay. The blood's pouring
out! What do I do now?

453
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,748
Okay. Okay, tighten the...

454
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,480
tourniquet and then use a
sponge to clear the blood.

455
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,258
Okay.

456
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,793
It's clearing up.

457
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,196
You should be able... to see...

458
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,257
I see it! And the leaking hole.

459
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,201
Now you just need to
use the needle driver

460
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,898
to sew the edges together.

461
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:35,873
Be careful not...

462
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,510
Be careful not to what?

463
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,747
Shaun?

464
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,950
Put the backpack under my head.

465
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,020
- How's that gonna help with your ankle?
- It... won't.

466
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,319
But I'm about to lose
consciousness from blood loss and...

467
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,826
I don't want...
dirt... in my m...

468
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,628
Shaun? Shaun?

469
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,461
Shaun? Shaun! Shaun!

470
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,709
Shaun! Shaun, come on!

471
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,246
Come on, Shaun. Shaun.

472
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:19,784
Okay...

473
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,078
Come on, Lea.

474
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,989
If you can hem a pant leg,
apparently you can do this.

475
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,389
All right. Okay.

476
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,166
I have freed the
pleural membrane.

477
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,251
Why does blood have
to be so damn slippery?

478
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:04,091
How am I supposed to tie a knot if
I can't even grip the damn thread?

479
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,766
Here we go. Here we go. Okay.

480
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,643
Okay.

481
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
Here we go.

482
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,894
You're a woman.

483
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,064
Um, yeah.

484
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,165
I've always considered myself a
supporter of women, you know,

485
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:50,107
equal pay for equal
work, right to choose...

486
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,800
Uh, thank you. From all of us.

487
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,481
Debbie seems
to think that I am...

488
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,020
overbearing and,
uh, controlling.

489
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,499
My ex was a humanities
professor and ACLU chapter head.

490
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,132
But I made more money,
and I don't think he was...

491
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,675
conscious of this, but I do
feel he was threatened by...

492
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,544
my independence.

493
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,513
The more insecure he got,
the more controlling he became.

494
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:33,541
He had to pick the restaurants
where we ate, the movies we saw.

495
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,188
And I definitely had
my own issues, but...

496
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,489
his need to control me was one of the
many reasons our marriage fell apart.

497
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,085
I can feel my toes.

498
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,854
Are you finished?

499
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,458
No.

500
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,226
Now I'm finished.

501
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,340
There's enough flow to keep the
tissue alive until we get to an ER.

502
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,406
You did this with
a tent repair kit?

503
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,243
And a fishhook.

504
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,116
She is very good
at fixing things.

505
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,853
You're lucky.

506
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:45,956
Yes.

507
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:47,925
I am.

508
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,192
And how do you feel?

509
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,566
Like a gutted fish.

510
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,333
Sorry, we had no choice but to
open you up to access all the lesions.

511
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,705
But they were able to remove them
all without damaging any of the organs.

512
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,073
You should recover fully.

513
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,202
Physically.

514
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,944
There are new antidepressants
you haven't tried.

515
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,814
But I also wouldn't stop
the mushroom cultivation.

516
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,451
Really?

517
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,787
After all this?

518
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:22,157
Cultivation. If this helped you,
it was either the placebo effect

519
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,856
or all the focus you put
into perfecting the process.

520
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,433
Sometimes, distraction
is the best medicine.

521
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,483
Hey.

522
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,123
We are... so sorry.

523
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,624
This is our fault.

524
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,591
It's okay.

525
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,971
I love you.

526
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,160
You know, I thought our
relationship was just a fun distraction.

527
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,423
But when you pushed me away...

528
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,496
I realized it was
more than that.

529
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,298
I was hurt, resentful...

530
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,577
which made every
interaction we had...

531
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,139
complicated.

532
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,444
What are you talking about?

533
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,918
You made sure it
wasn't complicated at all.

534
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,978
We stopped having sex
and now we're friends.

535
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,749
You know it's more than that.

536
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,991
And it can't be. Not anymore.

537
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,597
What does that even mean?

538
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,665
We still work together. We
have to talk to each other.

539
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,169
About work. That's it.

540
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,938
We can't try to keep some
sort of friendship going,

541
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,340
which means no more
jokes, no more teasing.

542
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,174
Nothing that isn't
totally professional.

543
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,403
So, what, we just...

544
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,116
act like robots
around each other?

545
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,349
I don't want that.

546
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,582
It's boring.

547
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,262
Well...

548
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,696
We act like we did before
we ever moved in together

549
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,565
and let ourselves
get into this...

550
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:49,233
unprofessional mess.

551
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,270
Yeah. Pretending that what happened
didn't happen, that always works.

552
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,532
You were a horrible father.

553
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,772
And you can't undo
the harm you did.

554
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,514
But I should forgive you.

555
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,219
You deserve it.

556
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,478
And I need it.

557
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,617
Because I need you.

558
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:47,462
So I'd... I'd like to...

559
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,658
keep spending time together...

560
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,593
and talking.

561
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,936
I would love that.

562
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,012
Do you think...

563
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,140
Think maybe we could, uh...

564
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,182
restart everything with a...

565
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,524
hug?

566
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,354
I was wrong.

567
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,419
I convinced myself that I
was right, and I was wrong.

568
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,397
I took choice away from you.

569
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:05,142
And I will do everything
I can to make it right.

570
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,347
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

571
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,116
You don't have to apologize.
Can you stop doing that?

572
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,894
I don't think I can
make this work.

573
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,094
I have...

574
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,841
had this feeling for months.

575
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,741
It's like a pit in my stomach
and I didn't want to...

576
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,603
face what it was,

577
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,879
but when we were
fighting, I just felt, like, relief,

578
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,180
like I had an out.

579
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,880
You think I don't
respect you. I don't...

580
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,790
I do.

581
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:57,421
Aaron, you almost walked
out of our wedding because I...

582
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,326
used bad grammar.

583
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:05,802
That was bad.

584
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,637
That was a bad moment.

585
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,775
Marriages are made
up of moments, right?

586
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,642
So many of our moments
are just... Are great.

587
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,279
Too many are so... Just painful.

The rain, the drunks, the
freezing cold night alone in my car,

604
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,452
and you almost
losing your foot was

605
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,856
definitely a bit more of a
distraction than I was hoping for.

606
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,597

you took me camping.
