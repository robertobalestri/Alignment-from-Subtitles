1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,836
<i>Two-six-six! Two-six-six!</i>

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,997
It's just an hour.

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,975
Which really means
an hour and a half,

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,069
which means by the time we get
to Jason's, the party will be over.

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,579
It's not a party, it's four boys

6
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,139
arguing over who's going to
play <i>Call Of Duty's Warfare.</i>

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,708
You're learning how to exercise
your First Amendment rights.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,481
By waving signs at cars?

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:24,215
And it's <i>Call Of Duty:
Modern Warfare.</i>

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,853
Everyone who sees our signs
knows that they're not alone,

11
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,955
and when we have numbers
we have a voice, we are heard.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,932
At least someone's being heard.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,799
This is democracy,
Ethan, making a difference.

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,738
- This is how change happens.
- Yeah, well, change sucks.

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,314
It's 10:30. I will have you
at Jason's by 11:45, okay?

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,577
Ooh, I see a spot.

17
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,647
- Really?
- Why'd you let her in?

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,122
Because the idiot
would've smashed our car.

19
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,155
How about we go get
milkshakes instead? Hmm?

20
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,198
But I spent three
hours making signs.

21
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,299
Oh! There! There's a spot!

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,131
<i>Two-six-six! Two-six-six!</i>

23
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,261
Sweet.

24
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,602
<i>Two-six-six! Two-six-six!</i>

25
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:16,440
Any hint of trouble,
we are leaving, got it?

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,911
Inspiring speech, Mom.
Very Vince Lombardi.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,542
I saw his hologram.

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,346
Oh. Here's your
very own wristband.

29
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,622
Solidarity!

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,923
Yeah!

31
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,598
Yes, they already did the finger
prick and gave me the gloop.

32
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,328
It's a 50 gram glucose solution.

33
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,370
It was gloop and
it tasted awful.

34
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,168
Gloop wouldn't tell us if
you have gestational diabetes

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,435
which is associated with
hypertension, preeclampsia,

36
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,740
preterm labor, and for the baby,
respiratory issues and obesity.

37
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,044
Before we buy jumbo baby clothes,
let's get the test results, okay?

38
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,380
- Okay. Will you text me when you...
- Whoa.

39
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,483
What's this?

40
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,314
<i>We know at least two
people have been shot,</i>

41
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,917
<i>but we have no
information on their status.</i>

42
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,223
<i>By all reports, the
rally in support...</i>

43
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,925
- That is less than a mile from here.
<i>- Was quite peaceful,</i>

44
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,879
<i>despite the presence of
some counter-protesters.</i>

45
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,236
<i>But just about 20 minutes
ago, what witnesses describe...</i>

46
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,637
I have to go to the E.R. STAT.

47
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,572
<i>As a late-model, white
panel van sped by,</i>

48
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,543
<i>the passenger opening fire...</i>

49
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,488
Nine-year-old boy with multiple
gunshots to chest and abdomen.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,361
- He took three rounds of epi, still PEA.
- Trauma phase six. Checking ABCs.

51
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,309
Asher, take compressions.
Claire, assess wounds.

52
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,199
- You're the mom? What's his name?
- Mm-hm.

53
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,600
- Mason.
- Mason, got it.

54
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,632
- Entry wound, left chest.
- Right over his heart.

55
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,441
- Emergency thoracotomy?
- Twenty blade.

56
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,310
We'll take good care of Mason,

57
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,177
- but right now you need to go.
- I can't.

58
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,248
- Now.
- Rib spreader.

59
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,083
- We got a pumper!
- Oh!

60
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,183
I can't see a thing. Suction.

61
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,027
Hole in right ventricle,
I got my finger on it.

62
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,222
That stopped the bleed,

63
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,136
but we've gotta get the
heart pumping normally.

64
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,198
Urinary catheter.

65
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,531
Stick it in the hole, inflate the
balloon inside the ventricle...

66
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,798
and occlude the hole.

67
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,078
- And we've got a regular heartbeat.
- Red cells, platelet transfusions.

68
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,515
Let's get him to the OR.
Very good, Dr. Browne.

69
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,579
Kid took one gunshot to the head.
Became unresponsive en route.

70
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,818
Intubated him. He's bradycardic.

71
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,459
- Pupils are blown.
- No response to sternal rub.

72
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,895
- And the kid's leaking brain.
- Glasgow Coma Scale: 3T.

73
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,303
One gram per kilo Mannitol,
50 milligrams per kilo Keppra.

74
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,639
Elevating head 30 degrees
and bagging down his CO2.

75
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,113
Let's take him. OR 2.

76
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,357
<i>And we can now confirm</i>

77
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,266
<i>that the shooting
victims were young boys,</i>

78
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,103
<i>witnesses describing them
as both under 10 years of age.</i>

79
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,505
<i>According to accounts,</i>

80
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,908
<i>one was shot several times
in the chest and abdomen,</i>

81
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,641
<i>the other shot at
least once in the head.</i>

82
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,116
<i>The fact it was children who
were shot is devastating news.</i>

83
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,882
<i>And so, we have yet another day
in an otherwise peaceful community</i>

84
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,582
<i>erupting in violence,</i>

85
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,593
<i>the kind of atrocity that has
sadly become all too commonplace.</i>

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,461
<i>And that only makes this attack
even more tragic and senseless.</i>

87
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:01,195
<i>We are awaiting updates and will let
you know as soon as we have any...</i>

88
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,300
Fixed the liver laceration.

89
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,964
Let's get this
spleen out of there.

90
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,785
Suturing the right ventricle.
Next up is left ventriculotomy.

91
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,246
All that'll leave is the bronchial
injury, the diaphragm tear, the VSD,

92
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,406
and the hollow
viscus bowel injury.

93
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,549
BP's dropping fast.

94
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,518
We're going to need every unit
of O neg or compatible blood.

95
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,703
Do you have someone in surgery?

96
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,415
No. I'm just here for a test.

97
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,643
- Mrs. Wilkie?
- What is it?

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,621
- And Mrs. Bardo?
- What happened?

99
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,158
Nothing. I just need
you to fill out these forms.

100
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,385
- Forms?
- Necessary evil.

101
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,423
Do you have copies of
your insurance cards?

102
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,866
Uh, no. I must have left mine...

103
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,565
I work here. In I.T. I'll
help them with the forms.

104
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,329
This is not a happy brain. Let's
clean out as much as we can.

105
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,255
Scalp, hair, skull fragments,

106
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,887
and let's not forget
bullet shrapnel.

107
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,726
Ultrasound.

108
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,389
I'm looking for any
deeper bullet fragments.

109
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,972
- Brain's herniating.
- CO2 is normal.

110
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,008
- Is he storming?
- Heart rate's way too low.

111
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,840
We need to take off
his entire right skull.

112
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,816
Drill with B1 bit.

113
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,279
Initial there.

114
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,988
And sign here.

115
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,595
Thank you...

116
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,989
- Lea.
- Lea.

117
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,200
I... I think that's
the other mom.

118
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,847
I'm Carina.

119
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,159
Were you... at the rally?

120
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,857
Yeah. I'm Taryn.

121
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,839
Mason's 9.

122
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,936
Ethan's 8 and a half.

123
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,313
They'll be fine.

124
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,117
I know it.

125
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,332
You're one of them.

126
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,570
Them?

127
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,829
Get away from me.

128
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,057
It is so sad that people can't
express their views peacefully.

129
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,424
The right is so intolerant
of political differences,

130
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,158
of any differences.

131
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,327
I think there are some
intolerances on both sides.

132
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,030
Well... like there are
good people on both sides?

133
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,500
What if I told you I
belong to the NRA?

134
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,168
I'd think you were saying
that to make a point.

135
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,103
About five years ago, my wife and
I went to a very trendy restaurant

136
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,614
in a very shady part of town,

137
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,480
and on our way back to the
car, we were mugged at gunpoint.

138
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,953
The next day, I bought us both
handguns. I'm a card-carrying member.

139
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,221
- I voted for Trump.
- Too soon.

140
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,962
I'm serious.

141
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,264
I liked his stand on Israel.

142
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:32,563
But I've never told anyone
because I'd be absolutely vilified.

143
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,005
- As you should be...
- Pooling up.

144
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,339
He's hypotensive.
Lactate's rising.

145
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,311
- Okay. Crit's down to 17.
- Could put him into deep hypothermia.

146
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,644
No, the low temp would
only worsen his coagulopathy.

147
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,738
He needs more blood.

148
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,785
We've used most of the
O and A neg from the bank.

149
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,547
Start calling other
hospitals. Now.

150
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,929
You actually voted for Trump?

151
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,065
Once.

152
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,134
And then what? You...

153
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,704
You suddenly discovered he
was exactly who he said he was?

154
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,573
I don't feel like you want an
answer. I feel you want an apology.

155
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,871
Wow, this kind of changes
how I feel about you.

156
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,111
What does that mean? Are
you saying you don't respect me?

157
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,847
We can't be friends
because of a vote?

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,081
It is more than a vote.

159
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,023
Yeah. It's a fundamental
right that I exercised.

160
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,728
This changes how I feel about
you. If I can't have a political opinion

161
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,696
about the best way to
improve all our lives...

162
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,426
- Do you think anybody's life got better?
- That's enough.

163
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,672
Are you okay?

164
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,488
Your repairs are almost finished.
We could be done in two or three hours.

165
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,673
We have just enough blood.

166
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,944
That's if we want to.

167
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,798
Mrs. Bardo?

168
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,258
What is it?

169
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,861
Uh, we fixed two holes
in your son's ventricles,

170
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,930
we've removed his spleen
and repaired his liver,

171
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,236
but he's still in surgery.

172
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,076
Well, your son has lost a lot of
blood. We're giving him transfusions,

173
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,515
but the blood loss may have
caused damage to his brain.

174
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,924
If his brain is fine,
then we should push on.

175
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,056
But if his brain
isn't fine, then...

176
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,198
continuing the
surgery could kill him.

177
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,030
Unfortunately, we
can't accurately assess

178
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,597
for brain function in the OR,

179
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:52,203
so we would have to wake him
up and do a traditional neuro exam.

180
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,746
You need her to decide that?

181
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,974
Why put that on her?

182
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,757
- You guys are the doctors. It's a...
- Wake him up.

183
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,256
If you wake him up,
I can be there, right?

184
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,326
You can.

185
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,591
But he will be
confused and stressed.

186
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,824
His belly will still
have to be open.

187
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,425
My husband died in a
car accident two years ago.

188
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,304
I didn't get to say goodbye.

189
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,570
This is not goodbye. This
decision should not be based on...

190
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,643
Please.

191
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,079
Wake him up.

192
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,282
Okay. Come with us.

193
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,892
Why haven't I heard anything?

194
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,992
The brain looks
more relaxed now.

195
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,094
Well, there are a lot of clots.

196
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,108
Kellan play soccer?

197
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,812
I'm fine.

198
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,444
Two kids shot? We all are.

199
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:11,122
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I know. I am so sorry.

200
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,251
Is the baby okay? Did
you get your test results?

201
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,058
No, but I'm fine, the
baby's fine. How's the boy?

202
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,532
You can't be here
and we can't tell you.

203
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,297
I'm sitting in a waiting
room with a terrified mother.

204
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,964
Somebody needs to tell
her he's being taken care of.

205
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,107
- Ms. Wilkie? I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
- Is my son okay?

206
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:43,719
Okay. We have successfully
removed half of your son's skull

207
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,520
to reduce brain pressure.

208
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,686
We've removed blood clots,
bone chips, and bullet fragments,

209
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,928
but we are still trying to
find the less accessible

210
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,695
and deeper chunks of
the bullet in his brain.

211
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,867
Can I see him?

212
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,170
Of course not. He's in surgery.

213
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,681
We...

214
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,017
just needed to let
you know his status.

215
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,891
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,494
Hey, Mason.

217
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,129
I need you to follow
my finger, okay?

218
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:46,684
Can you wiggle your toes
for me, your little piggies?

219
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,524
You're acing this test, Mason.

220
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,463
Now, can you squeeze my fingers?

221
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,497
Just, why don't you
try to make a fist?

222
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,729
It doesn't have to be
hard, just a little squeeze.

223
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,272
Okay. No, that's okay.
Hey, Mason. Look at me.

224
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,248
Now...

225
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,313
You're going to be okay, pumpkin.
Everything's going to be okay.

226
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,590
Hey.

227
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:40,997
There's an indentation on a
right M3 segment branch artery.

228
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,974
That suggests the presence
of a deeper fragment.

229
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,739
Nice catch.

230
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,843
Yes, but I'm not sure
how we get it out.

231
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,924
When was Ethan's birthday?

232
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,736
Um...

233
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,433
October.

234
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,674
It was just the three of us.

235
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,042
And we have a
Goldendoodle named Derber.

236
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,908
Ethan wanted to invite
a couple of friends over,

237
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,646
but I said no, it wasn't safe.

238
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,420
He wanted two friends. He
has like a hundred of them,

239
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,893
and I said no. To two.

240
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,695
It feels like all Ethan
and I ever do now is fight.

241
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,936
Children don't need their
parents to be buddies.

242
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,340
They need limits, structure.

243
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,678
You don't have kids, do you?

244
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,149
He'll die hating me.

245
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,486
Taryn, you cannot
think like that.

246
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,199
We found the last
bullet fragment.

247
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,299
It's deep, but stable,

248
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,861
so it is very unlikely to cause further
brain damage, bleeds, or seizures.

249
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,804
We should leave it where it is.

250
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,871
You want to leave a
bullet in my son's brain?

251
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:31,213
Removing it comes with a high
risk of lacerating key brain vessels.

252
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,824
You can trust them. They're
the best doctors I've ever known.

253
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,201
Okay.

254
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,404
Leave it in.

255
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,289
Did you get to see Mason?

256
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,856
They're doing more tests.

257
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,663
But I know he'll be fine.

258
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,602
He will.

259
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,808
Does Mason play any sports?

260
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,876
Uh...

261
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,902
Basketball.

262
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,913
Team captain.

263
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,279
Likes to be in charge.

264
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,756
So mature for his age.

265
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,692
When my husband died, it
was Mason who kept me going.

266
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,599
Brought me coffee every morning.

267
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,898
Opened my curtains.

268
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,337
Helped me get out of bed.

269
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,279
I'm a single mom too.

270
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,415
Hell of a day to
be one, isn't it?

271
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,119
Mm.

272
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,855
When did you lose your husband?

273
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:24,196
We divorced two
years ago. Not amicably.

274
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,524
Divorced.

275
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,462
I know it's not the same, but...

276
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,470
I buried my husband.

277
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,635
You lost him in the
worst possible way, yes.

278
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,173
But I doubt you also
lost half of your friends,

279
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,045
your self-respect, and...

280
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,383
the love of your son.

281
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,049
I doubt you ever
had to tell your son

282
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,552
that Daddy was never
coming home again.

283
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,889
- Look, I didn't mean to...
- You figured you know me.

284
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,485
You've experienced pain,

285
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,795
so you understand all the pain
everybody else has ever felt.

286
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,960
- I understand pain. We're...
- Shut up.

287
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,904
Right. Someone disagrees
with you and you shut them up.

288
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,100
You couldn't let us wave
our little signs in peace.

289
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,609
You had to come shout us down,

290
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,611
and when that didn't
work, you had to shoot us!

291
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,871
- Yes?
- Yes?

292
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,931
You can go first.

293
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,008
Why?

294
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,843
Well, I'm being polite.

295
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,746
It won't make any difference
who hears their news first.

296
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,779
We don't think there
is any brain damage.

297
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,584
We're going to take him back
to the OR to finish the repairs.

298
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,385
Wonderful. Thank you so much.

299
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
Of course.

300
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,956
We have to leave
Ethan's skull off

301
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,968
until his brain swelling
has gone down,

302
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,800
which could be a couple of
days from now. Or months.

303
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,239
We've moved him to intensive
care. You can see him now.

304
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,358
When he was a baby, I used
to love watching him sleep.

305
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,434
It was the only time he
wasn't bouncing off the walls.

306
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,839
The only time I
could just look at him.

307
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,504
When he was older,

308
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,204
if he caught me watching him,
he would say I was weird, and...

309
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,384
I just told him how
beautiful he was,

310
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,020
and that... and that
made me weirder.

311
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,821
But he is...

312
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,289
so beautiful.

313
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,390
His eyes moved. They
moved. He's looking at me.

314
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,162
- That's good, right?
- Yes.

315
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,739
No. He's not looking at you.
His eyes are deviating to the right.

316
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,833
What does that...?

317
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,610
He's squeezing my hand.
Ethan, honey, Mommy's here.

318
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,249
- How hard? Is it getting firmer?
- Yeah.

319
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,652
Ativan. Increase propofol,
and we need a CT and an EEG.

320
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,089
He is having a focal seizure

321
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,922
which is originating in
the left side of the brain,

322
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:44,225
which wasn't the damaged
side, which is... very strange.

323
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:51,126
The bullet fragment must have
migrated. It was a mistake to leave it in.

324
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,681
He's seizing.

325
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,009
This is exactly what he said
wouldn't happen if we left the bullet in.

326
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:09,654
Exactly.

327
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,723
I'm sure he'll figure
out what to do in...

328
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,885
Who do you have news for?

329
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,260
Ms. Dilallo?

330
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,439
Good news?

331
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,699
Oh... it's nothing.

332
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,310
It's okay for
someone to be happy.

333
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,219
I'm expecting. And all's good.

334
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,221
I gave birth on Christmas Eve.

335
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,690
All the nurses
were singing carols.

336
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:54,764
Kenny joked that the only thing
missing were the three wise men.

337
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,833
It was hokey and ridiculous...

338
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,704
but it was magical.

339
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,207
Ethan was three weeks premature.

340
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,449
We were having just one
last fun weekend, the two of us,

341
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,116
and I guess Ethan didn't
like that idea, so I gave birth...

342
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,962
in a motel room 300
miles from my OB.

343
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,424
Left a really good
tip for housekeeping.

344
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,969
It's very strange.

345
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,273
I was wrong. It's...

346
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,014
very, very strange.

347
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,386
No, you weren't.

348
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,552
The fragment's still
stable in location,

349
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,422
no severe compression
on MCA, no new bleeds.

350
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,325
That just means we
missed something else.

351
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,701
There. Deep in
the left thalamus.

352
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,665
I wasn't wrong.

353
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,698
I wasn't wrong. You were.

354
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,769
You missed it.

355
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,281
No. No, I wasn't wrong. I would
have noticed another fragment.

356
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,720
There. There was nothing
there eight hours ago.

357
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,717
Okay, so...

358
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:31,322
it's just new to this location,
which means it's moving.

359
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,591
And based on its trajectory, it's
going to cause a lot more damage...

360
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,332
It's much deeper than the other.

361
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,431
So we can't get to it.

362
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,398
We can't go through the water
drainage system of the boy's brain.

363
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,262
That would mean
puncturing the ventricular wall

364
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,069
at the thalamus. We can't follow
the injury pathway using MRI guidance

365
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,053
because the metal in the
bullet rules out the MRI.

366
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,606
- And we can't...
- Shaun, Shaun, just...

367
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,694
You are a neurosurgeon, okay?
You will know what I have missed.

368
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,370
You don't think you
missed anything?

369
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,335
No.

370
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,434
Then you didn't.

371
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,217
Okay, then...

372
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,916
Ethan is probably going to die.

373
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:40,689
Okay.

374
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,007
This one's different, huh?

375
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,974
Because he is a child?

376
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,482
Yeah, yeah.
Because he's a child.

377
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,573
No. I...

378
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,376
I've lost children before.

379
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:10,195
Shaun, every parent has one
job, and that's to keep their kid alive,

380
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,389
to keep them from all
the horrors in the world...

381
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
and maybe...

382
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,202
because you can't
protect Ethan, you think...

383
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,371
That's... not rational.

384
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:28,414
No. It's not rational.

385
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,274
The price of parenthood.

386
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,414
But you know
what? It's worth it.

387
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,719
If it makes me upset and irrational,
it doesn't sound like it's worth it.

388
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,049
You don't mean that.

389
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,462
I came here to ask for your
surgical advice about Ethan

390
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,566
and all you've given me is
emotional advice about me.

391
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,471
Yeah. Because that's all I got.

392
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,769
When Kellan started
playing soccer when he was 7,

393
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,037
he loved that jersey so much.

394
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,777
Wore it to bed every night.
Wouldn't let us wash it.

395
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,116
Then he spilled
grape juice on it.

396
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,116
A big purple stain.

397
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,858
And I got angry at him.

398
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,795
I always get a little
like this with kids.

399
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:05,039
And I think maybe Shaun and
Lim can handle it fine without me.

400
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,707
If it was Kellan in that ICU,

401
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,440
how would you feel if
his doctor bailed on him

402
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,509
because his kid had spilled
grape juice ten years earlier?

403
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,222
Yeah, it's brutal on you.

404
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,826
About a hundredth as
brutal as it is on them.

405
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,348
So you agree with Biden
on every single issue?

406
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,818
No, of course not. But I agree
with him on more than one.

407
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,754
How many? Where's the line?

408
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,888
I mean, every vote
is a compromise.

409
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,485
We support the things we
think are important and...

410
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,425
rationalize the
things that aren't.

411
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,296
Unfortunately, compromise
has become a dirty word,

412
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,633
which is ironic since that's
the essence of democracy.

413
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,936
And the lack of compromise
is why I left home.

414
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,566
His left foot is cold.

415
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,813
It's pulseless.

416
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,721
I've got a pulse here. Something's
happening between here and you.

417
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,386
- Good.
- Nothing.

418
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,791
Good.

419
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,594
Nothing.

420
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,663
Nothing.

421
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,229
It's his popliteal artery.
He must've thrown a clot.

422
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,827
We have to fix this now
or he loses the leg at best.

423
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,221
Ethan's seizures were
caused by a different fragment

424
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,258
that migrated to the
left side of his brain.

425
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,637
We weren't wrong about
leaving the other fragment in.

426
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,069
So you weren't
incompetent about that,

427
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,235
just about completely
missing this other fragment?

428
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,010
Yes.

429
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,173
But the new
fragment isn't stable.

430
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,011
And will almost definitely
continue to cause damage.

431
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,218
So you'll remove it
as soon as possible.

432
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,585
It's too deep to remove.

433
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,464
Which means...

434
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,761
you'll do what?

435
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,604
We'll keep him on
anti-seizure meds.

436
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:52,744
And, uh, we'll monitor
him. Hope for the best.

437
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,247
Monitor?

438
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,950
An 8-year-old boy is dying
and you're going to monitor him?

439
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,020
If this was your child,
you could live with that?

440
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,114
- They're doing best...
- They're doing nothing!

441
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,318
- Lea.
- It's okay. It's okay, Shaun.

442
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,595
You're a couple?

443
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,766
I made a decision about my son's life
based on your opinion of your boyfriend?

444
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,308
Taryn, I'm so sorry.

445
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,411
Isolating popliteal
artery. Next?

446
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,689
Incise vessel transversely,

447
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,886
use Fogarty catheter to
complete the embolectomy.

448
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,826
Confirm flow with angiogram.

449
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,824
How's our blood?

450
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,027
Maxing out on procoagulants,
antihemophiliacs,

451
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,036
and recycling every last
drop of cell saver suction.

452
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,937
- We're still down to our last 100ccs.
- What about other hospitals?

453
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:59,334
There was a multi-vehicle crash on
the 280. Nobody has anything to spare.

454
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,310
We'll just have to work a
little faster. Removing catheter.

455
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,043
BP's falling.

456
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:06,984
Damn it.

457
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,851
Catheter tore the artery.
Clamp and suction.

458
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,719
There's not enough blood.

459
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,851
His hematocrit is on
the floor. He's dying.

460
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,395
You got your test results
hours ago. You need to go home.

461
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,801
I can't.

462
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,411
Mason is hanging on,

463
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,543
but we have used up all
the O neg and A neg blood.

464
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,553
- We're having some medevac'd from L.A.
- How long will that take?

465
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,689
Another couple of hours.

466
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,666
You don't think
he'll last that long.

467
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,175
We're hoping.

468
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,466
I'm A-negative.

469
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,502
Sometimes we can't.

470
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:14,438
Every parent has an overwhelming
need to protect their child from horrors.

471
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,309
It's the price of parenthood.

472
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:21,180
Taryn donated twice the
typical amount of blood,

473
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,084
and Mason needed
every drop of it.

474
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,890
It's going to be a long night.

475
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,498
Where are you going?

476
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,864
Yeah, you should come with.

477
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,578
- Where?
- You ever read <i>Hansel and Gretel?</i>

478
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,164
That's what you were reading? I
thought you were doing research.

479
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,615
The scans show no sign that the
fragment tore major brain tissue

480
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,676
and there were no significant
bleeds or clots as it migrated,

481
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,849
which means it didn't cut a new route.
It took a trail that was already there.

482
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,516
Okay. How is that helpful?

483
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:04,723
It weaved through CSF spaces or
sulci in between the brain parenchyma.

484
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:07,356
If so, it left us some
breadcrumbs...

485
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,730
Heme products staining.

486
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,634
Along the way, and we can
use a rigid 3-mm endoscope,

487
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,298
find the trail, and take that
trail all the way to the bullet,

488
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,863
without damaging the brain.

489
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:37,989
It's okay. It's decaf.

490
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,235
You shouldn't feel
guilty about being happy.

491
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,040
I didn't feel happy.
Not right then.

492
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,177
I felt...

493
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,675
scared.

494
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,182
For us?

495
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,813
And for me.

496
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,515
You two, you're so
different, and so...

497
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,391
angry.

498
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,892
Hmm.

499
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,295
But you are so
strong. And I'm just...

500
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,926
You don't think you're strong?

501
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,938
No. Not strong enough for this.

502
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,802
This doesn't usually happen.

503
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,641
This isn't supposed to happen.

504
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,079
And... the way we've
been coping with it

505
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,311
has nothing to do with
whether we're good parents.

506
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,749
Strength doesn't
matter. It's compassion.

507
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,052
And the way you've treated us...

508
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,591
You're going to
be a great mother.

509
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,133
Mason made it.

510
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,308
Thanks to Taryn.

511
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,644
Ethan made it.

512
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,088
Thanks to Park.

Well...

525
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,725
I figure we should talk.

526
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:04,968
I'd like that.

527
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,414
You saved Ethan's
life. Nice job.

528
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,615
I was ready to walk.

for me, supported that decision.

Thank you for that nice, albeit
completely inaccurate, thought.

532
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,261
You just needed
some encouragement.

533
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,608
You want to come back to
my place for a little more?

534

It's been a long day. And night.

535
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,085
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

just sleeping with you...

538
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:07,931
isn't.

539
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,030
I want to give Heather a chance.

540
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Good for you.
