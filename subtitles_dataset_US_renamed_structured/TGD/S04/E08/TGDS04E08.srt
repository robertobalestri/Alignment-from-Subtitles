1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,494
Remember how I told you my
parents drop in unannounced?

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,436
Mm.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,203
I just got a text. They
are coming here tomorrow.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,945
- Okay.
- It's not okay, it's an ambush.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,776
My parents don't
visit, they judge.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,510
They hate everyone I date, which
means they're going to ask you

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,347
a ton of awkward questions.

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,214
It's going to be uncomfortable.

9
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,288
Very.

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,158
Okay.

11
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,323
You hate surprises. Why
aren't you thrown by this?

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,665
Because it's not a surprise.

13
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,964
They're behaving
exactly the way you said.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,937
So a disaster is fine as long
as it's a predictable disaster?

15
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,633
A disaster implies consequences.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,301
We're adults.

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,642
Why would it matter
what your parents think?

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,944
I don't know, because
they're parents.

19
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,986
Doesn't it bother you that your
grumpy second dad Glassman

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,076
still doesn't like me?

21
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,553
Dr. Glassman likes you.

22
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,621
No, he doesn't.

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,293
I have to go.

24
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,887
Fine, but I'm going to text
you some talking points.

25
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,489
Mostly subjects to avoid.

26
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,762
And it's gonna
be a very long list.

27
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,478
- How long has she had this wound?
- Uh...

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,945
She fell off the vault
two months ago.

29
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:27,021
Slow healing and signs of oral
bruising. Are you on a restricted diet?

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,524
Coach put me on a performance
diet. High protein, fiber...

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,186
I can show you her
training log. It's standard.

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,163
Although the noodles she likes
did a number on my stomach too.

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,826
- What noodles?
- Konjac. Girls on the squad eat them.

34
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,803
Konjac noodles were banned
in Australia several years ago.

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,204
They're dangerous,
basically indigestible.

36
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,142
We will get another
doctor to do a workup.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,873
We need to get Darya
to Imaging right away.

38
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,887
I review my schedule starting
with the last appointment

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,327
and working backwards.
It's an effective technique.

40
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,133
You might wanna write this down.

41
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,193
Uncle Marcus, we had a
deal. No special attention.

42
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,605
That deal's off. Livy,
you're struggling.

43
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,177
I can't sit on the
sidelines anymore.

44
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,715
But special treatment from
my uncle will make things worse.

45
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,479
I owe it to you, and I
owe it to this hospital.

46
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,486
I know you have unique talent.

47
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,682
So you've noticed both that I'm
screwing up and that I have unique talent?

48
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,856
I noticed the talent long
before you started here.

49
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,220
Aunt Tilly's annual barbeque?

50
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,335
You gave this to
me when you were 5,

51
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,429
and at that moment, I
knew you were special.

52
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:02,205
Huh. Giant mass of fiber
blocking entry to her intestines.

53
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,980
Her blood tests also show low
calcium and other nutritional deficiencies.

54
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,318
Can I see the 3D
reconstructed images?

55
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,551
It's unlikely to
pass on its own.

56
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,355
We'll have to break it up
and remove it endoscopically.

57
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,259
She also needs
to quit gymnastics.

58
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,998
She has severe osteoporosis
with compression fractures

59
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,161
in almost all of the
thoracic vertebrae.

60
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,764
- Hmm.
- Interesting.

61
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:29,037
She is a 14-year-old girl with the
bone density of an 80-year-old woman.

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,286
You have kyphoscoliosis caused
by insufficient diet and overtraining.

63
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,557
We need to surgically
stabilize across the deformity

64
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,429
to prevent the spine
from failure and paralysis.

65
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,568
Spinal fusion,

66
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,072
that means that she
can't compete, right?

67
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,473
Yes.

68
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,136
The games are less than
a year away. Could we wait

69
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,043
until after to have the surgery?

70
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,079
If left untreated, there's
a 20 percent chance

71
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,211
of progression, which could lead
to respiratory failure and death.

72
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,095
It's your call.

73
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,633
I take risks every day.

74
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm not giving up my dream.

75
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,271
You're 14. It's not your call.

76
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,443
Her mother passed away
when she was a baby.

77
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,244
And my father just
told you it's my decision.

78
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,484
Coach is my dad.

79
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,554
Do what you need to
do to clear the blockage.

80
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,648
But...

81
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,857
leave her spine alone.

82
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,058
She wants to risk
her life for a trophy

83
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,964
and her dad is okay with that.

84
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,697
I mean, that has to
be some form of abuse.

85
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,899
This hospital is not going to win
a lawsuit against a caring father

86
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,204
who supports his
daughter's dreams.

87
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,041
All you can do is pull him
aside and try to convince him

88
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,112
to be responsible.

89
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,016
Yeah. Convincing
people to be responsible

90
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,178
has not been my
strong suit lately.

91
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,089
We're not still talking
about Coach Dad, are we?

92
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,991
- You've been avoiding me.
- I've been busy.

93
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,554
Recovering from a motorcycle
accident that you lied about?

94
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,396
There's nothing to tell. I
hit a patch of wet pavement.

95
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,958
No, Audrey.

96
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,966
You have PTSD.

97
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,804
I'm dealing with it.

98
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,038
I don't think you are.

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,741
Well, I also have a truckload
of other things to deal with,

100
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,082
including the annual surgical
fundraiser Glassman dumped in my lap.

101
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,315
Yeah, parties,
they're important.

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,128
I am dealing with it.

103
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,992
Okay.

104
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,370
How long have you had
the severe heartburn?

105
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,038
Uh, six months, maybe a year.

106
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,139
BP is 142 over 90.
That's a little high.

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,343
Yeah, well, Darya
and I travel a lot

108
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,511
for competition. I don't
take care of myself.

109
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,283
Prioritizing your work
over health is bad.

110
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,722
For you and your daughter.

111
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,487
Thank you. But may
I kindly remind you:

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,586
How long are the shifts
that you doctors work?

113
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,961
High stress, no sleep.

114
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,229
When something is important,
you give it all you've got.

115
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,793
True. But we're
adults. Darya's not.

116
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,396
Yeah. But she's very different
from other girls her age.

117
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,375
I mean, Darya, she
works her butt off.

118
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,774
She's earned my respect.

119
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,080
You okay?

120
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,914
I'm feeling some
kind of chest pain.

121
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,954
His oxygen sat and
pressure's dropping.

122
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,359
Possible MI, lung
problem, or aortic aneurysm.

123
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,917
Secure his airway.

124
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,689
Poor perfusion. I
think he's septic.

125
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,925
Vitals aren't improving.

126
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,528
It might be a spontaneous
pneumothorax and trapped air in his chest.

127
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,339
No, his chest would sound like a
kettle drum. There's fluid in there.

128
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,573
Give me a blade, curved
clamp and a chest tube.

129
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,544
Boerhaave Syndrome
is easily misdiagnosed.

130
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,885
Nice catch with the
percussion technique.

131
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,289
You may have
saved this man's life.

132
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,796
Give me more retraction,
the tissue planes are terrible.

133
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,861
We're going to have to
debride the mediastinum.

134
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,229
And there's too much
damage to repair the esophagus

135
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,297
without risking
a chronic fistula.

136
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,673
The ongoing leakage into
his chest means it would be

137
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,042
a matter of time before
he dies from an infection.

138
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,778
The safest approach would be to
permanently divert the esophagus.

139
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,445
He'd eat through a tube the rest of
his life, but I don't see a better option.

140
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,121
In 24 hours, with
broad-spectrum antibiotics

141
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,322
and drains, the
infection could clear

142
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,659
and give us more options...

143
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,825
which buys everyone time to
come up with another brilliant win.

144
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,135
Does she really call
her own father "Coach"?

145
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,908
He is her coach. What
do you call your father?

146
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,581
Abba.

147
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,016
Pass.

148
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,551
Frank.

149
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,986
That's his name.

150
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,414
Do you respect any traditions?

151
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,653
Not random ones. Why
should we create labels

152
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,126
for things that
already have names?

153
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,322
It's not just what
Darya calls her dad,

154
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:54,391
it's how they act with each
other. They're like co-workers.

155
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,301
That doesn't sound
bad. If I were meeting

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,465
Lea's co-workers tomorrow,
she would be much less anxious.

157
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,168
Family is supposed
to make you anxious.

158
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,803
Introducing a new boyfriend
to your parents, it's a big deal,

159
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,507
it's a rite of passage.

160
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,447
Polymorphic
ventricular arrhythmia.

161
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,988
Torsade de Pointes.

162
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,320
We need magnesium
sulfate, 2 grams IV.

163
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,729
Heart rate's 170.
She's not responding.

164
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,925
Move in the defibrillator.

165
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,898
- Charged to 100 joules.
- Clear.

166
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,837
Did we do something wrong?

167
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,873
No, which is puzzling.

168
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,154
Mistakes by first-year
residents are expected,

169
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,987
but cardiac arrhythmia in a
14-year-old is definitely unexpected.

170
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,432
I was going to ask if you wanted
a ride, but if you're working late...

171
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,902
Twenty hours to figure this
out. Sure you wanna waste

172
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,438
one of them driving
home and back?

173
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,971
I think while I drive.

174
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,839
Not as well. Not in
the car. Not at home.

175
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,448
Too comfortable,
too many distractions.

176
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,245
Better to buckle down here,
where your colleagues can see you.

177
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,750
I was under the impression
results are more important

178
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,516
than how a doctor is perceived.

179
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,581
Jordan is running rings
around you there too.

180
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,655
Results don't matter if you
can't make people listen.

181
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,832
Is that why you didn't want to
perform the esophageal diversion?

182
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,762
You didn't hear me?

183
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,435
I made a decision for
the good of the patient.

184
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,673
Now it's up to you
to prove me right.

185
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:58,221
She has a prolonged QT
interval and sporadic extra beats.

186
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,890
I'm going to get the newbies
to recheck the renal panel

187
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,489
and order endocrine
and genetic studies.

188
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,161
I already did. Also a
tox and drug screen.

189
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,205
Are you okay?

190
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,332
Mm.

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,239
Lea's scared.

192
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:26,086
Then I should prepare myself.
There is definitely something

193
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,620
about me her parents won't like.

194
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,589
No, Shaun, you are who you are.

195
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,524
Who you are is great.

196
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,094
You've been preparing
for this your entire life.

197
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:41,794
When you do something important
for the first time, like surgery,

198
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,892
you practice.

199
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,438
I should practice
meeting her parents.

200
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:49,272
How? It's not like there's
a simulator for learning

201
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,107
how to navigate awkward
social interactions.

202
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,346
There is.

203
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,085
But I need pizza.

204
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,919
Shaun, I'd like you to meet
my parents, Pam and Mike.

205
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,365
Hi, Pam.

206
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,435
Hi, Mike.

207
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,439
Lea tells us you're a
doctor. What specialty?

208
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,672
I am a surgeon.

209
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,545
What a shame. I hear surgeons
are arrogant and overrated.

210
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,749
Okay. Morgan, I'm sorry but
can you give it a rest for a second?

211
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,882
I'm in character.
Address me as Pam.

212
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,086
I read recently that
while you're sleeping,

213
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,961
you accidentally eat
eight spiders every year.

214
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,401
Yes.

215
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:55,203
And I read that sometimes
they lay eggs in your stomach.

216
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,210
And then you can have
thousands of spiders...

217
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,939
Shaun...

218
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,880
You said not to disagree when he
says something wrong and pointless.

219
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,314
I didn't tell you to agree.

220
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,943
That only gives him more
wrong and pointless things.

221
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,086
Good.

222
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,079
That's helpful.

223
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,653
Let's continue.

224
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,362
Did you know Arizona doesn't
have Daylight Savings Time?

225
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,692
Saving.

226
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,460
It's "saving," not "savings,"
that's grammatic...

227
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:31,544
Well, how am I supposed to know
what is pointless? Facts are facts.

228
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,978
Okay. Okay. Okay.
This isn't gonna work.

229
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:37,609
We could spend the rest of the evening
teaching Shaun the fine but trivial art

230
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,516
of how to finesse trivia.

231
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:43,283
But the real problem isn't
gonna be small talk and bickering.

232
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,621
The problem is what happens
when Lea's parents express

233
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,389
real concerns
about their daughter.

234
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,485
What concerns?

235
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,224
Concerns any parent would have.

236
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,392
You barely know each other.
Haven't been dating long,

237
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,234
now you're living together. This
relationship is moving too fast.

238
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,439
You're wrong.

239
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,773
I thought you said we
shouldn't argue with your dad.

240
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,609
That wasn't my dad, that
was 100 percent Glassy.

241
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,643
You can't prepare for how
these evenings can go wrong.

242
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,346
Families are full of surprises.

243
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,149
Like how you don't like Lea.

244
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,399
I never actually said that.

245
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,541
Wow, a first-year all-nighter.
Brings back memories.

246
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,883
Not of myself, but of
the losers who thought

247
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,187
staying up all night drooling on their
laptops made them better doctors.

248
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,758
So, cure cancer yet?

249
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,460
I'm trying to find a new way
to repair a ruptured esophagus.

250
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,526
"Fundic reinforcement
with intercostal muscle flap."

251
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:07,096
Cutting-edge stuff. Why not
go with diversion? It's safer.

252
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,506
Because safe is
ordinary and boring.

253
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,804
Like me.

254
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,908
My uncle thinks I need a win.

255
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,040
And the only way to do that is
to be impressive, like Jordan.

256
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,049
Makes sense.

257
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,511
You agree?

258
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,646
That Dr. Allen is impressive?

259
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,384
Yeah. Everybody knows that

260
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,427
because Dr. Allen makes
sure everybody knows that.

261
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,725
She and your uncle are cut from
the same fashionably high-end cloth.

262
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,824
So I don't just need to be a better
doctor, I need to be a different person.

263
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,731
Wow.

264
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,602
You might wanna start by being a
person who feels less sorry for themselves.

265
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,238
Either you are an
awkward, inconsistent loner

266
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,177
who's irritatingly apologetic
about your best qualities,

267
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,943
or you're a quietly brilliant surgeon
whom others ignore at their own peril.

268
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,009
If you're the first one, quit
now and stop wasting resources.

269
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,145
But if you're the
second, be that.

270
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,224
Maybe a little louder.

271
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,102
Where should we start?

272
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,268
Centerpieces?

273
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,041
Appetizers? Color schemes?

274
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,605
Please tell me you're at a
hotel in the middle of the day

275
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,208
because you're having an affair.

276
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,652
There were no surgeries scheduled,
so I decided to volunteer to help.

277
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,780
How helpful.

278
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,190
Mm. We can get the job done in
half the time and still have time to talk.

279
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,820
Or we can just talk.

280
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,062
I am not a 14-year-old
girl whose next backflip

281
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,659
could kill her, Claire.
I don't need saving.

282
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,570
What do you think
about twinkle lights?

283
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,472
Too prom?

284
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,512
Tests show your heart problems

285
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,143
are caused by
excess estrogen levels.

286
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,654
And we wanna know
how it got in your system.

287
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,657
Medication? A supplement?

288
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,558
Coach gave you my training
logs. You know as much as I do.

289
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,224
We also know that you're
in a very competitive sport.

290
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,858
So maybe there's something
you're taking not on the log.

291
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,926
If you are, we can't
divulge that to anyone.

292
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,232
You think I'm doping?

293
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,438
No way.

294
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,498
- If your coach is pressuring you...
- He's not.

295
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,738
I'm sure it's a one-time thing.

296
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,415
Keep monitoring
me. I'll be fine.

297
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,381
Darya, you've made your dreams
come true by being stubborn.

298
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,955
Being relentless. And
just making things happen.

299
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,483
But that's not how your
heart works. Or your spine.

300
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,756
She's not being stubborn.

301
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,091
It is going to
go away, isn't it?

302
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,430
Because you are
taking something.

303
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,035
And now you're going to stop.

304
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,145
Which means it wasn't
performance enhancing.

305
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,548
What is it for?

306
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,154
You took drugs for boobs?

307
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,954
The girl on YouTube said
it would make them bigger.

308
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,225
Phytoestrogens used in herbal
remedies can cause swelling

309
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,597
in breast tissue, but there are
potentially dangerous side effects.

310
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,397
- What were you thinking?
- I didn't know it would make me sick.

311
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,008
I got tired of hearing the boys
talking about women with curves...

312
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,376
What if it showed
up on a drug test?

313
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,781
What if you got banned
from the Olympics?

314
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,512
It's natural, it doesn't mess
with performance, other girls...

315
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,951
I don't care about other girls.

316
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,957
And I didn't think you cared
about other girls. Are you...

317
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,759
I can't believe that you're
willing to risk everything...

318
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,688
for something so...

319
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,399
childish.

320
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,732
It's not childish.

321
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,395
I give a lot to my sport.

322
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,301
I just wanted something for me.

323
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,943
You're not an adult.

324
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:09,808
Hmm.

325
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,998
Fix her heart... and her spine.

326
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,732
Wha... What? You can't do that.

327
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,293
- Are you punishing me?
- I'm doing my job.

328
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,434
I'm your father,
and we're family,

329
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,343
and it is my job to make
good decisions when you won't.

330
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,245
Since when is being
my father your job?

331
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,879
We never do anything but talk
about gymnastics, not even Mom.

332
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,184
If you didn't think I needed my
father after she died, why start now?

333
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,352
Darya.

334
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,595
I'm calling the team lawyer
and filing for emancipation.

335
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,370
You think I can't make my
own decisions? Try this one.

336
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,833
You're fired, Coach.

337
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,520
We could try T-tubes. Using them

338
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,066
forms a controlled fistula
and route for drainage.

339
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,968
But the patient would still have a
long recovery and chance of reinfection.

340
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,403
- What else?
- I found

341
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,964
very interesting research on
endoscopic vacuum therapy.

342
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,943
It's under investigation for the
management of esophageal leaks.

343
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,570
Definitely innovative,
Dr. Allen, but a little too much so.

344
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,949
This hasn't gone through clinical trials,
and we need to perform surgery today.

345
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,622
Dr. Jackson, you've been quiet.

346
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,288
I was thinking
fundic reinforcement.

347
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,329
My idea is to use a
patient's own good tissue

348
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,561
to reinforce a primary closure,
in this case using the stomach

349
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,897
as the patch.

350
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,161
Like the way we use a skin
graft for third-degree burns.

351
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,943
He'd be at risk of a
diaphragmatic hernia.

352
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,139
Not if we cinch up the lower
esophageal sphincter with a fundoplasty.

353
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,507
Shaun, Lea tells us you're a
doctor. What's your specialty?

354
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,111
I am a surgeon. But
we're not all arrogant.

355
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,878
Though many of us are. I'm
still not sure if that's good or bad.

356
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,818
Is it hard for you?

357
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,885
I mean, it's a difficult job.

358
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,794
Shaun is excellent at his job.

359
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,337
- So how do you feel about vaccines?
- Oh, my God.

360
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,239
Because, um, they worry me.

361
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,801
They don't worry me.

362
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,738
- Oh.
- Really? We've read a lot of stuff.

363
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,113
Especially since
Lea told us about you.

364
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,209
Vaccines don't
cause autism, Mom.

365
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,947
Want to talk about religion now?

366
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,753
Lea, that was on the list
of things not to talk about.

367
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,487
- Mm.
- Lea wrote you a list?

368
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,789
- Dad.
- Well...

369
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,196
Honestly, Lea, if we're so impossible
to talk to, why even have us here?

370
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,259
Hemorrhoid surgery.

371
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,271
- Excuse me?
- Want more wine?

372
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,797
I removed a hemorrhoid from
a patient with terminal cancer.

373
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,845
He only had a few months to
live, and nothing would change that.

374
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,278
But the surgery did make
him more comfortable.

375
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,514
I suggest we treat this
evening like hemorrhoid surgery.

376
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,685
No, that's... That's
a good point.

377
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,968
You don't have to give him any
more lists. Let him talk. I like this guy.

378
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,603
Okay.

379
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,140
To hemorrhoid surgery.

380
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,267
To hemorrhoid surgery.

381
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,844
<i>♪ Everybody's feeling
warm and bright ♪</i>

382
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,611
<i>♪ It's such a fine
and natural sight ♪</i>

383
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,242
I went.

384
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,053
I went to see a psychiatrist.

385
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,686
- I'm... I'm so relieved to hear that...
- Well, once.

386
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,924
The doctor said my symptoms
warranted medication,

387
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,728
so I haven't been back since.

388
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,336
Why? If you need medication...

389
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,600
Why did you keep
your PTSD a secret?

390
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,438
You chose to deal with
your issues privately,

391
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,778
on your own terms.

392
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,643
Why am I not entitled
to the same choice?

393
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,811
Doing something...

394
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,856
self-destructive is not
a choice, it's a mistake.

395
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,449
- Just like it was when I did it.
- So...

396
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,130
when I do something
you agree with, it's great.

397
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,530
I do something you disagree
with, it's because I'm sick.

398
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,568
- No.
- This is why I don't want to talk to you,

399
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,867
because it's not a
conversation, it's a lecture.

400
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,271
Audrey.

401
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,816
Audrey.

402
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,875
Please, Claire. Let me go.

403
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,817
No.

404
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,718
I just want to go
home. I'll be fine.

405
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,553
Let me give you a ride. You
can't drive like this. Come on.

406
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,520
I said I'm fine.

407
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,720
No, you're not.

408
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,329
There. Now no one's
driving home. You happy?

409
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,297
<i>♪ Celebrate good times... ♪</i>

410
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,982
The two main challenges
of Boerhaave Syndrome

411
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,281
are timely diagnosis,
followed by viability of repair.

412
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,912
With this innovative
surgical approach...

413
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,421
I think we might achieve both.

414
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,358
I need silk ties and Ligasure.

415
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,298
His chest infection leaked through the
diaphragm into the intraperitoneal space.

416
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,914
There's an abscess
behind the stomach.

417
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,486
It's making the entire
posterior stomach friable.

418
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,545
Let's use an intercostal muscle
flap to patch the esophagus instead.

419
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,648
If we do, it raises
the risk of sepsis.

420
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,556
The patient signed
off, we should try.

421
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,255
Not this level of risk. We
need to do the diversion.

422
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,991
Your idea was good,
don't give up on it.

423
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,331
Reverting to diversion
doesn't mean failure.

424
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:17,335
I searched "eating meat
near me," which was a mistake,

425
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,846
but I did get a recommendation for
a steak house your father might like.

426
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,007
You don't have to be nice
to my parents anymore.

427
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,551
- We won't be seeing them again.
- Why not?

428
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,483
"We need to talk about Shaun."

429
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,753
Mm.

430
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:38,560
They don't think I'm mature enough
to be in a challenging relationship.

431
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,122
Leave it to my mom, she
took us both out in one shot.

432
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,872
You do get that this is
insulting, to both of us?

433
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,643
From the people who supposedly
love me most in the world.

434
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,007
They don't.

435
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,445
Not the most.

436
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,379
Not anymore.

437
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,382
Lea.

438
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,527
People who meet me
are usually uncomfortable.

439
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,764
And most of the time,
that doesn't go away.

440
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,003
How do you handle that?

441
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,502
I try to be patient.

442
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,001
Sometimes it works.

443
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,647
Maybe you're a more
mature person than I am.

444
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,909
But I'm not sure if that
is going to work for me.

445
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,659
- Have you see Dr. Lim this morning?
- Uh, no. Why?

446
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,964
- Darya's lawyer called.
- I need Dr. Lim.

447
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,096
Dr. Lim's not here, I
don't know if she'll be in.

448
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,767
If it's an emergency,
maybe Dr. Glassman...

449
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,504
Dr. Glassman's in meetings
this morning. Who needs me?

450
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,172
Darya's lawyer is demanding
the hospital release her client.

451
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,078
We're not releasing our patient

452
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,515
until she's healthy unless
we receive a court order.

453
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,677
What's your problem?

454
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,584
Dr. Andrews
encountered complications.

455
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,452
He asked me to inform
you the surgical plan

456
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,115
needs to change
without consent...

457
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,593
That's Andrews' call. I
don't need details, just coffee.

458
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,696
I changed my mind,
I need the details.

459
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,396
Stay here.

460
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,934
Long, painful recovery with a
feeding tube, or risk of death.

461
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,602
As his next of
kin, it's your call.

462
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,307
I have to decide?

463
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,010
You made a life-or-death
choice for yourself.

464
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,609
In fact, you insisted on it.

465
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,246
The doctors were asking me
to give up something I wanted.

466
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,450
Difference is your father
is on an operating table

467
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,117
waiting for you to grow up.

468
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,965
If something bad
happened, I'd be responsible.

469
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,124
Yes.

470
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,363
That's the definition
of adulthood.

471
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,975
I don't know what to do.

472
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,069
Of course you don't.
It's an impossible choice.

473
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,909
Terrible things
happen either way.

474
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,511
And yeah, it's on you.

475
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,543
I can't do it.

476
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,590
I just can't.

477
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,760
You're not a grown-up, Darya.

478
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,162
Luckily.

479
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,225
So those of us who are will make
the impossible decision for you.

480
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,432
Dr. Andrews will
do the diversion.

481
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,744
Someone will bring you to see
your father when he's out of surgery.

482
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,063
What was that?

483
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,998
I saved that girl
when you couldn't.

484
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,127
Yesterday, you told me
to respect her decision.

485
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,400
Today, you tortured her
into changing her mind.

486
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,634
Oh, did I make
a little girl cry?

487
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,200
I can't do this. I'm
done trying to help you.

488
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,337
Please. You're
never really done.

489
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,986
You know who
you were last night?

490
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,048
My mom. Drunk. Angry.

491
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,560
Refusing to lift a finger to
help herself, lying about it,

492
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,186
and taking your pain out on me.

493
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,590
That's going to keep
happening until you get help.

494
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,595
Take the medication,
talk to someone.

495
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,536
Do something.

496
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,539
Please.

497
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,707
I'm not your mother, Claire.
I'm not your responsibility.

498
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm your boss. And I
don't owe you anything.

499
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,031
Shaun? What are you doing here?

500
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,210
You're wrong about me and Lea.

501
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,647
Oh. Well, no offense, Shaun,
but this is between family.

502
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,276
Lea is my girlfriend.

503
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,378
And the texts you
sent were about us.

504
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:34,825
We're sorry you saw those.
Shaun, you're a very nice young man,

505
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,488
and we enjoyed meeting you.

506
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,689
It's just...

507
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,363
We've known Lea a lot longer.

508
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,958
Yeah, she's, um...

509
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,465
Well, she has a good heart,
she just doesn't think ahead.

510
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,168
She will do anything
to get under our skin.

511
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,575
You wouldn't believe some
of the people she's dated.

512
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:58,409
I'm different than
anyone she's ever dated.

513
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,847
How is that not a change?

514
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,050
That's true, Shaun. I'm
just not sure it's a good thing.

515
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,561
You knew her then.

516
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,666
You don't know her now.

517
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,335
All you know are her
mistakes. And you don't trust her

518
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,106
because you aren't sure
you were good parents.

519
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,277
You said our relationship
has challenges.

520
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,144
You're right.

521
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:43,195
Lea and I go through
challenges together.

522
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,924
It's one of the things
that makes us stronger.

523
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,127
Lea challenges me to try things,

524
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:54,196
even things I know I won't like,
because it is not always better

525
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,434
to stop and think.
And I make Lea patient,

526
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,875
because I can
be very frustrating.

527
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,604
So can the two of you.

528
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,853
Maybe this challenge will make
your relationship stronger too.

529
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,078
If you really think I should
have the spinal surgery...

530
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,879
I trust you.

531
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,020
I do.

532
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,518
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,324
Ever since your mother died...

534
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,668
I've been scared.

535
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,000
What did I know about
raising a little girl by myself?

536
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:09,013
And you... You were a handful.

537
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,678
Bouncing off the walls,
backflips off the furniture...

538
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,415
You couldn't get me
to the gym fast enough.

539
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:20,448
Because when you
are on the beam...

540
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,222
or flipping through the air...

541
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:30,429
you're not just a little girl.
You are an amazing athlete.

542
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:36,564
As your coach, you
make me feel amazing too.

543
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,081
All this time, I thought
I was giving you

544
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,639
exactly what you needed.

545
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,952
But I was wrong.

546
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,850
What you needed was
for me to be your dad.

547
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,357
And what your dad
would have told you:

548
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,865
That no matter how you look...

549
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,134
or what you achieve...

550
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:12,106
you will always be a beautiful,
strong superstar to me.

551
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,652
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

552
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,329
Thank you.

553
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,786
I like you, okay?

554
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,857
Stop. You're gonna make me cry.

555
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,286
You're a very cynical
person, you know that?

556
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,560
Actually, I'm not, but
you're a very grouchy person

557
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,533
who cannot give a compliment.

558
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:19,801
You're funny, you're smart,
and you make Shaun happy.

559
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,880
Which I guess is a good
thing, but it also means

560
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:28,386
you can also make him very, very
sad, and that worries me, frankly.

561
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,188
I am not planning
on hurting Shaun.

562
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,954
It's rarely intentional,
you know?

563
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,894
My parents have
an issue with Shaun.

564
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,597
And I just don't
want Shaun's parent

565
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,903
to have a problem with us too.

566
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,736
Too bad.

567
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,876
Everything Shaun
has gone through...

568
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:07,423
all the rejection
and the pain...

569
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,689
the victories, they
all belong to him.

570
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:20,496
But I feel every single
high and every single low.

571
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,203
So I'm sorry, I'm...

572
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:31,073
I'm not gonna stop worrying about
him, even if he doesn't need me to.

573
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,524
Well, if Shaun saw
that stain on your tie,

574
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,025
it would drive him crazy.

575
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,533
Hey, Liv.

576
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,703
I'm sorry we didn't get
to perform the surgery,

577
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,839
but I'm really proud of
the way you stepped up.

578
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,709
That surgery wasn't mine.

579
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,811
Of course it was,
and it was brilliant.

580
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,788
And neither was the stone.

581
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,953
That story you told me about
how you spotted my talent?

582
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,121
I don't remember any of it.

583
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,363
I didn't paint that rock,
and if I handed it to you,

584
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,198
it didn't mean anything,
because I was 5.

585
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,634
You've been carrying around
a memory for over 20 years

586
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,802
that represents
your dream, not mine.

587
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,847
Clearly that's not entirely true.
You went to medical school.

588
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,145
Because I do want
to be a great doctor.

589
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,251
I wanted it so bad
that I let you push me

590
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,381
to think up some flashy
surgery, even when my instincts

591
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,255
already told me to do what
I thought was the right thing,

592
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,352
and was the right thing.

593
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,921
- I want you to be the best...
- You want me to be Jordan.

594
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,960
If you're looking to mold someone
in your image, she's perfect.

595
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,636
But, Uncle Marcus,
I've got to be me.

596
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,771
And you can't help me do that.

597
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,913
Hey.

598
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,389
I'm still gonna brag on you like a
proud uncle. You know that, right?

599
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,334
Dr. Jackson.

600
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,734
- It's your parents.
- Yep, Shaun. I saw.

601
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,362
They probably want
something. We should prepare.

602
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,339
Either they want to
yell at us, in which case

603
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,842
we should not answer the
door, or take us to dinner,

604
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,243
but we are already
halfway through...

605
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,746
They want to take us to dinner.

606
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,810
Should I open the door?

607
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,615
What do you think?

608
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,887
I think...

609
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,064
they must have
been good parents.

610
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,593
We should have dinner with them.

611
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:41,636
Do you want to text them back?

612
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,393
Last year, after my mom died,

613
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,960
I was going through some
problems, emotionally.

614
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,130
I was diagnosed with PTSD.

615
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:18,909
I see.

616
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,070
Melendez knew.

617
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,807
Um, Morgan found out
because she's Morgan.

618
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,076
But I didn't tell anyone else.

619
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,515
I didn't want anyone to know.

620
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,347
Why are you telling me this now?

621
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:31,682
Because...

622
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:37,791
Lim is going through something
like it, but maybe worse.

623
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,294
She isn't going to therapy, she
has refused medications, she...

624
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,461
Okay.

625
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,531
I don't think you
should be telling me this.

626
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,434
Whatever Lim told you,
she told you in confidence

627
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,508
and as a friend.

628
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:54,045
But she's not just a
friend. She's my boss.

629
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:56,747
And you're her boss.

630
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:02,083
So I'm telling you because
I have no place else to turn.

631
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:06,219
She won't let me help
because she says it's not my job,

632
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,485
and she's right.

633
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,392
But it's your job to
protect the hospital.

634
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,925
And her.

635
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,171
So...
