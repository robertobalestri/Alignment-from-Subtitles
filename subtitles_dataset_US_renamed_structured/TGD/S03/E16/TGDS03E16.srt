1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,501
Early 60s,
found prone on the sidewalk,

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,473
appears to have chest pain,
maybe broken ribs,

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,985
- possible heart attack.
- Did you fall?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,137
She's very disoriented.
Hasn't said a thing.

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,270
Coley?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,306
No, I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,178
Will you help me, Coley?

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,587
I have to, it's my job.

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,180
She has stridor. Checking her pulse.

10
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,856
- Radial pulse is normal.
- But much weaker in her leg.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,399
She has a descending
thoracic aneurysm.

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,529
Page Dr. Melendez to the OR.

13
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,868
I just woke up
on the front campus lawn,

14
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,706
covered in blood,
with a skateboard next to me.

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,180
But I can't skateboard.

16
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,014
- Obviously.
- Were you drinking, Aiden?

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,381
- Or smoking something?
- No, to both.

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,847
There are college students
who abstain.

19
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,823
You were incredibly lucky.

20
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,590
Half an inch in any direction
and you would've bled out.

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,332
Aortic wall's tearing.

22
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,928
Can't expect pristine in a 60-year-old
homeless woman. Drop to a 5-0 suture.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,737
Not great, but better.

24
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,041
Let's see if it holds.

25
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,140
Remove proximal clamp.

26
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,556
- No leakage.
- Let's finish the repair.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,251
Carly broke up with me.

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,157
I'm sorry, Shaun.

29
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,593
I thought you two were doing great.

30
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,662
We were. Then I guess we weren't.
Cross-clamping.

31
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,506
- You must really be hurting.
- No, I'm fine.

32
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,145
We've all been through it.

33
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,443
And it helps
when you own that you're in pain.

34
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,781
There's nothing for me to own.

35
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,013
She's having epistaxis.

36
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,319
Carotid aneurysm rupture. Two French
Foley catheters. Give protamine stat.

37
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,894
Sixty-eight over 44. Holding
pressure on both carotids at the neck.

38
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,294
Inflate.

39
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,764
Forty-one over 28.
She's still bleeding internally.

40
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,899
Give four units of PRBCs
and start TXA.

41
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,300
Loading 700 milligrams TXA.

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,269
No distal perfusion.

43
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,405
We have to clamp her carotids.
Ten blades.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,689
Suction, clamps, let's go.

45
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,071
- I can't see a thing.
- Her blood volume's on the floor.

46
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,443
Time of death, 10:22 a.m.

47
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,582
Jane shouldn't have died.

48
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,922
Not then, not like that.

49
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,563
Her carotid blew out,
what am I missing?

50
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,564
Patients die, Dr. Murphy.

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,436
Something else we have to own.

52
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,038
Your next patient's waiting in the ER.

53
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,456
- How are you feeling, Aiden?
- Awesome,

54
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,422
- considering whatever you did to me.
- Surgery went well.

55
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,398
Hey, I'm alive, doped up, talking
to two very attractive doctors.

56
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,598
I guess this is what happens

57
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,537
when you mix weed
with my skateboarding.

58
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,432
You said you didn't do drugs
or skateboard.

59
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,811
- When did I say that?
- When we met you in the ER.

60
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,950
I've never seen you guys
before in my life.

61
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,747
Trust me, I'd remember.

62
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,930
I'd like to order an autopsy on Jane.

63
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,463
We went over this.

64
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,595
There was nothing suspicious
about her death.

65
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,267
Oh. I was asking the chief of surgery.

66
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,171
I know the case, and I agree
with Dr. Melendez.

67
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,940
I'm not authorizing an autopsy.

68
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,073
Jane's vascular walls...

69
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,812
It's hard to lose a patient,
almost as hard as losing a girlfriend.

70
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,118
I'm okay and I don't know
why no one believes me.

71
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,718
- Isn't it okay to be okay?
- Not when something bad happens.

72
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,792
We should feel hurt.

73
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,131
If you won't approve the autopsy,

74
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,337
I'll get it from Jane's family.

75
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,471
Good luck with that.

76
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,376
According to the files,
Jane's last name was Doe.

77
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,657
You're saying I'm having
some kind of blackouts?

78
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,702
Which could be caused
by head trauma, or drug use.

79
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,397
I'm definitely aware of telling you
I don't take drugs.

80
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,938
I live like a monk.

81
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,445
Sleep, class, study, repeat, that's it.

82
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,948
You've also told us
the exact opposite.

83
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,861
I need to find Jane's family

84
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,165
to get their permission
to perform an autopsy.

85
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,400
Dr. Lim wished me luck,
but Jane has no ID, no purse, no phone.

86
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,965
We know absolutely nothing about her.

87
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:59,283
Mm. This should be interesting to you.
You used to be a detective.

88
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,550
And now I'm a doctor and so are you,
and we both have a new case.

89
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,559
A boring case.
He has gallstones.

90
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,768
So you and Melendez
sneaking around again?

91
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,567
I hear he is back
to being a good mentor.

92
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,002
Apparently, my complaint
changed nothing.

93
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,910
You?

94
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,948
- Park said he did it.
- Park was lying

95
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,853
because he wanted
to get you to focus on work.

96
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,924
Good motive, bad judge of character.

97
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,619
And you don't like Melendez
has gone back to good mentor.

98
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,920
I don't like that he likes you.
I don't like that, because he likes you,

99
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,330
Shaun, Park and I
are second-class residents.

100
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,532
For someone as cynical as you are,
you're shockingly naive.

101
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,632
I'll tell you what you did.

102
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,471
You threw a bomb because
you felt slighted.

103
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,444
You made Melendez doubt himself,
doubt his judgment,

104
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,949
you made him resent you,
Park, Shaun and me.

105
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,046
I like to think it's that easy
to change status quo,

106
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,679
but I am pretty naive.

107
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,391
I am with Dr. B on this.

108
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,957
Sorry. Office politics.
Thought you were asleep.

109
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,402
Watching brain waves
can't be thrilling.

110
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,339
Not when they're as normal as yours.

111
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,373
Except these delta waves.

112
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,378
They mean you're still asleep.

113
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,828
Not planning on doing
any cutting, I hope.

114
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,697
Jane had a knee replacement
using an LCS system,

115
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,161
which means
it's at least 30 years old.

116
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:59,070
She also had an abnormal number
of cavities, crowns and implants.

117
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,739
These are clues, right?

118
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,178
I don't think this is about
you losing a patient.

119
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,213
I think you're distracting yourself.

120
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,944
You don't wanna let Jane go
because you don't wanna let Carly go.

121
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:22,828
Hmm.

122
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,933
What?

123
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,568
You're a doctor now,
you won't find it interesting.

124
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,710
Hmm.

125
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,253
A hummingbird.

126
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,588
Am I right?

127
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,929
The police keep a database
of all distinguishing marks.

128
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,665
Jane Doe, homeless, there's no way
she was never in the system.

129
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,001
How's Mr. Ginley?

130
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,433
A gallbladder case
you should be working on.

131
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,242
We confirmed the presence of gallstones
and have scheduled a cholecystectomy.

132
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,284
It's a very simple case
and requires no work.

133
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,588
With that attitude, you could
send another patient to the morgue.

134
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,153
Focus on the living.

135
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,324
He's right. We need to bail on this.

136
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,003
Hey, Shaun...

137
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,108
You and Carly shared a lot of firsts.
That must make it harder to move on.

138
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,718
- I had a lot of firsts with Lea too.
- Yeah, you did, and you moved on.

139
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,687
Didn't you?

140
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,820
How do you move on?

141
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,235
Hmm.

142
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,743
Hey, Kenny. I need a name.

143
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,852
We need to keep this on the DL.

144
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,856
We're going undercover?

145
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,688
Causes of sleepwalking
run the gamut from the serious,

146
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,096
like MS, encephalitis
and brain tumors,

147
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,033
to the mundane,
like alcohol and drug use,

148
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,070
poor sleep hygiene and stress.

149
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,197
Problem is, to rule some of those out,
we need a full patient history,

150
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,710
but Asleep Aiden and Awake Aiden
each have their own story.

151
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,006
Interview them both.

152
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,570
Take a medical history from a patient
when they're asleep?

153
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,411
I've never heard
of a lying sleepwalker.

154
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,380
I gotta go.

155
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,615
Hey.

156
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,896
Stress?

157
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:15,259
I have to maintain a 4.2 GPA.
Well, what do you think?

158
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,406
You have to care about something
to be stressed, don't you?

159
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,270
And since I'm getting
a 4.2 without trying.

160
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,604
Maybe a glass of wine.

161
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,647
I just microdose, you know,
whenever I'm not macrodosing.

162
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,407
Do you nap, exercise before bedtime?

163
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,315
I never nap, work out five days
a week, never too close to bedtime,

164
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,513
which is midnight,
12:30 at the latest.

165
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,284
I'm surrounded by 5000 women.

166
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,220
Yes, right before bedtime.

167
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,024
That explains the headaches
I've been waking up with.

168
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,765
I never thought they were hangovers.

169
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,904
He's a Cro-Magnon.

170
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,674
He's not me.

171
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,577
He can't be.

172
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,494
"Maribel Ventane."

173
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,062
"Sharing the spirit.

174
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,634
Marco, Maribel
and their 5-year-old son, Jules,

175
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:31,007
open their doors to host
the fourth annual fundraiser,

176
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,442
'Friends in Need.'"

177
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,346
"Maribel Ventane, 33,
was one jump away

178
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,849
from a first-place ribbon,"
blah, blah, blah.

179
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,317
"Suffered
severe orthopedic injuries."

180
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,289
"After two years in family court,
Maribel Ventane, 36,

181
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,952
and ex-husband, Marco Ventane, 43..."
blah, blah, blah,

182
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:52,328
"Mr. Ventane was given full custody
of their 11-year-old son, Jules."

183
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,027
"Marco Ventane, 63,
passed away in his home.

184
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,036
He is survived by his son,
Jules Ventane, 32."

185
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,370
I've found him.

186
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,041
- Are you Jules Ventane?
- Yes.

187
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,242
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy

188
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,871
and I recently treated
your mother, Maribel.

189
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,043
She died. I would like your permission
to do an autopsy.

190
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,881
We're very sorry for your loss.

191
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,149
She came in with
a ruptured aortic aneurysm

192
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,918
and there wasn't much we could do.

193
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:55,595
But we would like to be absolutely
certain about her cause of death.

194
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,191
I don't care how she died.

195
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,482
Remember we talked about moving on?

196
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,619
This is the time to do that.

197
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,259
Where do we stand with the Aidens?

198
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,396
Between the two alters, they engage
in just about every single behavior.

199
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,441
So we go back to Dr. Lim's list.

200
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,806
Maybe we should be looking
at paraneoplastic syndromes.

201
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,970
You may wanna consider
psychiatric issues.

202
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,014
Could be having psychotic
or dissociative episodes.

203
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,076
I have personal experience
with people with psychiatric issues.

204
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,816
If he had psychosis,
I'd have picked up on it.

205
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,655
- How about thyrotoxicosis?
- No irritability, agitation.

206
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,357
Paraneoplastic syndromes
trigger a loss of coordination,

207
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,866
- which could have caused...
- Actually, personal experiences

208
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,527
make us less effective
in spotting symptoms.

209
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,663
I always make an effort
to be as objective as possible.

210
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,264
You're not this time.

211
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,002
The vast majority of cases
of paraneoplastic

212
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,047
syndromes present with antibodies.

213
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,672
His labs show a normal serum panel.

214
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:27,244
Vast majority of all diseases don't present
with competing entities day and night.

215
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,653
- I'm just giving an idea.
- No, you're undermining mine.

216
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,156
Fine. Your idea's brilliant.
Go waste your time on it.

217
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,624
Thank you both.

218
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,525
Get an MRI to rule out tumors
and MS, an LP for encephalitis,

219
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,464
and a CSF panel to check
for paraneoplastic syndromes.

220
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,025
And a psych consult.

221
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,056
No.

222
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,567
Hi.

223
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,416
- I'm Dr. Lim, and you are?
- Trinity.

224
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,447
Where are your parents?

225
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,956
- My mother's in the maternity ward.
- She's having a baby?

226
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,122
- Already did, a girl.
- Wonderful.

227
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,521
So why the wandering?

228
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:50,370
My mom sent me to the cafeteria
to get a snack, but I got lost.

229
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,864
Three times?

230
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,847
Hey, Lucy. We're looking for, uh...

231
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,911
Trinity!

232
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,917
Please call Security.

233
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,936
- Stop the car.
- No.

234
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,438
- Yeah, I need to...
- Shaun! Shaun!

235
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,675
- I need your permission.
- No, Shaun!

236
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,393
- I need your permission.
- Let it go!

237
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,410
- It can't be over!
- You have to let Carly go!

238
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,319
- No!
- Shaun, you have to let Carly go!

239
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,702
- No!
- You have to let Carly go!

240
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,002
- It's not about Carly!
- Well, it's not about this either.

241
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,104
- It's not about Carly!
- Shaun, he's calling the police!

242
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,188
- No! Open the door!
- You'll get arrested!

243
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,489
Shaun, he's calling the police!

244
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,761
Come here! Shaun.

245
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,054
Oh, my God. Shaun, are you okay?

246
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,817
It was bad. I missed my surgery.

247
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,428
Don't worry about that.
Park's there. Everything there is fine.

248
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,488
- Will I have to go back to jail?
- No. No.

249
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,864
It's a good thing you were
with an ex-cop.

250
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,799
The guy's not gonna press charges,

251
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,034
but you're not allowed to be
near him, ever again.

252
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,576
Here. Let's get out of here, huh?

253
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,013
Park says that you're upset
about Carly.

254
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,988
Everyone keeps telling me that,

255
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,652
but I am not upset about Carly
and they need to stop.

256
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,852
Okay, so this isn't about Carly.

257
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:02,065
I wish Carly didn't break up with me,
but she did,

258
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,000
and now, I have to do what she said.

259
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,597
What do you mean, do what she said?

260
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,734
- She doesn't get to dictate to you...
- She told me to tell Lea I love her.

261
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,574
Oh.

262
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,246
Oh.

263
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,623
And you're afraid of what might happen
if you told Lea the truth?

264
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,099
If I tell her I love her...

265
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,634
and she tells me she doesn't...

266
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,204
then I can't be her boyfriend.

267
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,941
And even worse, I...

268
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,245
I don't think
I can be her friend either.

269
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,094
And what if Lea were to say...

270
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,539
"You know what, Shaun, I love you too"?

271
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,672
Hmm.

272
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:32,150
Pretty disturbing having this
weird personality creeping out of me.

273
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,457
Does he represent something
I'm suppressing

274
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,622
and need to express, or...

275
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,434
something I need to bury forever?

276
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,189
If it's any consolation,
I kind of like him.

277
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:47,197
I think he's just
trying to enjoy himself.

278
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,774
Except he's sabotaging
all the hard work of his waking self.

279
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,075
It's not sabotage,
it's just a part of who he is.

280
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,081
Some parts of who we are suck.

281
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,115
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,182
I shouldn't have ratted on you
and Melendez. I screwed things up.

283
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,793
But this guy needs a drink
every now and again.

284
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,096
- You see that?
- Yeah.

285
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,732
You have an arachnoid cyst
compressing your hypothalamus, Aiden.

286
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,235
We basically just need to drain it.

287
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,878
Will it kill me if you don't?

288
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,124
- He knows the risks.
- He knows it won't kill him,

289
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,491
which is enough for Jekyll
to decide to keep Hyde alive.

290
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,261
What if we ask Hyde?

291
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,363
I'm pretty sure consent needs to be
informed, voluntary and conscious.

292
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,031
It also doesn't matter,
Asleep Aiden's a hedonist.

293
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,232
He's not gonna make a decision
against his interest

294
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:58,140
- just to help his alter.
- Maybe he cares more than you think.

295
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,773
Okay.

296
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,680
Dr. Lim?

297
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,691
Thank you. Trinity, have a seat.

298
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,599
There's no one in our maternity ward
with a daughter named Trinity.

299
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,304
So I'm gonna need some information,

300
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,377
and it will be much more efficient
if it's the truth.

301
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,217
- First and last name.
- Trinity...

302
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,684
Mm-hm. Last name?

303
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,090
Okay. Will you at least tell me
what you're doing in this hospital?

304
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,257
I just wanted to meet you again.

305
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:07,577
Someone left a baby girl
at the ER about eight years ago...

306
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,071
on Trinity Sunday.

307
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,952
You were so tiny.

308
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,255
So sick and so helpless.

309
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,620
It killed me not to take you home.

310
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,631
But look at you now, so strong
and healthy, and fast.

311
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,039
We need to call your mother
and let her know where you are,

312
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,271
that you're okay.

313
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,774
Do you know her number?

314
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,948
Yes, but...

315
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:49,754
But?

316
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,121
Can you adopt me?

317
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,690
Shaunie.

318
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,421
You poor thing.
I'm so sorry about you and Carly.

319
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:38,068
I want to tell you how I feel.

320
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,815
I know you're hurting.

321
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,186
Carly made a huge mistake.

322
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,928
You're a wonderful man, Shaun.

323
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,401
Maybe the most wonderful man
I've ever met.

324
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,938
- Lea?
- Yeah, Shaun?

325
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,990
I found that in my mother's drawer.

326
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,633
Does she know you're here?

327
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,303
She's been in Campbell Memorial
for the last two days.

328
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,001
She thinks I've been in school,
and at a friend's.

329
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,675
As long as I'm home by 6,
no one knows the difference.

330
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,444
Mm. Well, it's past that.
I'm sure she's worried.

331
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,643
She has a new daughter.

332
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,157
It's hard to share your mom, isn't it?

333
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,428
If she loves your sister
with all her heart,

334
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,201
that doesn't feel like
it'll leave much room for you.

335
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,301
Do you love your mom
with all your heart?

336
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,973
How about your dad,
you love him with all your heart too?

337
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,409
But that doesn't seem possible, does it?

338
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,955
Hearts are amazing things.

339
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,657
I've held one in my hands many times.

340
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,363
You'd never know it
by looking at them, but...

341
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:50,334
somehow they have
all the room we need.

342
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,013
Doctor B. Please tell me you're single.

343
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,965
You have a cyst in your brain.

344
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,728
If you leave it as is,

345
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,997
it could expose you to considerable
neurological complications,

346
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,740
potential visual loss,
endocrine abnormalities, depression.

347
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:35,407
But if we drain and treat the cyst,
there should be no complications.

348
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,251
Including sleepwalking.

349
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,089
The professor
already rejected treatment.

350
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:55,766
So you're asking the frat boy
to fall on his sword for him?

351
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,366
I think the frat boy
is more than just a frat boy.

352
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,537
We're all complicated,

353
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,378
we're all sometimes superficial,
selfish jerks.

354
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,542
But we're also capable of sacrifice.

355
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:19,521
I think you live in him
the same way he lives in you.

356
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,554
And that won't change,
no matter what decision you make.

357
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,907
Shaun.

358
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,644
Maribel died.

359
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,981
I think she had
polycystic kidney disease,

360
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,175
which is associated
with dilation of the arteries,

361
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,980
which results
in weakened vascular walls,

362
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,919
which in turn contributes
to the formation of aneurysms.

363
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,048
I need to do an autopsy.

364
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,994
- Dr. Melendez...
- Didn't approve.

365
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,825
Dr. Lim didn't approve.
The family said no.

366
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,094
- So, what can I...
- You're the head of Pathology.

367
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,369
Shaun, I'm not going to...

368
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,840
I can't do what you told me
I should do...

369
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,935
until I solve this distraction.

370
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,025
No sign of polycystic kidney disease.

371
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,983
I know this breakup has been
hard on you.

372
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,509
It's been hard on me too.

373
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,514
But I know what I saw
between you and Lea.

374
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,134
I did see something, didn't I?

375
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,275
I love you, Carly.

376
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,347
But you were right, I love Lea more.

377
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,083
Okay.

378
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:43,969
So... you know
you have to tell her, right?

379
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,273
I'm scared.

380
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,476
I know.

381
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,817
But look at how far you've come with me.

382
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,483
How scared you were.

383
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,484
How brave you were.

384
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,113
I have to go.

385
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,817
Thank you, Carly.

386
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,865
If you're watching this,
it means I'm dead. Heh.

387
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:28,997
<i>And you're waking up from a surgery
you think you didn't consent to,</i>

388
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,841
<i>but I hereby proffer
my full and informed consent</i>

389
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:39,909
<i>to said surgical procedure,
signed, "Aiden Michael Porter."</i>

390
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,544
<i>The second.</i>

391
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>Uh, just one... One more thing.</i>

392
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,098
<i>My advice...</i>

393
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,362
<i>is to try to chillax a little.</i>

394
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:06,838
<i>Neither of us is perfect, but...
we're okay.</i>

395
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,685
<i>We are gonna be...</i>

396
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:19,881
<i>okay.</i>

397
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:27,830
<i>And... that girl who sits in front of you</i>

398
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,064
<i>in Advanced Calculus,
her name is Staci, with an I,</i>

399
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,601
<i>and she likes you
way more than she likes me.</i>

400
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,547
<i>Peace out, Professor.</i>

401
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,138
- You're kidding me, right?
- I know why your mother died.

402
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,936
And I said I didn't care.

403
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,744
When I examined her liver,
I found three aneurysms

404
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,074
in her hepatic artery,
which is very unusual

405
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,174
and made me realize she has
Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

406
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:23,277
It's a very rare disease that often
goes undiagnosed and can be fatal...

407
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,932
Are you gonna make me call
the police again?

408
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,323
It's hereditary. No, I don't want
to get arrested again,

409
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,984
but do you have
an excess of cavities?

410
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,689
You might have inherited
Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

411
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,924
from your mother,
and your life could be in danger.

412
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,093
But its symptoms can be treated.

413
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,632
Okay, goodbye.

414
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,972
So that's all I got from my mother...

415
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,710
a potentially deadly disease?

416
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,955
Did your mother ever call you Coley?

417
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,163
Yeah.

418
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,671
Short for <i>colibri.</i>

419
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,944
The French word for hummingbird.

420
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,648
She said I would
flit around the house...

421
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,682
always going from
one thing to another.

422
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:39,093
She had a hummingbird
tattooed on her body.

423
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,764
And "Coley" was the last word she said.

424
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,680
She loved you.

425
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,778
Maybe...

426
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,986
she was just afraid to tell you.

427
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,521
Morgan buy the fight?

428
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,224
Isn't it weird how hard we have
to work to hide a platonic friendship?

429
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,728
Very, but it's worth it.

430
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,172
Hi, Mom.

431
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,969
Shaun?

432
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,328
What's up, Shaunie?

433
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,729
Shaun...

434
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,830
please, talk to me.

435
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,880
I love you, Lea.

436
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,554
I want to be your boyfriend.

437
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,597
I love you too.

438
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,602
But...

439
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:15,944
you know me.

440
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:22,085
I am selfish and I am so, so needy.

441
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:27,050
I'm... I mean, listen to me right now,

442
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,925
I can't even put
a complete sentence together.

443
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,054
I'm a... I'm a total mess.

444
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,463
How...

445
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,459
How am I supposed to, you know...

446
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,431
just lay all of that on you?

447
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,211
Why do you think

448
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:51,413
I can't handle your selfishness,

449
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,217
neediness and messiness?
I think I can.

450
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,351
It's just...

451
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,589
I'm a challenge for anyone, and you're...

452
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,954
you.

453
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,997
And I just know
it would be too hard for you.

454
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:19,276
You need things a certain way,
you work in a certain way, and...

455
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,386
Because I have autism?

456
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,853
You...

457
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:41,463
don't want to be my girlfriend
because I have autism?

458
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,046
Oh...
