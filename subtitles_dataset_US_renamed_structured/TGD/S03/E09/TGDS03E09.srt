- I have a question for Dr. Glassman.

32
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,300
Uh, he's in the shower.
Do you wanna come on...

33
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,312
- When did his shower begin?
- He just got in.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,449
His showers are at least
nine minutes. I'd be late to work.

35
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,646

that pink roses express passion

67
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,112
Thirty-nine-year-old male, multi-car
accident. Blunt abdominal injuries,

68
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,157
including ruptured spleen
and lacerated liver.

69
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,748
- What's his GCS?
- Nine.

70
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,988
Free fluid in the right upper quadrant.

71
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,394
We need an OR stat. Page Melendez.

72
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,850
We were at our engagement photo shoot.

73
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,545
I thought it was just a migraine.

74
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,781
I get them sometimes
with the flashing lights.

75
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,323
Then she started slurring words.

76
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:20,326
I was trying to tell him that
I couldn't feel or move my left side.

77
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,760
The only thing that got me through
was Tony telling me:

78
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,661
"Okay, it will be."

79
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,635
How long before your symptoms
began to subside?

80
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,194
Half an hour. By the time we got here,

81
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,602
all I had was a mild headache.

82
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,040
I think you had
a transient ischemic attack.

83
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,775
- A mini stroke.
- A stroke?

84
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,871
- Mini.
- Jeanie's 25.

85
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,644
Which is why we'll need an MRI,
cardiac echo, and labs

86
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,448
before we know for sure.

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,686
Cauterize that bleed.

88
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,825
That's it for the liver.
What's his mean arterial pressure?

89
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,361
Sixty-seven.

90
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,831
What was that place with the
deviled oysters you took Dr. Lim to?

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,298
Oh, Mia's in town.

92
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,133
As some of you may be aware,
Dr. Lim and I are no longer together.

93
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,398
It's called Half Shell.
Downtown, off Second.

94
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,844
Remove the packing.

95
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,645
Look at the aorta.

96
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,117
Likely a laceration from the accident.

97
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,213
We'll need to dissect further
to determine the extent of the damage.

98
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,190
- BP's sky-rocketing.
- He's suffered massive blood loss,

99
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,227
he's under anesthesia,
should be hypotensive.

100
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,228
- Pulmonary embolism?
- Push beta-blockers.

101
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,991
That would... kill him.

102
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,930
He's tachycardic and hypothermic.

103
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,757
I think he must be on something.

104
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,670
MDMA mixed with anesthesia?

105
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,574
Give him a low dose of nitroglycerine
and calcium channel blockers.

106
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,850
- BP's dropping, it's working.
- Push the full dose. Close him up.

107
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,769
We're gonna have to wait for the MDMA
to leave his blood stream,

108
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,661
and get a better look
at the aorta by imaging.

109
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,896
Good call.

110
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,899
I need to use the restroom.

111
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,204
Hang in, Jeanie,
just a couple more minutes.

112
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,980
You should ask me
what I'm going to do tonight.

113
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,425
Okay, but just to make it feel
more like an actual conversation...

114
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,056
Nothing much. I've got a yoga class
and a date with Ben and Jerry tonight.

115
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,066
- How about you, Shaun?
- I'm having sex with Carly.

116
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,828
- Whoa.
- It's my first time.

117
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,234
Mazel tov.

118
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,569
It took us 22 days to kiss,
nine more to hold hands,

119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,269
although, we don't really hold hands
when we hold hands,

120
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,801
and another six to touch
more than one thing at a time.

121
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,939
- But now I'm ready.
- That's a lot of foreplay.

122
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,111
I've been reading
about the four stages of arousal...

123
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,519
Fair warning, the first time
for most people is awful.

124
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,724
Your first time was awful?

125
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,989
Not an appropriate question
to ask a colleague.

126
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,265
Although there's an exception
to every rule.

127
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,367
Which books did your lover read
to prepare?

128
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:26,840
No clots, no bleeds, no occlusions,
no PFO.

129
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,241
She didn't have a stroke.

130
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,113
She's having a seizure.

131
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,755
Pushing diazepam.

132
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,496
She had to use the restroom.

133
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,998
Her bladder is distended.

134
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,407
Whatever it's pressing against
must be causing these attacks.

135
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,479
CT shows she has two pelvic lesions.

136
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,706
Labs show elevated levels
of catecholamines.

137
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,652
The pain meds we gave her
could've distended her bladder,

138
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,985
which is abutting one of the tumors,
setting off her second attack.

139
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,547
- But what set off the first one?
- Sexual intercourse.

140
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,495
The other tumor appears to be
within her clitoris.

141
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,430
Progressive impact may have
destabilized it over time.

142
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,935
And now she's at risk
of having more seizures.

143
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,302
Sex could kill this woman.

144
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,674
He's stable and the MDMA's
out of his system.

145
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,876
We're good to go back in
and graft the aorta.

146
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,443
We're just getting caught up
with blood loss and fluid resuscitation.

147
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,079
An endovascular stent
is minimally invasive.

148
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,681
- It is a better option than a graft.
- A stent could clot off

149
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,305
because we won't
be able to get blood

150
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,196
thinners. His liver's
still a bleeding risk.

151
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,958
Let's take our chances
with the stent.

152
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,694
We can have him back in the ICU,
where we can focus on his recovery.

153
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,829
I do not want to proceed
without consent.

154
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,396
He won't regain consciousness
for another couple of hours.

155
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,135
We shouldn't wait that long.

156
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,068
Get it from his wife.
She's on her way here now.

157
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,580
We can remove the tumors.

158
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,146
But it means we also have to remove
most of your vagina and clitoris.

159
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,486
You can still have children...

160
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,751
Via C-section.

161
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,259
It won't affect your uterus
or ovaries.

162
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,491
What about sex?

163
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:29,133
You won't be able to have intercourse
or experience an orgasm.

164
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,405
It doesn't make sense. I've been
sexually active for five years,

165
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,966
never had any attacks.

166
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,104
We suspect the tumor's been dormant
for some time.

167
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,747
What if I don't have the surgery?
What are the odds of another attack?

168
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,287
There are many variables involved,
including frequency,

169
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,086
duration, sexual position,
penis size...

170
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,820
About 2 percent.

171
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,123
- Each time?
- Each time.

172
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,165
On average, couples have sex
52 times per year.

173
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,929
Which means, in the next three years,

174
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,971
your chance of having
a life-threatening attack

175
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,473
is well over 95 percent.

176
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,516
I think we'll take our chances.

177
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,479
You should talk it over
between yourselves.

178
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,118
- Perhaps with a counselor...
- I understand the situation.

179
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,189
I don't want the surgery.

180
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,743
- Hey.
- Hey.

181
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,879
Missed you at the research meeting.

182
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,043
I was in surgery, craniotomy.

183
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,084
Now I have two consults,
a meeting with a donor

184
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,680
and hospital chair meeting.

185
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,057
- Don't forget to eat something.
- Ah, food is for the weak.

186
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,388
So is waiting for this elevator.

187
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,526
- Are we okay?
- Yeah. Sorry, I'm just busy.

188
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,245
We're recommending the stent.

189
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,474
It risks clotting, but it's also
less invasive than the graft.

190
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,341
A graft would be
a more permanent repair,

191
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,513
but there's greater chance
of surgical complications.

192
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,293
I have to trust you, right?

193
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,066
- Is Dad gonna be okay?
- Oh, absolutely, darling.

194
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,407
We're gonna take care
of your dad.

195
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,237
He'll be home
before you know it, okay?

196
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,309
Okay.

197
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Thank you.

198
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,916
If we send her home
without the surgery, she'll die.

199
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,018
We don't know that.

200
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,615
And taking away sex
from a young couple in love?

201
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,117
- That's devastating.
- So is death.

202
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,591
How much time does a couple
spend having sex?

203
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,792
Nineteen minutes per week,
including foreplay.

204
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,628
The rest,
that's the real relationship.

205
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,604
Forget the act itself.

206
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,736
Sex is crucial to the happiness
and satisfaction of a relationship.

207
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,302
Sex is destructive.

208
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,644
It turns people into liars
and cheaters and idiots.

209
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,274
Might start relationships,

210
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,343
but more often than not,
it rips them apart.

211
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,145
She got devastating news

212
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,157
and made an emotional decision
without thinking it through.

213
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,352
The least we can do
is get her counseling.

214
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,986
Was she offered counseling
when you gave the diagnosis?

215
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,621
Briefly. But she was still...

216
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,828
Then it's over. Once she's stable,
discharge her. Thank you.

217
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,471
You got the pink heart
and purple star...

218
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,579
How're you feeling?

219
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,342
Hi, doctor, he's doing great.

220
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,215
Hi, I'm Dr. Browne, you had a tear
in your aorta,

221
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,290
- but we stabilized it with a stent.
- Mm.

222
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,458
Until we can give you blood thinners,
you'll be at risk of a clot,

223
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,689
so we'll be monitoring you closely.

224
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,997
But now, everything is looking
absolutely perfect.

225
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,399
- Aw.
- Gentle.

226
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,639
See, cupcake? It's all good.

227
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,609
Why didn't you come home last night?

228
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,206
Daddy had a sleepover
at Uncle Jeff's.

229
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,976
He got a new turtle,
you can see it next time.

230
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,728
Your blood pressure is responding well
to the alpha-blockers.

231
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,525
We'll run labs, if they're normal,
you can be discharged.

232
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:52,898
Thank you.

233
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,728
You'll wanna be aware at all times
of where the closest hospital is.

234
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,871
Every time you have intercourse,

235
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,344
you'll be endangering
your fiancé's life.

236
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,146
I'm aware of that. We both are.
But it's Jeanie's body.

237
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,245
It's her decision, I'm just trying
to be supportive.

238
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,750
I don't think you are.

239
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,919
You're being selfish.
She's risking her life,

240
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,087
and you're keeping your mouth shut
so you can keep getting laid.

241
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,394
You do think
I'm making the right decision?

242
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,802
Yes, I do.

243
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,081
Thanks.

244
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,218
He really is gonna be fine.

245
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,453
I know, thank you.

246
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,729
You okay?

247
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,092
I think he's cheating.

248
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,072
His brother lives in Willow Glen.

249
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,405
The other side of the city
from his accident.

250
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,333
What did he say about it?

251
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,840
That he had a breakfast meeting
with a client.

252
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,419
Not unlike the excuse he used
last time he cheated.

253
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,485
Him denying it was the worst part.

254
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,289
Made me doubt myself, you know?

255
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,725
Was I just a paranoid, jealous wife,

256
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,260
throwing out wild accusations?

257
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,100
Your husband has just had
a serious car accident

258
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,470
and you're very stressed.

259
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:49,311
Right now, all you should be
thinking about is getting him better.

260
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,444
You're right.

261
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,789
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

262
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,891
- Would you like to take my top off?
- Yes.

No.

I would like to do it myself.

Do you want to slow down?

286
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,760
Do you wanna stop?

287
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,603
I'd like to go watch some TV.

288
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,469
- So you... You weren't feeling it?
- I was definitely feeling it.

289
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,873
She... I don't know...

290
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,002
I think you're confused.

291
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,875
I think it's emotional and it's hormonal

292
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,507
- and maybe...
- I wasn't confused.

293
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,377
She had a tattoo.

294
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,110
It was half a heart.

295
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,782
I don't understand why someone
would get an incomplete tattoo.

296
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,883
She shouldn't have something
incomplete on her body

297
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,155
that I can see.

298
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,530
You sure it was the tattoo?

299
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:27,437
Yes. It is a very disturbing tattoo

300
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,303
that makes no sense.

301
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,678
Maybe it's not about the tattoo.

302
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:36,277
I mean, maybe it's about intimacy?

303
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:40,480
Letting another person into your life,
that's a big deal, I know, trust me.

304
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,615
There are gonna be things
about her that you love,

305
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,057
and things about her that, heh, you don't.

306
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,858
And there are certain things,
like the tattoo, you can't change.

307
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,232
Because...

308
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,368
Because...

309
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,571
Well, it's worth it.

310
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,806
She can get the tattoo removed.

311
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,010
She can't get the tattoo removed,
Shaun.

312
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,379
I don't think it's about the tattoo.

313
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,585
We are backed up.

314
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,245
Sorry, Shaun.

315
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,061
Okay.

316
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,260
<i>Everything looks good.</i>

317
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,897
You could've checked them
on the EMR.

318
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,403
I know. How's it going with Shaun?

319
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,004
He tends to over-share
with co-workers.

320
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,334
Yes, he does.

321
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,777
And he was over-sharing
up until this morning,

322
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,371
so I'm guessing
"the night of a thousand stars"

323
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,505
didn't go as planned?

324
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,243
We're fine. Thanks.

325
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,747
Of course. You waited three weeks
for a kiss, you're a saint.

326
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,392
That didn't sound like a compliment.

327
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,127
I like Shaun,
and I love that he's dating.

328
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,755
But I can't help thinking
the person who'd go out with Shaun

329
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,596
might be seeing him more
as a project than a person.

330
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,501
And I'd rather not see him
get his heart broken.

331
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,272
Last week, two techs called in sick.

332
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,370
I had to diagnose and file
over 200 slides.

333
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,078
But when I told Shaun, he came down
and he helped me get through them

334
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,914
until 3 in the morning.

335
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,213
I am not going out with Shaun
because I have a martyr complex.

336
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,388
I'm going out with him because
he's a great guy who treats me well.

337
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,959
And the condescending notion
that someone needs an ulterior motive

338
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,033
to be interested in him

339
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,468
means you're the one who isn't
seeing him as a person.

340
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,309
Craniotomy ended an hour
before the research meeting.

341
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,445
You didn't miss the meeting because of
surgery, it was because I was there.

342
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,614
I'm busy.

343
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,524
- I can show you my calendar if you'd like.
- You dumped me.

344
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,653
I should be the one avoiding you,
what's going on?

345
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,127
- Are you having second thoughts?
- No, I'm not.

346
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,676
Why are you willing to die for sex?

347
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,512
Sex creates vulnerability.

348
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,513
Lets you be open,
honest with each other,

349
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,184
share your biggest fears.

350
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:38,130
Sometimes you shouldn't share.

351
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,666
Sometimes you have to
just accept, right?

352
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,630
- Wrong.
- Mm.

353
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,967
What you have to accept,
that's not for anyone else to say.

354
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,907
If you don't tell your partner
everything that you're feeling,

355
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,242
thinking, worrying about,

356
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,373
then you aren't fully connected.

357
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,486
Close your eyes.

358
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,993
Yes, this is one of those
dumb sensory exercises,

359
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,325
but just go with it.

360
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,237
Now tell me one of your
favorite memories with your fiancé.

361
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,540
Last summer, we went camping
in Yosemite.

362
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,876
We decided to rough it by only
packing PB&J sandwiches.

363
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,145
The first night, a bear rips
into our tent and devours them.

364
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,520
And the next night,
we have this hole in our tent

365
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,719
and the mosquitoes just eat us alive.

366
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,390
And the bug spray that we thought
we packed, it was sunscreen.

367
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,567
When it started pouring, we turned
to each other, at the same time,

368
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,298
and we said, "Denny's."

369
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,732
Ha-ha. And that's when I knew
I wanted to marry her.

370
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,810
Great.

371
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,242
That was a memory of something
you got through together.

372
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,912
Not about the time
you had a threesome in Miami.

373
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,783
It was New Orleans.

374
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,991
The threesome was in New Orleans,
not Miami,

375
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,119
and it was way better
than the bear trip.

376
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,889
But I wasn't gonna tell
my fiancée's doctor about it.

377
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,664
Sex makes you real with someone.

378
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,169
Sex makes you stupid.

379
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,105
I had the perfect man.

380
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:34,078
He was smart and funny...

381
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,310
He squeezed the sponge
after washing the dishes.

382
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:45,451
And one night, I met some guy,
and I had a few drinks, and...

383
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,924
I got all tingly
and got really stupid.

384
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,028
Never saw him again.

385
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,464
Or my boyfriend.

386
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,664
Sex can make us feel incredibly close
to someone,

387
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,243
honest, vulnerable...

388
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,607
But sex is not the goal.

389
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,609
All the rest of those things are.

390
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,558
She's the love of my life.

391
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,459
And I always thought
that we were strong

392
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,964
and that we could overcome
anything together.

393
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,994
But without sex?

394
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,630
I don't know if we have enough.

395
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,778
Okay.

396
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,546
Then you need to lie to her.

397
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,885
Nurse said you'd be here an hour ago.

398
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,927
Yeah, well,
you're not my only patient.

399
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,799
Look, I get it. This is about
as awkward as it gets.

400
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,394
Yes, it is.

401
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,607
You know, I almost died
in that accident.

402
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:18,374
When I woke up, all I could think about
was my wife and my little girl.

403
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:22,411
How much of an ass I've been
and how hurt they'd be.

404
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,224
So why is it once I get out of here,
I'm gonna keep cheating on her?

405
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,229
I can't help it.

406
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,558
No matter how much remorse
or guilt or...

407
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,968
I feel like I always give in.

408
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,563
- Then you should leave them.
- I can't.

409
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:43,774
I love them.

410
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,574
How messed up is that, right?

411
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,476
But I think you know.

412
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,481
Yeah, well, I don't cheat.

413
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,785
I saw you checking me out in the bar.

414
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,485
My left hand.

415
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,995
Just making sure I was married.

416
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,631
You're just as big a cheater
as me, Dr. Browne.

417
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,304
My, uh, leg, it's... It's cold.

418
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,191
No pulse.

419
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,124
Your stent has formed a clot.
We need an angio, stat!

420
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:45,664
Everything okay?

421
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,638
You haven't said a word
since "pass the salt."

422
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,938
It's about Shaun, isn't it?

423
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,849
Two weeks ago, you asked me
to give him romantic advice,

424
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,478
which I didn't wanna do.

425
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,718
And then he comes into my office
for romantic advice

426
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,794
- and you kick him out.
- Because you're helping him too much.

427
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,729
- He is completely dependent on you.
- For good reason.

428
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,856
He hasn't spoken to his parents
since he was 14.

429
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:18,062
The only person he cared about
died right in front of his eyes.

430
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,999
Aaron, I know how much you love him.

431
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:26,133
How you hate to see him struggle, fail,
get hurt...

432
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,240
But you need to let him,
and it'll be okay.

433
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,147
Because he has someone else
in his life now.

434
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,215
Just like you do.

435
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,526
Placing guide wire
through the needle.

436
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:46,531
Placing catheter.

437
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,259
How do you know this guy?

438
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:54,332
You knew he was on MDMA,
been avoiding him since he arrived.

439
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:58,275
And I checked on his accident.
He was a half-mile from your place.

440
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,612
I was with him the night
before the accident,

441
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,206
but it's not relevant.
It hasn't affected my judgment.

442
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,284
Yes, it has.

443
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,678
If you hadn't been avoiding him,
we could've caught the clot earlier.

444
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,918
I figure you've been going through
something lately?

445
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,689
Something that's really hurt you?

446
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,499
And maybe it's making you
turn to things you normally wouldn't.

447
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,029
But some of the guys you meet
are gonna be trouble, be married...

448
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,802
He took a vow, not me.

449
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,378
That's the exact attitude someone had
when they helped ruin my life.

450
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,651
There's the clot.

451
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,823
Activating angiojet.

452
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,122
- It's too big to bust.
- We have to open him up.

453
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:57,094
You said accept things I don't like,
but Jeanie said I have to share everything

454
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,968
- and I don't know...
- Shaun, stop, stop, stop.

455
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,630
I have to go home.

456
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,344
I can walk you to your car.
Is it very far?

457
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:10,007
I think this will take 15 minutes,
so maybe you can drive me?

458
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,415
We have to set boundaries, okay?
We have to set some limits.

459
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:17,684
You can't just come over 6:30
in the morning for flower advice,

460
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,019
pop into my office any time you want.

461
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,118
- Is this because of Debbie?
- No. Yes.

462
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,997
And I agree with her.

463
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,628
It was different when it was
just the two of us,

464
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,970
but now we have people
in our lives, both of us.

465
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,808
We have to make them the priority.

466
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:43,441
Does this mean we can't talk anymore?

467
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,507
No, of course we can talk.

468
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,083
It's just there's a time
and a place for everything.

469
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,488
And this is the wrong time and place.

470
00:29:58,997 --> 00:29:59,997
Yeah.

471
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,971
Seven a.m., Tuesday, pancakes.

472
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:19,674
I liked it better when it was
just the two of us.

473
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,924
One-twenty-five over 78. Looks good.

474
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,538
Nice bug spray. SPF-50.

475
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,277
Not much went right that trip.

476
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,691
But the more things went wrong...

477
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,584
the closer I felt to you.

478
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,625
We'll get through this too.

479
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,565
I don't know.

480
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,602
Sex has always been our language.

481
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:25,110
Our way of sharing who we are
with each other,

482
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,617
and if we lose that...

483
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,686
What if we don't have enough?

484
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,952
We'll still have...

485
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:40,095
honesty, intimacy, love,

486
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,501
three kids, two boys and a girl...

487
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,909
I love you more than sex.

488
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,711
I love you more than sex too.

489
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:15,459
Does this mean
you're getting the surgery?

490
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,132
Yeah.

491
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:27,336
Ninety minutes without a pulse
in his leg. At high risk for necrosis.

492
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,211
Prosthetic successfully
sutured aorta.

493
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,306
Almost done with
distal right anastomosis.

494
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:34,376
Careful not to narrow the artery
during suturing.

495
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,872
Blood flow restored.
Good arterial pulse.

496
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,909
Good job catching that clot,
Dr. Browne.

497
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,501
If we waited any longer,
we'd amputate.

498
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,407
Thank you. It was a team effort.

499
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,189
Making incision
at the vaginal wall.

500
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,350
Murphy, develop margins at the lesion.

501
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,223
- Forceps.
- Nicely done.

502
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,824
How you turned your patient around.

503
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,161
It was nice when Tony told
Jeanie he loved her more than sex.

504
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,565
He was lying.

505
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,737
I told him that if he cared about her
at all, he had to.

506
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:31,904
Maybe it was the truth.

507
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,174
It can be true
without him knowing it's true.

508
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:57,935
What's wrong?

509
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:03,272
Dr. Glassman told me
I have to accept things,

510
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,776
but Jeanie said to be open
and honest.

511
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,607
I agree with Jeanie. Whoever she is.

512
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,543
It's your tattoo.

513
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,817
Thank God, I thought
you hated my boobs.

514
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
It's incomplete.

515
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,121
Didn't you have enough money
to pay for a full heart?

516
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,389
- I got this in high school.
- It's incomplete.

517
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,975
Not anymore.

518
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,813
I got you.

519
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,171
Shaun...

520
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,169
Dr. Glassman was right.

521
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,676
It's not the tattoo.

522
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:34,525
We were able to restore blood flow
to his legs. He's gonna be just fine.

523
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,557
Thank you so much.

524
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,537
Now that he's out of the woods,

525
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,838
you don't need to feel guilty
about questioning him.

526
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:48,345
All the pain, and paranoia
and self-doubt...

527
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,347
You deserve to know the truth.

528
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,051
He's just gonna deny it.

529
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,078
Then you need to insist.

530
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,369
Our relationship was a stupid idea.

531
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,944
Which made ending it a smart idea.

532
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:26,076
Simple, binary, and naive.

533
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,588
I really underestimated
how hard this would be.

534
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,227
Yes, I've been having
second thoughts.

535
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,575
I'm not saying we should
get back together.

536
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,067
What are you saying?

537
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,770
I don't know.

538
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
Good.

539
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,443
It's good to know that it's not easy.

540
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,246
It's good to know that it mattered.

541
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,824
Intimacy isn't about a tattoo.

542
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,603
And it's not about touching,
or kissing

543
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,039
or even sex.

544
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:29,678
It's about sharing your biggest fears.

545
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,916
Yes.

546
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,652
What are you scared of?

547
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,492
I love being a pathologist.

548
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:49,358
But every day I walk into the lab,
I am filled with doubt.

549
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,333
Am I smart enough?
Am I capable enough?

550
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,599
Do I really deserve to be here?

551
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,839
How long until someone walks in
and exposes my fraud

552
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,379
and has me removed from the premises?

553
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,882
Eventually, those thoughts retreat.

554
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:11,452
Until the next morning when they all
come crashing back into my brain.

555
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,290
That, and pigeons.

556
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,789
They freak me out.

557
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,090
Hmm.

558
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,732
My biggest fear...

559
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,701
is that I'll be alone.

560
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:39,007
If I don't get over this, you'll leave.

561
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,079
We don't have to have sex.

562
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,154
Can we just hold each other
for a little bit?

563
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,526
I think I'd like that.

564
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Shaun?

565
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,807
Sasha. Sash...

566
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,031
You should go.

567
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:45,038
I don't know, maybe it can wait
until tomorrow morning.

568
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,745
And you were right.

569
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,315
Everything you said was right.

570
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,482
This is different.

571
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,748
Shaun needs you.

572
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,591
Hey.

573
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,594
Your mom called from Wyoming.

574
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:22,364
Your dad's been diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer.

575
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,135
He may only have a few days left.
