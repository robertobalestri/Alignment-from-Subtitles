00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,866
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,700
<i>Message received from Mom.</i>

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,408
<i>Hey, baby, I got your text.
We're gonna celebrate.</i>

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,504
<i>I'll see you soon.
I'm so proud of you, baby.</i>

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,241
Here are flowers and chocolates.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,583
- Are you asking me out?
- Yes.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,780
I would love to.

8
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,549
Will we be doing this
during all the commercials?

9
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,149
It's possible.

10
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,112
<i>Patient came in
through the celebrity track.</i>

11
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,105
He was admitted through
the loading dock.

12
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,082
You're not to mention his name
even to colleagues.

13
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,234
- What is his name?
- Mitchell Stewart.

14
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,140
The conspiracy theorist?
That's a celebrity now?

15
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,373
A guy who thinks 9/11
was an inside job?

16
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,815
- He's an ass.
- He's an ass who needs liver surgery.

17
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,353
- Whoa. Hold it right there.
- It's okay, Dex, they're on the list.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,424
Doctors Murphy, Park, Andrews.

19
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:38,397
Mitchell Stewart. I don't blindly turn over
my well-being to those in authority,

20
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,297
so I ran background checks
on all of you.

21
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,831
Including Nurse Villanueva.

22
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,370
Nurse Villanueva is not
a person in authority.

23
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,476
People can be gotten to,
bribed, threatened.

24
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,537
And don't bother hooking up that IV
until I know what you pump into me.

25
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,412
They're normal IV fluids,
Mr. Stewart. Please.

26
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,453
I'm sure you consider whatever
you give me normal medical treatment,

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,546
but we all know doctors are pushers
in the pay of the drug companies.

28
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,717
The bag contains
an isotonic crystalloid

29
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:09,729
composed of 0.9 percent sodium chloride
dissolved in sterile water.

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,732
Also, given that
we will soon be drugging you

31
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,803
into unconsciousness
and cutting into your body,

32
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,236
don't you have to trust us a little?

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,499
You must be the autistic guy.
Good, no bull.

34
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,136
Probably doesn't know what bull is.

35
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,647
Bet your parents got one of those
combination vaccinations...

36
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:32,345
Not connected because science
does not support an autism link.

37
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,430
- Yeah, that's what they told you.

38
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,252
Mr. Stewart,
suppose we focus on

39
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,291
what we'll be doing to halt
the liver damage

40
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,054
caused by your genetic condition.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,186
Idiopathic portal hypertension
can cause ma...

42
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,390
My liver is damaged,
but that's not the cause.

43
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,490
I've been poisoned.

44
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,108
His internist heard the same theory.

45
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,187
Tox screen came back negative.

46
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,780
And KCNN-three genetic testing
confirmed the cause

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,688
of his idiopathic
portal hypertension.

48
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,227
He inherited it from his mother.

49
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,263
Worth running that tox screen again?

50
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,429
He has a web show where he claims
parents of children

51
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,765
who've died in school shootings
are crisis actors. He's earned enemies.

52
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,594
Once we start doubting the tests,

53
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,436
you can't trust anything,
and there's no point.

54
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,705
We know our patient needs liver shunt
surgery, we're doing the surgery.

55
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,801
You were late.

56
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,139
Your mom keeping you up
singing at night again?

57
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,416
No. She's been quiet.

58
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,282
Ms. Barstow, I'm Dr. Browne,
this is Dr. Reznick.

59
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,826
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Nothing much, really.

60
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,091
I feel silly for coming here,
but Jonas insisted.

61
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,429
Because you weren't getting better.
Lily likes to downplay her problems.

62
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,161
She's the rock and I'm the wimp.

63
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,396
Ah, fuss, fuss, fuss.

64
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,134
I've just been off food for a few days.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,800
You have a fever.
Most likely an infection.

66
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,084
- Oh, my God. Lily.
- Sir, please step back.

67
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,416
Lay back for me.
We're gonna do an ultrasound.

68
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,527
Her pulse is up,
blood pressure's up too.

69
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,489
Uh... Her appendix is ruptured.

70
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,293
- Oh, my God.
- Page Anesthesia. Taking her to the OR.

71
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,969
We need pre-op lab results.

72
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,611
- Patient name?
- We can't tell you.

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,576
Celebrity track. You'll find the
results under the ID number.

74
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,518
Politics, arts, business?

75
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,483
Is it the president?

76
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,215
I'll give you a hint.
He's less popular.

77
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,384
Hmm.

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,733
That's disappointing.

79
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,913
We need to figure out
why her brain

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,620
isn't getting the right distress signals.

81
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,379
How should we go about that,
Dr. Browne?

82
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,685
We do an FMRI. Stimulate
her, and see how her brain reacts.

83
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,390
Sorry. You asked Claire,
but I have lunch plans.

84
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,276
- I have a question.
- Well, hopefully it's a quick one,

85
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,503
I've cleared my schedule
for the rest of the day.

86
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,345
Debbie and I are going
to City Hall to get married.

87
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,756
Not gonna make a big fuss
out of it, you know.

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,883
Get dressed up,
turn it into a big event.

89
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,761
After all, we are not kids anymore.

90
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,769
This is where you say,
"Congratulations."

91
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,367
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

92
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,740
- Do you and Debbie hold hands?
- Yeah, why?

93
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:22,473
- Is that what Carly wants to do?
- Yes. She tried twice.

94
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,710
Have you tried to explain
why it's difficult for you?

95
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,282
- No.
- Well, I'd start with that.

96
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:34,823
How can this be important?
It's a little thing.

97
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,330
Carly and I are compatible
on so many big things,

98
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,333
children, geographic preferences,
work priorities,

99
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,404
the use of headphones,
color schemes for our home.

100
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,599
- You have a checklist?
- Yes.

101
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,338
Carly and I are still learning
about each other.

102
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,241
It's not like you and Debbie.

103
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,347
You already know these things,
or you wouldn't be getting married.

104
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,490
Four...

105
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,193
five...

106
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,497
<i>- I'm feeling some pain.</i>
- We can stop.

107
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,465
We're not getting anything.

108
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,666
She's fine. We need feedback.

109
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,544
Eight...

110
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,613
nine...

111
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,950
Claire, she's not feeling pain.

112
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,186
The only activity is in the parietal.

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,381
Nothing in the limbic, nothing
in the anterior cingulate cortex.

114
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,718
She's feeling touch.

115
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,520
- But why did she...
- My guess?

116
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,755
Because she's never felt pain.

117
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,887
She doesn't know what it is.

118
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,411
- Sleep apnea.
- What?

119
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,781
That poor guy over there,
I think he's got sleep apnea.

120
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,182
Maybe he's just tired.

121
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,314
So it's one of the most important days
of his life, and he can't stay awake.

122
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,417
Maybe you could tell him
there are treatments.

123
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,624
Me?

124
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,788
Otherwise,
he's gonna keep his wife awake

125
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,425
snoring the rest of his life.
It'll destroy their marriage.

126
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,432
You seem very sure about that.

127
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,298
There is literally no greater torture

128
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,071
than not getting a
good night's sleep.

129
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,438
Right. First, I don't think you mean
"literally" no greater torture.

130
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,708
Oh, no, it's true.

131
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,108
Once, when I was in
the Merchant Marine...

132
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,710
- Merchant Marines?
- It's "Marine." No S.

133
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,551
- You were in the Merchant Marines?
- Mm-hm.

134
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,854
And we were stationed off the Azores,

135
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,554
and every night, we were driven crazy

136
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,121
by this loud, just, like,
strangled sounds.

137
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,259
Turns out, it was just a bunch
of cagarro birds.

138
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,770
We were literally hearing the sound
of Daffy Duck drowning.

139
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,378
Of course, that was nothing comparing
to what happened in Valparaiso.

140
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,482
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,544
Are you okay?

142
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,653
Sorry. Ahem.

143
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,919
It's just I'm not feeling so good.

144
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,757
You're not feeling well?

145
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,796
- I can't do this.
- What?

146
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,436
Is that it? Are we finished?

147
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,638
Yeah, we're gonna get you out.

148
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,901
Uh, just a couple more questions.

149
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,277
Your mother died, age 66,
of a heart attack.

150
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,508
Were you there when that happened?

151
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,116
Yes, I called the ambulance.
She died while we were waiting.

152
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,317
Check the anterior cingulate cortex.

153
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:57,589
Physical pain and emotional pain
are processed through the same areas.

154
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,467
Nothing. But we don't know
how she feels about her mother.

155
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,970
It's your mother. When she goes,
there is a vacuum.

156
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,510
What about your husband?
Has he had any problems lately?

157
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,876
He had a cancer scare
about a year ago.

158
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,479
Slight activity here,
but it's pretty weak.

159
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,450
You wanna argue that she doesn't like
her mother and her husband?

160
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,554
Wow. She...

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,795
She's like a superhero.
Nothing can really hurt her.

162
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,743
Is everything okay?

163
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:51,310
Your right hand is red.
It's starting to swell.

164
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,215
What does that mean?

165
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,981
Infection.

166
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,321
Hello. Your surgery went well.

167
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,328
If there are no complications,

168
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,866
you should be discharged
in a few days.

169
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,025
Hey.

170
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,096
That's great,
but what about the big picture?

171
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,002
Once I'm out of here,
I'll go back to being poisoned.

172
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,978
You make many statements
that have been proven wrong.

173
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,205
Do you really believe them?

174
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,780
You wanna untangle
what's real and what's for show?

175
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,250
Now you're talking.

176
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,850
Okay.

177
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,623
Do you think vaccination damage
is being covered up?

178
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,032
Yes.

179
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,995
Do you think the parents of children
killed in school shootings

180
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,903
are crisis actors?

181
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,572
I can't answer for individuals,

182
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,635
but I do believe there's a force
in this country

183
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,409
that wants to scam our people
into laying down their arms.

184
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,745
But I no longer think

185
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,880
there's a paedo slave ring
in a basement under that pizza joint.

186
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,085
That was a wrong call.

187
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,894
What did you do when you realized
you'd made an error?

188
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,132
Nothing. No apologies, no admissions.

189
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,225
The second you say you were wrong,

190
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,770
they'll make it seem like
everything you know is wrong.

191
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,465
Can't give them that ammunition.

192
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:24,676
Then you're not really offering the truth.

193
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,843
Maybe if people saw you admit
you were wrong, they'd believe you more.

194
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,814
No. There is no middle ground.

195
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,785
Compromise is a scam.

196
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,757
When only one side
can get what it wants...

197
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,294
make sure it's yours.

198
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,828
We have to remove
all infected tissue immediately.

199
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,500
- Stop it from spreading.
- We discovered that Lily can't feel pain,

200
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,236
which is why the appendicitis went

201
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,279
untreated, causing
a widespread infection.

202
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,172
I can't feel pain?
That makes no sense.

203
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,011
Whatever stimulation
your nerves receive,

204
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,813
your brain doesn't acknowledge
it as pain.

205
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,083
- No, I feel pain...
- Do you? Because I'm pinching you.

206
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,021
- I feel it.
- You didn't jump or react,

207
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,717
you felt it as a touch.

208
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,488
Physical or emotional pain,
it doesn't matter.

209
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,826
Okay, let's go. OR Two.

210
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,036
Stop hiding.

211
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,470
I'm not hiding, I'm thinking.

212
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,669
Well, I've done my thinking,
and I've come up with

213
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:35,147
I deserve a better explanation
than, "I can't do this,"

214
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,480
because that was humiliating.

215
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,490
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
You're sorry?

217
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,530
What does that mean?
Are we going back tomorrow?

218
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,094
Never? What?

219
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,992
You're the one that proposed to me.

220
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,872
You're the one that told me how happy
our being together makes you.

221
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,671
It makes me happy, it does.

222
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:10,080
But when I proposed to you,
you even said, "I don't know you."

223
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,085
Is that what this is about?
Because I was...

224
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,118
Because I was in the Merchant Marine?

225
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:20,524
I mean, yes. Okay, it makes me wonder
what else I don't know about you,

226
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,425
but more importantly,
it makes me realize

227
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,931
you don't know anything about me.
I am really annoying.

228
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,592
I'm easily irritable.

229
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,967
Like when people use the word "literally"
about things that aren't literal.

230
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,041
I am impossible to live with,
maybe literally.

231
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,278
That's been made very clear to me
in the past.

232
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,916
I don't wanna go two years
and get divorced.

233
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,916
Divorcing you would hurt.

234
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,693
Thank you.

235
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,228
But that's a bunch of crap.
You know that, right?

236
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,133
We have different personal styles.

237
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,400
You like to examine things
from every angle,

238
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,273
and I like to take a leap
into the dark every now and then.

239
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,073
You're right.

240
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,284
I am not a leaper.

241
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,955
I am a toe-dipper.

242
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,954
It takes me hours to get into the ocean
when it's warm.

243
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,029
I know that you're good for me.

244
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,642
And I know that I'm good
for you, Aaron.

245
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,779
Since meeting me, you've jumped ship
from a comfortable career

246
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,339
because you decided that you
were missing something. And...

247
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,690
you asked a complete stranger
to marry you.

248
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,321
Who knows what's next?

249
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,491
I guess you'll have to keep thinking.

250
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,070
Dr. Browne, widen the debridement.

251
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,012
Extending the incisions
proximally.

252
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,211
Her husband thought she was a rock.

253
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,845
Turns out she's a rock
because nothing matters to her.

254
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,785
You're making assumptions.

255
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,919
We were monitoring her reaction to pain.
Love wasn't part of the test.

256
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,690
- You care, you hurt.
- Maybe not Lily.

257
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,768
She married this man,
she stayed with him for years.

258
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:46,238
Maybe for her, love can exist
without the pain of loss.

259
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,869
That would be paradise.

260
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,515
There is way more necrotic tissue
here than I expected.

261
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,545
She's gonna lose the hand.

262
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,785
If anyone can handle bad news...

263
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,738
- Are you going to take my hand?
- Not right now, no.

264
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,067
I don't like to hold hands.

265
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,646
Either we hold hands, or we don't.

266
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,583
There's no compromise.

267
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,113
Only one of us can get
what they want.

268
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,349
- I guess that's true...
- It should be me.

269
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,590
Holding hands makes me uncomfortable.

270
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,929
Not holding hands
doesn't make you uncomfortable.

271
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:05,244
That show we watched the other night.
It had a happy ending...

272
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,478
because they stopped
the story in a good place.

273
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:15,087
But in real life, it's gonna get dark
and cold out there.

274
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,094
All we have...

275
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,189
is this.

276
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:26,901
This says we're in it together,
we've got each other's back.

277
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,701
That we'll hold each other up
for as long as we can.

278
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,808
I can say all those things verbally.

279
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:43,185
You could shout them,
and it wouldn't say it as loud as this.

280
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,619
You said not holding hands wouldn't
make me uncomfortable, but it would.

281
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,661
I would feel...

282
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,560
separate.

283
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:34,973
It's all right.

284
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,548
You've actually been lucky,
considering you have no warning system.

285
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,686
You need to be doing self-checks.
Knees, feet, elbows, hands.

286
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,020
Look for bruises, discolorations,

287
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:02,432
anything at all that changes
could be dangerous, life-threatening.

288
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,972
But there's another option. Naloxone
affects the central nervous system.

289
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,134
It's been shown to block the action
of pain-lowering endorphins.

290
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,541
It could give you the ability
to feel pain.

291
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,910
I don't see the point,
I've been fine so far.

292
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,541
Guess that sounds silly,
I just lost a hand.

293
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:23,112
But now I know about checking myself,
and I'll be a lot more careful.

294
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,034
Why is one gesture so important?

295
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,605
- Carly still pushing you to hold hands?
- No.

296
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:47,579
I tried, and she said it was all right.

297
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,739
Huh.

298
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,512
You should give me context
for that "huh."

299
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,489
She wants it, she's just given up.

300
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,491
Good.

301
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,121
Not if it's gonna bother her
the rest of your relationship,

302
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,256
which may not be very long.

303
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,435
Huh.

304
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,608
Uh-oh.

305
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,791
We need to do imaging to make sure
the problem isn't the shunt.

306
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,511
Check there isn't a clot
causing backup...

307
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,018
The surgery was a success,
but I'm still being poisoned?

308
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,318
No. The surgery was a success,
but your liver's still deteriorating.

309
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,390
We don't know why.

310
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,023
Jen, check me out.
Find another hospital.

311
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,291
I can't approve that.
You're in no condition to leave.

312
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,977
You've just confirmed that someone
in this hospital is poisoning me.

313
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,970
You want me to cooperate
with the suspects?

314
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,801
Another hospital
wouldn't solve your problem.

315
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,801
People can be gotten to,

316
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,902
bribed, or threatened.

317
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,511
- Right. Someone here wants to kill me.
- No one is trying...

318
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,316
Let's constrain some of these variables.
One person touches me.

319
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,183
Him.

320
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,427
- He doesn't know how to lie.
- I can lie.

321
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,520
Yes, but not successfully.
Good choice.

322
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,697
- Will I be able to play tennis?
- Yes, eventually.

323
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,671
Funny, I never could before.

324
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,438
You always take things well.

325
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,242
We had to pick up
and move from Durham.

326
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,413
Well, that was for your job.
No sense in moping about it.

327
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,084
The miscarriage.

328
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,398
You never talked about it, so...

329
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,793
I never talked about it.
Didn't wanna hurt you.

330
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,802
But did you not talk about it...

331
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,701
because you just
weren't thinking about it?

332
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,300
What are all these questions for?

333
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,945
I thought we were carrying the load...

334
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,642
together, knowing how each other felt.

335
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,478
This isn't about us.

336
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,983
This is just a medical condition.

337
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,990
If I died, would you care?

338
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,395
Would you miss me? Or, uh...

339
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,732
would you just...

340
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,763
move on?

341
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,604
Would you want me to be miserable?

342
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,441
- I want it to matter.
- Of course it matters.

343
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,973
You know I love you.

344
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,489
Jonas...

345
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,223
Maybe...

346
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,861
you think it's love, but...

347
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,586
it's like the pain.
It just doesn't go that deep.

348
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,599
Isn't it possible for me to love you

349
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,532
without it being
all wrapped up in suffering?

350
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,535
But that's how it works.

351
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,329
When you lose someone...

352
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,842
it shouldn't be like your hand,
it should ache.

353
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,015
That's right, isn't it?

354
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,947
That's what loss feels like.

355
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,398
I need to get away for a while.

356
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,999
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:40,836
Next, we're going to test you for
autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver.

358
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,883
Those are diseases
whose symptoms overlap yours.

359
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,249
They might have been masked by
your idiopathic portal hypertension.

360
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,515
Nurse Villanueva, welcome,
but you know I'm not gonna touch that.

361
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,356
The dietician ordered it,
and I'm required to bring it.

362
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,924
What are you eating
if you're refusing hospital food?

363
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,501
Uh...

364
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,697
Eighty grams of protein a day.
Kale, baby greens.

365
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:06,828
Hey.

366
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,741
"Leopard Spring."

367
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,371
Jen, Dex, you mind stepping out?

368
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,317
It's Chinese herbs.

369
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:27,359
To make you feel younger,
more energetic, more virile.

370
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,084
You don't feel virile?

371
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,959
Of course, but there's nothing wrong
with feeling more virile.

372
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,588
I need strength for the fight.

373
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,861
You're not talking.
Is there a problem?

374
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,539
No, these herbs are harmless.

375
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,444
- You asked about my virility.
- I was curious.

376
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,647
We're going to test you for
autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver.

377
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,751
- What's up?
- I tested a patient

378
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,620
for autoimmune
hepatitis and fatty liver.

379
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,318
What's up with you?

380
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,623
Our patient decided
to take the drugs.

381
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,955
Because a husband walking out
can make an impression

382
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,126
even on a woman
who feels no pain.

383
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,063
- It's a lot of paperwork for two tests.
- They were negative.

384
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,075
I thought I might find something

385
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,941
in his mother's old records
that could help,

386
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,777
but, no, her case was straightforward.

387
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,941
His parents were both alcoholics,

388
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,748
but her liver was already
weakened by her condition.

389
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,748
Parents both alcoholics?

390
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,986
No wonder he thinks people in authority
like to deny the truth.

391
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,992
He's grown up now, Claire.
No longer in that position.

392
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,029
There's still plenty of lying
going on in the world.

393
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,625
That's not a situation you outgrow.

394
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,206
Yes, there is a lot of lying.

395
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:59,345
Want to hear my theories?
Fight with your mother is number one.

396
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,818
You're debating
whether to throw her out.

397
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,554
This explains what?

398
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:08,684
Why the compassionate Doctor Browne
envies a woman who feels no pain.

399
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,192
You're miserable, torn,

400
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,460
you don't know what to do
to make your pain go away.

401
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:21,435
Want to hear my theory?
People that aren't you are doing great...

402
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:25,137
so you're looking for a toy to break,
a pet you can torture.

403
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,854
- Is she in pain?
- No.

404
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,186
- What are her vitals?
- Vitals are fine.

405
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,854
- Then how can she be in crisis?
- I don't know, but she is.

406
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,397
Lily?

407
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,561
Are you okay?

408
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,005
Lily?

409
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,341
I never noticed how
ugly the walls are.

410
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,958
I've discovered the cause
of your liver problem.

411
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,396
Really? Fatty liver? Autoimmune?

412
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,958
- I've never had symptoms of...
- No, you were being poisoned.

413
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,605
What? Who? Do you know who? How?

414
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:33,106
I thought maybe the dose of herbs
listed on the bottle was wrong...

415
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,546
- There's a toxic dose in there?
- No, there are no herbs at all in here.

416
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,140
It contains sildenafil.

417
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:45,213
It's the active element in Viagra.
It promotes blood flow in your penis.

418
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,752
I know what it does.

419
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,156
- They say it's natural herbs.
- They lied.

420
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,029
Your idiopathic portal hypertension

421
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,232
means your liver
is vulnerable to abuse.

422
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,003
The amount of sildenafil in here
wouldn't kill most people,

423
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,637
but if someone with pre-existing
liver issues took it every day...

424
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,939
You were right.
You've been poisoning yourself.

425
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,186
It's good news.

426
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,596
Those communist bastards.

427
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,793
I think they're based in San Pedro.

428
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,634
Mr. Barstow.

429
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,370
- Is Lily all right?
- She's on medication

430
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,376
to reverse her pain-free condition,
but it's hit her hard.

431
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,703
She's being wrung out by all
the negative thoughts and feelings

432
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,078
the rest of us have built calluses against.

433
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,779
But she made the right choice.
I mean, she needs this to be safe.

434
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,850
I don't think she's doing this to be safe,

435
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,049
I think she's doing this
because you walked out.

436
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,293
Why?

437
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,023
You were happy for years.

438
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,032
Now you can't be happy
unless your wife changes?

439
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,599
I want her to feel everything I feel.

440
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,874
The love, the pain, everything.
Wouldn't you?

441
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,709
The residents in this hospital
work long hours. Know why?

442
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,980
The surgeons in charge worked
long hours when they were residents.

443
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,680
They suffered, so we have to suffer.
It's human nature.

444
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,740
- What does...
- For someone like your wife,

445
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,122
so invulnerable, it's like she's
gotten away with something.

446
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,421
It's hard not to resent her.

447
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,355
Sure, we wanna cure her,
but how much of it

448
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,763
is to give her a warning system,
and how much is because

449
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,528
we wanna pull her down into hell
with the rest of us?

450
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,610
Are you married now?

451
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,782
No. I chickened out.

452
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,686
Apparently, I don't like change.
Makes me very nervous.

453
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,791
I'm not the easiest man in the world
to live with.

454
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,399
My first wife made that very clear.

455
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,962
It's true, you can be very irritating.

456
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,104
You saying I shouldn't get married?

457
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,116
Are you asking for my advice?

458
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,587
Yes.

459
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,826
You've never really asked before...

460
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:40,626
and this is an important decision.
Your happiness depends on it.

461
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,702
This is huge.

462
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,508
Well?

463
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,779
Oh. I don't have any advice.
I don't even understand the issue.

464
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,079
I also don't understand why you asked

465
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,347
when you've already
made up your mind.

466
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,486
What?

467
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,250
You usually call her your ex-wife.

468
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,988
You just called her your first.
It implies a second.

469
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,671
Why are you staring in your trunk?

470
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,205
Something in here?
The answer to your problem?

471
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:33,517
Yoga mat, gym bag, extra sneakers.

472
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,487
Here's a little earthquake kit,
so sensible. Dirty towel.

473
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,558
- Ooh, what's this?
- Put it back.

474
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,970
It's my mom.

475
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,068
Why are you jumping?

476
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,537
I'm not jumping, I'm leaping.

477
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,176
Come on. Come leap with me.

478
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,206
We both can't leap on that thing.

479
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,337
Oh!

480
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,945
Are you okay?

481
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,753
Never better.

482
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:47,356
Will you leap with me to City Hall?

483
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:51,021
Yes, I will.

484
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,056
Also, I may have done
something to my ankle.

485
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:58,597
- Do you want me to call someone?
<i>- Je ne regrette</i> nothing, baby.

486
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:11,447
I left the champagne
because I was so ready for victory.

487
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,621
Now I don't even know what
to do with the damn ashes.

488
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,718
Leave them on a shelf in the closet
with the spare towels?

489
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,659
Put them down the disposal?

490
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:27,096
- What did she want done with them?
- It was stupid, I'm sure she was joking.

491
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,361
Yeah, everyone jokes in their will.

492
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,230
The Marine Science Center.

493
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,600
She loved sea lions.

494
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:42,056
She'd take me to see them
all the time, it was a thing.

495
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,312
Any city we were in,
"I wonder if they have sea lions."

496
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,283
You need to do it. Now.

497
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,083
No. No. It is a pointless gesture

498
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,251
because my mother is dead
and she doesn't care.

499
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,187
Perfect. The center's open
this evening for an after-hours event.

500
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,798
We'll have to dress up.

501
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,296
The winner of tonight's vote
for most fabulous sea creature,

502
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,467
the vampire squid.

503
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,217
- I feel ridiculous.
- You look great.

504
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,685
You could give the vampire squid
a run for her money.

505
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,346
Now, let's find the sea lions.

506
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,993
- You came back.
- Yeah.

507
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,846
Thank God.

508
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,525
We'll stop this, it'll be all right.

509
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,894
Doctor, you gotta get this stuff
out of her IV.

510
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,033
You don't need it.

511
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,034
If you have to be careful
about getting hurt,

512
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,037
I'll be there to help you.

513
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,104
The "stuff" was removed
some time ago.

514
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,778
Before Dr. Browne went off-shift,

515
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,509
she told me that Lily
was experiencing some problems,

516
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,245
so I thought it best to discontinue
the medication for a while.

517
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,079
She's as she was when you left her.

518
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,352
You never cry.

519
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,000
When I saw you sitting there...

520
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,700
I've never been so happy
in my whole life.

521
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,118
I thought you didn't
want to make a fuss.

522
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,222
Yeah. Who knew?

523
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,590
This seems weird.

524
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,294
It is weird.

525
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:54,628
Most people have some kind of ritual
all ready for them,

526
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,471
so they don't have to think about
this kind of stuff.

527
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,111
You got a prayer?

528
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,311
Not religious. Neither was my mom.

529
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,478
Everybody has a religion.

530
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,655
Not everybody has a god,
but everybody has a religion.

531
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,527
Music.

532
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,236
Your mother's religion was music.

533
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,374
Sing.

534
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,171
By the sea lion colony
at a drag pride party?

535
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,848
Or you can just dump it out
and feel weird.

536
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:45,222
Your call.

537
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,377
Amaz...

538
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,383
