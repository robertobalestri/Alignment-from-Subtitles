1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,767
I followed Gordon Ramsay's recipe
for the perfect scrambled eggs.

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,007
Thank you. This looks amazing.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,008
Except I cut the tomatoes in half.

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,813
The recipe says to sautÃ© them whole,

5
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:20,286
but I once had a patient
who almost choked to death on a...

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,354
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,583
These are perfect.

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,560
I'm glad you like your breakfast.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,332
I read that if I made you feel loved
and cared for,

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,029
it could help us work out
your insecurity...

11
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,336
over my friendship with Lea.

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,437
Aw, Shaun...

13
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,578
you don't have to do
any more research.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,842
I am fine with you and Lea
being friends.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,542
But you can keep making me eggs
any time you want.

16
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,732
You're late.

17
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,264
I made Carly a special breakfast
this morning,

18
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,363
and then she wanted to have sex...

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,133
so we did.

20
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,600
That's great, Shaun.

21
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,704
Next time feel free just to say
you missed the bus.

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,712
Women don't like it
when you kiss and tell.

23
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,617
- Even though they do it all the time.
- Not at work.

24
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,450
Apparently you've never been
in the nurses' break room.

25
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,624
- What were you doing there?
- Delivering doughnuts.

26
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,627
Best lesson I learned as a cop,
"better to feed down than kiss up."

27
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,662
Oh, it's my fault
we haven't started our rounds.

28
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,226
I missed the bus.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,870
It's all right.

30
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,001
I'm glad you're all here...

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,101
because I want to apologize.

32
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,176
Dr. Lim told me she received
a complaint about me playing favorites.

33
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,785
She obviously
didn't reveal any names,

34
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,289
but I want to assure you all
that I don't have any favorites,

35
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,690
and if I did anything
to give that impression...

36
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,496
it's my mistake.
It won't happen again.

37
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,758
We're a team,

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,092
and we need to be
able to communicate...

39
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,003
and trust each other
in order to be our best.

40
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,042
So in the future,
if you have any concerns,

41
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,008
you can come to me directly.

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,145
Absolutely.

43
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,547
<i>She got blindsided.</i>

44
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,116
Thank God a woman had pepper spray,
or the dog would've killed her.

45
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,128
- Brave.
- Loosen the tourniquet.

46
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,364
Oh. Okay.

47
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,828
We need an OR, stat.

48
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,573
- Page Dr. Melendez.
- Right away, doctor.

49
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,730
Start empiric antibiotics. I'm gonna guess
this dog wasn't big on flossing.

50
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,306
Ha-ha. On it.

51
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,434
Wasn't that funny.

52
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,808
Doughnuts,
best 10 bucks you'll ever spend.

53
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,822
Cory's upper trachea
never fully developed in the womb,

54
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:15,351
his upper airway is totally blocked,
and he has no larynx at all.

55
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,755
The trach tube he needs to breathe

56
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,231
continues to cause reoccurring
infections and pneumonias.

57
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,403
He says, "It tickles
when you touch his neck."

58
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,003
Sorry, not much I can do about that,
but I'll make it quick.

59
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,740
Why are you signing?
He's mute, but he's not deaf.

60
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,978
It helps us stay mindful
of what he's going through.

61
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,225
What did he say?

62
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,525
He says, "When we get mad,
we don't sign, we yell."

63
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,261
"And when we play soccer together."

64
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,498
So keep your room clean,
and pass your dad the ball,

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,368
then they won't have to yell.

66
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,100
His lungs are clear,
and I don't see any sign of infection.

67
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,209
Thank God.

68
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,269
The better news is he's a good candidate
for the surgery we discussed.

69
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,807
Yes, it seems a bit experimental.

70
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,907
It's shown great results.

71
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,383
If we can excise the scar tissue,
open up the airway,

72
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,550
he still won't be able to talk,
but he'll be able to breathe normally.

73
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,588
It's a complicated procedure,

74
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,528
but given the severity
of the infections he's been dealing with,

75
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,089
I think it's definitely
the best option.

76
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,972
He'll do anything to get rid of
the tube sticking out of his neck.

77
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,542
And you two?

78
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,987
Okay, now you're yelling.
We hear you.

79
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,159
What do you think?

80
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,124
Let's do it.

81
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,469
Fran?

82
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,072
Fran, I'm Dr. Melendez.
This is Doctors Park and Browne.

83
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,078
You were attacked by a dog,
almost bled to death. Do you remember?

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,147
Yes.

85
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,617
We repaired
a severed artery in your arm.

86
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,452
So...

87
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,148
am I okay now?

88
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,854
The surgery went well.

89
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,658
Dr. Park?

90
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,626
We stopped the bleeding,
which caused you to go into shock,

91
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,386
but we still need to go back in.

92
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,965
Stabilize the shattered bone,
repair nerve damage,

93
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,467
and do skin and tissue grafts.

94
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,363
But after that?

95
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,041
I'm a firefighter,
I need my full strength.

96
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,977
With plenty of physical therapy,

97
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,512
we should be able to get you
pretty close.

98
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,492
It must be hard
for him to communicate.

99
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,324
My friend's daughter
took a signing class at summer camp.

100
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,522
Picked it up pretty fast.

101
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,034
Non-verbal communication
is definitely more confusing.

102
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,263
That's why Carly and I
always talk out our problems.

103
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,862
Sorry to break it to you, Murphy,

104
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,170
but it doesn't matter
how explicitly Carly speaks.

105
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,336
She's saying a lot more silently,

106
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,209
and it's often the opposite
of what she said out loud.

107
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,078
Why would Carly lie?

108
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,645
It's not lying.
It's communicating indirectly.

109
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,255
Everyone does it,
but women way more than men.

110
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,254
- Most of the time we don't realize it.
- That sounds sexist.

111
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,195
You gonna report me to HR,
or listen and learn?

112
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,929
Has she ever told you she didn't want

113
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,799
to have sex because
she had a headache?

114
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,903
No.

115
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,065
I thought you didn't want
to hear about my sex life.

116
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,173
Fine.

117
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,070
But if you ever get
the feeling she's upset,

118
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,113
and she insists nothing's wrong...

119
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,408
something's wrong.

120
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,989
The humerus isn't broken, it's...

121
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,290
pulverized.

122
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,957
Who do you think complained to Lim?

123
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,761
No idea.

124
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,822
And we're gonna need
internal fixation,

125
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,833
with locked intramedullary nailing
to stabilize the fractured pieces.

126
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,095
It must be Morgan.

127
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,734
- She's always looking for an advantage.
- Let's focus on the patient.

128
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,775
You can start your whistleblower
investigation as soon as we're done.

129
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,205
How does she expect us to trust her,

130
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,075
if whenever something
doesn't go her way,

131
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,776
- she goes to the boss, and...
- It wasn't Morgan. It was me.

132
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,318
Why?

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,912
You're the least competitive
of all of us.

134
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:36,820
That's not true,

135
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,415
and I didn't do it to help me,
I did it to help you.

136
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,229
If people see
you're getting special treatment,

137
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,355
even if it's not your fault,
they'll resent you.

138
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,626
I'm not getting special treatment...

139
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,361
and I don't need your protection.

140
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,663
Fine, my mistake.

141
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,600
So you can yell at me,
or we can get back to work.

142
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,643
Just what the doctor ordered.

143
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,185
- What?
- You.

144
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,880
I need a double dose of Shaunie,
stat.

145
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,618
Glassy is driving me crazy.

146
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,894
I mean, what is it with old people
and technology?

147
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,125
- Mm.
- Don't worry, I just need to vent,

148
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,997
and I'll scram if Carly comes.

149
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,865
It's okay.

150
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,462
I think Carly's not insecure
about you anymore.

151
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,537
Really? That's awesome.

152
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,009
I added the "I think"

153
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,505
because Morgan thinks women
sometimes say

154
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,049
the opposite of what they think,

155
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,586
but I don't think Carly would hide
what she thinks.

156
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,915
What do you think?

157
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,983
Look, nobody always says
what they think.

158
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,556
So Morgan's right?

159
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,064
- Except for the sexist part?
- No.

160
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,897
I think Carly is very in tune
to how you communicate.

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,176
If she was unhappy,
I'm sure she wouldn't hide it.

162
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,711
Yes, I agree.

163
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,046
Lunch is over.
We have a surgery to do.

164
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,847
Hey, Morgan, love your boots.

165
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,087
- Thanks, love your sweater.
- Thanks.

166
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,330
Nice work.

167
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,966
Look at that.

168
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,094
On the bone, teeth marks.

169
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,335
Must've been a huge dog.

170
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,206
During no-knock searches,
I was more afraid of dogs than guns.

171
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,272
Gangsters have horrible aim,
but their dogs never miss a target.

172
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,372
- Which was our crotches.
- Damn.

173
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,418
- How many times they get ahold of you?
- Never,

174
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,080
- another benefit of martial arts training.
- You kicked the dogs?

175
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,988
Like I needed a 60-yard field goal
to win the Super Bowl.

176
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,724
That's awful.

177
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,591
- It's self-defense.
- Totally.

178
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,660
I need 9-0 nylon micro sutures.

179
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,892
Next step is to suture
in the interposition graft.

180
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,427
Dr. Park's doing great.
Might as well continue.

181
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,474
- I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty.
- Let's see how Park does with this first.

182
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,744
Make sure your stay sutures
are at six and 12 o'clock.

183
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,787
- You are very efficient.
- And you're very clever.

184
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,628
Intro-ing your insult
with a compliment.

185
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,396
Your "helping me out" appears
to have conveniently helped you out.

186
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,904
I was expecting worse.

187
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,101
Melendez is bending over backwards
to avoid anything that might convey

188
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,110
the slightest bit of appreciation
for my work.

189
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,976
Because it couldn't possibly be
I was doing a better job.

190
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,481
Right, you're probably
buying him doughnuts too.

191
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,715
I did what I thought needed to be done,

192
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,720
and you're accomplishing nothing
by continuing to badger me about it.

193
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,218
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're welcome, child.

194
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,229
The boy's
obstructed cricotracheal segment

195
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,492
looks bigger than
what we saw on imaging.

196
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,365
I chose to be aggressive
with resection.

197
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,301
Murphy,
flex the neck to mobilize the ends,

198
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,964
and reduce tension on the anastomosis.

199
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,800
You sure we're gonna be able
to cinch it closed?

200
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,242
Not "we," You. Step on up.

201
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,810
4-0 vicryl sutures
on a needle driver.

202
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,984
Place lateral traction sutures
at the proximal and distal airway.

203
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,495
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's just I...

204
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,695
I hit my finger with a hammer.

205
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,530
I was trying to hang a painting.

206
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,601
Murphy, take over.

207
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,380
- It's all right, I can...
- Move.

208
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,863
You're a surgeon, not a hockey player,
we don't play through injuries.

209
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,980
Next time, hire a handyman.
Those fingers are your livelihood.

210
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,683
Got it.

211
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,125
I know Carly says
she's not jealous anymore,

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,424
but based on what I saw at lunch,
maybe she should be.

213
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,930
I think Murphy's old enough
to handle his own girlfriend trouble.

214
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,128
I don't have any girlfriend trouble.

215
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,729
Eating off the plate
is the oldest trick in the book.

216
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,741
Lea was hungry.

217
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,038
It looked more like she was claiming
territory than satisfying hunger.

218
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,105
Might as well have peed on your leg.

219
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,945
You, shut up,

220
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,576
and you, keep a smaller gap
between sutures.

221
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,782
We're gonna need a solid anchor
to get the anastomosis airtight.

222
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,659
That's better, good job.

223
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,060
- Good work today.
- Thanks.

224
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,728
- See you tomorrow at the track.
- I, uh...

225
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,765
I wanted to talk to you about that.

226
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,665
We can't do this anymore.

227
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,243
It's...

228
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,241
It's just a run at a public track.
We're not meeting at a hotel.

229
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:05,683
I just shouldn't be socializing
with residents outside of work.

230
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,982
- Any of you.
- Neil...

231
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,620
I've been going through a tough time.

232
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,492
Our friendship... having someone
I can talk to, it helps.

233
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,586
I'm not abandoning you.

234
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,093
I'll be there to support you at work.

235
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,459
You've got your therapist,
you're gonna be fine.

236
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,766
This is exactly why women have such
a hard time finding mentors.

237
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:30,674
No one questions when guys hang out,
but any time a woman wants to build

238
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,269
a totally appropriate relationship
with a male colleague,

239
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,575
the stupid rumors start.

240
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,847
I agree...

241
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,182
but the rumors have started.

242
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,297
I'm gonna plug the trach tube,
and I want you to try to take a breath.

243
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,803
Nice and easy.

244
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,256
He says it hurts, but it's
the best feeling he's ever had.

245
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,067
<i>What's wrong?</i>

246
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,908
You don't like it?

247
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,573
It's delicious.

248
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,781
I hear delicious,
but I see disappointed.

249
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,847
It's not...

250
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,447
the chicken, it's my patient.

251
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,358
We fixed his airway,

252
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,861
and he can breathe
without the trach now.

253
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,025
- That's fantastic.
- But he still can't talk.

254
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,858
He can talk.
He just does it with his hands.

255
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,393
Mm. But only with people
who can also sign,

256
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,804
and they have to be looking at him,
and...

257
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,773
Could you do
a cadaveric larynx transplant?

258
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,777
- No.
- I've heard that's worked

259
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:15,371
- for some throat cancer patients.
- No. Dr. Lim ruled that out years ago.

260
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,885
The risk of tissue rejection
is too great in a child his age.

261
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,614
- Well, could you wait till he's older?
- No!

262
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,822
If he doesn't learn to speak soon,
he'll never be able to.

263
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:29,961
Okay.

264
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,326
I need to do some reading.

265
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,269
Come on, Shaun,
at least eat something first.

266
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:45,071
No, I'm hungry,
but I will do the reading first.

267
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,652
You're in early.

268
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,262
What's the haps?

269
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,993
Are you serious?

270
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,300
I didn't even know Michelle Obama
was in SEAL Team Six.

271
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:51,867
You noticed how Glassy grinds
his teeth listening to someone talk?

272
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,709
- It's like a cow chewing on her...
- You never used to do that.

273
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:55,981
Do what?

274
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,043
Eat food off my plate.

275
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,518
I used to work full-time at a place
with private chefs.

276
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,317
Now I work part-time in a place

277
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,324
with hard-boiled eggs
in a vending machine.

278
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,054
She said it's like you're peeing
on my leg.

279
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,195
Expand on that.

280
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,864
Morgan thinks your body language says

281
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,870
you're trying to assert
your dominance over Carly.

282
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,906
Morgan is one twisted beyotch.

283
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,172
Is she right?

284
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
No.

285
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,807
Not even close.

286
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:28,078
I promise you my voice
and body language

287
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,944
are communicating the same thing,

288
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,453
which is pure,
non-threatening, platonic friendship.

289
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,617
Shaun?

290
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,061
He also snores.

291
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,393
- Really loud.
- Glassman?

292
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,591
Oh. I have to go.

293
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,239
Okay.

294
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,243
Hmm. Incision sites look good,

295
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,384
and skin and tissue grafts appear
to be taking hold nicely.

296
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,916
We were able to reattach
your bicep muscle and tendon.

297
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,356
That's good to hear.

298
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,484
Can you lift your arm?

299
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,456
No, I can't.

300
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,861
Because it hurts too much?

301
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,302
It doesn't hurt at all.

302
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,574
I figured that was
because of the meds.

303
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,747
You feel that?

304
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,283
No.

305
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,127
Vocal cords aren't the only way

306
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,028
a person can create sounds
with their mouth.

307
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,431
You want the kid to learn to
burp his way through his conversation?

308
00:18:55,501 --> 00:19:00,769
Mm. I don't think it would be possible
to sustain enough air output to...

309
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,309
- It was a joke, Murphy.
- Oh.

310
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,905
Snoring is a better model anyway.

311
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,040
Soft palate tissue vibrates,
making the sound when people snore,

312
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,229
but it's not stiff enough
to replace the vocal cords,

313
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,216
but we could use
his own costal cartilage

314
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,949
to act as vocal cords.

315
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,486
The larynx is a complicated piece
of anatomy.

316
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,187
Basically, a tiny musical instrument.

317
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,662
We can remove two of his ribs
to create

318
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,666
the anterior
and posterior larynx frame,

319
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,328
and then stretch
the cartilage across it.

320
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,235
And then cut open a trachea we worked
so hard to close?

321
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,831
We could destroy
everything we just fixed.

322
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,208
Yes.

323
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,541
I think it's worth the risk.

324
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,074
Because you're thinking
the kid's like you.

325
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,674
That he needs to speak out loud
to be understood.

326
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,047
She's right.

327
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,059
The larynx is like
a musical instrument...

328
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,195
but if Bo Diddley can make a guitar
out of a cigar box,

329
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,325
I'm pretty sure I can make a larynx
from bone and cartilage.

330
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,897
Oh.

331
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,337
Absolutely not.

332
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,241
He's finally healthy.
There's no need to take any more risks.

333
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,175
You're right,
there are definitely risks,

334
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,976
but I wouldn't present the option
if we couldn't manage them.

335
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,074
Couldn't we wait
until he's a few years older?

336
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,244
I assume the stronger he is,
the safer it is.

337
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,880
Most verbal language development
happens within the first eight years.

338
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,788
Cory's already 10.

339
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,893
If we wait any longer, he may not be able
to learn to speak even with a larynx.

340
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,896
He can communicate without speaking.

341
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,565
- You're making a big mistake.
- Murphy...

342
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,537
He'll always be... limited.

343
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,772
It'll be difficult to make friends,
to interact with strangers.

344
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,310
Murphy, that's enough.

345
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,810
They're aware of their options,
and they've made their decision.

346
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,030
The suture repair looks fine,

347
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,230
which makes me think
the nerve got compressed

348
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,170
between the bone and the dog's teeth.

349
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,333
It's too wide to repair with a graft.

350
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,071
What if we built a nerve conduit
out of silicone and polyglycolide?

351
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,809
We could guide the severed nerve ends
to grow toward each other.

352
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,715
Create a pathway for them
to connect and heal.

353
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,151
I'm not sure the nerves can grow
across that distance.

354
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,619
It's definitely worth a try.

355
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,918
We can't just
experiment on her like a lab rat.

356
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,982
We can't just sit back
and do nothing.

357
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,857
I'm not saying do nothing,
we just can't experiment on her blindly.

358
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,123
Maybe we could use donor tissue
to bridge the gap.

359
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,428
That means putting the patient
on a transplant list.

360
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,094
Who knows how long
before she gets a viable donation?

361
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,628
Firehouse won't hold her position
until she heals. She'd lose her job.

362
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,369
First you want to treat her like a guinea
pig, now you're concerned about her life?

363
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,342
- You just want to be right.
- And you don't?

364
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,979
Are you going to step in
at any point?

365
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,345
I think Park's idea has
the best chance of success.

366
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,515
Get her prepped.

367
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,332
Do you really think his idea is better,

368
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,962
or do you not wanna look
like you're biased?

369
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,366
I'm not happy
about this situation either,

370
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,205
but you're overreacting.

371
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,211
Get it under control,

372
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,748
or you're watching from the gallery.

373
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,322
Hi.

374
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,490
Hey.

375
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,347
Do you have a problem with me
staying friends with Shaun?

376
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,907
I know you've told him
you're fine with it, but are you?

377
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,380
Yes.

378
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,581
Really?

379
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,957
I mean, I'm totally glad you are.

380
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,358
It's great.

381
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,785
I'm not sure I would be
if I were in your shoes.

382
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,424
If it was any other guy,
I probably wouldn't be.

383
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,667
But Shaun, he always tells the truth.

384
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,766
So when he told me
he's not interested in you, I believe him.

385
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,543
Okay.

386
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,444
You told the residents
not to come to me?

387
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,824
No, that's not at all what I said.

388
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,888
You didn't tell them,

389
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,192
"Next time you have a problem,
come to me directly"?

390
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,791
I was encouraging open communication
and trust on my team.

391
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,097
What I have is ambitious residents

392
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:02,231
struggling to figure out how to be
cooperative as well as competitive.

393
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,504
You're not helping them figure it out

394
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,103
by suggesting they resist taking
complaints up the chain of command.

395
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,240
I'm sorry you've had
to waste your time dealing with this,

396
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,810
- but there really isn't...
- Neil, I am not wasting my time.

397
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,616
You do have an issue...

398
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,222
and you've got to stop pretending
you don't.

399
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,499
The incision is healing nicely.

400
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,125
We should be able
to discharge you today.

401
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,973
Are you happy to be going home?

402
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,941
Have any questions for us?

403
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,309
Are you sure?

404
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,245
Because you don't seem happy
to go home.

405
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,088
What is he saying?

406
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,864
He said Dr. Murphy was right.

407
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,002
He does have a hard time
talking to kids at school,

408
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,400
and making friends.

409
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,747
He doesn't want people to ignore him
or act like he's stupid anymore.

410
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,840
Honey, I'm so sorry.

411
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,056
Okay.

412
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:26,282
<i>âª May the good Lord shine

429
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:07,482
Reznick, secure the posterior surface
while I place PDS 4-0 sutures.

430
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,985
Murphy, be ready to suture the graft
into the anterior section.

431
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,457
Morgan realized
our patient wasn't happy,

432
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,762
even though he said he was.

433
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:24,159
If she hadn't been there,
we wouldn't be doing this surgery.

434
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,366
It wouldn't have mattered
what I realized,

435
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,846
if you hadn't been obsessed
about a new surgery to help the patient.

436
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,751
- Blood pressure's plummeting.
- Field is filling with blood.

437
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,084
Can't see the source.

438
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:50,360
Murphy, expose the external carotid
and find the superior thyroid.

439
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,509
- BP's still dropping.
- Heart rate is up.

440
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,863
Place a temporary clamp on it, Reznick.

441
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,896
It's not working, this is venous.
Ten blade.

442
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,535
I see what happened.

443
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,381
Left and right jugular veins
are connected by a venous arc

444
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,384
we injured during retraction.

445
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,046
Dr. Murphy, just double ligate
with 2-0 silk ties on both ends.

446
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Silk ties.

447
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,569
He's stabilizing.

448
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,798
Good job. Both of you.

449
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,274
Congratulations.

450
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,980
It's not every day you get
to build a kid a brand-new larynx.

451
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,749
It was very exciting.

452
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,491
<i>âª Was I on your mind? âª</i>

453
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,996
<i>âª Was I on your mind? âª</i>

454
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,830
Those two are
getting pregnant tonight.

455
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,933
Yeah.

456
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,508
They should get a room...

457
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,279
so they can make out in private.

458
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,947
Oh my God, it's Lea.

459
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,956
She's not getting pregnant.

460
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,892
She definitely uses protection.

461
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,397
Every time one of her boyfriends
would come over,

462
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,525
- she would...
- That's okay. I don't need the details.

463
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,866
Would you ever be comfortable
making out in public like that?

464
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,104
I don't know.

465
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,641
As a board-certified pathologist,

466
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,151
I think we need
to conduct an experiment.

467
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,488
Okay.

468

474
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:17,942
Ten blade.

475
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,272
Transverse incision approach
to the brachial plexus.

476
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,542
Adson forceps.

477
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,349
I can assist with ligating
the traversing external jugular branches.

478
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,357
I could divide the omohyoid muscle.

479
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,050
It's all right, best for me to handle this.

480
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,288

490
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,585
Yes.

491
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,426
It's a joke, Shaun.

492
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,399
- What Carly did was...
- I get it.

493
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,635
I get it.

494
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,238
She anthropomorphized
the word "mood"

495
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:24,106
to make it seem like you hurt it,
and it's now hemorrhaging.

496
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,609

510
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,488
âª I can tell you're in touch
With your feminine side âª

511
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,980
âª Oh, yes, I did, yes, I did âª

512
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:05,245
âª Please someone who the heck I is
I am Nicki Minaj âª

513
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,752
âª I mack dudes up, back coupes up
And chuck the deuce up âª

514
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,819
Oh!

515
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,348
âª Away! âª

516
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:14,153
âª Beating like a drum
And it's coming your way âªâª

517
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,163
<i>âª Boom badoom boom
Boom badoom boom bass âª</i>

518
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,303
<i>âª He got that super bass âª</i>

519
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,265
<i>âª Boom badoom boom

520
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,858
<i>âª Yeah, that's that super bass âª</i>

521
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,994
<i>âª Boom badoom boom

528
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,557
<i>âª Yeah, that's that super bass âªâª</i>

529
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:56,999
It was fun last night.

530
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,333
I'm glad you and Lea are friends.

531
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,404
Yeah.

532
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,375
What was your favorite song?
Mine was "Whip It."

533
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,313
I have to go.
I have an early morning.

534
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,512
Okay, I will see you at work.

535
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,257
You're at 60 meters per second.

536
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,768
Normal electrical signal velocity
of the nerve is 50 to 65.

537
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,139
- That's good.
- Very. The surgery worked.

538
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,473
Your strength might go down a bit,
but you should get function back.

539
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,044
How can I thank you?

540
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,445
Seriously.

541
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,245
Well, it's Dr. Melendez you should thank.

542
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,445
- He did the surgery.
- We didn't really do anything.

543
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,146
Well, you obviously did something.

544
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,949
Well, okay, you're welcome.

545
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:55,986
Get some rest.

546
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,795
How are you feeling?

547
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,397
Any pain or discomfort?

548
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,566
Good.

549
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,098
If you're feeling up to it,
we'd like you to make a sound.

550
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:16,642
Now, start down here...
and just push the air up.

551
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,411
Be gentle.

552
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,385
We don't need you breaking
wine glasses just yet.

553
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,261
That's the most beautiful voice
I've ever heard.

554
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,600
It's just a primitive sound,

555
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,641
with speech therapy
he'll be able to fully speak.

556
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:53,279
Cory says, "thank you, Dr. Murphy,
for pushing for the surgery."

557
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,186
This is the best day of his life.

558
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,923
You are very welcome.

559
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,017
This is not you, and it's not right.

560
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,449
We can be friends
and have it not be weird.

561
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,683
It's already weird.

562
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,357
I'm not gonna stay.

563
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,984
You don't have to run away
because I'm here.

564
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,828
- I'm not running. I'm being professional.
- You're overcompensating.

565
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,560
Trying to play it safe...

566
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,997
and it's hurting things,
it got Park and I in an argument.

567
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,832
That's not how I want to be mentored.

568
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:54,110
That's not who you are.
At least, not who I thought you were.

569
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,015
Enjoy your dinner.

570
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,211
I'm confused.

571
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,153
One day you're filing a complaint,

572
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,954
the next you're incredibly supportive
to your fellow resident.

573
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,123
I told you, I just felt like
Dr. Melendez's treatment of Browne

574
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,325
was starting to cause dissension
on the team.

575
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,466
I have no doubt that's part truth.

576
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,902
I'm guessing the other part was...

577
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,099
pre-emptive.

578
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,943
You thought it would inoculate you.

579
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,601
We'd never fire someone

580
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,442
who filed a complaint
against their attending.

581
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,948
Which is why I'm so confused.

582
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,948
Why would you feel your job
could be in jeopardy?

583
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,052
I don't.

584
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:13,319
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay.

585
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,924
Just so you're clear...

586
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:19,954
I won't hesitate to let you
or anyone go if I feel it's deserved.

587
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,057
No matter whether they've filed
a complaint or not.

588
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,168
Of course.

589
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,569
I understand.

590
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:26,861
Good.

591
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,698
Have a good night.

592
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,289
Two menus.

593
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,890
I'm going to make you
a surprise dinner tonight.

594
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,761
It's a special
grilled cheese sandwich.

595
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,892
It uses four kinds of cheeses,

596
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,993
gruyere, parmesan, yellow...

597
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,335
I don't think
we should be together anymore.

598
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,239
Hmm?

599
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,938
I can't be your girlfriend anymore.

600
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,252
Did...

601
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,426
Did I do something wrong?

602
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,290
No, Shaun, it's not...

603
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,866
Last night at karaoke...

604
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,538
when you and Lea
were singing together...

605
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,377
there was something between you two.

606
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,782
You love her, not me.

607
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,382
Oh. No.

608
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,331
No.

609
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,636
No.

610
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,002
I don't.

611
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,107
It's obvious.

612
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,333
You're wrong.

613
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:47,778
You say that...

614
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,715
and maybe you even believe it.

615
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,977
But...

616
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,987
I saw what I saw, Shaun,
and I am telling you...

617
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,489
it doesn't matter what you say.

618
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,784
It's true.

619
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,092
And I think she loves you too.

620
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,138
<i>âª This one goes out âª</i>

621
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,641
You should tell her how you feel.

622
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,147
<i>âª A simple prop âª</i>

623
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,145
<i>âª To occupy my time âª</i>

624
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:37,652
<i>âª This one goes out to the one I love âª</i>

625
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:47,529
<i>âª Fire âª</i>

626
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:56,276
<i>âª Fire âªâª</i>
