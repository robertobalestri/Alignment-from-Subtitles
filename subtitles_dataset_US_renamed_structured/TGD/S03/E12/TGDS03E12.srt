1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,506
Those are yours.

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,506
We bought them together.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,546
Because you found the pattern soothing.

4
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,346
I'm gonna miss you, Shaun.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,990
I love Carly.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,321
And that's great.

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,157
I am so happy for you.

8
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:34,229
Now you can hang
the toilet paper incorrectly

9
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,734
any time you want,

10
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,238
and Carly and I can go back
to the way things were before our fight.

11
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,371
Well, sometimes couples
need a little time to recover.

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,377
We won't.

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,846
Carly asked for you to move out.

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,740
You are moving out.

15
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,582
How many kidneys do I need
in my body to attend prom?

16
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,920
- Ryan...
- Even if the surgeon removes my kidney,

17
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,692
it'll be laparoscopic,

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,457
so my in-patient time
will be seven days, tops,

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,759
and then three more days
of rest at home.

20
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,891
I can take my girlfriend to prom, right?

21
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,197
That's not a purely medical decision.
I have to draw blood.

22
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,739
What are the chances Dr. Melendez

23
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,070
might remove the tumor
but spare Ryan's kidney?

24
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,839
Well, the MRI will let us know
how much the chemo

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,540
has shrunk the tumor,
but you shouldn't count on it.

26
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,109
One chili burger,
extra mustard, extra pickles.

27
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,981
Hey. Morning, Mr. Cooper.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,748
He can't have that with his surgery.

29
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,846
Oh, he's fine until about 6:30 tonight.

30
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,086
I know you.

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,253
Angie Valens.

32
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,254
I helped put in your chemo port.

33
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,722
I owe you a big thank you. Ha-ha.

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,290
- We met in chemo.
- Mm.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,131
They should put us in a public service
announcement or something.

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,467
Yeah. I lost a tumor
and gained a boyfriend.

37
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,904
Thanks, chemo.

38
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,236
- James McDougall?
- That's who we're here for too.

39
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,145
All of you can head over
to Bay Four.

40
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,910
Guy saw me six months ago
for a stress fracture.

41
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,920
He's a lunatic ultra-marathoner.

42
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,515
I just hope he didn't go too hard
too soon and break it again.

43
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,524
He didn't break it again.

44
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,843
Your GP was right to start you
on ketoprofen for the swelling,

45
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,680
but clearly it isn't working.
That's why Murphy and Reznick

46
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,945
are going to block off
some of your lymphatic channels.

47
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,785
It should reduce production.

48
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,552
- The more pressing concern is why.
- Ever had surgery on your lymph nodes?

49
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,657
What about cancer,
or radiation treatment?

50
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,290
No. Physically,
I've always been healthy.

51
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,459
Physically?

52
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:51,164
I was diagnosed with persistent
depressive disorder when I was 16.

53
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,334
That's why you gotta get me back
out on the road, doc.

54
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,803
Are antidepressants not effective?

55
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,644
I mean, they help,
but running really is key.

56
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,715
It saved my marriage and my life.

57
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,945
Lymphedema can be caused
by an infection.

58
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,318
He doesn't have a fever.

59
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,188
Ketoprofen can suppress fevers.

60
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,694
Let's get cultures and start him
on broad-spec antibiotics.

61
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,532
As requested,
your restock on enemas.

62
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,864
Nice cover.

63
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,164
- How've you been feeling?
- The methotrexate is working great.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,072
No pain, no redness.

65
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,105
- Stiffness, flu-like symptoms?
- No, all good.

66
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,843
How long are you planning
to hide out doing RA exams

67
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,749
and clipping diabetics' toenails?

68
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,784
Dizziness, headaches, nausea?

69
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,688
Uh, sometimes I'm a little queasy
after I eat.

70
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,425
You had to love neurosurgery.

71
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,292
How about we try to get you a medication
that doesn't irritate your stomach?

72
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,801
No. My hands feel great,
that's all I care about.

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,207
You used to open up skulls
and poke around people's brains.

74
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,237
No way this fulfills you.

75
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,110
I enjoy it.

76
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,113
Or rather, I usually enjoy it.

77
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,411
I'll let you get back to it.

78
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,884
Maybe someone out there
needs an enema.

79
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,227
Got a measurement
on the Wilms' tumor?

80
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,524
Not quite there yet.

81
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,762
You mentioned seven centimeters as
our limit to doing this laparoscopically.

82
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,030
What if we pushed it to 7.2?

83
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,167
It would speed up recovery.

84
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,802
By a few days.

85
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,432
Forget I brought it up.

86
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,703
Ryan wanting to take his
girlfriend to prom

87
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,181
should not factor into our surgical plan.

88
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,980
- Is he nuts about her?
- Oh, crazy, head over heels in love.

89
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,316
They both are.

90
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,615
Idiots.

91
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,089
I wouldn't mind being an idiot
like that again.

92
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,088
Though I'm not sure
I ever felt that way.

93
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,758
You know, totally happy.

94
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,631
So therapy's going well?

95
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,564
No metastasis in the lungs.

96
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,566
Look at that.

97
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,946
Your tumor is gone.

98
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,384
Gone?

99
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,947
How's that possible?

100
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,820
The chemotherapy worked
better than we expected.

101
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,650
Wait, like, no tumor? Zero?

102
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,286
- No need for surgery whatsoever?
- That is right.

103
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,957
- These are discharge forms.
- Oh, my God.

104
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,367
Both of my kidneys
are taking you to prom.

105
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,903
Hell, yeah they are.

106
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,504
I'm so... I'm s...

107
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,378
Angie?

108
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,848
- Angie!
- She's having a seizure.

109
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:51,917
Angie.

110
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,552
Two milligrams of lorazepam
and portable oxygen, stat.

111
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,247
Let's get that under her head.

112
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,059
His lungs are filled with fluid.

113
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,427
I need a chest X-ray
and a bedside ultrasound.

114
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,898
And page Dr. Reznick.

115
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,047
Imaging has confirmed
reoccurrence of your brain tumor.

116
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,546
What stage?

117
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,022
Three.

118
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,189
Now, the best approach is surgery.

119
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,162
A wide resection of the tumor
followed by radiation and chemo

120
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,458
to encourage full remission.

121
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,163
Sounds like a fun couple of months.

122
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,228
Full recovery will probably
take closer to eight.

123
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,041
We can get through this, baby,
just like last time.

124
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,979
When will the surgery be?

125
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,109
We need to do additional imaging,

126
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,053
and I'd like to consult a colleague
about the best approach.

127
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,715
That'll take a few days.

128
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,125
Take your time.

129
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,461
Prom?

130
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,623
Yeah. Now that Ryan can go,

131
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,792
- I have to go. I can't...
- Angie, honey.

132
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,597
This is your health
we're talking about.

133
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,899
Mom, please.

134
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,240
I just wanna do this one thing
like a normal kid.

135
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,573
Can you tell her it's okay?

136
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,911
We can't. Until we remove
your tumor, you're at risk

137
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,509
of potentially fatal seizures.

138
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,023
After you're recovered,
you and Ryan can get all dressed up

139
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,593
and we'll go have dinner
at the Grandview. Okay?

140
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,734
Prom sucks.

141
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,668
My buddy had a fake ID.

142
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,502
I got so drunk I passed out
and never made it into the dance.

143
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,337
Maybe that wasn't
everybody's experience.

144
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,776
I was prom king, my date was queen.

145
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,885
What? I had the dress, the date,
I had the mom who got arrested.

146
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,014
Spent the night picking her up
from the drunk tank.

147
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,557
You see Park while you were there?

148
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,021
Go to Scheduling,
get Angie's surgery set for Friday

149
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,892
with the best neurosurgery OR nurses.

150
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,698
Let's go see Glassman.

151
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,532
Now I'm identifying
the sub-millimeter lymphatic vessels.

152
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,005
I need an 11-0 micro suture
and a 70-micron needle.

153
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,342
Instead of harvesting nodes
to this area,

154
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,210
could we redirect lymphatics
away from his lymph system?

155
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,314
We could.

156
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:39,078
If you identify an appropriate vessel,
you can make the connection.

157
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,711
We're clearly not dealing
with an infection.

158
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,052
There must be a blockage
somewhere in his lymph system.

159
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,557
Most likely cancer.

160
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,224
His CBC didn't show
any abnormal cells.

161
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,355
Lymphoma doesn't always show up.

162
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,492
We need to run cytology
on his lymphatic fluid.

163
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,832
It's either gonna be nasty
or very nasty,

164
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,367
depending upon how it attaches
to the thalamus and fornix,

165
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,614
which no imaging or testing
can possibly determine.

166
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,113
So our options are...

167
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,552
Between an endoscopic approach
or an open anterior one.

168
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,322
That is correct.

169
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,888
I'd run a stereotactic MRI
with fiducials

170
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:27,124
and DTI to gauge how close
the white matter tracts actually are.

171
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,561
You should scrub in.

172
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,131
Another doctor can cover the clinic.

173
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,210
I haven't been in an OR
in over a year,

174
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,041
and then, as a patient.

175
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,111
I'm not asking you to cut,

176
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,714
but it'd be a huge value to have you.

177
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,285
I appreciate that.

178
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,915
I'll consider it.

179
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,401
Hello. We need to run cytology
on this lymphatic fluid.

180
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,305
I would be happy to.

181
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,247
Lea moved out this morning.

182
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,950
Thank you.

183
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,879
You're welcome.
Can you come over tonight?

184
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,789
- Uh, that probably won't work.
- Or we could go to your apartment.

185
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,919
I can't.

186
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,758
Lea said that
it might take time for us

187
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,393
to recover from our fight,
but I told her that we were okay.

188
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,933
We are.

189
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,030
I made plans tonight,

190
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,768
to hang out with a friend
who just got fired.

191
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,108
But I would love
to come over tomorrow night.

192
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:46,979
Okay.

193
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,806
I'll put a rush on this test too.

194
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,182
Your lymphovenous
anastomosis technique,

195
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,420
I was impressed.

196
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,790
It's a little early in the morning
to be sucking up, Reznick.

197
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,992
Not for me,
I like to get a jump on things.

198
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,228
I'm fascinated by the way
you use plastic procedures

199
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,237
like microsurgery
in other surgical specialties.

200
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,739
I thought it might make
an interesting topic for a paper.

201
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,874
Wanna write it with me?

202
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,307
- Yes.
- Let's talk and eat.

203
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,082
That's not breakfast.

204
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,254
I'm buying.
What publications do you wanna target?

205
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,185
Last time,
Angie had bad post-op vomiting.

206
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,355
- Of course, I'll make a note of it.
- Excuse me.

207
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,899
She's asleep.
She needs her rest.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,698
- I'll wait until she's awake.
- Ryan, your immune system is weak.

209
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,866
It would be easy for you
to pick up a bug and pass it to Angie.

210
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,909
I haven't been around
anyone but my dad.

211
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,610
He could wear a mask.

212
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:59,219
After Angie's surgery,
we'll see about arranging a visit.

213
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,254
You just tell her Ryan came by.

214
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,052
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

215
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,593
I'd like to change Angie's status
to "no visitors" on her chart.

216
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,857
Yeah.

217
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,001
Please take Mr. McDougall
to his room. I'll be there in a moment.

218
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,202
<i>Personnel...</i>

219
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,071
Is that James McDougall?

220
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,870
- And the woman with him?
- His wife.

221
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,245
Is it cancer?

222
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,083
No, worse.

223
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,086
His lymphedema is caused
by a genetic mutation.

224
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,619
If you don't find a medication
he responds to,

225
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,284
he'll drown from the inside.

226
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,563
The mutation is on James' ARAF gene.

227
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,626
It makes an enzyme called kinase,

228
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,728
which can cause cells
to over-proliferate.

229
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,295
It's a genetic condition.

230
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,532
What set it off now?

231
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,941
Probably the stress fracture.

232
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,912
Sent his immune system into overdrive,
fired up his lymphatic system.

233
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,042
What treatment protocol
targets this mutation?

234
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,913
An MEK inhibitor.

235
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,112
The problem is, which one?

236
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,918
There are 41 possibilities,
each with different side effects.

237
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,824
Good luck.

238
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,325
I was hoping you could stay.

239
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,964
Okay, sure.

240
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,064
We need you to stay completely still.

241
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,934
Not a problem.

242
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,009
You okay?

243
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,342
Ryan totally bailed.
He hasn't come back to see me.

244
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,712
If you tell her that her mom said
he couldn't visit,

245
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,517
she'll be pissed at her mom.
How's that gonna help?

246
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,719
He's probably busy
catching up at school.

247
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,159
We had a pact.

248
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,828
As long as we were together,
cancer wasn't gonna beat us.

249
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,133
He broke it.

250
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,830
Cancer wins.

251
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,645
Do you mind finishing?

252
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,751
- Imaging finished?
- Not quite.

253
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,132
Mrs. Valens,
Angie would really like to see Ryan.

254
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,192
I know you're concerned about infection,
but there is minimal risk.

255
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,568
Actually, none,
if they do a video chat.

256
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,572
Interesting idea.

257
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,437
I'll think about it.

258
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,243
Angie's depressed,

259
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,005
and studies have shown
that can have a negative impact

260
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,641
on her surgical outcome.

261
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,515
You know, Ryan doesn't always
improve Angie's mood.

262
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,726
A couple of weeks ago,
they had some silly fight

263
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,352
and she cried for days.

264
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,561
Thank you for letting me know.

265
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,457
I'm gonna do my best
to cheer her up.

266
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,899
She's a 16-year-old,
she wants her boyfriend.

267
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,403
Yeah. And how smart were you
when you were 16?

268
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,814
Well, what about selumetinib?

269
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,475
It's shown promising results
on related conditions.

270
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,883
And a high occurrence of liver disease.

271
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,087
Binimetinib is similar,
but has fewer complications.

272
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,286
Any objections?

273
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,722
Let's start James on that.

274
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,067
This is exciting, working together.

275
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,202
It is, although I'm used to...

276
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,810
samples and slides
instead of patients.

277
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,218
Patients can be difficult,
but you will be fine.

278
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,874
Do you need something?

279
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:23,044
I was curious how James
was responding to binimetinib.

280
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,481
Urine output is up,

281
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,315
which suggests
the lymphatic fluid...

282
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,249
And his potassium is a little low.
Can you give him this?

283
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,383
I wasn't really...

284
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,906
Hi, I'm Dr. Lever.

285
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,851
The tumor is abutting
and possibly infiltrating

286
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,575
the white matter tracts
of her fornix.

287
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,411
We'll likely have
to remove a section.

288
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,850
That'll affect her ability
to form memories.

289
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,649
With neuropsych rehab, she may be able
to compensate with other pathways.

290
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,187
Studies have shown positive attitudes
lead to positive outcomes.

291
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,024
- Worried about her attitude?
- She's worried about young love.

292
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,327
I'm worried about
what Angie is facing after surgery.

293
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,799
Physical therapy,
cognitive therapy,

294
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,668
one challenge after another,
and what she wants is so simple.

295
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,899
Wanna make a sad kid happy?

296
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,012
I guess I do. Which isn't my job
and I need to stop

297
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,842
getting sucked into personal issues.

298
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,440
Is there a way to do that
without antagonizing the mother?

299
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,582
Maybe.

300
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,884
Then make her happy.

301
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,066
We've never gotten
this far before.

302
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,072
No, we haven't.

303
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,875
And you're okay?

304
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,640
I am very okay.

305
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,594
Oh, Carly.

306
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,676
Okay.

307
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,251
Did I do something wrong?

308
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,948
No. I'm sorry, it's me.

309
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,419
You said we were okay.

310
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,128
I thought we were.

311
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,531
- I want us to be.
- You have no reason to still be mad.

312
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,694
I'm not mad. I'm just...

313
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,609
It's Morgan.

314
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,806
The medication
caused James an upper GI bleed.

315
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,289
Have you localized
the source of the bleeding?

316
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,324
Working on it.

317
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,656
Seems to be coming
from the antrum of the stomach.

318
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,207
We've stopped the binimetinib.

319
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,295
On top of causing this,

320
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,059
it hadn't done much
to curtail swelling.

321
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,532
- Where's Dr. Lever?
- There's the ulcerative lesion.

322
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,658
Cautery.

323
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,033
Zebrafish.

324
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,205
They're used in medical research
because of their quick maturation

325
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,143
and 84 percent of genes
associated with human disease

326
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,942
have a zebrafish equivalent.

327
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,382
You think we should do
a transgenic expression

328
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,319
of James' ARAF mutation
into the zebrafish genome.

329
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,381
Translation for those of us
without a genetics textbook handy?

330
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,983
We make mini-Jameses,
as zebrafish,

331
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,256
all with the same disorder.

332
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,389
Then we test every conceivable drug
on those fish.

333
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,258
How long before
we could start testing?

334
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,735
If we implant the embryos now,
probably late afternoon tomorrow.

335
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,202
Get going. Shaun, go with her,
you have path experience.

336
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,491
I understand no means no.

337
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,095
If you don't want to have sex...

338
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,630
I accept that.

339
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,297
But I am very confused.

340
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,372
So am I.

341
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,877
I thought I was fine until I...

342
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:49,040
I told Lea to move out
like you wanted.

343
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,044
You said that things were okay.

344
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,320
They aren't.
How do I make them okay?

345
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,254
I can't tell you
because I don't know.

346
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:26,610
When I was in chemo, the nurses
used to force that stuff down my throat,

347
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,122
so I know you're not drinking it
because of the taste.

348
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,990
Fast, easy nutrition.

349
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:35,255
That and you don't end up
puking your guts out in the bathroom.

350
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,960
I was president of this hospital
for over 10 years.

351
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,000
I made a few friends,
including Jack the janitor.

352
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,696
Talks a lot, A's fan, horrible gossip.

353
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,806
If the methotrexate is making you sick,
we should try another medication.

354
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,678
How can you guarantee
you're not gonna throw up

355
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,510
in the middle of surgery?

356
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,514
It won't happen.

357
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,650
Because it only happens
if I eat solid food,

358
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,882
and I've stopped.

359
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,518
At least at work.

360
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,703
That is a lot of fish tanks.

361
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:26,040
Forty, so we can test all
of the possible medications for...

362
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,636
Are you throwing a party?

363
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,913
Hope so.

364
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,517
Oh.

365
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,251
How are you doing, Shaun?

366
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,194
Since your father passed away?

367
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,364
Don't think about him very much.

368
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:01,676
My mom died recently.
I don't know if you knew that.

369
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,047
She pops into my head
all the time.

370
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,081
Not always the nicest thoughts.

371
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,426
It's okay not to love them.

372
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,167
They didn't make us who we are.

373
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,941
Has your mom gone home?

374
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:09,208
There is one more thing
we have to deal with tonight.

375
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,416
Come on.

376
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,950
How many more sets of imaging
can you possibly do?

377
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,121
One of these is your prom dress.

378
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,492
I like the pink, but I think
you'd look gorgeous in both.

379
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,325
Hurry up and choose.
Your date will be here soon.

380
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,545
All the medications are in.

381
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:49,185
Which means more waiting to see
which medicine works.

382
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,052
It's hard to be patient.

383
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:00,329
Do you think the fish control
how they react to the meds?

384
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,890
No.

385
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,666
It's just how their bodies respond.

386
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,138
That's how I felt last night.

387
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,148
I thought I was ready for us
to be together, but...

388
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,281
my body had a different response.

389
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:25,180
I can't turn that response off
any more than these fish can control

390
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,816
how their mutation reacts
to the medication.

391
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,858
Was our mutation...

392
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,166
me going to Wyoming with Lea?

393
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,306
Do you think...

394
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,042
we can find our right medication?

Maybe a touch.

419
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,023
Dance with a prom king?

420
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,860

We were talking,
and then he just stopped.

424
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,254
We need to do a pericardial tap.

425
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,086
Call the Cath lab, tell them we're coming.

426
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,750
No time. We're doing it here.
James,

427
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,385
the pain in your chest
is too much fluid around your heart.

428
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,006
We'll put a tube
into your chest to drain it.

429
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,898

Morgan called.
James isn't doing well.

447
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,042
Cross SL-327 off the list.

448
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,184
I see one...

449
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,749
No, two tumors.

450
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,342
Okay. This is my stop.

451
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,480
I'll see you after.

452
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,114
I love you.

453
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,890
I love you too, Mom.

454
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,363
Don't worry, okay?

455
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:32,956
I got this.

456
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,034
I know you do.

457
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,810
Okay.

458
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,144
Okay.

459
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:56,850
What if I wake up
and don't remember Ryan at all?

460
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:01,858
Then...

461
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,389
you'll have a chance to fall in love
with him all over again.

462
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,933
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

463
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,283
We're down
to five potential options.

464
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,719
I don't need five potential,
I need one actual.

465
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,690
- There are two that best curb.
- Choose one.

466
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,526
We should try refametinib.

467
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,725
It caused abnormal cell growth.
Trametinib is safer.

468
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,065
Which doesn't mean it's safe.

469
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,569
Well, nothing's safe.
Which do you want us to do?

470
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,669
Trametinib. That's the one.

471
00:31:58,817 --> 00:31:59,978
Saline in.

472
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,710
Advancing scope
toward the third ventricle.

473
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:06,555
Claire, hold gentle pressure on the tumor
while I cut off its blood supply.

474
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,924
We've got some significant bleeding.

475
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,832
Adjust the scope and suction.

476
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,767
Look higher.

477
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,809
The septal vein,
there's your bleeder. Cauterize away.

478
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,316
Micro-dissector.

479
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,355
The tumor's immobile.

480
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,867
I can't resect it without injuring
the nerve tracts. She'd be comatose.

481
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,870
Try sharp dissection.

482
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,045
- I can't get a plane.
- How bad?

483
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,872
It's completely invaded
her thalamus.

484
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,508
Thin it out
with the suction aspirator.

485
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,679
It's too adherent.

486
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,181
If I keep going,
I'm gonna kill her.

487
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,150
Any ideas?

488
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,877
Tell ICU Angie will be coming
sooner than we planned.

489
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,612
Let's close her up.

490
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,533
What's next?

491
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,338
Another round of radiation?
Chemo?

492
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:47,745
Her carcinoma is unlikely
to respond to those therapies.

493
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,718
No. We have to try.

494
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,262
- Angie will want to fight.
- She's seizing.

495
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,242
Get me lorazepam and Dilantin, stat.
Have phenobarb and propofol on deck.

496
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,081
You're crying.

497
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,759
Yes.

498
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,590
Why?

499
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,398
I found James on Facebook.

500
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,998
He and Marjorie
wanna go to Costa Rica.

501
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:48,008
Their dog is a three-legged rescue
named Tripod.

502
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,278
He's not a slide, he's a person.

503
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,422
He is a good person,
and he might die.

504
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,555
This is why
I like to stay in the lab.

505
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,167
That...

506
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,965
is a very dumb thing to say.

507
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,803
If you had stayed in the lab,

508
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,481
James would probably
be dead already.

509
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:29,981
Your plan with the zebrafish
gave him a chance.

510
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:35,491
It was a beautiful, perfect idea,

511
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,191
from a beautiful,
almost perfect person.

512
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,567
Your earlobes are lopsided.

513
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,871
I'm so sorry.

514
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,137
We couldn't save her.

515
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,323
Ms. Valens?

516
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,266
Nice call on the zebrafish.

517
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,815
About our paper,
let's meet weekly.

518
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,585
I'm thinking lunch every Tuesday
in the cafeteria.

519
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,658
Perfect.

520
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,661
I heard about Melendez's patient.

521
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,142
Yeah.

522
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,653
You were right,

523
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,988
I should probably try
another medication for my RA.

524
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,362
I need solid food.

525
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,902
<i>Claire, wait up.</i>

526
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,277
You okay?

527
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,744
Fine. I'm just tired.

528
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,742
You did an amazing thing for Angie.

529
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,218
You gave her mother a memory
that she will have forever.

530
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:52,254
Yeah, well, it won't make up
for the daughter she lost.

531
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,883
You're angry.

532
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,218
I'm not, I am sad.

533
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,092
- Who are you angry at?
- I'm not.

534
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,674
Are you angry at me and Glassman,
because we couldn't save her?

535
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,098
- No.
- At Angie?

536
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,931
No, you can't be mad
at someone for dying!

537
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,030
That's not true, you know that.

538
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,775
She was sick,
and she was trying to get better.

539
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:16,407
She failed, and left you alone,

540
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,809
after you spent a lifetime
trying to take care of her.

541
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,277
You have every reason
to be mad at your mother.

542
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,483
But I hate feeling this way.

543
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,686
My whole life I have been angry at her,
and now it will never change.

544
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,225
I don't know how to stop.

545
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,963
Therapy will help.

546
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,203
Time will help.

547
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,936
There is one other thing
that's worked for me.

548
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,456
Did we fix our mutation?

549
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,285
- Oh...
- Ha-ha-ha.

550
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,238
That the best you got?
