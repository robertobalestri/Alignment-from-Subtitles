00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,167
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,064
Ready to tell me what's on your mind?

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,776
I think I'm in love with my boss.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,571
I have rheumatoid arthritis.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,875
I wanted you to know and no one else.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,281
I've been thinking
about synovectomy surgery.

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,684
It'll resolve the pain temporarily,
then what?

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,651
It'll give me at least 10 years.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,418
Then you're gonna be bone on bone.
What's your plan then?

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,225
I understand you're leaving surgery.
That's tough, but it's the right call.

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,591
No, I don't think it is.

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,295
I'm doing the surgery.

13
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,600
You don't tell me anything
about your life.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,538
- Because you don't wanna know.
- That's not true.

15
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,819
You don't wanna feel guilty
about being a thousand miles away.

16
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,835
You just wanna know that I'm okay.

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,572
I love you, Lea.
I want to be your boyfriend.

18
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,584
I'm a challenge for anyone.

19
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,086
I just know
it would be too hard for you.

20
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,450
You have to give me a chance.

21
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,526
- You need to let me try...
- No.

22
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,960
- I will fix it.
- You're autistic. You can't fix that.

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,566
You acted like you cared about me,
but you don't even respect me.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,869
You're going to end up alone
and you deserve it!

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,434
Because you're a superficial,
selfish and prejudiced person!

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,758
Uh, two lychee Kölsch, please.

27
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,798
- Lea? Hey.
- Hey.

28
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,129
I saw the invite at the clinic

29
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,297
and I assumed you wouldn't be here.

30
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,470
Here with a friend?

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,939
It's been a rough couple of weeks.

32
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,153
Hey. They're here.

33
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,152
- The guys who made this all possible.
- I don't know about all that.

34
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,818
Yeah, well, you try opening a brewery
or fundraising when you're dead.

35
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,390
Oh, honey, you remember Dr. Melendez
and Dr. Glassman.

36
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,525
- This is my wife, Noreen.
- Aaron, hi.

37
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,030
- This is Lea.
- Your flavor profiles are epic.

38
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,533
- How about a tour?
- Uh, yes.

39
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,938
Okay, great. Come on.

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,510
- Marta.
- Carl.

41
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,110
She is in host mode.
We could be here forever.

42
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,445
I'll show you around.

43
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,357
The hops in the Kölsch,
is that the Citra?

44
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,018
In combination with the Noble German.

45
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,562
Lady knows her stuff.

46
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:47,991
Do you feel that?

47
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,668
It's an earthquake.

48
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,184
Get out of there!

49
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,327
Lea!

50
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,290
- Hello.
<i>- Thank God.</i>

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,131
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I think.

52
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,773
- The ceiling caved in.
- Were you hit? Are you bleeding?

53
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,502
Not as far as I can tell.

54
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,936
Just some bruises.

55
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,075
The brewing tanks fell over.
One went right through the floor.

56
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,311
And Glassman? Wasn't he with you?

57
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,319
I was, yeah.

58
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,391
Your shoulder, it's dislocated.

59
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:21,894
Yeah.

60
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,930
I'm okay. Noreen?

61
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,327
<i>We're okay here.</i>

62
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,340
I'm about to assemble a HURT team.
Any idea how many wounded?

63
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,671
No. Let me check.

64
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,939
Come on.

65
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,917
Lea.

66
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,972
Get here as fast as you can.

67
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,577
The hospital is on mass casualty
incident protocol.

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,210
Cancel all elective surgeries,

69
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,380
transfer noncritical patients
to urgent or chronic care facilities,

70
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,015
no family members or visitors
are allowed in the ER.

71
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,718
Gonna need all the space we've got.

72
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,796
Use the waiting room
for patient overflow.

73
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,990
Our HURT Team, which I'll be running,

74
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,362
has been assigned
to the Bold Statement Brewery,

75
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,800
- which collapsed during a charity event.
- Melendez and Glassman went to that.

76
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,101
I spoke with Melendez. They're both fine.

77
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,106
That's two out of approximately 100.

78
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,206
Park, Shaun, Claire, with me.
Get the equipment packed up.

79
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,248
I wanna be on the road
in three minutes.

80
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,181
Cover Surgery.
I'll get another attending on the ER.

81
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,316
I'll do both.
I used to run the whole hospital.

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,628
It's just a cut. You'll be fine.

83
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,927
I need to focus
on medical emergencies.

84
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,863
Cuts and scrapes do not qualify.

85
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,501
My colleague and I will be com...

86
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,239
- Lea?
- Door to the brew hall is totally blocked.

87
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,640
- Dr. Melendez.
- Noreen.

88
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,275
Marta!

89
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,747
- What hurts?
- My back.

90
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,054
I'm going to need a towel and tape.

91
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,394
Glassman and I
need every first aid kit you've got.

92
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,267
Go.

93
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,107
Hold still. You're going to be okay.

94
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,907
I'm going to stabilize that leg, sir.

95
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,419
Hold on a second.

96
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,184
Sir, please put the light
on your leg.

97
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,786
- What was that?
- Hold still.

98
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,207
What if there's an aftershock?
The whole place could come down.

99
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,132
Just hold still, please, sir.
Just hold still!

100
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,501
Just please sit down.

101
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,846
Hey, you guys.

102
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,583
Head across the street.
You'll be okay there.

103
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,228
Maybe about 40 people inside
in need of treatment

104
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,754
or some kind of onsite evaluation.
Where do you need me?

105
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,859
- The hospital. We're short on surgeons.
- Okay. Shaun...

106
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,633
Lea was here.

107
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,110
- Where is she now?
- I don't know.

108
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,839
She was inside
when the tanks fell down.

109
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,107
But first responders
are gonna find her. Shaun?

110
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,761
Jack's in place. Let's lift it.

111
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,897
- All right, she's clear.
- Melendez?

112
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,670
Fifty-year-old woman,

113
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:29,209
medical history includes spinal tumor
resection, C1 through 3 fusion,

114
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,834
complaining of severe back pain.

115
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,708
Where were you hit?
Are you dizzy? In pain?

116
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,839
I'm fine. A beam fell,
hit me on my side, knocked me down.

117
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,144
Let me see.

118
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,083
I'm fine.

119
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:40,786
Let me see.

120
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,723
I'll lay off working my obliques
at the gym for a bit.

121
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,224
Ow.

122
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,327
- How much did that hurt?
- No more than it should.

123
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,225
You're gonna need a full evaluation.

124
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,290
I'll go with Marta back to the hospital,
get checked out.

125
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,029
Where was Lea?

126
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,232
In the brew hall,
but it's completely blocked in.

127
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,875
Glassman and I already tried it.

128
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,342
The danger of spinal fracture.

129
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,313
Let's get a real cervical collar
on her and get her onto the board.

130
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,807
Stop.

131
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,586
Don't touch her.

132
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:28,128
You winced when they touched
your neck. Did your right hand hurt?

133
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,760
Yeah, like it was on fire.

134
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,703
It's not just a fracture.

135
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,071
Something is pressing
on her spinal cord.

136
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,372
The move to the board
could shift the object,

137
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,935
leading to permanent paralysis.

138
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,775
I need to find Lea.

139
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,049
Get the battery-powered X-ray.

140
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,053
Lucky there weren't more books
on that shelf.

141
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,563
Bay one, 500 milligrams
IV acetaminophen

142
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,258
and page Calderon in Pedes.

143
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,397
Reznick, no, you had surgery
on your hands 48 hours ago.

144
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,869
I don't need them to triage.

145
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,270
We need a surgeon.
Construction worker.

146
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,308
Through and through impalement,
point of entry is his pelvis.

147
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,678
BP 111 over 84. Pulse 107 BPM.

148
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,007
- Pupils?
- Ignore her.

149
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,144
- Normal and reactive.
- Right now, she's a patient, not a doctor.

150
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,986
- Motor exam? All right, thanks.
- Normal.

151
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,015
I'm concerned about the iliac artery.
Check his femoral pulse.

152
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,489
- I was planning to.
- Unh!

153
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,993
Okay, okay, okay.
Right leg is strong.

154
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:29,895
Left is thready.

155
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,194
Ultrasound his leg to confirm.
His abdomen too.

156
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,699
Look for additional damaged vessels.

157
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,896
Then take him to OR 2 and page Cohen.

158
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,601
There could be a lot of vascular injuries.
Do his surgery, while I help with triage.

159
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,644
Dr. Reznick, I don't need
or want your help.

160
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,338
You have a habit
of withholding key details

161
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,110
from your attendings as it benefits you.

162
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,310
Go to bed.

163
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,059
Lea? Lea, can you hear me?

164
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,063
Help.

165
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,332
Shaun, we need you on triage.
Let the professionals...

166
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,962
- Shh. Okay.
- Help me. Under here.

167
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,206
Someone is down there.

168
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,071
Someone's down there,
but it's not Lea.

169
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,972
- We need Fire and Rescue over here!
- Coming down.

170
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,483
Shaun.

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,885
It's right up
against the spinal canal.

172
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,591
The C2 screws we used to fuse
the vertebrae once the tumor was out.

173
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,096
That doctor was right?
I could end up paralyzed?

174
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,033
I'm afraid so.

175
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,540
So, what are we gonna do about that?

176
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,717
We could remove the screw here.

177
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,186
No. You can't operate on my wife's spine
in the middle of this.

178
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,394
It would have its risks,

179
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,390
significantly more than most surgeries.
But Dr. Browne's right.

180
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,097
If we don't remove the screw here,

181
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,195
it's likely you'll be paralyzed
from the neck down.

182
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,136
Take it out.

183
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,121
Lea!

184
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,548
Lea!

185
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,817
Are you there?

186
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,028
- Can you hear me? Lea!
- Please help!

187
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,403
Lea, it's me. Lea, it's Shaun.

188
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,443
Lea...

189
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,275
- Shaun, help.
- Okay.

190
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,255
Hey! This area needs to be stabilized
before any medical personnel...

191
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,414
Lea!

192
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,467
I think I'm stuck.

193
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,191
Okay.

194
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,657
Lea, I'm coming.

195
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,853
Okay.

196
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,015
I am not afraid.

197
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,885
I am not afraid.

198
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,024
I am not afraid.

199
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:00,893
Of course you are.

200
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,060
You know why?

201
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,536
Because this is stupid scary.

202
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,613
Dispatch rerouted us to Good Sam
for some reason.

203
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,207
I put us on diversion. Too many patients,
too few surgeons.

204
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,311
Now you got two more patients and one
more surgeon. Which procedure?

205
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,550
Pelvic fracture can wait. Bay seven.
I'm overseeing the ER.

206
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,956
Someone has to.
Doesn't have to be you.

207
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,490
Morgan texted me,
she's offered to help.

208
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,265
Hands free.

209
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,497
- I'll handle the ER, you two go cut.
- Who's going to treat patients? Siri?

210
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,596
The nurses. I'll tell them what to do
and then oversee every move.

211
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,800
Running this place isn't a job
for a third year,

212
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,775
even on days without an earthquake.

213
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,075
Well, we've had an earthquake,
there are no options.

214
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,847
Morgan, you be careful
with those hands.

215
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,418
- You could screw them up for good.
- Understood.

216
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,477
Petringa! OR 3.

217
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,923
What were you doing
in a brewery anyway?

218
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,992
I was just sitting at the bar,
having a beer.

219
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,261
- Now I'm trapped under it.
- You're not 21.

220
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,794
I'd show you my ID, but my pockets
are kind of underground right now.

221
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,264
We should let your parents know.

222
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,367
I'm fine. It doesn't even hurt.

223
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,635
You should have someone here.
Mom, Dad...

224
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,712
My mom's dead.

225
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,982
My dad's on a plane.

226
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,752
Do you know the flight number?
We can get word to him.

227
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,990
If my son was in your situation,
I'd want to be there,

228
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,894
no matter what else was going on,
or how he got there.

229
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,323
My dad already thinks I'm a screwup.

230
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,136
And this doesn't exactly
disprove that.

231
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,705
Just get this off me.

232
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,403
Call me a bitch.

233
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,211
Call me a bitch.

234
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,919
We're going to clear this ER
and get the hospital off trauma diversion.

235
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,135
With a patient in every bed
and a doctor with zero hands?

236
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,422
Actually, I've got eight.

237
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,793
You guys are going to do exactly
what I tell you.

238
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,027
I ask you to probe two inches to the left,
I don't mean 1.5 inches or 1.7.

239
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,865
I have you debride a wound,
that's three Betadyne swabs, not two.

240
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,871
I don't care what shortcuts
you've picked up.

241
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,839
I will not say "please,"
it is a wasted word.

242
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,035
I will not say "thank you,"
I will be moving on.

243
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,079
I will be a bitch,
so may as well call me one now.

244
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,404
Bitch.

245
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,415
- You're a bitch.
- Bitch.

246
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,575
As a feminist, I'm not...

247
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,016
- Say it.
- Bitch.

248
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,554
Nice. Let's get to work.

249
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,892
You should be up there
doing your job. Not down here.

250
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,229
- Lea needs me.
- No, she doesn't.

251
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,101
You think rescuing her will make her
fall in love with you. It won't.

252
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,538
You're being...

253
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,042
- You always said I could do...
- Because I believed in you.

254
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,852
Right now, I don't.

255
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,121
She doesn't love you. She told you.

256
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,451
She thinks you're limited.

257
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,889
You are.

258
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,935
You're not her hero.

259
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,875
Please help.

260
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,136
We need a central line,
endotracheal tube,

261
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,332
bag mask, portable oxygen,
anesthesia...

262
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,965
We've got midazolam.

263
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,204
That combined with the morphine drip
should work.

264
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:06,972
Noreen?

265
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,015
Don't do this surgery, please.

266
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,479
I can't lose her. Not this soon.

267
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,949
When Marta was with her husband,
she was miserable, she didn't know...

268
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,187
We're not the ones to persuade.

269
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,932
Sorry.

270
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:36,667
I will push your wheelchair,
I'll wipe your mouth, whatever you need...

271
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,982
and be glad for every minute of it.
Because...

272
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,518
you will still be alive...

273
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,517
and we'll still be on our adventure.

274
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,318
Five years...

275
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,863
that's... it's just not enough.

276
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,361
- So greedy.
- Marta, please.

277
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,979
Thank you for being willing
to take care of me again.

278
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,575
Five years isn't enough.

279
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,784
However long I have with you
will never be enough.

280
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,756
I only found you
once I stopped listening to my fear.

281
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,762
Fear of hurting my husband...

282
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,400
being thrown out of the Church,
of dying alone.

283
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,575
Pushing all that aside
made room for you,

284
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,080
and you are my life.

285
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,581
Dr. Melendez saved me once.

286
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,382
He's gonna do it again.

287
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,125
Be brave with me.

288
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,854
Okay.

289
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,987
You found me.

290
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,353
Hmm.

291
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,306
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
I'm here to help you.

292
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,977
What's your name?

293
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,809
Vera.

294
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,745
- Where does it hurt, Vera?
- Everywhere.

295
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,916
But mostly the shoulder...

296
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,830
Take a deep breath, please.

297
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,871
Your lungs are fine.

298
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,645
- Can you feel your hands?
- Yeah.

299
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,582
That means you have no nerve damage.

300
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,781
It missed your vital organs.

301
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,051
I can remove it
without risking permanent injury.

302
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,520
That's good news.

303
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
This is bad.

304
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,699
When I cut, brace this.

305
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,802
Her neck cannot move at all.

306
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,947
Making initial midline incision
to posterior neck.

307
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,221
It'll take time
before we can move that bar.

308
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,134
Fine. We need to get a sense of the kid's
injuries before you do anything.

309
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,952
I need to get under
there and take a look.

310
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:00,976
Follow me.

311
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,805
Asthma and dust inhalation.
Bad combination.

312
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,244
Take deep breaths.

313
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,317
Higher. Higher.

314
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,585
Where her lungs are.

315
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,747
- You're the one who can hear them.
- There.

316
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,756
Deeper.

317
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,852
Trying. Just... can't.

318
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,826
That's probably because your lungs
are hyperinflated.

319
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:33,167
Start nebulizer, albuterol and oxygen
at eight liters per minute.

320
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,597
Why are you using plaster of Paris?

321
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,438
Told me cast her arm, you didn't tell me...

322
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,638
To use fiberglass, which takes half
the time and is twice as effective?

323
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,977
I wasn't aware I had
to instruct you on common sense.

324
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,049
Bitch.

325
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,468
<i>Can I speak to Dr. Lim, please?</i>

326
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:07,568
Shaun, where are you?

327
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,666
I found a woman with shoulder
and leg impalements.

328
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,870
I'm going to extract the shoulder,

329
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,573
but freeing the leg could sever
the posterior tibial artery.

330
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,843
- That sounds bad.
- You would die.

331
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,678
<i>- What's the leg impaled on?</i>
- Mm. It appears to be steel rebar.

332
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,086
<i>We'll send down a firefighter.</i>

333
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,053
Once they've sawed through the rebar,
they'll transport her up.

334
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,926
Keep this channel open
so I can hear you.

335
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:40,339
- Have they found Lea?
- No, they're still searching.

336
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,502
Okay.

337
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,422
Aaron, can you head back to the ER
when you finish?

338
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,963
Not unless you can take

339
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,090
the transected aorta
being prepped in OR 3.

340
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,862
I've got a myocardial contusion
and tamponade in 2.

341
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,733
Ceiling fan fell on this guy's chest.

342
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,270
I'll see you on the other side.

343
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Yeah.

344
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,143
- We've got a bleed.
- Clamp.

345
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,881
The hardware tore a muscular branch
of her right vertebral artery.

346
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,724
I can't find the bleed without suction.

347
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,562
I see it.

348
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,101
Vitals are stable,
but she's lost too much blood.

349
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,503
We can't keep cutting
until we give her a transfusion.

350
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,597
Check all local hospitals
and blood banks.

351
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,370
See who can get us O-negative, stat.

352
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,104
There might be another way
to transfuse her.

353
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,519
So I'm 16, in my dad's car,
a dime bag in my pocket,

354
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,425
- and a cop approaching...
- Did you get arrested?

355
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,193
Hey, let me tell the story.
It's got a beginning, middle and end.

356
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,164
- I want the end.
- Better with the middle.

357
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:20,469
We roll down the window, and the cop
is hit with a cloud of smoke.

358
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,973
She makes us get out,

359
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,441
pats us down,
searches the whole car...

360
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,175
I'll be right back.

361
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,476
Wait, come on!
Don't leave me hanging.

362
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,676
- Come on.
- She didn't find anything.

363
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,150
Our bodies can do amazing things.
Even hide dime bags.

364
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,452
Holy crap, dude.
Wait, did you still smoke it?

365
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,521
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, man, you did. Ew.

366
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,321
How bad is it?

367
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,058
His spine's been severed.

368
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,165
He's lost a lot of blood,

369
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,835
no femoral pulses,
his legs are ice cold.

370
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,042
The bar's basically cross-clamping
his abdominal aorta.

371
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,314
He's gonna bleed out
when we lift the bar.

372
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,694
No, there's gotta be something
we can do.

373
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,732
We can get his dad here
before it's too late.

374
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:34,378
Inject five CCs bupivacaine,
wait 20 minutes, then pull it out.

375
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,245
You here for me to discharge
our asthmatic?

376
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,479
No. She's gotten worse.

377
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,350
And she's complaining
about back pain.

378
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,357
She fell during the earthquake.
Symptom explained.

379
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,393
Sutures need to be closer.

380
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,146
Add budesonide to her nebulizer.
That should help her breathing.

381
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,993
I think she might be pregnant.

382
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,930
Shortness of breath plus back pain

383
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,264
could be UTI,
kidney stones, or pregnancy.

384
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,370
Urine dip ruled out UTI
and kidney stones.

385
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,565
Her symptoms have nothing to do
with the earthquake?

386
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:01,999
It's possible.

387
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,001
How can you be both slow and sloppy?

388
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,706
This is my first time doing sutures.

389
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,777
Finish up so I can discharge him.

390
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,545
Stop with the zebra hunting.
Put her on budesonide and clear the bed.

391
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,589
I asked you to be my hands,
not my brain.

392
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:20,023
Dr. Reznick, I'm over the bitch plan.
After three years of it.

393
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,558
- We're in crisis.
- That you're using to rehabilitate

394
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,529
your reputation with Andrews,
which is fine.

395
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,964
But stop biting the hands
that are your hands.

396
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,569
What are you doing?

397
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,442
Sterilizing the instrument.

398
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,914
Do you know someone with cancer?

399
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:44,742
Uh...

400
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,250
I'm curious why you were
at a fundraiser for cancer research.

401
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,757
I was there for a man...

402
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,495
one without cancer
or any interest in being with me.

403
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,967
My ex-boyfriend is on the board
of the charity.

404
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,064
Why did you want
to see your ex-boyfriend?

405
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,972
I guess...

406
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,636
I hoped he'd realize he was still in love
with me and beg me to take him back.

407
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,950
- Clever, huh?
- I understand.

408
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,525
I still want Lea to be my girlfriend.

409
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,653
But she doesn't feel the same way?

410
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:38,670
- I have autism.
- Oh, Shaun, that shouldn't...

411
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,410
Why didn't you warn me?

412
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,216
Studies have shown that anticipation
only heightens pain.

413
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,520
I used small talk to distract you.

414
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,334
Where did you two meet?

415
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,735
Church.

416
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,513
Not a member anymore.

417
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:27,876
Hey.

418
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,854
Place that in the surgical cavity.

419
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,395
- You made a cell saver out of a...
- Beer engine.

420
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,466
I ran alcohol through it
to sterilize it.

421
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,470
Attach this to an IV.

422
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,810
We're going to pump her own blood
back into her.

423
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,919
We've got somebody down here.

424
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,079
Can you hear us? We're coming.

425
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,493
- Lea. Are you okay?
- I think so.

426
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,767
Hey, how long before you guys
can get this thing off?

427
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,513
We're working on it.

428
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,800
You said your dad thinks
you're a screwup.

429
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,867
Has he actually said that?

430
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,132
No.

431
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,837
The reason I told you that story is...

432
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,143
everyone does dumb stuff
when they're a teenager.

433
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:10,019
I bet your dad doesn't judge you
nearly as harshly as you think.

434
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,959
My dad doesn't know me,
and neither do you.

435
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,493
Can you stay with him?

436
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,776
That's incredible.

437
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,286
Thank you.

438
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,154
Spend enough time around Dr. Browne,
you get used to incredible.

439
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,936
Okay. Thank you.

440
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:06,178
There'll be a cruiser waiting to pick
Casey's dad up when he lands.

441
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,939
What if we compress Casey's aorta
against his spine,

442
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,879
create a higher cross-clamp?

443
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,918
You didn't tell him yet, did you?

444
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:14,752
No.

445
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,717
We could buy time to repair his aorta
after we lift the bar.

446
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,957
- Casey is about Kellan's age...
- This has nothing to do with Kellan.

447
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,467
Yes, it's a 1 percent chance
of success if we do this,

448
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,968
against a 100 percent chance
of death if we don't.

449
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,070
Okay. Prep him.

450
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,117
When will we know
she's going to be okay?

451
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,649
When she wakes up.

452
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:55,087
Still a risk of infection.
Let's get her stabilized and out of here.

453
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,299
I'm administering the budesonide
and checking to see if she's pregnant.

454
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,666
- I told her I'm on the pill.
- Ever miss a day?

455
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,642
Look at that, an unoccupied uterus.

456
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,445
Prep for discharge.

457
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,451
Can you give me something
for my back pain?

458
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,314
It's bruised from when you fell
in the earthquake.

459
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,981
- Take some Tylenol.
- It's been bad all week.

460
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,423
Muscle relaxers usually help.

461
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,690
Check her tubes.

462
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,307
You're pregnant.

463
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,408
The fetus is developing
inside your fallopian tube.

464
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,312
It's an ectopic pregnancy,
it's not viable.

465
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,677
That's a relief.

466
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,446
But if your fallopian tube ruptures,

467
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,715
it can cause a serious,
possibly fatal bleed.

468
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,052
We'll get you into surgery
soon as possible

469
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,820
to make sure that doesn't happen.

470
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,163
It's gonna be fine.

471
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,810
If we get out of this alive,
let's promise to move on.

472
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,881
You can do better than Lea.

473
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,547
Not that I have any business
suggesting that.

474
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,716
I might die because I'm still hung up
on Paul.

475
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:41,730
No, I don't want to move on.

476
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,264
If she doesn't feel like...

477
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,998
I always knew
I could be a good doctor.

478
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:54,541
But until I met Lea,
I never knew I could drive a car.

479
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,614
Or enjoy music.

480
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,379
Or sing karaoke.

481
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,714
Or take tequila shots.

482
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,388
Or fall in love.

483
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,999
I don't want to stop being
the person I am with her.

484
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,199
Lea makes me...

485
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,934
more.

486
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,611
<i>But I don't make her more.</i>

487
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,287
<i>If I did...</i>

488
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,328
then Lea would want
to be my girlfriend.

489
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,620
She's tachycardic and hypotensive.

490
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,456
Abdomen?

491
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,099
- Rigid.
- Her fallopian tube ruptured.

492
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,610
Any chance he can wait an hour?

493
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,343
Rapidly expanding
subdermal hematoma.

494
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,012
It still doesn't hurt. Can't this wait?

495
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,242
- We need to fix something right away.
- Okay.

496
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,247
Whatever you gotta do.

497
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,117
Hey, um, about my dad...

498
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,626
The minute he lands, we'll get him here.

499
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,162
Thank you.

500
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,562
Okay.

501
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,271
She needs a surgeon, stat.

502
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,447
I'm a surgeon.

503
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,445
Harmonic scalpel, DeBakey forceps,

504
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,888
two yankhauer suctions
and vasopressin.

505
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,573
Marta.

506
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,182
Can you squeeze Noreen's hand?

507
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,488
Let's get you to the hospital.

508
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,095
You two, free beer for life.

509
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,801
Aftershock.

510
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:42,299
We need to immobilize your leg.
Cover your head.

511
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,428
Right, get her out of here.

512
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,365
That was a big one.

513
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,827
Oh. Are you okay?

514
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,005
Yeah.

515
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,375
- Just a little... A little motion...
- Oh!

516
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,883
