1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,045
I'm Dr. Browne, I'll be performing
your surgery today.

2
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,606
I'm Dr. Browne, I'll be performing
your surgery today.

3
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,951
I'm Dr. Browne.

4
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,112
I'll be performing your surgery.

5
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,885
It's a very simple procedure.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,627
It's a straightforward procedure.

7
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:32,223
<i>♪ 'Cause I've never known
A love like this before ♪</i>

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,460
It was a successful surgery.

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,404
<i>♪ Baby, I know dreams
Tend to crumble at extremes ♪</i>

10
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,343
The surgery was a success.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,576
We expect a full recovery.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,981
<i>♪ We're surviving
We're still living ♪♪</i>

13
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,986
I expect a full recovery.

14
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,723
Baby... where do you want this?

15
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,987
Uh, thanks, Mom. By my bag.
I'll have the lab run it.

16
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,674
Nausea and severe abdominal pain
after eating.

17
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,647
This patient could need a lap chole.
That would be an ideal first surgery.

18
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,480
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
she may just need an antacid.

19
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,323
Hi, Michelle, I understand
your mother is on her way in.

20
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,655
- I'm Dr. Browne.
- I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,591
You need to fix my sister.

22
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,094
- What's your name?
- Tisha.

23
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,632
Hi, Tisha. Well, that is exactly
why we're here.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,169
- To help your sister.
- Foster sister.

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,365
When did the pain start?

26
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,200
- About an hour ago.
- We was on the bus.

27
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,971
My sister rides with me every day
to school and back.

28
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,147
My brother and I
used to live on a bus.

29
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,212
Cool.

30
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,183
- Have you felt like this before?
- A few times.

31
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,854
Ow.

32
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,322
She has extreme
upper-right quadrant tenderness.

33
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,859
That's consistent with cholecystitis.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,920
As is her fever
and elevated white count.

35
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,832
Your gallbladder probably needs
to be removed.

36
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,000
You must be excited, Claire, this is
going to be your first surgery.

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,374
Has your urine changed color?
Gotten darker?

38
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,058
I hear Dr. Browne might have
landed her first lap chole.

39
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,725
Not exactly a straightforward case.

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,663
The duct is massively dilated,
wall's inflamed,

41
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,495
this scarring,
it's gonna limit visibility.

42
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,732
The thickness of the gallbladder wall
does pose a challenge.

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,565
What do you think?

44
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,509
It's not her decision.
It's mine, the attending.

45
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,242
Doesn't mean she shouldn't offer
her opinion.

46
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,678
I think that, um... Dr. Melendez is right.

47
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,222
With the limited visibility
I shouldn't...

48
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,920
Only with a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy,

49
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,962
which I don't think we should do.

50
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,026
An open procedure would provide
a clear view of the gallbladder

51
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,468
and the surrounding anatomy
despite the inflammation.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,276
Carly and I went on another date
last night.

53
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,871
Mm. What'd you do? Dinner? Movie?

54
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:39,010
We walked 12 minutes to a deli,
and had some food and talked.

55
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,455
- Where are we going?
- Andrews is starting an open chole.

56
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,134
Sounds like it's going well
with you and Carly.

57
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,925
Oh, yes.
She answered all of my questions.

58
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,724
- How many did you ask?
- Eighty-three.

59
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,392
Although, some had multiple parts.

60
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,232
"Do you want to have children?
If yes, how many and when?

61
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,935
Where do you plan to raise them?
In what religious tradition?"

62
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,135
Those are pretty intense.

63
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,108
They're good questions, Claire,
about important topics.

64
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,117
Early on, people usually stick
with lighter stuff.

65
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,279
Favorite movies, bands,
hometowns, small talk.

66
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,493
Put some laps
on the upper-right quadrant.

67
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,086
Here's the bovie.

68
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,995
Isn't the point of dating

69
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,262
to gather information
to determine compatibility?

70
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,768
- Retract the omentum.
- Sure.

71
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,875
Isn't that best achieved by finding out
what's important to the other person?

72
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,172
Hemostats.

73
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,475
It's a process, Shaun,
like peeling an onion.

74
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,450
People are more comfortable
revealing their layers gradually

75
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,784
as opposed to getting sliced right
down the middle.

76
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,123
I heard Dr. Lim selected you
for the first lead.

77
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,889
Guessing you drew a cholecystectomy.
Sponge on a stick.

78
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,555
What's your approach to dissecting,
retrograde or antegrade?

79
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,190
Antegrade, once I've located
the porta hepatis.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,995
I think Carly was comfortable.

81
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,670
Why does it matter what kind of
questions are asked when?

82
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,642
- Aren't the answers what's important?
- I'm sure you're right.

83
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,235
- Yes.
- What is the plan for the next date?

84
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,745
Mm.

85
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,749
We didn't make another date.

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,881
Then I grasp gallbladder
fundus, and elevate it which way?

87
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,889
Superiorly. Is that significant?
No follow-up date?

88
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,358
Not necessarily. How did the
night end? Goodnight kiss?

89
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,521
Now I've exposed the triangle of Calot

90
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,531
and ligated the cystic duct and artery.

91
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,830
- What is the risk at this juncture?
- Lacerating the liver during dissection.

92
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,146
- Correct.
- We didn't kiss.

93
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,366
Ironically, a complication which

94
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,431
I've inadvertently just demonstrated.

95
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,737
Hold direct pressure,
I need better exposure.

96
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,040
I sliced instead of peeled.

97
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,746
You are familiar
with the Pringle procedure?

98
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,181
Yes, although I've never...

99
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,011
Clamp down the portal triad
with an atraumatic hemostat clamp.

100
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,689
Then use a number-two catgut suture.

101
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,673
Shaun? Just go to her and explain.

102
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,402
If what I said made
her uncomfortable,

103
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,070
then saying more could make her
more uncomfortable.

104
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,976
I sliced instead of peeled.

105
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,578
After Michelle's surgery,
I will go and talk to Carly.

106
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,918
Good.

107
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,485
You can talk to her soon.

108
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,594
OR Two had a cancellation,
your surgery is in 45 minutes.

109
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,728
I'm Dr. Browne, I will be
performing Michelle's surgery.

110
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,340
I will be removing her gallbladder,
a simple procedure.

111
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,014
We're gonna make sure your daughter
is well taken care of.

112
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,779
Ow!

113
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:02,289
- Sir, we need to decapitate it.
- No, don't. I'm begging you.

114
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,482
Don't. Please.

115
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,951
- I can't get an image.
- How did that... Is that a swordfish?

116
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,089
With that dorsal fin? It's a marlin.

117
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,100
I hooked him with a naked ballyhoo,
battled for an hour.

118
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,166
Suddenly, he leapt out of the water,
came right at me.

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,536
Save the story, Quint.
We need to cut the thing in half.

120
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,805
No, 40-plus years I've been chasing this.
You can't behead him.

121
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,847
We can't leave his nose in
your leg either.

122
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,108
His bill.

123
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,276
Can't you just... pull him out gently?

124
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,331
- I'll sign a waiver.
- The pull-out method never works.

125
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,257
If any of your blood vessels
are damaged, it gets messy.

126
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,619
Congrats,
your surgery is on the schedule.

127
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,738
- How's his distal pulse?
- Little thready but still there.

128
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,199
- We need to get him to an MRI.
- I'm not going anywhere without Franklin.

129
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,665
- I named him after my father.
- You and Franklin both won't fit.

130
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,840
How? You said he was dead.

131
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,173
- I didn't take a pulse.
- Get something to kill it.

132
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,973
- No, it's dead.
- It's moving.

133
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,174
Post-mortem response.
You are doctors, don't people do this?

134
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,409
- No!
- No!

135
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,383
- I'll help you review at lunch.
- Surgery's in 20 minutes.

136
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,422
- Good luck.
- You too.

137
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,300
- "I want to..."
- "I want to..."

138
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,003
No, no, I haven't left.

139
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,171
- "I want to be..."
- "Want to...

140
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,339
- Great."
- "...great,

141
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,776
- or nothing."
- "...nothing."

142
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,853
Got it. I'll be back as soon as I can.

143
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,553
Hi, you must be Michelle's mother.
I'm Dr. Browne, I'll be...

144
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,356
Yeah, how long will she have to stay?
Hospitals make me nervous.

145
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,855
- Three days to a week, depending on...
- But she's gonna miss school.

146
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,800
And she watches Tisha
and her brothers in the afternoon.

147
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,114
Your daughter has a serious infection
in her gallbladder.

148
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:02,098
She's been experiencing symptoms
on and off for a while now.

149
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,940
She never told me that.
Why didn't you tell me that?

150
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,915
- Momma...
- My point is,

151
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,384
she's been ill for a while,
so her recovery may take...

152
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,981
Mom? Please, my... my chest hurts.

153
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,061
- What's wrong?
- Oxygen levels are dropping, tachycardic.

154
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,096
I need a chest CT, stat.

155
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,238
You had a blood clot in the artery
that feeds your lungs,

156
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,434
called a pulmonary embolism.
Medicine broke it up.

157
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,941
- How?
- According to our scan,

158
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,956
it was part of a larger clot in your leg
that broke off and traveled there.

159
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,677
As for why the larger one formed,

160
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,178
when I asked you if you were taking
birth control pills, you said no.

161
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,881
Was that the truth?

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,786
You asked me in front of Tisha.

163
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,525
I'm doing it with my boyfriend,

164
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,994
I don't want babies,
so I'm taking birth control.

165
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,295
- How long have you been taking them?
- A year?

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,369
I'm prescribing condoms
for your boyfriend.

167
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,898
Go off the pill to prevent further clots.

168
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,033
Dr. Browne is gonna place
an IVC filter via your femoral vein,

169
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,008
in case other parts of the clot break off.

170
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,646
Your surgery's gonna have to wait.

171
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,443
What are you doing?

172
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,845
This is where the catheter goes in.

173
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,426
How did you get these scars?

174
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,290
I cut myself climbing a fence.

175
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,136
Those scars...

176
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:49,172
They're straight, in a row,
all the same length.

177
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,146
I don't believe you got them
from a fence.

178
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,520
I don't care what you believe.

179
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,556
Kids who cut,

180
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,763
most of them are really sad,

181
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,764
in a lot of pain,

182
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,205
and cutting makes them feel better.
Is that how it is with you?

183
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,069
I don't wanna talk about it.

184
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,876
Okay.

185
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,034
- My life sucks, okay?
- Tell me how.

186
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,139
Why? It won't change anything.

187
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,877
Talking might make you feel better.

188
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,717
And maybe I can help.

189
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,255
I live in a foster home,
but I'm not a foster kid.

190
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,453
I'm a whole mother,
but I've never had a baby.

191
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,221
My mom brought three kids in

192
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,823
and now it's my job
to take care of them.

193
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,766
Make breakfast, get the kids dressed,
take them to school,

194
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,932
go to school, pick them up,
dinner, homework, laundry, repeat.

195
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,045
I barely ever leave the house
without a kid attached to me.

196
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,841
Can you help me with that?

197
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,579
Michelle wouldn't hurt
herself on purpose.

198
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,979
Michelle is unhappy.
She feels pressure to look after

199
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,456
- her foster siblings, help out at home.
- Yeah, her home life is fine.

200
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,293
I'll talk to her.

201
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,688
It might be helpful to have her speak
with a psychiatrist.

202
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,528
My daughter is not crazy. We don't
do psychiatrists, you know that.

203
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,364
That needs to change.

204
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,199
- When is her surgery?
- Tomorrow.

205
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,465
Thank you.

206
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,665
I will speak to my daughter.

207
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,110
Don't.

208
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,576
It's your job
to fix her gallbladder, not her life.

209
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,952
It's your first surgery.
Don't get distracted.

210
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,794
- Have you talked to Carly?
- No.

211
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,699
Blood pressure is 62 over 31,
your patient is in cardiac arrest.

212
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,371
I know.

213
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,307
You're practicing
the Pringle maneuver

214
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,248
in the event of a liver bleed?

215
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,819
Yes.

216
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,387
- That was better.
- Thanks.

217
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,551
- Now you can talk to Carly.
- I need to practice.

218
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:56,028
Dr. Lim says getting away from things

219
00:13:56,135 --> 00:14:00,038
every now and again,
having balance in our lives,

220
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,769
can be just as important
to our performance as practice.

221
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,847
Maybe you should get some balance
by talking to Carly, I don't know.

222
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,884
I'm nervous about my surgery, Shaun.

223
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,945
Practice will make me less nervous,
that will improve my performance.

224
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,653
Okay.

225
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,095
Okay.

226
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,231
You should practice not causing
a liver bleed.

227
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,693
Planning on it.

228
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:34,905
Also, how you will recover
if you cut the portal vein,

229
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,943
that's potentially fatal.

230
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,212
Or if you perforate the small bowel,

231
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,215
which could cause sepsis,
leading to death.

232
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,547
Or cut the common bile duct
which would cause...

233
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,554
- Gonna talk to Carly. Right now.
- Right now?

234
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,886
- Aren't you still nervous?
- Nope. All better.

235
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,825
- What blade for the Kocher?
- What?

236
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,194
Incision for the chole, what blade?

237
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,292
Uh...

238
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,130
- Ten.
- Mm-hm.

239
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,064
No! They won't both fit in the MRI.

240
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,770
Fish boy doesn't buy it.

241
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,968
Location of the incision?

242
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,810
Why are you trying to help me?

243
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,114
Lim picked you for the first surgery.

244
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,211
That makes you
the front-runner for chief resident.

245
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,813
This is me sucking up.

246
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,523
I've never been big on pretense...

247
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,757
- Are you okay?
- What just happened?

248
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,031
The marlin had metal in his body.
Lures.

249
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,299
I think a license plate flew by me.

250
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,338
Franklin. Oh, no! Franklin.

251
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,943
Ah! It's okay. Franklin's okay.

252
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,144
It all came out one side.

253
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,285
It won't show when I mount him.

254
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,690
Well, thank goodness
for small miracles.

255
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,857
Ow!

256
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,362
- Got his femoral.
- Call the OR. We're coming.

257
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,904
Hang on, Dr. Browne.

258
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,881
Need to make an incision above
and below the arterial injury site.

259
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,717
We need to clamp
the femoral proximal to the

260
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,982
bleed without clipping the femoral nerve.

261
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,217
Got it. I feel the nerve
above my index finger.

262
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,324
One down.

263
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,025
- My hand is starting to cramp.
- Lean this way.

264
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,087
Rotate your wrist.
Just a little bit more.

265
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,100
Let's see if that holds.

266
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,212
Go get cleaned up.
We'll take it from here.

267
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,756
I wanted to check
the patient's blood work.

268
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,852
He's negative for HIV, hep B and C.
You don't need prophylactic meds.

269
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,596
I'm nervous about my surgery.

270
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,602
You'll be fine.

271
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,097
And don't ever say that again.

272
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:26,042
Why? Weren't you nervous
before your first lead?

273
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:31,042
If I was, I didn't volunteer that
to the chief of surgery, or anyone.

274
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,451
We're women, we're not white,
and we're surgeons.

275
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,853
Unicorns consider us a fabled species.

276
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,825
We don't get the luxury
of public insecurity.

277
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,363
I will aspire to repressed stoicism
in the future.

278
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,422
We don't need to be insecure,

279
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,431
because every step of the way,

280
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,766
we've had to be twice as good
as everybody else.

281
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,635
Suck it up. You got this.

282
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,356
Don't forget we have our session
with Dr. Donovan today.

283
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,026
I won't.

284
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,468
- Your patient?
- Mm-hm?

285
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,296
What are they like?

286
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,973
Man, woman? Young, old?

287
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,565
Woman.

288
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,239
Girl, actually.

289
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:12,510
She's tough, smart, really sad.

290
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,252
Her mom has her taking care
of three foster kids.

291
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,850
At least you were only looking after me.

292
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,498
- How old?
- Fourteen.

293
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:35,168
Although she acts a lot older.
She's been having sex for almost a year.

294
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,073
You were that age with Wayne.

295
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,440
- I didn't have sex with Wayne.
- What?

296
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,546
He was in love with you,
always sniffing around our place.

297
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,110
Maybe. He didn't get any.

298
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,016
So who? Junior prom guy, Derek?

299
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,718
Derek... No.

300
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,130
I didn't lose my virginity
until sophomore year of college.

301
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,599
- What were you hoping for, a proposal?
- No.

302
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,068
I wanted it to be special.

303
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,903
Ah. Good for you.

304
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,103
I wouldn't have held out,
but good for you.

305
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,308
I thought for sure you and Wayne
were doing it.

306
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,112
- You were okay with that?
- You were so serious.

307
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,889
So restrained.

308
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,588
We talked about birth control.

309
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,790
I figured, "Good for her,
she's finally relaxing, having some fun."

310
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,229
Well, I was so restrained and serious

311
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,103
because I never knew
when you were gonna fall apart.

312
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,671
Gotta get to work.

313
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,784
I'll be back before Michelle goes
into surgery.

314
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,953
Have you had a chance to talk to her?
About cutting?

315
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,860
Oh, some fool friend
of hers gave her the idea.

316
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,167
- She's not unhappy, it's peer pressure.
- She sounded unhappy to me.

317
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:13,568
She's upset I didn't let her hang out
with friends, typical teen drama.

318
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,267
She promised me she's done.

319
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,004
Self-harming behavior doesn't just stop.
Michelle might need...

320
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,480
Dr. Browne, my daughter needs to have
surgery and get out of this hospital.

321
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,027
You didn't tell your mom the truth

322
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,234
about why you cut yourself,
about how unhappy you are.

323
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,967
I tried. She didn't wanna hear it.

324
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,863
Just said that things aren't always
gonna go my way

325
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,102
and I need to be responsible.
Like I'm not already.

326
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,350
Growing up, I had to
take care of my mom.

327
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,428
- What was wrong?
- She's mentally ill.

328
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:15,058
Bipolar disorder,
and a drinking problem, pills.

329
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,002
When things were bad,
she'd forget to buy groceries,

330
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,439
or clean the trailer, or pick me up.

331
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,501
Or she'd spend all our rent
on something stupid.

332
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:32,382
Now, I thought
if I could make her life easy enough,

333
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,512
if I cooked and cleaned
and got good grades,

334
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,254
that she'd get better.

335
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,548
But she never did.

336
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,390
And for the longest time, I thought
it was my fault she was sick.

337
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,889
I probably still would,

338
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,732
if a psychiatrist hadn't
refused to believe me

339
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,772
when I said I was fine.

340
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,271
You've been to a psychiatrist?

341
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,810
But you're, like, a fancy surgeon.

342
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,588
I could have a therapist come see you
before your surgery.

343
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,731
Okay.

344
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,517
He should be getting better. It's gotta be
an infection from the marlin.

345
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,321
Aeromonas or
mycobacterium marinum.

346
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,421
- Would've responded to the antibiotics.
- Guys, I'm trying to focus.

347
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,468
What if he has an underlying
autoimmune disorder?

348
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:00,536
Could've been triggered by the surgery,
even the initial stabbing.

349
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,835
It would explain
the leg ulcerations progressing

350
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,344
despite good arterial flow.
We could see if he responds to steroids.

351
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,971
Which could kill him
if it is an infection.

352
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,250
We could run an ANA,
see if he's positive.

353
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,348
What about a parasite?
Rhinosporidium seeberi or gill worm?

354
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,052
Have you talked to Carly?

355
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,060
Sorry, I got sidetracked by a marlin.

356
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,308
- Come in.
- You wanted to see me?

357
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,348
Ms. Reynolds tells me you went
against her wishes

358
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,286
and had her daughter speak
with a psychiatrist.

359
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,584
Uh...

360
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:55,593
- Michelle asked to see a therapist.
- Only after you talked her into it.

361
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,188
I'm gonna report you to the
medical board. You had no right...

362
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,425
Dr. Browne,

363
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,559
were you concerned that Michelle
might be a serious danger to herself?

364
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,766
- Yes.
- In that case, the consult was required.

365
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:11,105
That said, Dr. Browne's failure
to inform you was inappropriate.

366
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,506
You're off the case.
Dr. Melendez will perform the surgery.

367
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,254
How are you doing?

368
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,926
Claire?

369
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,058
Today's a big day for you. First surgery?

370
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,925
- We don't need to talk about that.
- I think we do.

371
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,598
You've taken care of your mother for
a long time.

372
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,572
That's a pattern you both need
to break out of.

373
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,210
I know I haven't always been there
for you, and I just...

374
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,913
- I'm trying to change that.
- I know, Mom.

375
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,541
I'm good, everything is fine.

376
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,382
And your first surgery?
Is that this afternoon?

377
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,744
It's...

378
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,549
Actually, it's not. Um...

379
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,223
I arranged a psych consult
without the mother's permission,

380
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,123
so I got thrown off the case.

381
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,895
How could the hospital allow that?
What is wrong with them?

382
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,803
- After how hard you've worked...
- It's okay, Mom. They had to.

383
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,238
- That must be a disappointment.
- It is.

384
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,972
Anything else, Claire?

385
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,885
I'm upset, humiliated.

386
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:33,419
So, so mad at my patient's mother
for not taking care of her daughter.

387
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,324
And I'm... I'm relieved.

388
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:41,296
I'm so relieved
to have that weight off of me,

389
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,029
- and that makes me feel like a fraud.
- Don't say that.

390
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,937
How can I be so scared to do something
I have wanted for so long?

391
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,276
Because things that matter are scary.

392
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,007
That's how I feel about coming here,

393
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,807
talking about my life and our relationship.

394
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,546
What if I can't fix it?

395
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,785
What if I can't make up
for all the times I've let you down?

396
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,826
And then I think...

397
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,989
"Just be like Claire."

398
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,865
Because nothing stops you, ever.

399
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:26,008
You see what you want and
go after it with everything you've got.

400
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,471
You are an inspiration.

401
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,577
You're my inspiration.

402
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,500
Carly. Hi. Do you have a second?

403
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:52,333
OR Two is waiting to learn
the patient's mass wasn't cancerous,

404
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,202
so they can close.
I can come back. Mm-hm.

405
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,504
I'll meet you at the cafe? Okay.

406
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,288
Cancer. The marlin guy has cancer.

407
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,858
CT chest, abdomen and pelvis
showed no masses.

408
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:17,295
It's in his leg. It explains progressive
ulcerations despite arterial flow.

409
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,956
And why the antibiotics aren't working.

410
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,496
We'll send a tissue sample
from the ulcerated area.

411
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,403
And when I'm chief resident,
I'll remember this.

412
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,735
- There's a problem with Michelle.
- I'm not doing it.

413
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,212
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me what to do.

414
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,378
- I want Dr. Browne.
- Michelle? What's going on?

415
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:42,145
I want you to do my surgery.
Her, Mom, not somebody else.

416
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,314
Dr. Melendez is gonna do your surgery,
he is great...

417
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,757
He's not you. You care about me.

418
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,954
Everybody here
cares about you, Michelle.

419
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,156
Please sit,
you could rupture your gallbladder.

420
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,063
- I don't wanna get better.
- Don't say that.

421
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,433
- It's the truth!
- Michelle, you need this surgery.

422
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,166
That is all that matters,
not whether I do it.

423
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:07,408
I'm gonna be there, I will be watching
from the gallery the whole time.

424
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,178
You just... You need to sit down.

425
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,259
The kid okay?

426
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,326
I had to pull you off.

427
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,667
If you made the tiniest misstep,

428
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,708
that mom would go from threat
to lawsuit.

429
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,071
Is Patricia okay with me watching?

430
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,444
No.

431
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,078
You can't remove her gallbladder
from the gallery.

432
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,384
- What?
- You're doing Michelle's surgery.

433
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,085
How'd you get the mom
to change her mind?

434
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,616
I explained that given Dr. Browne's
commitment to her daughter,

435
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,322
she's the perfect choice to lead.

436
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,831
Especially with me over her shoulder
the whole time.

437
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,669
- Thank you for fighting for me.
- That's what bosses do. Let's go.

438
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,579
- You stood me up.
- Sorry.

439
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:20,846
What's up?

440
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,386
Shaun's a little worried
he may have freaked you out

441
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,356
with his questionnaire
the other night.

442
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,589
I thought it was cool.
Small talk bores the hell out of me.

443
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,321
Well, then, great. I'll tell him.

444
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:37,097
Shaun got worried about that all
on his own? It doesn't seem like him.

445
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,861
I may have mentioned

446
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,832
that people don't usually ask deeply
personal questions on an early date.

447
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,177
Claire, I like you,
but we don't really know each other.

448
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:53,579
And yet you decided how I was going
to react to Shaun's questions,

449
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,019
which isn't your business.
And you were wrong.

450
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,425
Totally, totally wrong.

451
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,391
Shaun and I don't need you
or anyone

452
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,862
to run interference
on our relationship.

453
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,259
Butt out.

454
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,827
Is everybody ready for a time-out?

455
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,599
Dr. Claire Browne, lead surgeon.

456
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,862
Dr. Neil Melendez, attending surgeon.

457
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,802
Dr. Shaun Murphy, assisting.

458
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,269
Dr. Jan Lancaster, anesthesia.

459
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,037
Donna Petringa, scrub nurse.

460
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,305
Shani Walden, circulating nurse.

461
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,610
Patient is Michelle Reynolds.

462
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,150
We'll be performing
an open cholecystectomy.

463
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,118
All tools I need are confirmed
to be present,

464
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,281
estimated blood loss, 100 cc's,

465
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,824
patient will go to the ICU after surgery.

466
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,655
Is everybody in agreement?

467
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,988
Dr. Murphy, have you chloroprepped
the site?

468
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:47,692
I have.

469
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Ten blade.

470
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,225
Sponge.

471
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,176
Top layer of abdominal muscle
is exposed.

472
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,212
I'll need a bovie to cut through.

473
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,524
Nice work, Dr. Browne.

474
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,634
Bookwalter retractor.

475
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:07,201
I see the liver and I need to better
expose the inferior surface.

476
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,271
Retract the duodenum inferiorly, please.

477
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,052
Gallbladder exposed.

478
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,063
Dr. Browne?

479
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,766
There's more scarring
than the imaging suggested.

480
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,929
True.

481
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,636
Talk through your approach.

482
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,910
I grasp the gallbladder
fundus forward

483
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,816
and use a right-angle clamp
and suction

484
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,753
to develop a plane
around the gallbladder.

485
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,452
Kelly clamp, right-angle clamp
and suction.

486
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:17,945
That was elegant use
of the Kelly clamp.

487
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:28,050
I see the cystic duct and
behind it, the cystic artery.

488
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,151
I need my first assist to confirm

489
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,198
that I have identified the common
bile duct and it is out of the way.

490
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,534
- Yes, cutting the duct would be...
- Very, very bad.

491
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,166
Move the gallbladder,
cranially, a little bit.

492
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,803
Titanium clip applier.

493
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,694
You sure you have a clear view?

494
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,162
Making the cut.

495
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,790
She's hemorrhaging.

496
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,362
I can't see the source
of the bleeding.

497
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,101
MAP is 45 and dropping.

498
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,045
What do you think is happening?

499
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:10,220
Most likely, my scissors'
tip nicked the right hepatic artery.

500
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,890
It happens. It's happened to me.

501
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,065
I need to clamp the common
hepatic artery, repair the arterial wall

502
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:23,666
- with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.
- That's what I would do.

503
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,822
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, slow down.
No running. No running.

504
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,458
Dr. Browne, how's my daughter?

505
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,230
The surgery was a success
and we expect a full recovery.

506
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,135
I wanna see her.

507
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,704
Is that okay?

508
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,502
- Yay!
- Okay, okay.

509
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,749
Michelle says
she wants to be a doctor.

510
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,545
She would be a great one.

511
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:49,188
Uh, that therapist Michelle talked to?

512
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,325
Could I get her card?

513
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,566
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Mom.

514
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,918
Three, two, one.

515
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,531
You were right.
He had angiosarcoma of the leg.

516
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,069
Had to amputate,
but the margins were clean.

517
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,601
- What happened to...
- Franklin!

518
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:43,771
Franklin, you amazing fish.

519
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,909
You saved my life!

520
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,181
Come on. Bring him in. Bring him in.

521
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,282
Oh.

522
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,732
Thank you, guys. Group hug.

523
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,772
Do you prefer to work in a team

524
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,572
or do you prefer to lead
or follow commands?

525
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,977
Team. And lead.

526
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,296
