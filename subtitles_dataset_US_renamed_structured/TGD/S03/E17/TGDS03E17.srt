1
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,502
Wes Keeler, 49,

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,269
prick to the upper right arm
by a cactus four days ago.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,810
Temp 102.5.

4
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,573
Wound is seriously infected.

5
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,175
He was leading a camping trip
on Mount Thayer.

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,547
We couldn't leave them up there alone.
BP is 86 over 51.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,880
Tachycardic.
Rapid, shallow breathing.

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,827
- Signs of sepsis.
- You gonna cut his arm off?

9
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,723
- I'll be fine.
- We need to debride the wound, stat.

10
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,733
Shaun, I've been looking all over
for you.

11
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,034
Hey, how about getting
some breakfast?

12
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,542
- Some pancakes?
- No. I'm not hungry.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,438
Okay. Um, how about coming over
for dinner tonight?

14
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,175
Is Debbie making lasagna?

15
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,944
- She could.
- No, thank you.

16
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:56,357
Okay, Shaun, can we just stop
and talk for just a minute?

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,055
Why aren't you responding
to my texts?

18
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,122
Are you upset?
Are you sad because of Lea?

19
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:08,395
Yes, I am very sad,
but it will be okay.

20
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,234
- Yeah. Of course it'll be okay.
- I'm still going to be with Lea.

21
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,839
Wait, what?

22
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,103
She said she loves me.

23
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,048
She also gave you a hundred reasons
why she can't be with you, Shaun.

24
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,278
Yes, she gave me very specific
reasons why we can't be together,

25
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,287
but I've overcome other challenges
to become a good doctor,

26
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,913
- a good friend.
- It's not about

27
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,892
overcoming challenges.
It's not about you.

28
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,420
It's about Lea.

29
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,395
I can't take two steps
without falling down.

30
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,061
Is the issue balance or weakness?

31
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,764
All of the above.
Fatigue, dizziness,

32
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,431
light-headedness, headaches,
occasional bouts of nausea.

33
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,170
- When...
- Five years ago just after the birth

34
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,576
of my daughter, and there's no
discernible fluctuation

35
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,478
based on time of day
or time of the month.

36
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,107
Temp 98.2, BP 111 over 78.

37
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,881
That'll drop to 80 over 50
when I'm upright.

38
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,922
I don't drink, smoke, or take drugs.

39
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,686
I haven't traveled outside
the country in the last 10 years

40
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,124
and there's no family history
of a similar condition.

41
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,190
- You've been through this before?
- Seventeen times.

42
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,961
Eighteen if you count the naturopath
in Seattle, which I don't.

43
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,093
No one has been able to give me
a diagnosis.

44
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,637
We need to do an EKG and stress test,
get a CT of your chest, abdomen,

45
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,769
- and pelvis...
- Let me save you some time.

46
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,774
Five years' worth of tests, labs,
scans, reports.

47
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,115
My entire medical odyssey.

48
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,280
Fun.

49
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,800
Set up in the lounge,
and give me copies of each of those...

50
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:53,873
Claire.

51
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,871
Dash. Oh, my God.

52
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,646
- Why are you here?
- Uh, you changed your number.

53
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,944
Right. Um, it's a long story.

54
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,213
Dash, you remember Dr. Melendez,
Dr. Murphy?

55
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,377
Yeah, of course.

56
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,682
Uh, you gave my wife
six more good months.

57
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,315
We considered
renaming our cat after you.

58
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,522
That would have been foolish.
Cats remember their names.

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,661
Sorry for your loss.
Wish we could've done more.

60
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,960
Why don't you two catch up?

61
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,739
Hi.

62
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,175
I think the infection spread

63
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,479
because of underlying damage
to your liver and kidney.

64
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,043
We'll keep you on a prolonged course
of IV antibiotics.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,679
Hey, you hear that, guys?

66
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,924
Hep C and heroin
aren't as much fun as they sound.

67
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,017
One was more fun
than the other, for a while.

68
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,259
- Don't they have somewhere else to go?
- Not likely.

69
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,625
Most of them haven't seen
their parents in years, so they're with me.

70
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,704
Survivalist training program
for at-risk youth.

71
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,935
We prefer young adults
with unrealized potential.

72
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,205
I'm supposed to be teaching
these yahoos responsibility and...

73
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,276
good decision-making.

74
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,277
Hell of an example.

75
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,119
Oof.

76
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,615
He's gotten a new murmur.

77
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,158
BP is dropping.

78
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,421
Wes, we need
to take a look at your heart.

79
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,765
The infection's spread.
It's damaged your aortic valve.

80
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,736
You need emergency surgery.

81
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,811
Mm. What about vasculitis
or dysautonomia?

82
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,356
Both are consistent
with weakness and fatigue.

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,484
Her temporal artery biopsy
was negative. Rules out vasculitis.

84
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,290
I thought I saw something
about dysautonomia in here.

85
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,128
There are 15 different causes
of dysautonomia.

86
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,360
Seven have been ruled out.

87
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,993
The rest are inconsistent
with Alice's symptoms

88
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,572
or have no definitive diagnostic test.

89
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,665
How did you make Dr. Lim
fall in love with you

90
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,369
after you had been friends
for so long?

91
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,117
I assume that's directed at you.

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,184
I don't think you make anyone
fall in love with you, Shaun.

93
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,157
It unfolds naturally over time.

94
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,294
That's not true.

95
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,630
Everyone starts off not loving you,
then you say and do things

96
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,101
that make them love you or not.
That's the point of romance.

97
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,330
But romance is harder if you're
already friends with the person.

98
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,611
You can't hide the
less attractive parts of yourself.

99
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,547
It can be an advantage.
You already know what pisses them off.

100
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,718
That's very true.

101
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:01,561
Shaun, did Carly tell you
she just wants to be friends?

102
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,260
Or are you talking
about someone else?

103
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,731
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
I'm looking for my dad.

104
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,776
- I just... I'm just here visiting...
- Okay. Dr. Park is not here,

105
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,709
and we're discussing
something important.

106
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,381
Right. Sorry.

107
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,782
Kellan. Your dad's in surgery.
He could be a couple of hours.

108
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,585
Thanks.

109
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,649
Shaun.

110
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,786
That was harsh.
We're talking about your love life.

111
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,254
Talking about my love life
is important.

112
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,732
It helps clear my head,
so I can focus on the medicine.

113
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,964
Intracranial hypotension.

114
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,309
It is consistent
with Alice's headaches

115
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,574
and dizziness getting worse
when she's upright,

116
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,946
and a leak in spinal fluid
can be triggered

117
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,315
by severe intracranial pressure
during childbirth.

118
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,911
To confirm I'm right,
we need to insert a lumbar drain

119
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,116
into Alice's spine, infuse her with fluid,

120
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,216
and see if her symptoms improve.

121
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,695
But if you're wrong,
she'll have an excruciating headache,

122
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,562
massive brain pressure,
temporary vision loss...

123
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,827
She'll give her consent.

124
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,199
It's a reasonable diagnosis.

125
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,231
And the patient's desperate
for an answer.

126
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,339
Can you do the procedure alone?

127
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,019
Only one doctor is needed
to insert a lumbar drain,

128
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,112
and I have a time-sensitive matter
to take care of.

129
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,757
Sure.

130
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,364
You okay? You look okay.

131
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,667
I'm fine.

132
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,796
- Your text said it was urgent.
- My text said it was time-sensitive.

133
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,241
I have to get back to work
before my lunch break is over.

134
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,776
I was at work too, Shaun.

135
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,948
I know we left things
in a weird place,

136
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,043
but now is not a good time.

137
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,785
The pinto beans
are next to the tomatoes.

138
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,559
That is not in alphabetical order.

139
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,900
There's more.

140
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,264
The toilet paper
is in the wrong direction,

141
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,839
the way you like it.

142
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,710
You got angry when we were roommates
because I couldn't accept

143
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,975
your way of doing things,

144
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:41,018
but I can learn to accept things
I'm not comfortable with.

145
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,915
This is not bothering me at all.

146
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,795
I can deal with your messiness
and neediness

147
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,035
- and selfishness.
- Stop.

148
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,164
Your way of proving
that you're flexible

149
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,073
and attentive to my needs
is to pull me away from work

150
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,443
with no notice, make me drive
all the way across town,

151
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,575
just so you can show me
you un-alphabetized your beans.

152
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,421
Doesn't that seem
a little inconsistent?

153
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,319
Oh...

154
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,698
That is a good point.

155
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,533
I should've waited until evening
when you are done with work.

156
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,903
We can discuss this later.
I have to get back to the hospital.

157
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,343
Resecting necrotic tissue
around the annulus.

158
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,476
Dr. Reznick, trim down
the patch from the pericardium.

159
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,220
The infection caused a fistula
and we need to remove it.

160
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,852
Repair the annular defect
with the pericardial patch.

161
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,897
He's gonna have
permanent heart damage.

162
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,870
The guy survives IV drugs, hep C,
hard time, and gets taken down

163
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,805
by a cactus spike on his road
to redemption.

164
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,907
- That's ironic.
- Predictable.

165
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,007
He ignored dangerous symptoms
because he wanted to be tough

166
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,723
- for those kids.
- He's trying to keep them

167
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,739
from repeating his mistakes.
It's admirable.

168
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,446
It's a narcissistic waste of time.
You can't undo a lifetime

169
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,080
of abandonment with a couple weeks
in the woods.

170
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,784
The kids are still here,
aren't they?

171
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,424
Finish the closure of the fistula tract
with pledgeted sutures.

172
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,330
- Park, I need you to come with me.
- Now?

173
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,965
Go. We got this.

174
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,837
Security agreed to let us
keep this between us.

175
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,471
No need to call the cops.

176
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,680
Everyone needs to chill.

177
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,452
We weren't cooking meth
in the dumpster.

178
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,427
Do you have any idea how many people
die from vaping pot?

179
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,163
What were you thinking?

180
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,659
We'll give you two some space.
You, with me.

181
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,075
You have asthma, Kellan.

182
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,813
I know you're not this stupid.

183
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,390
Heart rate's tachy at 148.
Systolic's in the 200s.

184
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,054
I removed the drain a half hour ago.

185
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,190
I was wrong.
My idea made things worse.

186
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,478
We need to do a lumbar puncture
to relieve the built-up fluid.

187
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,971
It didn't make her worse
the way it should have.

188
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,507
She should have a headache
or upward brain herniation,

189
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,837
heart rate should be low.

190
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,208
Something is causing her heart
to beat too hard too fast.

191
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,770
- Mm. I missed something...
- Shaun, you need to give her

192
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,679
a 10 milligram bolus of labetalol now

193
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,719
- or she is going to die.
- Okay. I missed something.

194
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,913
Shaun.

195
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,052
Mommy?

196
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:05,884
Alice?

197
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,233
There was significant tissue damage
from the infection,

198
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,793
but it should be manageable with
medication and modifications to your diet.

199
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,538
So no more flaming hot Cheetos?

200
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,902
That's not a thing
any self-respecting adult should eat.

201
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,313
You'll need long-term follow-up
with a cardiologist,

202
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,509
beta blockers, ace inhibitors...

203
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,087
What'd you do?

204
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,719
Mr. Reed was found vaping THC
on hospital grounds.

205
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,285
I'm emancipated,
so I'm basically an adult.

206
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,964
You're emancipated
because your parents do

207
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,897
even dumber stuff than you do.

208
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,130
Thanks for letting me know.

209
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,735
There will be consequences
for his behavior,

210
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,809
starting with an apology,
and not some smart-ass one either.

211
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,811
Mr. Keeler, your hand is swollen.
I need to look at your feet.

212
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,647
Less than 100 milliliters.

213
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,911
- What's wrong with his piss?
- Max.

214
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:05,984
What's going on?

215
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,551
We're gonna need to run
additional tests.

216
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,685
We've done a lumbar puncture
to remove the excess fluid

217
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,535
and bring your spinal pressure
back to normal.

218
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,050
When will she be able to go home?

219
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,058
I'm not going home.

220
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,166
Honey, their test just about
killed you in front of your daughter.

221
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,137
She wasn't supposed to be here.

222
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,671
It's because you told me
you were visiting your sister.

223
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,276
Since when do we lie
to each other, Alice?

224
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,818
You have to stop doing
this to yourself.

225
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,188
They're only going to confirm the same
diagnosis you've already been given.

226
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,684
You said you don't have a diagnosis.

227
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,797
They told her she has idiopathic
dysautonomia six months ago.

228
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,495
- It was confirmed by two other doctors.
- You left it out of your records?

229
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,905
Idiopathic is just a doctor's
fancy way of saying

230
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,001
they don't know
why I'm sick or how to fix it.

231
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,622
You haven't given the treatments
a chance.

232
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:10,208
Because even on them,
I can barely sit up most of the time.

233
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,720
Ruby deserves a mother
who can teach her

234
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,222
how to do a cartwheel...

235
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,860
and scoop her up
when she's having a nightmare.

236
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,657
She deserves a mother who's around.

237
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:36,506
Ruby doesn't need to learn
how to do a cartwheel.

238
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,339
She needs you to watch her,
cheer her on,

239
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,372
lay down next to her
when she's scared

240
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,846
and eat the cookies she bakes
and pretend to enjoy them.

241
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,546
You're a great mother.

242
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,794
And there's good in the life we have.

243
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,864
You're missing it
by constantly searching

244
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,028
for something better,
something that may not exist.

245
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,176
Are you feeling overheated?

246
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,041
No.

247
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,752
Scared?

248
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,923
No, I'm sad
that my husband thinks

249
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,481
- there's no hope.
- You are sweating.

250
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,785
Sweat is a response to fear,
not sadness.

251
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,462
Your temperature is normal.

252
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,066
You may have an adrenal tumor.

253
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,572
- Is that good?
- Yes. Tumors can be removed.

254
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm not mad.

255
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,923
I'm a little mad.

256
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,255
But I wanna understand
what's going on.

257
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,719
Dad, not now.

258
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,526
It's not like you to be reckless
with your health, your future.

259
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,626
I can't...

260
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,022
Kell, are you having an asthma attack?

261
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,032
- Where's your inhaler?
- I don't...

262
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,775
- It's not the asthma.
- What is it?

263
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,008
- Tell me what you're feeling.
- My heart's beating fast.

264
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,515
Do you feel dizzy?
Like the walls are closing in?

265
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,117
I think you're having a panic attack.

266
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,684
Take a deep breath.
One, two, three,

267
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,953
now out.

268
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,955
And keep breathing.

269
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,970
Good.

270
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,866
Does this happen a lot?

271
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,978
I know vaping is stupid, but...

272
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,986
It helps this feeling go away.

273
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,533
- Hey, give it back, asshat.
- Victor, Max, cut it out.

274
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,738
Mr. Keeler, we have some results
we need to discuss.

275
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,541
- In private.
- Whatever you have to say to him,

276
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,837
you can say to us.

277
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,709
Wish we could, we'd love your input.

278
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:31,113
But clearly you're far too busy
watching pimple-popping videos.

279
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,319
Go away.

280
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,063
The damage to your heart
cut off blood flow to your kidneys.

281
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,970
They were already weak
and couldn't handle the stress.

282
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,876
You've progressed
to complete renal failure.

283
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,376
- I'm sorry.
- You'll need a transplant.

284
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,882
But dialysis can keep you going
until a donor is found.

285
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,046
I'm guessing a guy with a bad heart,

286
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,349
damaged liver, history of hepatitis,

287
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,289
isn't first up.

288
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,623
Your best bet
is to find a living donor,

289
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,426
most likely a family member.

290
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,064
Man, I'm an addict...

291
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,800
who stole and lied like one,
then went to prison.

292
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,372
My Christmas card list
is pretty short.

293
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,880
We'll connect you
with our transplant coordinator.

294
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,677
She'll help you reach out to family

295
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,580
and answer any questions
they may have.

296
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,620
I should've taken
those twerps sailing.

297
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,299
Her husband's not wrong, Shaun.

298
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,098
Sometimes people need to accept
that things are

299
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,040
as good as they're gonna get
and make peace with it.

300
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,971
Wanting more can only lead
to disappointment and heartbreak.

301
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:18,686
What good does it do to give up
if you're already heartbroken?

302
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,860
Hmm.

303
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,832
You were right. No tumor.

304
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,963
No, you were also right.

305
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,244
The bright color,
it means there is an increase

306
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,315
in the uptake of radioactive material
in the medullary space.

307
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,215
Which is enlarged
and overproducing adrenaline,

308
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,582
so the gland itself
is acting like a tumor.

309
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,384
We have a new diagnosis.

310
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,959
The quiet is a nice change of pace.

311
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,395
I told the boys to get some air,

312
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,870
try to avoid committing

313
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,465
more criminal offenses
on hospital grounds.

314
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,070
I know they can be annoying and loud

315
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,916
and constantly in the way,
but I can't make them leave.

316
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,742
- Want me to give it a shot?
- I'd like to see that, actually.

317
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,713
No, they're just scared.

318
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,425
They think if they leave, then...

319
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,686
I'll be the latest in a long line of people

320
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,788
they ain't have a chance
to say goodbye to.

321
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,926
Wes?

322
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,302
Code blue!

323
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,014
You do not have
idiopathic dysautonomia.

324
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,516
You have a rare condition
called bilateral adrenal

325
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,917
- medullary hyperplasia.
- Unfortunately,

326
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,751
there's only one cure for this,
remove your adrenal glands.

327
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,089
You would be on steroid
replacement therapy the rest of your life.

328
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,061
And that comes
with a new set of symptoms.

329
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,961
Fragile bones, high blood pressure,
GI issues, mood disorders,

330
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,895
increased chance of diabetes,
serious infections.

331
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,938
I understand. I wanna do it.

332
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,941
Medullary hyperplasia
is not terminal or progressive.

333
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,568
You could have a normal
life expectancy

334
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,979
- in your current condition.
- My current condition is pathetic.

335
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,486
- I'm having the surgery.
- Alice, this could kill you.

336
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,255
I love you.

337
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,052
I won't risk your life.

338
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,555
If you insist on
going through with this...

339
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,162
Ruby and I are leaving.

340
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,645
If you love her,
you shouldn't leave her.

341
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,148
It's not her fault.

342
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,209
She's sick, and she just wants
to make things better.

343
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,018
- It isn't fair.
- Shaun.

344
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,647
There is nothing worse
than losing the person you love.

345
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,158
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,855
This isn't Dr. Murphy's call,
nor is it mine.

347
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,226
We'll give you two some time.

348
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,663
He's right.

349
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,970
I... I can't lose you and Ruby.
I won't do it. I won't do the surgery.

350
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,254
Wes suffered major cardiac damage.

351
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,852
We can't solve one problem
before the next one hits.

352
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,659
He's stable now,
but his heart can't handle

353
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,666
the fluid volume shifts
of standard dialysis.

354
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,759
The only thing keeping him alive
will kill him?

355
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,067
We could put him on low-fluid dialysis,
keep him in the ICU around the clock,

356
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,233
- that will buy him a little time.
- Very little.

357
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,503
Call UNOS, see if they'll move him
up the list.

358
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,704
Where are we with family?

359
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,542
Two of Wes' cousins agreed to be tested,

360
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,411
- we're waiting on the results.
- Good.

361
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,048
Get on the phone
with any family you can find.

362
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,711
If their man doesn't get a kidney
in the next couple days,

363
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,384
they should make arrangements
to say goodbye.

364
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,206
- New kicks won't help you outrun me.
- Ha-ha.

365
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,740
They're recipes from Dash.

366
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,575
Well, from Kayla.

367
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,273
Kayla, by way of Dash.

368
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,808
It's complicated.

369
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,322
He asked me on a date.

370
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,560
What did you say?

371
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Nothing.

372
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,101
- I stammered and then I fled.
- Ha-ha.

373
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,607
What did you wanna say?

374
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,009
Oh. I don't know.

375
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,213
Shaun was right.

376
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,319
Coming home to an empty apartment
sucks.

377
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,620
I used men to make me feel better,

378
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,495
most of them didn't mind, but...

379
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,774
don't trust myself
not to hurt someone I care about.

380
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,879
Claire, it's not that complicated.

381
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,250
You lit up this morning
when you saw him.

382
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,878
He seems to make you happy.

383
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,050
You deserve to be happy.

384
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:16,907
Mm.

385
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,979
How are you feeling?

386
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,049
Not high,
if that's what you're asking.

387
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,589
It's not.

388
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:32,287
You know, earlier in the car,
I pushed too hard,

389
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,826
made you feel cornered.

390
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,561
I'm sorry.

391
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,368
You didn't know.

392
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,046
I, uh... I talked to your mom.

393
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,015
- Is she freaking out?
- She's concerned.

394
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:55,420
And we talked about finding
a therapist in Phoenix

395
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:59,322
who specializes in treating anxiety.

396
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,225
So you're pawning me off
on a total stranger?

397
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,762
No, no.

398
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,367
I thought you'd be more comfortable
talking to someone who's not...

399
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,435
She said
you've been pretty withdrawn lately.

400
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,577
I know things between your mom
and I are a little...

401
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,845
Screwed up?

402
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,754
Unsettled.

403
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,420
- Is that making you feel anxious?
- No.

404
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,859
It's not you.

405
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,789
It's nothing, it's okay.

406
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,765
No, it's obviously not.

407
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,738
Because some of this is on you.

408
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,631
Every time we talk, you don't
tell me anything about your life.

409
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,643
Because you don't wanna know anything!

410
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,711
That's not true!

411
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,517
You're busy saving patients
a hundred hours a week.

412
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,318
You don't wanna feel guilty
being a thousand miles away,

413
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,822
you just wanna know that I'm okay.

414
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,123
So I say I'm okay.

415
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,461
Eww...

416
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,904
That's annoying.

417
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,441
Can you do that someplace else?

418
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,305
I'm trying to find
a better solution for my patient.

419
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,780
Your patient is being discharged.
I'm trying to get a kidney for a dying guy.

420
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,818
You're watching gross videos.

421
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,443
I'm waiting to hear back from UNOS.

422
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,521
Ew.

423
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,926
Do you prefer being called or texted?

424
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,297
Neither.

425
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:49,660
Do you like surprises
or do you find them irritating?

426
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:53,194
- I find this irritating.
- It's research.

427
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,831
Lea said we can't be together
because she is too needy

428
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,569
and selfish to deal with my issues.

429
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,737
You are the most selfish person I know,
so you are a good subject.

430
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,547
Lea's right. She is needy and selfish.

431
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,020
Find someone who loves you
the way you are.

432
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,525
People always say that,

433
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,459
but shouldn't we be with someone

434
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,020
who makes us
a better version of ourselves?

435
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:24,769
Maybe.

436
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,270
But trying not to be autistic
won't make you better.

437
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,217
I'm sorry you still don't feel good,
Mommy.

438
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,989
Oh, I'll feel better when I'm home,

439
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,691
eating those delicious cookies
that you make for me.

440
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,756
You don't have to go home.

441
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,396
I invented a better surgery.

442
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,869
Instead of removing
both your adrenal glands,

443
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,375
we can just squeeze out
the hyperplastic medullary part,

444
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,578
like popping a pimple.

445
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,741
You invented a surgery?

446
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,907
Dr. Murphy's come up
with a surgical plan

447
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,211
that could curb overproduction
of your hormones

448
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,324
- while leaving you some adrenal function.
- What are the chances it'll work?

449
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,785
- We don't know.
- Since it's never been done before,

450
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,518
it's difficult
to predict the outcome,

451
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,391
but it is a safe
and viable treatment option.

452
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,908
Is Wes dying?

453
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,855
We're doing everything we can
to help him.

454
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,289
I snuck a look at his chart
when no one was around.

455
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,251
- You know that's a crime, right?
- Only a misdemeanor.

456
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,094
You should talk to Wes.

457
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,603
We all got tested.

458
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,574
I'm a match.

459
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,141
I'm gonna give Wes my kidney.

460
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,727
We've discussed
your offer at length, Max.

461
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,196
It's incredibly admirable
and generous.

462
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,001
But you're 16, living donors
have to be 18 years old.

463
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,701
I'm emancipated.

464
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,606
I can give consent for myself.

465
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,132
But it's still up to the hospital
to decide if this is a good idea.

466
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,344
We don't feel
this is in your best interest.

467
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:54,416
Max, the surgery is much harder
on the donor

468
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,680
than the recipient.

469
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:59,623
You could have post-operative bleeding
or infection, and it's incredibly painful.

470
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,627
I've been through more crap
than any of you.

471
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,425
- I can handle it.
- Also long-term consequences.

472
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,328
High blood pressure, renal failure.

473
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,164
Something happens to your other kidney,
you don't have a spare.

474
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,999
I know how to subtract.
I'm cool with it.

475
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,936
And recovery is long and hard.

476
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,941
You would need someone to help you
get dressed and bathe,

477
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,772
make sure
you take all your medications.

478
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,575
I've been taking care of myself
just fine for a long time.

479
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,050
Actually, Max,

480
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,750
you've been in juvie and on drugs.

481
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,187
You're not taking care of yourself.

482
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,788
Okay, I get it.

483
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,564
I'm a screwup.

484
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,933
But Wes isn't.

485
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,199
He's bailed me out of jail,

486
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,737
he's picked me up
in the middle of the night

487
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:53,211
when I was too messed up to drive,
he's cleaned me up after fights.

488
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,877
He came with me
to my sister's funeral.

489
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,320
If I managed to stay out of jail,
it's because of Wes.

490
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,556
If I'm a halfway
decent father someday,

491
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,825
if I'm not a lost cause,

492
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,101
it's because Wes never gave up on me.

493
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:24,643
He shouldn't die
because I made dumbass decisions.

494
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,625
It's your surgery.

495
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,098
And we have the exact same amount
of experience with this.

496
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,868
Free up the medulla
along the inter-cortical surface.

497
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,276
Careful not to penetrate the cortex.

498
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,319
Nothing's coming out.

499
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,323
Try using your fingers
to pinch the gland,

500
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,188
use a circular motion to coax it out.

501
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,063
I've popped my share of pimples.

502
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,724
That's cool.

503
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,424
One down, one to go.

504
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,297
Wes is like a father to Max.

505
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,305
If he were his actual father,
we wouldn't hesitate to let him do it.

506
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,567
I think we should.

507
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,108
Me too.

508
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,039
The little punk got to me.

509
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,312
We've explained all the risks,

510
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,579
Max was unwavering.

511
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,547
I vote yes.

512
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:26,725
One admirable decision
doesn't wipe away a lifetime of bad ones.

513
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,769
It's three against one.

514
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,971
This isn't a democracy.

515
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,105
I'll tell the patient.

516
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,800
- One of the boys get into trouble again?
- No.

517
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,660
No, they've given you
a reason to be proud.

518
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,007
They all got tested to see
if they were a match.

519
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,235
Max is.

520
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,578
He wants to give you his kidney.

521
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,513
That little turd is full of surprises.

522
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,669
I can't approve the transplant, Wes.

523
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,767
I'm sorry.

524
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,605
Max is a good kid.

525
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,778
He's gonna make a good man one day,
thanks to you.

526
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,686
But for now, he still needs grownups
to have his back.

527
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,847
- The risks to his health...
- It's okay.

528
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,861
It's the right call.

529
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,536
It's my job to save those kids.

530
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,432
Not the other way around.

531
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,478
You're still on the UNOS list.

532
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,215
We'll keep reaching out to your family.
And we're not giving up.

533
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,963
I need you to do
one other thing for me.

534
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,045
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

535
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,583
No one's probably listening anyway.

536
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,626
Your kidney's not a match.

537
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,429
They said I was.

538
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,034
Your blood and tissue type are good,

539
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,079
but the serum cross match
showed that Wes produces

540
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,445
antibodies in reaction to your cells.

541
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,274
His body would reject your kidney.

542
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,816
I'm sorry.

543
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,291
Figures.

544
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,822
- I can't do one stupid thing right.
- That's not true.

545
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,434
You did everything you could.

546
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,163
Wes is so proud of you.

547
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:27,702
- Any dizziness or nausea?
- No. No headaches either.

548
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,603
You need to try getting out of bed
to see if your symptoms return.

549
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,272
- Is she ready for that?
- No cartwheels yet, but hopefully.

550
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,991
How's it feel?

551
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,363
- The room's not spinning.
- Mommy! You're all better!

552
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:05,375
Whoa. Careful, sweet pea.
Mom is still recovering.

553
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,479
I'm okay.

554
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,348
Come here.

555
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,146
Ooh.

556
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,422
Here's the Big Dipper.

557
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,025
If you extend a straight line
through these two,

558
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,036
this bright star is Polaris.

559
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:37,902
- All of our phones have compass apps.
- Hey, just shut up and listen.

560
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,538
This crap's important.

561
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,572
Polaris is your true north.

562
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,577
Now, keep your eye on that,

563
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,783
you're gonna find your way out
of whatever mess you've gotten into.

570

I think we should go on a date,
a real date.

574
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,317
Shaun, I already said no.

575
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,089
Because you think there are problems
that can't be fixed,

576
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,988
but I am very good
at solving problems.

577
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,959
I saved a woman today
who nobody thought I could save.

578
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,620
You know, I don't need saving, Shaun.

579
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,631
Okay. I understand, I can fix this.

580
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,228
Yes. You have to give me a chance.

581
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,968
You need to let me try.

582
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,767
No! I don't need to do anything.

583
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,307
- You need to listen to me.
- No.

584
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,894
- This is proving my point.
- I have...

585
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:22,038
I have a plan. I can fix it, I will fix it!

586
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,672
Shaun, you're autistic, you can't fix that!
