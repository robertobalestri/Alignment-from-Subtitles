00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,144
- We had the clinic at the hospital.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,199
Come back as president
and we'll reopen it.

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,339
We need to go to HR and break up.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,845
I've accepted your explanation
and report.

6
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,508
- Thank you.
- But I don't believe it.

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,881
You don't get to lead surgeries
until fourth year. That will be changing.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,718
When the right surgery comes along,
it'll be yours.

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,953
I want you to meet our new attending,
Doctor Marcus Andrews.

10
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,862
Pleasure to meet you.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,725
You had a date last night,
didn't you?

12
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,359
It was hard, uncomfortable, unpleasant.

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:39,270
And I have no idea if she was happy.
And I know I wasn't happy!

14
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,841
- I don't like when you do that.
- I know.

15
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,750
But I did it anyway,
because you need to snap out of it.

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,622
- The moping, it accomplishes nothing.
- I'm not moping, I'm eating.

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,353
Which is the only thing you're doing
outside of your room now.

18
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,595
You didn't even come out to tell me
to turn down the Talking Heads.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,292
- It didn't bother me.
- The walls were shaking.

20
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,797
I'm surprised the cops
didn't show up.

21
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,267
You like Carly. You need to get
back in the saddle,

22
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,278
and luckily, you have
a totally awesome roomie

23
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,509
- who's here to help you.
- I'm not going on any more dates.

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,584
Shaun, everyone gets it.

25
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,385
Dating is stressful,
but being alone is worse.

26
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,827
I'm not alone. I have you.
I have Doctor Glassman.

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,955
Friends are great,
but everyone needs a special friend.

28
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,192
I don't.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,836
- Shaun, I just...
- I'm not like everyone.

30
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,947
No one is like everyone.
We're all unique.

31
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,051
But we're also the same.

32
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,434
I had rent control.

33
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,673
The only way for them
to jack the rent is to get me out.

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,368
So they make up a reason.

35
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,910
Said that I was playing my music
too loud.

36
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,844
And all-night parties,
fighting with neighbors,

37
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,043
wandering around the parking lot
without clothes?

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,244
I had a robe on!

39
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,345
And I wasn't wandering,
I was trying to take the trash out,

40
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,822
but they moved the damn bins.

41
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,890
- It was windy.
- Mom,

42
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,690
you are clearly off your
meds and drinking.

43
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,499
Okay. Was.

44
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,595
It was a temporary setback.

45
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,536
Nobody's perfect,
but it is under control now.

46
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:58,068
People under control don't show up
at 1 a.m. looking for a place to stay.

47
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,377
I will be out of your hair
before you even know. Two weeks.

48
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,244
- Three, tops.
- One!

49
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,110
I don't have time
to babysit a grown woman.

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,122
Three weeks until the end of the month.
You owe me that.

51
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,522
No, I don't, actually. One week.

52
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,455
- We need help!
- Male, 30s,

53
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,090
10-centimeter laceration
to his left cheek.

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,932
Probable fractured temporal bone,
maxilla, definitely shattered mandible.

55
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,630
What happened?
- Tried to stop a creeper

56
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,638
from groping a woman.

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,369
Bashed his skull in
with some skateboard.

58
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,641
Wheels broke off
and the metal axle... did that.

59
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,308
Okay, secure his airway, his mouth
is filling up with blood. Intubation cart.

60
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,544
Through-and-through oral defect

61
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,087
and the mandible is crushed.
We need hemostats.

62
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,421
- The woman?
- She's fine.

63
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,217
Cops arrived, Tased the dude,
took him away.

64
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,387
Everybody's fine except the hero.

65
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,897
We need to intubate through the neck.

66
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,832
Betadine, scalpel, 6-0 tube
to place surgical cric.

67
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,443
<i>Doctor Brigham to 435.</i>

68
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,274
<i>Doctor Brigham to 435.</i>

69
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,750
Could you take this up to Lim's office?
I'm running late.

70
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,819
No problem.

71
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,584
Melendez is waiting.

72
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,489
Sorry, had to help Kellan
with a biology project.

73
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,084
- What's in the box?
- A Ducati throw pillow.

74
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:25,291
- Think you can bribe Lim with a pillow?
- I'm not bribing her, I'm being nice.

75
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,150
Starting a new
job in a new office.

76
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:29,325
She'll decide who
gets first lead surgery.

77
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,873
I don't think I can influence
her decision with a gift...

78
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,640
but it never hurts to have
a relationship with your boss.

79
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,372
And it's a damn cool pillow.

80
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,148
Hey.

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,215
No signs of any post-op infection.

82
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,515
There's also no sign
your surgery did any good.

83
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,622
Tom!

84
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,390
- How often is he vomiting?
- After every feeding.

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,786
Okay. Shh...

86
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,965
This is not the outcome we hoped for,

87
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,194
but a pyloric stenosis
requires a cautious approach.

88
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,829
If we're too aggressive...

89
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,636
It's okay, buddy.
I got you. There we go.

90
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,904
Shh...

91
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,603
- Hold on.
- Our baby is in pain.

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,479
He can't eat
and you don't have any clue why.

93
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,381
I would be upset too if I were
in your position, but you're wrong.

94
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,523
We need to conduct tests
to confirm, but I am confident

95
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,857
it's a matter of going back in
and making an adjustment.

96
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,391
Your son's in good hands.

97
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,125
Thank you.

98
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,898
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- A father who loves his son.

99
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,268
You've got nothing to apologize for.

100
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,512
That was impressive.

101
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,346
Get an abdominal ultrasound
to confirm

102
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,648
it's just an incomplete
pyloromyotomy.

103
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,258
You're wasting your ass-kissing.
First surgery isn't his decision.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,524
No, he's just the one sleeping
with the one making that decision.

105
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,970
- Pupils are equal and reactive.
- Do you know where you are?

106
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,233
And do you know
how you ended up here?

107
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,306
Josh, you have multiple fractures
in your cheek and jaw,

108
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,442
and a large piece of your cheek tissue,

109
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,750
skin and underlying muscle was torn off.

110
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,957
You're going to need extensive
reconstructive surgery

111
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,651
to save your jaw function.

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,787
You need to read these consent forms,

113
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,127
and if you have any questions,
write them on this pad.

114
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,397
Was the woman on the subway
a friend of yours?

115
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,474
<i>He's a fool.</i>

116
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,744
Trying to prove how macho you are
can get you killed.

117
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,610
Clamp the branch
of the inferior alveolar.

118
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,455
So you would just stand by?
Let a woman get groped?

119
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,984
Apply manual compression,
try and close the fracture gap.

120
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,360
Do you help every homeless addict
you see on the subway?

121
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,093
- I don't.
- And neither does Browne.

122
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,636
Which is why she ought not get
so self-righteous.

123
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,937
Yes.

124
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,940
I help my patients
to the best of my ability

125
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,377
because it's meaningful, and to me,
the downside is purely financial.

126
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,475
For friends, I'll risk more,

127
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,676
but the only people
I'm risking life and limb for

128
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,013
are my family.

129
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,751
Someone gropes my wife on the subway,
they're gonna get whupped.

130
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,282
This isn't gonna work.

131
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,457
The mandibular ramus is too shattered
and I can't get stabilization.

132
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,661
We can't do skin or muscle grafts
if we can't fix skeletal structures.

133
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,828
Alloplastic augmentation
to bridge the gap?

134
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,463
The span is too wide.

135
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,146
We're going to wire him shut.

136
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,180
Wake him up.

137
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,517
He should know he's never gonna talk
or eat solid food again.

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,829
Forever.

139
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,110
Do you have questions?

140
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,412
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,244
The Cantrells want a new surgeon.

142
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,538
What can you tell me
about the first surgery?

143
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,649
Is this an M&M review?

144
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,146
Not yet.

145
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,585
Is it possible, you may have been
a little too aggressive?

146
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,793
- Cut too deeply?
- Are you really asking me that?

147
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,091
I need to know.

148
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,398
Definitely didn't go too deep.

149
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,663
Great. We'll talk to the Cantrells.

150
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,175
Audrey...

151
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,510
is this weird for you?

152
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,383
A little. You?

153
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,475
Trying not to let it be.

154
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,511
Good. Me too.

155
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:58,097
Hello. I'm here to pick up
artificial dermal regeneration templates.

156
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,332
Let me get it. Hey, Shaun.

157
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,766
I heard what happened to the guy.

158
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,534
It sounds horrible.
Is he gonna be okay?

159
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,405
He won't be able to eat
or speak normally ever again.

160
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,671
- Thank you.
- Shaun.

161
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,781
You seem a bit uncomfortable.

162
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,821
If it has anything to do with our date,
I want you to know, I had a good time...

163
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,852
and hope we can do it again.

164
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,133
I had... a horrible time...

165
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,002
and... don't want to do that ever again.

166
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,043
Extensive swelling.

167
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,645
But within the acceptable range
of post-op edema.

168
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,418
The very top of the range.

169
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,225
I think maybe Melendez
did go too deep,

170
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,157
- injured the pylorus.
- Well?

171
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,831
The swelling is within the acceptable
range for a post-op edema.

172
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,837
Got your muffins. Delicious.

173
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,839
- I'm glad you liked them.
- I did.

174
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,569
Just surprised you thought
I could be bought.

175
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,349
We're not trying to buy you off
with muffins or a pillow.

176
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,169
Someone got me a pillow?

177
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,685
No. I wanted to show
my support for your promotion.

178
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,685
You're all gonna lead surgeries.
Doesn't matter who does anything first.

179
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,750
The only thing that matters
is that you do it right.

180
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,923
So, what was in the box?

181
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,060
Sample marketing pamphlets.
My buddy owns a print shop

182
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,230
and asked me to give Lim samples.

183
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,203
Well played.

184
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,799
But it's all moot anyway,
it doesn't matter who goes first.

185
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,604
Right.

186
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,904
So I'm clear, that "right" was sarcastic?

187
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,038
Right.

188
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,717
Hey.

189
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,284
Since when does the president
need to stock his own shelves?

190
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,387
When it's a free clinic
and want it done right.

191
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,295
Thank you.

192
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,892
Have you ever had sex in the office?

193
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,805
I'm not gonna answer that.
First, it's embarrassing if I say yes.

194
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,770
And it's even more embarrassing
if I say no. I take the fifth.

195
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,303
If we're gonna get
married, I need to know all your naughty...

196
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,350
I brought us lunch.
I know what you each like.

197
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,049
Doctor Melendez
is not just our best surgeon,

198
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,955
he's one of the tops in the country.

199
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,789
With the expertise to know
the best way to avoid

200
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,094
a truly bad outcome in this procedure
is to err on the side of caution.

201
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,633
- We hear all that.
- We do.

202
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,503
And we appreciate you
taking time to explain everything.

203
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,570
But we would just
be more comfortable

204
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,773
having someone else take over.

205
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,042
You do understand.

206
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,182
Of course.

207
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,218
I assume you'd be okay if I performed
Braden's second surgery?

208
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,158
The chief of the department? Uh...

209
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,821
Absolutely. Thank you, doctor.

210
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,954
Of course.

211
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,530
Nobody likes dating.

212
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,539
It's awkward and uncomfortable
and it's expensive.

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,667
Ah. That's why you proposed
after two dates, to save money.

214
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,042
I proposed after two dates
because after one,

215
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,843
I realized how much
I loved being around you.

216
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,209
And how much fun
we'd have together.

217
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,413
He's right, Shaun.
Because the fun can be so fun.

218
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,656
That didn't happen to me.

219
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,424
I have to go to surgery.

220
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,194
Shaun, whenever you're ready,
you'll try again.

221
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,068
- What?
- Whenever he's ready?

222
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,940
He's gotta go at his own pace.

223
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,405
- He needs to be pushed.
- I'm not gonna push him.

224
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,540
A man doesn't push another man
into a date.

225
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,347
- He pushed you.
- Shaun doesn't know any better.

226
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,354
If you want him to find love,

227
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,856
he literally needs to be
pushed into it.

228
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,017
Literally?

229
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,288
Shaun's not like other men.

230
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,460
He easily admits he's wrong?

231
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,297
He easily changes course?

232
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,100
If you don't talk to him,
is anything gonna change?

233
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,172
No good deed goes unpunished.

234
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,610
Why does it always work out that way?

235
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,376
It doesn't.
Most good deeds get rewarded.

236
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,661
What do you base that on,
Murphy?

237
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,553
Certainly not the news or the Forbes 500.

238
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,785
- Or the Bible.
- I base it on neuroscience.

239
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,328
Bad outcomes just implant deeper
in our cerebral cortex.

240
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,831
So evolution agrees with me,
our brains encourage us to be selfish.

241
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:05,701
Yes, which makes it strange
that people keep being unselfish.

242
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,772
You were.

243
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,608
You saved my job,
and now you're an attending

244
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,180
instead of the president.

245
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,845
Screws and wire ligature.

246
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,256
We're not doing this.

247
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,652
We can do better.

248
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,421
There is no other procedure.

249
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,799
We'll invent one.

250
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,607
Truce during surgery.

251
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,674
- Fair. What about procedures?
- Imaging is fair game.

252
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,148
Anything invasive, we go to our corners.
I left my keys.

253
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,947
- Losing my mind. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night.

254
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,284
What about a muscle graft
from the temporalis?

255
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,192
Well, that wouldn't address
deep mucosa or bone.

256
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,057
Unless we took
an osseocutaneous free flap

257
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,656
from the radial forearm.

258
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,697
We'd need two inches

259
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,498
and could use the natural concavity of...

260
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,369
And lose the use of his hand.

261
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,039
That seems like a reasonable trade-off.

262
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm not telling this guy
we can restore his speech,

263
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,508
- and all it'll cost is his hand.
- Because he's a hero?

264
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,712
What he did has nothing to do with it.
It's what we can do that matters.

265
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,083
What we can do is what we were doing.

266
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,382
That's the protocol.

267
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,749
Aren't we risking more damage
leaving him in a bed

268
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,328
while we try to invent
a new treatment?

269
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,730
How about attaching
two free flaps on vessels

270
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,426
on either side of his neck.

271
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,095
Heard from Claire you were having
an all-hands-on-deck sesh.

272
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,729
- Happy to join.
- Good.

273
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,104
- How about Park?
- He left.

274
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,370
Said he had a thing with his son.

275
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,608
I don't have kids,
so extra hours, not a problem.

276
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,049
Have you considered
allograft augmentation or a...

277
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,848
Heard y'all were working late,
so I got coffee.

278
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,549
Any way I can help?

279
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,456
I wanna talk about the Cantrells.

280
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,230
On date night?

281
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,233
Can it wait 10 and a half hours?

282
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,068
- I guess.
- Thank you.

283
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,235
Ever been to The French Laundry?

284
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,073
- No.
- We should do a weekend in Napa.

285
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,213
I know this great B and B
south of Saint Helena...

286
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,946
It's not about the Cantrells,
it's about what you said to them.

287
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,412
Has it been 10 and a half hours already?

288
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,923
I erred on the side of caution?

289
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,625
- Caution is a good thing.
- Err isn't.

290
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,788
- I didn't err. Not at all.
- I was going to bat for you.

291
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:50,800
You're so afraid of appearing to favor
your boyfriend you're overcompensating.

292
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,135
Given I think you may have erred,
I'd say I was incredibly supportive.

293
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,267
You went against better judgment
to favor your boyfriend.

294
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,437
So I'm too supportive
or not supportive enough?

295
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,116
Should I change the reservation
to two tables for one?

296
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,755
I've had plenty first dates
that were actual disasters.

297
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,526
Took one woman to a Coyotes game,
saw four minutes of it,

298
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:20,657
spent the night in the ER while she got
17 stitches after being hit by a puck.

299
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,500
Got married eight months later.

300
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,534
Then you divorced her.

301
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
It was worth it.

302
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,546
We don't have a choice.

303
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,276
Evolution needs us to propagate, so it...

304
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,986
gives us a shot of happiness
every now and again

305
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,988
to suck us in like idiots.

306
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,817
To keep us in a game that we know
we're gonna lose almost every time,

307
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,558
because the upside's like...

308
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,924
nothing else.

309
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Love.

310
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,872
But if Shaun really
doesn't need to play, then...

311
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,536
good for him.

312
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,876
We've officially turned into
an episode of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

313
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,174
Everyone, go home.

314
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,244
- I'm not tired.
- I am.

315
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,212
No, there are still
a number of possibilities...

316
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,020
Murphy, you are smart
and you're creative,

317
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,889
but there are things...

318
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,488
you can't do.

319
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,659
You can't do miracles,
you can't fix the unfixable.

320
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,182
Hey, baby.

321
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,358
You work way too hard.

322
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,087
Yes, I do.

323
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,594
Let me get you something to eat, I made
some pulled pork and peanut coleslaw.

324
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,035
No, thanks, Mom.
Did you find a place?

325
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,708
I saw one, but it was nasty.

326
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,404
- You must be hungry.
- You saw one

327
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,547
and then you came home and cooked?

328
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:22,248
Yes. I came home
and cooked dinner for my daughter.

329
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,922
I'm trying, Claire.

330
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,457
Okay? I'm taking my meds,
I'm seeing Doctor Donovan.

331
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,621
I am doing my best.

332
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,733
I've heard that before.

333
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,534
You got six days.

334
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:07,795
Shaun, you need sleep, your neurons
will be sparkier in the morning.

335
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:12,202
There are 640 muscles
and 206 bones in the body,

336
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,468
but only 284 and 72 of those
are of sufficient size

337
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:21,480
for our grafts, but that still leaves
20,448 possible permutations.

338
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,812
It's not unfixable
until I rule out every...

339
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,844
So some anatomy problem
you won't give up on,

340
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,617
but after one date,
you think you've explored

341
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,285
all the possible permutations?

342
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,727
- Stop distracting me.
- I'm distracting you?

343
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,328
By talking about you? About love?

344
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,235
Yes. I... I need to concentrate.

345
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,470
Okay. I'll shut up.

346
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,142
- You're still talking.
- Good night, Shaun.

347
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,647
- You're still...
- We only have 206 bones?

348
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,477
- Still talking.
- Oh.

349
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,914
Yes.

350
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,908
Shaun?

351
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,176
I think we should talk.

352
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,416
So did Lea,
but I have to find a solution

353
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,650
for an oromandibular defect
that doesn't involve titanium plates,

354
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:42,183
356 of our muscles
or 134 of our bones.

355
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,761
I don't think you never want
to see me again.

356
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,232
I have to find a solution
for an oromandibular...

357
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,270
We have to talk.
You owe me that much.

358
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,110
Why do I owe you that much?

359
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,714
Because I thought we had a nice time.

360
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,881
And I thought you were a nice guy.

361
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,891
An honest guy,
and I still think you are

362
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,086
and I'm confused about how you feel,

363
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:19,495
and about how I feel about how you feel,
and I just need to talk about it.

364
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,460
So if you have feelings for me at all,
help me understand.

365
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,515
Okay.

366
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,080
My little sister Andie has autism.

367
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,787
We're not all the same.

368
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,717
I know.

369
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:52,356
I think growing up with Andie
helps me understand you.

370
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,628
But it also makes me wonder
about myself.

371
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,330
Did I date you to prove something?

372
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:06,810
Did I date you to somehow
make things better for Andie?

373
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,113
I don't think I did, but...

374
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,789
My point is...

375
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,853
I have questions too, Shaun.

376
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,695
Trying to figure out what we want,
and why we want it,

377
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,267
and is it good for us,
are good questions.

378
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,030
And they can't all be
answered over one dinner.

379
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,481
I have to go.

380
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,337
Murphy...

381
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,843
I've... I've got it!

382
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,047
I've got it!

383
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,388
We take a vascularized
free flap and suture it

384
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,052
to the facial artery and vein,
then flip up the pectoralis.

385
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,556
It's a great idea.

386
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,625
We're not doing it.

387
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,464
It's never been tried before.

388
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,571
Risk one, graft failure brings infection

389
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:45,134
and he loses the other half of his face.
Risk two, sepsis and he dies.

390
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,346
- Three...
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

391
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,440
We do the standard procedure,
the guy never speaks or eats again.

392
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,345
Doctor Murphy,
could you give us a minute?

393
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,366
Why do you want to do this?

394
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,766
You've been my boss for a few hours

395
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,394
and you're questioning my motivations?

396
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,667
You fell on your sword
for Shaun and your

397
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,006
reward for your heroism was getting fired.

398
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,240
And now you're back here
answerable to me.

399
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:26,009
I imagine you've been
asking yourself if it was worth it.

400
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,915
Your issues with the procedure are valid,

401
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,360
- but let me put them before the patient.
- He'll say yes.

402
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,964
- I won't sugar-coat the risks.
- He'll say yes anyway.

403
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:45,002
He wants to believe things will work out.
That's why he's a hero.

404
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,764
Sometimes the hero loses.

405
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,969
Which is why he's gotta learn
when to stand back...

406
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,274
when there's nothing
he can do to help.

407
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,949
Are you gonna order me to stand back?

408
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:05,923
No.

409
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,228
Hey, Shaun, you got a minute?

410
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,329
Okay.

411
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,795
Debbie wanted me to talk to you.

412
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,339
To tell you... not to give up on love.

413
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,071
Don't give up on love.

414
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,485
Okay, do you want me
to let her know you told me?

415
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,953
Yes, please.

416
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,218
Hey, Shaun?

417
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,219
I know this dating thing can be scary.

418
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,728
You're good at dating?

419
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,028
Well, before Debbie,
the last time I went on a date,

420
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,035
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"
was the big hit.

421
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,838
Because after Maddie and the divorce,

422
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,369
I kind of shut down for a while.

423
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,477
Yeah, and it felt better to be
in a place where I couldn't get hurt.

424
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,515
But then last year, I got my diagnosis,

425
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,109
I thought I was gonna die
and Debbie came into my life

426
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,917
and I said to myself,
I don't want to be safe anymore,

427
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:14,489
you know? I want... I want to...
I want to feel alive.

428
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:19,221
And... And if I get hurt, I get hurt.
That's part of the deal.

429
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,594
Morgan says it's biological,
that it doesn't make sense.

430
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,799
- Morgan's right.
- So I'm right?

431
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,001
No. No.

432
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,313
Look, it... it's wonderful,
this love thing.

433
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,013
Why should it make any sense?

434
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,714
When I think about the reasons
I'm in love with Debbie,

435
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,154
okay, she's... She's kind, she's funny,

436
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,886
she's... She's loving,
but that's not it, not really.

437
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,899
Heh. Don't tell her, but there are
other people that are kinder, funnier,

438
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:57,835
that are more loving than she is,
but she makes me happy.

439
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,435
Just being around her,
makes absolutely no sense...

440
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,473
but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

441
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:16,821
Okay.

442
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,592
I have an ethical dilemma.

443
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:31,967
I was going through state regulations
for medical staff, specifically residents,

444
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,869
and their new guidelines
have raised an issue for me.

445
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:39,770
The state caps residents at 80 hours
a week, but I don't think that's enough.

446
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,173
I work over a hundred
and I don't plan on cutting back,

447
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,649
so I'm wondering how I
should be reporting my hours...

448
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,277
Park offered to co-write a paper with me.

449
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,116
- What a suck-up.
- I said yes.

450
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,484
It's an interesting case,
it should be written up.

451
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,289
- So he's...
- Gonna do a lot of work for nothing.

452
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,990
Except for the good
of the medical community.

453
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:03,199
I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
You come with one more favor,

454
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:07,330
one more humblebrag, if I suspect
either of you have lips puckered,

455
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:10,535
- you're going to the bottom of the list.
- Yes, ma'am.

456
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,142
Doctor Lim...

457
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,578
do you ever think about
what it means, me doing all this?

458
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,180
Means you've underestimated me.

459
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,516
Maybe.

460
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,888
But it also means that I care.

461
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,827
That getting the first surgery
means something to me.

462
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,729
Enough to go out and overspend

463
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,734
on designer desserts
and then spend even more time

464
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,565
trying to make them look homemade.

465
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,272
If I'm putting that much effort
into muffins,

466
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:45,435
imagine how hard I'll work to make the most
of this opportunity if it's given to me.

467
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,415
With considerable
physio and speech therapy,

468
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,889
this graft would allow you to not only
chew and swallow whole foods,

469
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,393
but it would enable you to talk again.

470
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,856
It's an untested procedure
with not insignificant risks.

471
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,628
If the graft doesn't take,
more skin and bone

472
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,934
could become infected,
possibly necrotic.

473
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:23,546
- We need to know you understand.
- It's an experimental procedure.

474
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,312
In addition to all
of the usual surgical risks,

475
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,546
there are all of the unknowns.

476
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,079
Bleeding out,
permanent graft loss, stroke...

477
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,125
death.

478
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,578
Good for you, Josh.

479
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,079
Get him prepped.

480
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,122
Okay.

481
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,754
Infuse carbon dioxide.

482
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,765
Grasping duodenum distal of the pylorus.

483
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,102
Huh.

484
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,662
- Look at that.
- That's not good.

485
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,606
Page Doctor Melendez.

486
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,441
An intussusception.

487
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,778
Telescoped bowel
is causing a blockage.

488
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:34,115
The baby had two unrelated conditions
causing the same symptom.

489
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,985
We only know about the second
condition because of the first surgery.

490
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,351
Treatment protocol's a barium enema,
but not for someone Braden's age.

491
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,126
- An air enema might work.
- Unless the intestine's torn.

492
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,499
Morgan, reposition the scope
to get a better look

493
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,800
at the intestinal wall
around the intussusception site.

494
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,642
Too much swelling and edema
to be sure.

495
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,178
With the risk of infection,
we don't have time to find out.

496
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,043
- You're gonna have to open him up.
- You should.

497
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,683
The Cantrells made their wishes clear.

498
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:09,186
Well, that's when I made them think
you'd erred. Which you did not.

499
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,813
Not on the side of caution, not at all.

500
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,356
We do the surgery together.

501
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,589
- Who's the lead?
- I think you know.

502
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,194
- Pulling rank?
- Absolutely.

503
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,664
As chief of surgery, I designate you.

504
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,505
It's like a puzzle.
You secure the artery,

505
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,906
then the vessel
just won't quite stretch to the vein.

506
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,241
You could mobilize
the recipient vessel.

507
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,048
Repeat that, Doctor Browne.

508
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,415
Mobilize the recipient vessel
to create more slack.

509
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,919
- You saw Carly again. How was it?
- Inconvenient.

510
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,620
But despite her intrusion,

511
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,359
I was still able to concentrate
on medicine.

512
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,401
It wasn't an intrusion,
that was a date.

513
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,902
It was walking.

514
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:02,367
Walking with someone you like
who likes you too is a non-date date.

515
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,373
Some of the best dates I've had

516
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,844
did not involve flowers
and restaurant reservations, just

517
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,244
sharing a bag of chips
and sitting on a couch.

518
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,486
Secured. Remove clamps.

519
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,283
Blood flow to and from graft.

520
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,258
Let's move on
to the pectoralis flap.

521
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,895
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- Okay, heart rate is up.

522
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,661
Push IV fluids, give epinephrine

523
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,133
one milligram, then start a drip.

524
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,505
- There's intestinal wall perforation.
- Repairable?

525
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,004
There's too much tissue damage.

526
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,572
- Infection?
- No sign of peritonitis,

527
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,137
but we'll need to remove
this section of bowel.

528
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,682
- He's tachy.
- Hypotensive.

529
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,086
Push vasopressors and antibiotics.

530
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,788
Check an i-STAT hematocrit,
ABG. Give two units PRBCs.

531
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,862
I don't see any major bleeding.

532
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,159
Push more fluids,
start an inotrope.

533
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,893
Check all vessels we worked
on for clots with the doppler.

534
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,128
Okay.

535
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,207
Large clot in the carotid.

536
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,507
Clamps back on,
performing carotid arteriotomy.

537
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,616
Will try to aspirate out the clot.
Standby with heparin.

538
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,790
Carotid clot removed.

539
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,458
EEG looking good.

540
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,833
Resuming pectoralis flap dissection.

541
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,035
Good work, everybody.

542
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,336
Go ahead, say something.

543
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,238
Yeah, you can talk.
Maybe not too much at first,

544
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,512
give the jaw a chance to heal.

545
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,117
Thank you.

546
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,685
On behalf of all of us,
you're very welcome.

547
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,526
The woman who was being accosted
when you intervened is here.

548
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,391
Is she all right?

549
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:45,266
She's not here as a patient,
she's been waiting to see you.

550
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,004
Okay?

551
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,581
Hello.

552
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:59,283
Hey.

553
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,911
I am so sorry this happened.

554
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,755
Me too.

555
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,450
You look...

556
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,589
When the swelling goes down,
he'll look a lot better.

557
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,729
It's okay.
My face was never my fortune.

558
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,097
What made you do it?

559
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,035
Why did you step in?

560
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:25,936
I don't know.

561
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,445
You needed help.

562
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,915
Olivia, by the way.

563
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,627
- Josh.
- We'll let you two get acquainted.

564
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:53,095
It didn't matter who got
the first lead surgery to me,

565
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,834
but it's recently been brought
to my attention

566
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,432
how much it might mean
to some of you.

567
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,340
Seems I'd forgotten
how important this decision is

568
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,711
when you've been dreaming
about it for years.

569
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,545
You're all excellent candidates,

570
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,586
each deserving
and will all get your turn.

571
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,016
- Starting with Doctor Browne.
- Yes!

572
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,550
Thank you.

573
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,126
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

574
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,535
- What the hell was that?
- I was happy for a colleague.

575
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,840
You weren't campaigning for you to win,
you were campaigning for me to lose.

576
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,177
Do you dislike me that much?

577
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,818
I just wouldn't want you
supervising me as chief resident.

578
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,876
You'd be a nightmare of a boss.

579
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,924
Shaun...

580
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,861
Doctor Lim thought my motives
for fighting this hard

581
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,836
for this patient were miscalculated.

582
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,206
She was right.

583
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,934
We shouldn't have saved his face?

584
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,277
We have limited resources
and we're even more limited

585
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,848
in our personal capacity
to determine who is deserving,

586
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,384
so we make a choice
to treat everyone the same.

587
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,922
So why did you treat
this patient differently?

588
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,155
Because I was angry.

589
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,959
I made a sacrifice to save you.

590
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:27,255
I lost my job,
I took a substantial demotion

591
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,393
and I thought I was a fool.
The cost was way too high.

592
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,238
I resented you
and I, kind of, resented the universe.

593
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,701
But today...

594
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,273
you made me proud of my sacrifice.

595
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,484
Thank you.

596
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,284
You're welcome.

597
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:59,230
Very few things that are worthwhile in life
come without a cost, Shaun.

598
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,318
This is tricky.

599
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,849
I feel like we were just tested
and both of us failed.

600
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:30,421
But... we'll get better at this.

601
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,970
Hey, honey. I'll make you a plate
and you can take it to your room.

602
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,112
Thanks.

603
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,048
I saw three more apartments today.
One was kind of nice,

604
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,145
but it's not ready
until a week from this Tuesday,

605
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,383
which puts me
over your deadline by three days.

606
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:03,985
No.

607
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,264
- Three days, come on.
- You can stay here.

608
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,902
For a little while,
until you're a bit better.

609
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,006
But you have to stay on your meds.

610
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,704
Keep away from other drugs and alcohol,
I'm testing your urine every two days.

611
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,576
Don't miss any appointments
with Doctor Donovan.

612
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,015
Can you live with that?

613
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,433
Do you have a couch?
