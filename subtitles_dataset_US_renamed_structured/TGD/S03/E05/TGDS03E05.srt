1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,368
<i>- Do we have any pretzels?
- Sorry, I...</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,698
<i>- What about the salt at the bottom?
- No, I...</i>

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,854
<i>- It's one of my mixtapes.
- Oh, well, I would like to hear it.</i>

4
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,622
Naughty thought.

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,290
How about we don't wait
for our next kiss?

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,891
We would never see
the end of the movie.

7
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,650
Mm.

8
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,789
It's better if we stick
to the schedule.

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,725
Sure.

10
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,496
Didn't hear you come in last night.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,301
So I'm guessing it
went well at Carly's.

12
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,810
The end of the movie
was very predictable.

13
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:25,249
Not the question I was asking,
but you still managed to answer it.

14
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:31,118
- Carly touches me when we kiss.
- You don't like her touching you?

15
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,661
- Oh, I do.
- Oh...

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,596
But I prefer to touch only one thing
at a time.

17
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,997
Have you told her you prefer
to touch only one thing at a time?

18
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,903
In those exact words?

19
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:58,550
- Okay. Whatever it is, I'm in.
- My first lead surgery!

20
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,953
- Oh! Shaun! That is awesome!
- I am going to rock it!

21
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,719
Oh, hell... yeah, you are! Yes! Yeah!

22
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,794
Oh.

23
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,374
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

24
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,542
Thank you for helping me
with the sea lions.

25
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,051
I'll never say no to a caper.

26
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,586
But I'd like to keep my mother's death
between the two of us.

27
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,455
I just... I can't deal
with people's platitudes.

28
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,154
Okay, but that suggests you're not good.

29
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,490
This is textbook denial, it's only
going to inhibit your grief process.

30
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,465
Denial is the first step,

31
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,368
so I'd say I'm right on track.
But thank you for your platitudes.

32
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,064
This is Curtis. He decided to fix
his chimney without a safety harness.

33
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,767
Open bilateral tib-fib fractures.

34
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,176
They wanted $1200 for a two-hour job

35
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,477
and I can still do a hurricane grind.

36
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,851
It's a skateboard move that
builds off a 180 ollie.

37
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,680
I got great balance.

38
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,883
Pupils are slow to react.

39
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,253
Unfortunately, balance is less great
after a few cocktails.

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,554
Not me.

41
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,630
Clean and sober six years,
three months and 24 days.

42
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,232
Get him on IV antibiotics
and to OR level one. And run a BAC.

43
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,604
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy, your surgeon.

44
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,653
Esophagealcancer
is a serious condition.

45
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:48,285
However, you don't have any remote
or metastatic disease,

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,229
and responded well to chemoradiation,

47
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:55,599
so a resection of the esophagus
should render you cancer-free.

48
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,239
You look awfully young.

49
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,574
I always say, the younger they are,
the smarter they must be.

50
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,086
Oh, yes.

51
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,917
We will pull the stomach up

52
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,550
and attach it to the remains
of your esophagus,

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,821
keeping your GI system connected,

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,919
so you will not need
a permanent feeding tube.

55
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,791
My oncologist told me all this...

56
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,598
but I refused to believe it,
that it was all gonna be okay,

57
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,196
until I heard it from my surgeon.

58
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,609
I'm sorry, it's just...

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,774
I've been through a divorce
and a career change

60
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,679
and I finally bought my own cafe,

61
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,315
three days before I got my diagnosis.

62
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,824
And I thought it was a sign
I was making a mistake...

63
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,655
but it was just the opposite.

64
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,554
I wasn't done.

65
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

66
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,035
I have to inform you of the risks
of this procedure.

67
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,471
There is a seven percent chance
of heart and lung problems,

68
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,644
a 12 percent chance of infection,

69
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,874
a point-five percent chance of death,
among others.

70
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,853
Bring it, Dr. Murphy.

71
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,234
Shaun got very lucky.

72
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,170
Landed the world's most genial patient
for his first case.

73
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,863
- Nice.
- Of you.

74
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,572
You picked that patient for him.

75
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,074
I heard it was Park's chart
before you stepped in.

76
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,938
Shaun's weakness is
patient management.

77
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,411
You shouldn't coddle.

78
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,277
We challenge him too much,
we lose him.

79
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,672
Murphy?

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,751
He perseveres.
He's annoyingly resilient.

81
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:57,156
I agree that some failures
don't seem to faze him at all.

82
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,187
But it's his lifelong dream.
So, yes, I think we could lose him.

83
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,889
I'll tough-love his ass next week.

84
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,871
- Okay, Curtis, we're good to go.
- Curtis, are you okay?

85
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:14,606
- Should've gone with the contractor.
- His thinking was impaired,

86
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,473
he had a blood-alcohol level
of point zero nine.

87
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,779
Your test must be wrong.

88
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,251
You were quite inebriated
when you came in.

89
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,719
That's impossible.
Curtis doesn't drink.

90
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,889
- We'll make a note of it.
- We've gotta get him to the OR.

91
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,066
You play softball?

92
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,466
Uh, my junior year in high school,
I had an ERA of 2.95.

93
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,073
My wife's got an arm.
I can't believe you're my wife.

94
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,411
Till death do us part.

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,930
- Oh, you found Wally.
- You have a name for it?

96
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,628
Yeah, he's my Walther PPK 32.
He and I go way back.

97
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:15,968
Is it loaded?

98
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,497
I mean, is this a problem?

99
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,839
Because I just... I keep it
in my bedside table, in my gun safe.

100
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,310
- Combination 7-3-5-9.
- I'm not gonna remember that.

101
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,246
I don't wanna remember that.

102
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,645
If we're gonna live together,
we're gonna need to make some...

103
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,355
compromises.

104
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,298
You nervous?

105
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,065
How badly are you freaking out?

106
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,469
I'm not badly freaking out.

107
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,408
I've assisted
in six esophageal resections,

108
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,910
all of which were
free of complications.

109
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,174
So you're overdue for a blow-up.

110
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,179
Sorry, I'm just a bit annoyed

111
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
because I had
my hand on this case first,

112
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,420
and now I'm third
out of four at best.

113
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,360
But I'm happy for you.

114
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,297
Really.

115
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,562
I'm happy for me too.

116
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,402
She has extensive scar tissue.

117
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,169
And it's plastered her stomach
to her anterior abdominal wall.

118
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:35,945
I told her she wouldn't need
a permanent feeding tube...

119
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,910
but she will.

120
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,186
We've gotta tell a chef
she'll never eat again.

121
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,892
- How will she react?
- Don't know.

122
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,593
- Badly. But the specifics she...
- You should tell her.

123
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,106
- She's your patient, it's your job.
- I'm bad at patient communication.

124
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,112
If I make her very unhappy,
she may not want me to do the surgery.

125
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,240
If you're not willing to take that risk,
then hand the case to Park.

126
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,549
No. I don't want to hand the case
over to Dr. Park.

127
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,951
Park will tell Beth.

128
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,594
And, Shaun, it's still your surgery.

129
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Drill.

130
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,774
Do you see his heart rhythm?

131
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,407
Rate controlled A-fib.
Wasn't on his record.

132
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,276
Ask his wife about it post-op.

133
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,509
Probably a symptom
of binge drinking, which he'll lie about

134
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,585
and she'll tell us she believes.

135
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,319
She's in denial?

136
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,087
You had surgery as a child.

137
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,127
As a baby. I don't even remember it.

138
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,092
There's considerable scar tissue,

139
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,827
more than we'd
typically expect to find,

140
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,668
which has affected our surgical plan.

141
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,974
- How?
- Dr. Murphy will field that question.

142
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,669
- No, Dr. Lim said...
- Proceed, Dr. Murphy.

143
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,942
Somebody please tell me.

144
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:30,459
We can't move your stomach up,
so you will need a feeding tube.

145
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,326
For the rest of your life.

146
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:42,635
The good news is that this surgery
is simpler,

147
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:47,143
so your recovery time will be shorter
by three to five days.

148
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,581
Hey.

149
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,996
Do any of you own a gun?

150
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,191
Is there someone you'd like
taken care of?

151
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,099
Ha.

152
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,401
- I still have my service pistol.
- I have a SIG P365.

153
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,709
Do any of you have
or have you ever had issues about it

154
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,573
with your significant others?

155
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,908
After our son was born,

156
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,281
my wife suddenly hated
having a firearm in the house.

157
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,877
Then one night,
I came home late to...

158
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,057
a PowerPoint presentation.
Ninety minutes of horrifying statistics.

159
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,356
Now it's in a locker at my gun range.

160
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,522
Lot of setup, but I like that.

161
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:40,397
I had a boyfriend who felt very weird
about me having a gun.

162
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,899
He wasn't big on logic,
so I took the emotional approach.

163
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,202
It's not for the firepower,

164
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,553
but the confidence it gives me
as a woman when I carry it.

165
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,638
I lived with a guy who had a gun.

166
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,236
Had to use the nuclear option.
It goes or he goes.

167
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,209
It worked, they both went.

168
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,012
Well, that's just wonderful.

169
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,262
I heard your news.
It's pretty exciting.

170
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,888
I jumped seven times.

171
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,060
- How's the anxiety level?
- Why do people keep asking me that?

172
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,334
- Everyone has doubts, Shaun.
- I'm excited.

173
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,467
You can be excited and nervous.
Usually they go together.

174
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:29,842
Speaking of, uh, I'm sorry if I was a bit
too assertive last night.

175
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,109
Lea said it must be tricky for you.

176
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:39,288
So now Lea is also privy to the intimacies
of our intimacy? Great.

177
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,691
Yes.

178
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,964
Oh, Lea said to tell you

179
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,366
that I prefer to touch
only one thing at a time.

180
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,438
Located upper esophageal sphincter.

181
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,308
You have a good tumor margin
resecting above or below?

182
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,475
- Below.
- Mm-hm.

183
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,148
Shaun gave the news
to his patient after all.

184
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,600
Shaun did what I expected.
He upset her, but the news is upsetting,

185
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,822
- she'll deal with it, he'll learn...
- She wants him off.

186
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,129
- Shaun.
- No.

187
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,637
- Shaun, I will find you another case.
- This...

188
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,473
is my case.

189
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:34,105
I prepared for this case.
I don't want another case.

190
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,109
Dr. Murphy.

191
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,943
You're learning, Shaun.

192
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,551
That's what you do
at a teaching hospital. I'm learning too.

193
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,415
Going from attending
to chief of surgery is a big deal.

194
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,261
Every day, every decision, every mistake,

195
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,363
I learn something.

196
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,160
So do you.

197
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,870
No, I don't.
I have a developmental disorder.

198
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,613
Come with me.

199
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,549
- I'm waiting for my bus.
- Well, take a later one.

200
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,413
I'm sure I mentioned I was chief.

201
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,428
Hi, Beth.

202
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,423
I'm sorry for what
you're going through,

203
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,960
and Dr. Murphy's phrasing
was unfortunate.

204
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,735
But there's been no deceit or negligence.

205
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,778
He's an excellent surgeon
who has my full confidence in the OR.

206
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,504
If you don't trust him,
you don't trust me.

207
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,644
So I would recommend
you have your surgery

208
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,152
at a different hospital.
I can make arrangements.

209
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,013
However, if you reconsider,

210
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,854
we can proceed as scheduled
first thing tomorrow morning.

211
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,842
If you don't want people to know
your mother died,

212
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,477
stop acting like someone
whose mother died.

213
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,818
I'm gonna move on
to the second stage of grief: anger.

214
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,353
- I'm not acting depressed.
- No, you're acting bitchy.

215
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,454
But you're not,
so that looks weird on you,

216
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,465
and people are gonna
know something's up.

217
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,498
So do you want me happier or sadder?

218
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,265
Let me know, because I'm really
looking for your approval.

219
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,899
Bitchy.

220
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,870
You really think this guy's
still on the wagon?

221
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,712
Just because he's a drunk
doesn't mean he's not sick.

222
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,343
But all you can see is an addict
married to an enabler,

223
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,685
so all roads lead to rum.

224
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,654
Come on, that was cute.

225
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,856
No LV wall motion abnormalities.

226
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,860
No valvular disease or dysfunction.

227
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,993
Ruling out any structural cause
for the arrhythmia.

228
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,828
You win. Congratulations.

229
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,372
- Hey.
- Hey.

230
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,435
- How was your day?
- Good, good.

231
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,509
Pensive. I was thinking about
your gun and why you need it.

232
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,247
- Oh, Aaron, I don't...
- No, no, no. I was an idiot and a guy.

233
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,381
I get it. You walking alone
in a garage late at night,

234
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,168
you walking alone on the street
late at night.

235
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,685
Or getting into my own car,
or even my own house.

236
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,926
Exactly. That's why
I got you a surprise.

237
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,200
- Yeah?
- Right outside the backdoor.

238
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,106
You have exactly 10 seconds
to punch in the code

239
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,947
before Seal Team Six arrives.
Seven-three-five-nine.

240
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,649
Every door, window,
every vent over 36 inches.

241
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,747
This is your security fob.

242
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,557
It works in all 48 contiguous states
and Canada.

243
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,661
You have no idea how much
extra comfort this is gonna give me.

244
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:51,996
Actually, I was hoping it would be
your primary source of comfort.

245
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,644
You were thinking that...

246
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,475
- this would mean I'd give up my gun?
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

247
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,141
The first rule of security systems
is redundancy.

248
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,742
By that logic, we should get a tank
for the garage.

249
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,583
It shouldn't matter why I want a gun.

250
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,590
Whether it's because
it makes me feel more secure,

251
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,594
or it was a memento of my dad's,
or just because it's fun to shoot.

252
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:20,162
All that matters is I'm a grown-up
and I'm responsible.

253
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,534
And I want it.

254
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,404
You're ruining Shaun.

255
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,641
Maybe you got him over the hump
of patient management,

256
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,204
but what about surgical management?
Taking charge of the OR,

257
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,682
keeping lines of communication open,
everyone cooperating.

258
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,720
You're throwing him into the deep end
and that's unfair,

259
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,881
unless you plan to scrub in
as a lifeguard.

260
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,924
He'll be fine.

261
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,319
You handpicked his surgical team?

262
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,393
You're ruining him.

263
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,365
The tests prove his arrhythmia
is associated

264
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,532
with excessive ethanol consumption.

265
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,237
But there's no permanent damage
and his rhythm will return

266
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,813
in the absence of
any further drinking.

267
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,509
We met when we were 15.

268
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,523
I was first clarinet, he was second.

269
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,387
We were at a band festival in Anaheim

270
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,826
when he found out his parents died
in a plane crash.

271
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,765
We grieved together and fell in love.

272
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,728
Then he started drinking.

273
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,938
It wasn't until I threatened to leave
that he woke up.

274
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,212
The day he received
his two-year recovery chip

275
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,977
was the day we got married.

276
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,617
The day he vowed to me in a church
full of our family and friends

277
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,384
that he would never drink again.

278
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,927
Our marriage is
built on his sobriety.

279
00:19:58,998 --> 00:19:59,998
I believe him.

280
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,766
Teal...

281
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,196
we ran the BAC three times...

282
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,707
and the results were consistent.

283
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,712
I believe in my husband.

284
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,205
I have to.

285
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,316
His BP is dropping.

286
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,951
- Temp is normal.
- Check for causes of shock?

287
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,560
Upper GI bleed. Need stat
hematocrits and transfuse blood.

288
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,104
Surgery's the easy-peasy part.

289
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,341
You wanted this... enjoy it.

290
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,681
I can't.

291
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,111
If I get distracted,
if I get upset...

292
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,747
If you do, Andrews has your back.

293
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,261
If Dr. Andrews has to take over,
then I have failed.

294
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,924
I have failed and I have
endangered a patient's life,

295
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,699
and if I'm no good at the easy-peasy part,
then what part am I good at?

296
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,107
What do we do when we get all nutty?

297
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,944
Blow out the candles.

298
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,812
How many do you need?

299
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,784
Three.

300
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,905
Hey, I was looking for you.
Big day, huh?

301
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,044
- How are your nerves holding up?
- I'm not nervous.

302
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,415
Of course you're nervous.
Everybody's nervous.

303
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,420
It just means that you care.

304
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:06,549
Being nervous means
I feel inadequate and unprepared,

305
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,754
and if I am either of those things
it doesn't matter whether I care or not.

306
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,388
You are more than adequate
and you're very prepared.

307
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,831
You remind me of a young surgeon
I knew once.

308
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,870
The day he got his first lead,
he was thrilled,

309
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,839
but he was a mess trying
to remember a million things,

310
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,705
imagining a million things
that could go wrong.

311
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,439
But then he remembered
the birth process.

312
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,140
How moms are asked
to pick a focal point,

313
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,911
let everything filter through that.

314
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,214
So he chose
the color orange to focus on.

315
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,050
This is the cap that he focused on,

316
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,717
and he got through it
with flying colors.

317
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,093
Maybe it'll help.

318
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,457
Why do you have the
young surgeon's cap?

319
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,403
I was being coy.
The young surgeon was me.

320
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,256
That's Japanese for "hello."

321
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,730
<i>Konnichiwa</i>. I have surgery
in 42 minutes.

322
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,131
Which is why I'm here,
to wish you luck.

323
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,598
I don't need luck.

324
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,907
Everyone needs luck.

325
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,176
That was a good-luck kiss.

326
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,406
How can a kiss give you...

327
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,250
So was that.

328
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,814
I am feeling a bit lucky.

329
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,358
You know the thing
that Lea told you to tell me?

330
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,361
- Yes.
- That was actually great advice.

331
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,626
It's important we tell each other
exactly what we like and what we don't.

332
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,669
I also don't like pickles, sirens,
anything woolen...

333
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,865
I was thinking more
in the romantic area.

334
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,876
And right now, we are not
going to touch lips anymore...

335
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,280
because there's something else
I want you to touch.

336
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,451
Oh.

337
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,226
So, what do you think?

338
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,899
You don't have any lumps.

339
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,770
Win-win.

340
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,786
Lab and imaging tests rule out
Crohn's, gastroenteritis,

341
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,590
C-diff colitis and even H pylori.

342
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,829
Leaving bleeding ulcers
caused by alcohol abuse.

343
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,900
He needs to be on a proton pump
inhibitor and octreotide

344
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,871
to prevent further blood loss.

345
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,577
No.

346
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,583
He loves you,
that's why he hasn't been honest.

347
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,517
It doesn't make it right,

348
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:25,422
but it's that same love that
kept you together through everything.

349
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,126
And it'll get you through this too.

350
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,761
He's telling the truth.

351
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,630
We'll run more tests.

352
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,705
Your faith in your
husband is impressive,

353
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,371
but it may have just killed him.

354
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,511
Ten blade, please.

355
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,511
Located lower end
of esophageal lesion.

356
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,674
Linear cutting stapler.

357
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,851
Resecting the esophagus
from the stomach.

358
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,593
I'm now at the upper
end of the lesion.

359
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,296
Hemoclips?

360
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,740
- Dr. Murphy?
- No.

361
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,575
- No.
- What's the matter?

362
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,578
No. No. No.

363
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,056
- Shaun, what are you seeing?
- Can't do this.

364
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,059
- What? What can't you do?
- No!

365
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,424
- Don't! No.
- No!

366
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,959
- No, no, no.
- Dr. Murphy!

367
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,125
- No!
- Dr. Murphy!

368
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,637
Page Dr. Lim. Keep her stable.

369
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,770
No. No, no. You're...

370
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,676
No, no.

371
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,055
- No. You're...
- What happened?

372
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,648
- No, no, no...
- He lost it, walked out mid-procedure.

373
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,988
- Yuri... Y... Yuri...
- Shaun?

374
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,695
Sayo... Yuri...

375
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,365
- Okay, Park, take over the surgery.
- No!

376
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:34,939
Dr. Park.

377
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,876
- No.
- Well, he obviously can't.

378
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,347
I don't think he lost it.
He was in complete charge.

379
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,884
- I don't think this is a meltdown.
- He said he can't do it.

380
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,352
He said, "Can't do it."
Maybe we can't do it.

381
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,289
- I think he's seeing something.
- We have a patient open on the table.

382
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,458
Shaun, you have to tell us
what you're seeing.

383
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,353
It's okay, Shaun.

384
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,666
Breathe.

385
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,145
That's it. Now, slowly...

386
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,813
what are you thinking?

387
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,025
When...

388
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:34,226
Okay. When I examined
the upper portion...

389
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:41,035
When I examined the upper portion,
there was a much larger area

390
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,631
of tumor-free esophagus
than anticipated.

391
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,406
That's correct, but not nearly enough
to reach the stomach.

392
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,278
But there is enough to accept
a jejunum free flap...

393
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,584
using a portion of the small intestine
to replace the resected esophagus.

394
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:59,081
- We don't do jejunum free flaps.
- They do in Japan.

395
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,723
They do in Japan.
I've been studying their technique.

396
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,857
<i>"Yuri kucho saiken."</i>

397
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,597
They have had great success.

398
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,235
It would mean
Beth wouldn't need a feeding tube.

399
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,305
But...

400
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,800
it is very complex.

401
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:24,378
It's too complex for you to lead,
so you'll lose your case.

402
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,318
Yes.

403
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,684
I haven't done a transposition graft
like that before.

404
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,830
Think you can walk us through it?

405
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,999
Yes.

406
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,637
I'll scrub in.

407
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,448
Stomach...

408
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,076
is perfect.

409
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,912
Check the duodenum.

410
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,316
The only way
Teal will accept the treatment

411
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,982
is if we give her no room for denial.

412
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,588
Did you really believe what you said?

413
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,259
That their love is enough to get them
through this?

414
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,928
Such BS,
the belief that love is enough.

415
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:20,035
Even worse, it's corollary
that a lack of love is the real problem.

416
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,801
If they had someone in their life
who had enough faith in them,

417
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,919
had enough love for them,
they could've pulled through.

418
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,878
It's wrong and it's mean.

419
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,247
What's that?

420
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,049
Flush the area.

421
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,482
- There's our bleed.
- But it's not coming from an ulcer...

422
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,625
- It's coming from a tumor.
- It's obstructing his digestive tract.

423
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,665
I'm paging Melendez to the OR.

424
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,067
Okay.

425
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,469
Actually, I'm gonna need
an extra shot.

426
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:55,773
Rough day?

427
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:59,276
I had to help out in the ER

428
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,279
with an 8-year-old boy who
was accidentally shot by his sister.

429
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,179
He'll survive, but with brain damage.

430
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,310
That's horrible.

431
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,842
Yes, it is.

432
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,383
And quite...

433
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,818
- coincidental.
- Like so many other coincidences.

434
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:19,262
You know how many kids are shot every
day in this country? Nineteen.

435
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,667
You know you're three times
more likely to be shot

436
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,493
if you have access to guns
than if you don't?

437
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,559
Here's another fact.

438
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,865
One in four women
are victims of violence

439
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,839
at the hands of
their intimate partner.

440
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,210
No, no, no. I'm not afraid of you.

441
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,575
This isn't about you.

442
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,848
Did something happen?

443
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,380
Because if it did,
I wanna know about it.

444
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,920
You figure something horrible
must have happened

445
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,467
to drive me to such an irrational,
fear-driven choice?

446
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,564
I'm sorry, hi.

447
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,190
The ends of the harvested
jejunum have been matched

448
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,206
for caliber size
for the attachment sites.

449
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:15,618
You should begin proximal
attachment at the neck incision,

450
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,246
using layer-to-layer technique
on the esophagus

451
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,758
and microvascular anastomosis
of the vessels.

452
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,791
You wanted to know
when Dr. Semler

453
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,127
was heading to OR number three.

454
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,932
Dr. Park, scrub out and join Semler.

455
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,240
If it's all right, I'd rather stay here.

456
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,503
You're needed where you're needed.

457
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,083
Tumor is free.

458
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,885
Bag it, tag it and get it to Path.

459
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,258
Do you smell that?

460
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,402
Smells like a distillery.

461
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,802
But we knew he couldn't have
touched a drop for at least 24 hours.

462
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,544
The final stitch is yours.

463
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,421
It's completely symbolic,
but symbols can be powerful.

464
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,519
Easy-peasy.

465
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,024
You had something called
auto-brewery syndrome.

466
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,327
The tumor we found
was blocking your intestinal track,

467
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,835
so carbs weren't being digested, they
were being trapped and fermented.

468
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,330
Your stomach was actually creating
its own alcohol.

469
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,171
You were drunk,
but not from drinking.

470
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,609
With the removal of the tumor,
which was benign, you're all good.

471
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,577
And the arrhythmia's gone too.

472
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,347
I never doubted you.

473
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,614
Her faith in you saved your life.

474
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:33,991
Thank you.

475
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,461
I was so pissed when
Lim kicked me out,

476
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,560
until I found Semler had an
appendectomy waiting for me.

477
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,629
Got my first lead after all.

478
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,604
I'm happy for you.

479
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,505
- Really.
- I'm happy for me too.

480
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,606
You earned it.

481
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,420
And you'll get your chance
again soon, Shaun.

482
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,121
So that's it? All's well that ends well?

483
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,025
Your surgeon walked out on his case.

484
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,588
That's your takeaway? That he failed?

485
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,829
- A chef can eat!
- Yeah.

486
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,131
As a diagnostician,
he did something wonderful.

487
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,830
But as a surgeon?

488
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,234
Yes, he failed.

489
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:29,576
We don't work alone, Marcus.
Every time we have a good outcome,

490
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,116
it's because everyone in the room
did something right.

491
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,748
Shaun came up with the idea.
Park got it out of him.

492
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,585
I approved the surgery, and you?

493
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:43,318
The only reason Shaun is working here
is because you believed in him.

494
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,787
Yay, team.

495
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,828
Are you still having a gun fight?

496
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,638
Oh, yeah.

497
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,508
Second day of my marriage
and we are at an impasse.

498
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,375
Tried the logical approach,
I tried the emotional approach.

499
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,640
No compromise.

500
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,683
Only thing left is the nuclear option,
which really sucks.

501
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:13,349
The thought of having a gun in my house
makes me sick.

502
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,688
Has Debbie let you touch her breast?

503
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,361
What?

504
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:29,107
Has Debbie let you touch her breast?

505
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,509
Yeah.

506
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:39,249
Then you shouldn't worry
about anything else.

507
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,559
I was wrong...

508
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,701
this time.

509
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:04,340
But 99.9 percent of cases,
I would be right.

510
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:08,039
If someone acts like an addict,
lies like an addict, smells like an addict,

511
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,876
then they are an addict.

512
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,347
And just because we stumbled across

513
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,943
the one ridiculously fluky exception,

514
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,184
that isn't gonna change my attitude
moving forward.

515
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,461
I respect you, Claire.
Might even go as far as to say I like you.

516
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,257
And I know you're angry right now.

517
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,201
At your mother, the world...

518
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,438
yourself.

519
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,735
Eventually, that'll go away,
or at least some of it will.

520
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,306
But until then,
giving up on that 0.1 percent

521
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,541
means giving up on something else:

522
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,308
hope.

523
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,689
Hope...

524
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,754
killed my mother.

525
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,550
We need to talk,

526
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,552
about the 800-pound gun in the room.

527
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,019
I'm working on my compromise skills.

528
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,047
Okay.

529
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,288
Looks like
your first lead surgery went well.

530
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,584
I didn't have a first lead surgery.

531
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,059
Yes, it went very well.

532
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,728
Can I check your other breast?
