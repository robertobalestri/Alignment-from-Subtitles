1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,536
This isn't my usual seat
in a speeding ambulance.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,409
You vomited and passed out.

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,850
You have a 3-inch abdominal bruise
and a big bump on your head,

4
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,979
- either of which...
- Check it all out tomorrow.

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,317
Soon as I'm at the hospital,

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,585
I'm treating patients.
They must be on overflow...

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,058
Soon as we're back at the hospital,
you're getting a CT.

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,229
You could have increasing
intracranial pressure

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,299
- from contusions, edema or a hematoma.
- I don't.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,062
I'm sure I know my symptoms
better than you.

11
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,399
No headache, no unilateral weakness.

12
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,235
The doctor without the head injury
makes the call.

13
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,843
There's the rupture.

14
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,012
The fallopian tube's necrotic.
DeBakey forceps.

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,858
BP's stabilizing at 90 over 65.

16
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,224
- I'll take the clamp.
- I'm fine. You remove the laps.

17
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,626
It's better if you do.
Less likely to damage your hands.

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,699
We need six hands, we've got four,
and you want us to work with two?

19
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,529
I need 2-0 chromic catgut.

20
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,183
His heart's shifted from the pressure
on his chest.

21
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,699
Try retracting it to the right.

22
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,407
There's nowhere for it to go.

23
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,150
Close him up.
We have to go in through his side.

24
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,416
That won't be easier.

25
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,250
Well, it better be.
This way is impossible.

26
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,096
- Hello.
<i>- Yes, Shaun.</i>

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,994
- Lea?
<i>- Yeah, it's me, you okay?</i>

28
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,365
Why is it still you?

29
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,167
I'm fine. I wanted to stay and help.

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,437
No. I don't need you, okay?
I need a rescue worker.

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,604
They're taking in a lot of scaffolding,
hoping to reinforce the wall...

32
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,478
- The water should be a priority.
<i>- They shut off the main,</i>

33
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,517
they don't know
why it's still flowing.

34
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,110
We're gonna drown
in about five minutes.

35
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,291
That's not true.

36
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,021
At the rate the water is filling,
we have about an hour.

37
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,095
And I could leave.

38
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,538
I am going to cut the rebar
to free you.

39
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,313
I didn't do it before because it risks
rupturing your posterior tibial artery.

40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,183
But now we need to. Take this.

41
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,051
Cutting will intermittently
cause your leg to move,

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,650
which will cause a lot of pain.

43
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,967
How did you deal with your heartache?

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,706
Are you just asking to keep me calm?

45
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:59,371
Yes. Distracting you from
the disastrous situation you're in

46
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,314
will help keep your blood pressure down,
oh, and reduce bleeding.

47
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,686
Honesty...

48
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,157
was the problem with my ex.

49
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,856
I opened up to him,
told him everything.

50
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,061
In return,

51
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,858
he didn't.

52
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,036
Were you being honest when you said
you're going to move on?

53
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,905
One upside of being impaled on rebar

54
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:36,040
underground in a room slowly filling
with water is it focuses your priorities.

55
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,509
Yeah. I'm moving on.

56
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,883
If you loved him,

57
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,554
maybe you can't.

58
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,064
- I told you.
- What? Be quiet, be still.

59
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,004
The machine is past the point
where you would see damage.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,836
The fact you've said nothing
means you're

61
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,705
figuring out how to tell me I'm gonna die,

62
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,508
or you're trying to figure out
how to apologize for wasting my time.

63
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,248
You're right.
I'm glad your brain is fine.

64
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,148
I'm not sorry at all.

65
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,811
I appreciate the concern. Now I can get
out of here and treat patients,

66
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,753
and you can get back
to the winery to help.

67
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,082
Brewery.

68
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,291
Oh, come on. I misspoke.

69
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,220
It's been a rough day.
There was an earthquake.

70
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,234
I've seen you on a lot of rough days,
but not once have I seen you confused.

71
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,535
Move your gown.

72
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,777
You're bleeding internally.

73
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,685
I need baci irrigation,
then we can start closing her up.

74
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,289
- Dr. Reznick?
- Please step back, Dr. Andrews,

75
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,234
we're trying to keep this area
as sterile as possible.

76
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,136
Glad you're aware it's not
an actual operating room

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,925
- that you seem to be operating in.
- There weren't any available.

78
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,497
And there weren't
any surgeons either. Suction.

79
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,193
So you violated Dr. Glassman's
order to not use your hands.

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,430
Ectopic pregnancy,
the fallopian tube ruptured,

81
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,572
patient would have died.
Oh-Maxon sutures.

82
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,806
You could have found another way,
but you wanted to be a hero.

83
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,383
Get your hands out of the patient
and take them to your room.

84
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,385
I'll finish.

85
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,141
He has a traumatic dissection
all the way to the ascending aorta.

86
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,404
The clamp would tear
through the vessel wall. He'd bleed out.

87
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,914
And if we clamp proximal to it,
he'd lose perfusion to his head.

88
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,847
He'll be brain dead.

89
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,889
You should go back to the hospital.

90
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,860
I'll stay with the boy.

91
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,173
Who's in charge?

92
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,007
First Andrews,
then Morgan, Andrews again,

93
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,356
- she's in her room, he's in surgery.
- What have you got?

94
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,043
Bay 4, otherwise healthy 35-year-old
with chest pain.

95
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,550
- High sensitivity troponins back?
- First was negative.

96
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,520
Repeat tropes in an hour.
Still no change, discharge him. Yeah?

97
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,148
Bay 2, 16-year-old,
dresser fell on her leg.

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,352
- Normal pulse and sensory exam?
- Yes.

99
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,919
It's a non-displaced fracture. Prep her
for a posterior slab and book a follow-up.

100
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,157
Dr. Lim...

101
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,934
Who's this?

102
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,235
Dr. Melendez.

103
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,710
Dr. Park.

104
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,042
So how'd it go?

105
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,919
Not good, Casey.

106
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,888
We couldn't fix things.

107
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,621
When we take this off you,

108
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,718
you'll start bleeding and...

109
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,891
we won't be able to stop it.

110
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,434
You're gonna die.

111
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,940
No. No. No, you're wrong.

112
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,270
You gotta be wrong. It was...

113
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,737
- Where's my dad?
- He's on his way.

114
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,149
- We're gonna keep you comfortable.
- I'm not in pain, okay?

115
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,481
You gotta be wrong.

116
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,219
I'm sorry, Casey.

117
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,989
Where is my dad?

118
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:57,734
Isn't "moving on" just a euphemism
for giving up? For failure?

119
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,810
Do you really believe that?
Do you think you've failed?

120
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,515
Accepting loss

121
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,679
makes us stronger.

122
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:16,159
Refusing to accept failure
makes us not fail.

123
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,697
If we keep fighting until we succeed,
then...

124
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,357
That's not true.

125
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,399
It traps us,
prevents us from moving on.

126
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,268
To other victories.

127
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,940
Your hematocrits suggest
you're still bleeding.

128
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,644
Appears to be in the retroperitoneum.

129
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,208
Probably from the pancreas.

130
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,085
If we open you up,

131
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,486
it means major
resections and reconstructions,

132
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,821
and you could end up
with ostomy or diabetes.

133
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,225
I'm well aware of the risks
of abdominal surgery.

134
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,627
The more conservative approach
is an angio

135
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,563
for embolization to stop the bleed.

136
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,066
- Less invasive...
- Again, aware.

137
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,367
Do the embolization.

138
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,841
In this case,
I don't think it's actually safer.

139
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,008
If the bleed isn't from the pancreas,
we'll have to keep poking around

140
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,603
until we find it, and...

141
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,204
it might be too late.

142
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,379
- You wanna do the surgery instead?
- Not really.

143
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,415
But Claire's right.

144
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,826
We've been able to get
a satellite hook-up to your dad.

145
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,734
- Want me to talk to him first?
- No. I need to talk to him.

146
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,935
<i>Son?</i>

147
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,541
Dad, I'm sorry.

148
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,207
<i>Sorry?</i>

149
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,613
Dad, I'm so sorry.

150
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,775
<i>I can't hear you. Say that again.
Are you hurt?</i>

151
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,548
Dad. It's my fault, okay?

152
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,748
<i>Are you okay?</i>

153
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,586
<i>Can you hear me?
Just stay strong, okay?</i>

154
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,159
- Dad? Dad?
<i>- Casey?</i>

155
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,161
Get him back.

156
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,728
Plane's caught in a
storm. I don't know...

157
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:03,752
Get him back.

158
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,877
Divide the gastro-colic
ligament and expose the pancreas.

159
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,879
It's a branch of the superior
mesenteric artery that's torn,

160
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,749
not his pancreas. Good call.

161
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,755
I need to resect the devitalized tissue
to get a healthy anastomosis.

162
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,257
We need clamps
and 6-0 vicryls on Castros.

163
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,619
Dr. Lim?

164
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,668
Above the SMA, the small bowel...

165
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,039
There are three ways
to stop a bleeding vessel.

166
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,282
Clamp, cauterize or repair.

167
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:57,519
Since this vessel is made of steel,
clamping requires a 60-ton press,

168
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:01,459
and cauterization requires
an oxyacetylene torch.

169
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,921
I don't need to stop the water...

170
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,363
just slow it down.

171
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,198
You're good
at adapting to challenges.

172
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,832
Yes, I am.

173
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,935
Blindly keeping on sawing
wasn't gonna work.

174
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,572
- No.
- But it wasn't a failure.

175
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,581
Because cutting the rebar
wasn't your goal.

176
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,354
Saving me was your goal.

177
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,259
And your goal isn't Lea...

178
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,689
it's love.

179
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,203
I think the scar will work
with the tattoos.

180
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,110
The bleed wasn't from the pancreas.

181
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,906
It was from the SMA,
but we found additional injuries

182
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,451
all the way to the celiac trunk...

183
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,752
- Ischemic bowel?
- Early stages.

184
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,658
We have restored full blood flow
and reperfused.

185
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,728
I'm sure the bowel
is gonna be just fine.

186
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,023
How sure?

187
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,958
What's my lactate?

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Four.

189
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,529
Means there's already been
some failure of the bowel wall.

190
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,646
We are going to retest your lactate
and I'm sure it'll have gone down.

191
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:05,481
If it's gone up, it means ischemia is
progressing and there'll be more leakage.

192
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,817
Which in turn will mean septic shock.

193
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,685
Past the point of treatment.

194
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,354
We're not there yet.

195
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,375
Let him know
it's still gonna be a while.

196
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,271
- How long is a while?
- Sorry, I don't know.

197
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,441
He says they're gonna drown
in 15 minutes.

198
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,644
Is a while more
or less than 15 minutes?

199
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,620
That last tremor made things
too unstable to send my crew down.

200
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,648
You're supposed to be saving lives.
You're supposed to be the heroes.

201
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,959
If you let me, what I'm gonna do

202
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,909
is help my crew get in
more braces, scaffolding,

203
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,160
and heavy machinery.
What you need to do,

204
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,231
is convince Dr. Murphy
to get out of there.

205
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,339
Talk to me, Casey.

206
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,669
I'm tired.

207
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,209
Let's just... talk.

208
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:12,149
Why do you need to apologize to
your father? What do you think you did?

209
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,214
Whatever it is, there's nothing
that he's gonna be mad about right now.

210
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,118
You don't know anything.

211
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,122
I know how a father feels.

212
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,761
I know, no matter...

213
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,392
how mad or how ugly things get,

214
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,665
we don't stop loving our children.

215
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,078
I killed my mother.

216
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,553
You need to get out.

217
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,522
- Soon.
<i>- Not soon, Shaun.</i>

218
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,218
Get out now. It's not stable.

219
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,021
Vera can't leave.

220
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,523
The firefighters told me
they're making headway

221
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,660
<i>and they'll be able to save Vera soon,
but you need to get out of the way.</i>

222
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,038
Are you lying?

223
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,056
You need to go, Shaun.

224
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,495
If I leave,

225
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,421
you die.

226
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,493
If you stay,

227
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,296
we both die.

228
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,940
You can't cut through the rebar
in time.

229
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,494
I can't cut through the rebar.

230
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:12,171
But... I can cut through your leg.

231
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,545
In the Civil War, there was a doctor

232
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,948
who could amputate limbs
in under three minutes,

233
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,884
which kept blood loss and pain
to a minimum,

234
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,013
thus reducing the effect of shock.

235
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,613
Our scalpels are sharper,

236
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,819
so I can slice through the skin
and muscle faster,

237
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:37,694
and I only sawed the rebar
with the top half of the saw,

238
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,562
so the bottom half is still pristine
to get through the bone.

239
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,059
Do you consent to the procedure?

240
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,038
No.

241
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,274
I have one condition.

242
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,573
You have to promise me
that if I don't make it,

243
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,210
you'll move on.

244
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,351
You deserve to find love.

245
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,850
You need to.

246
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,530
You're down here risking your life
for me, right?

247
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,231
Well, this is me risking my life
for you.

248
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,939
Promise me you'll move on, Shaun.

249
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,167
Promise.

250
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,585
I promise.

251
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,891
<i>Let's do this.</i>

252
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,361
The year before med school...

253
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,029
I took six months off,

254
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,405
backpacked across Southeast Asia.

255
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,906
Hostels were 3 bucks a night,

256
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,272
beer was 50 cents.

257
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,110
And I found this little island
in Thailand,

258
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,382
Koh Lanta.

259
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,224
Nothing but bamboo huts
and palm trees.

260
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,928
Stayed eight days.

261
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,730
Read <i>Moby Dick.</i>

262
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,562
Fell in love.

263
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,405
How high?

264
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
High.

265
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,114
8.1.

266
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,334
Place is probably overrun
with tourists now.

267
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,131
She had an accident,

268
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,938
nothing really,
Mom didn't even report it.

269
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,843
But it was big enough
to mess with her neck.

270
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,612
Lot of pain.

271
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,978
But she was dealing with it.

272
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,618
I thought.

273
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,693
She became dependent on the pills?

274
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,992
I went through her purse,

275
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,492
looking to steal a couple bucks
for the movies.

276
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,433
Found three half-full
prescription bottles, same drug.

277
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,736
What did you do?

278
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,681
Nothing.

279
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,382
I didn't say anything.
To her or my dad.

280
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,556
I didn't know what to say.

281
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,524
Three weeks later,
she OD'd in her sleep.

282
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,701
He would've gotten her help.

283
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,879
I need to tell him.

284
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,015
You will.

285
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,120
I promise.

286
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,898
When I was a second-year resident,

287
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,032
I was assigned
to a Dr. Wilmet Fortingale.

288
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,371
Full of himself, sarcastic, thin-skinned.

289
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,040
Our first case together,

290
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,650
I saw he screwed up,
and I called him on it.

291
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,518
He lit into me.

292
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,086
What kind of ego I must have,

293
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,222
what little regard I must have
for my superiors,

294
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,596
how hard it must be for me
to trust anyone in my life.

295
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,797
Two days later, the M&M,

296
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,330
guess who screwed up?

297
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,735
Me.

298
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,410
When you're a resident,

299
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,813
you think you know everything.

300
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,945
I'm sorry.

301
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,156
I should've told you
about my diagnosis.

302
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,290
- It's hard.
- Yeah.

303
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,162
And what that showed me was
you don't respect protocol,

304
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,825
you don't respect your superiors,
your patients,

305
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,835
the only thing you care about
is your own career.

306
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,708
And again, I was wrong.

307
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,205
What you did today for your patient
was remarkable.

308
00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:00,351
You made it clear that saving lives
is your first priority.

309
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,324
Unfortunately...

310
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,227
it may have cost you
your career as a surgeon.

311
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,958
You've traumatized
your joint capsule incisions.

312
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,829
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,607
I'm not afraid to die.

314
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,356
I was raised a good Catholic,

315
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,517
altar boy, First Communion...

316
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,498
faithfully wore my silver crucifix

317
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,262
that Tía Ynez gave me
for confirmation.

318
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,403
I was a true believer.

319
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,065
Then I went to college.

320
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,879
And maybe it's just now that I'm...

321
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,379
staring into the yawning void,

322
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,845
I'm hedging my bet, but...

323
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,053
it's coming back to me...

324
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,088
like an old friend with a warm hug.

325
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:43,222
- I want you to know that I...
- Don't.

326
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,194
You should go.

327
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,565
This place still has a crisis going on.

328
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,780
Goodbye, Claire.

329
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,211
Goodbye.

330
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,723
Ninety-six point one. That's okay.

331
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,936
Feels way colder than 96.

332
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,133
Feels like 56...

333
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,803
Forty-six...

334
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,948
- Thirty-six...
- Casey?

335
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,649
- Twenty-six...
- Casey.

336
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,814
Stay with me just a little longer.

337
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,756
I can't give you any more epi.

338
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,353
Casey.

339
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,536
Dad?

340
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,551
Yeah.

341
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,547
I'm right here.

342
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,653
- You had morphine?
- I saved it in case I needed to do this.

343
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,396
- Good thinking not telling me.
- Yes.

344
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,526
The upside?

345
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,465
In three minutes,
I'm gonna lose 10 pounds.

346
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,666
I'd say only eight,

347
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,072
unless you count blood loss...

348
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,940
- Do you take everything literally?
- No.

349
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,539
Lea, I need you
to count off the seconds

350
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,345
<i>from one to 180.</i>

351
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,353
<i>I want to know how close I am
to three minutes.</i>

352
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,013
How will that help you?

353
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,855
I don't think it will.

354
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,554
But it may help distract you
from the screaming.

355
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,559
- Ready?
- No.

356
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,330
Just do it, for God's sakes.

357
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,112
One... two...

358
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,949
three...

359
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,758
I wanna go back in.

360
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,067
If we resect more bowel
and do a trauma whipple...

361
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,159
A trauma whipple?

362
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,498
It's a big surgery.

363
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,564
Okay, a huge surgery
and there's obviously no guarantee

364
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,440
and lots of complications,
but if we act now...

365
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:55,106
Whoa, let's just hold on for one second.

366
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,649
First of all, we are talking
about Melendez, correct?

367
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,480
Secondly, we do know the numbers...

368
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,918
They're terrible.

369
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,514
And maybe so's this idea.
But that's how this works.

370
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,286
You shoot down mine,
I shoot down yours,

371
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,520
until we come up
with a viable solution.

372
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:13,596
Okay, here goes.

373
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,933
The mesenteric bypass already failed,

374
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,973
his lactates have more than doubled
from 4 to 8.1,

375
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,441
any significant revascularization
is already out of the question.

376
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,174
If by some miracle,
he were to survive the surgery,

377
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,348
he'd be tube-fed, a diabetic,

378
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,978
with an ostomy bag,
waiting for a liver transplant.

379
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,358
Your turn.

380
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,921
It's time to stop being a doctor.

381
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,828
Be a friend.

382
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,002
Dad. I knew.

383
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,541
I knew about Mom.

384
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,646
I knew about the drugs.

385
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,823
I should've told you.

386
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,324
I knew too.

387
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,539
Of course I knew.

388
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,575
When you love someone,

389
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,269
you know when something's wrong.

390
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,914
But, Dad, if you knew...

391
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,747
I did what I thought I could.

392
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,416
Sometimes...

393
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,223
you can help them, but...

394
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,193
sometimes there's just nothing
anyone can do.

395
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,632
And we were the adults.

396
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,035
It was our problem,
our responsibility,

397
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,698
never yours, Casey.

398
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,111
It was never your fault.

399
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:24,258
<i>Sixty-seven, 68, 69, 70.</i>

400
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,962
- I've made it to the bone.
<i>- Seventy-one, seventy-two...</i>

401
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,592
You need to stay conscious, Vera!

402
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,603
Seventy-five...

403
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,667
<i>Keep counting!</i>

404
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,608
Eighty, eighty-one...

405
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,315
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:49,052
I should've been able to do more.
Faster, better.

407
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,922
I know you wanna find blame.

408
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,793
If there's blame, there's a reason.

409
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,061
Sometimes...

410
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,268
there just isn't.

411
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,331
It pisses me off too.

412
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,708
I could have spent a lifetime
drinking whiskey with you.

413
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,578
I was even starting to like it neat.

414
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,225
What did we do?

415
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,463
No blame.

416
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:00,918
<i>One-fifty, 151, 152, 153...</i>

417
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,697
Vera! Vera!

418
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,034
Exhale!

419
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:12,732
Breathe out!

420
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,005
<i>One-seventy-two, 173, 174...</i>

421
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,750
One-seventy-nine, 180.

422
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,786
That's three minutes, Shaun!

423
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,724
Shaun?

424
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:42,867
Shaun?

425
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,865
Shaun, can you hear me? Shaun!

426
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,233
Dad, it's so cold.

427
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,544
I know.

428
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,678
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,205
We should go snowboarding.

430
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,277
If you teach me one of your tricks.

431
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,984
You'd break your leg
and Mom would kill me.

432
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,423
Heh. Good point.

433
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,260
I love you, Dad.

434
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,746
I love you too.

435
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,197
His father's in the squad car,

436
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,701
we have him on the line now.

437
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,533
Let's get this bar off him.

438
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,403
Mr. Taylor, I'm Dr. Park.

439
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,684
Lea?

440
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,318
It's time to go.

441
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,784
I can't.

442
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:52,186
There's nothing left to do,
we should get you checked out.

443
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,725
<i>We've got something.</i>

444
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,898
You need a helmet.

445
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,910
- Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,749
I heard the A's picked up
another reliever.

447
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,515
Yeah.

448
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:28,030
I keep thinking, what's gonna happen
to the next Theresa Adams?

449
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,133
Remember her?

450
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:35,096
- Gallbladder.
- Or so we thought.

451
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:40,538
We get in there, it's completely healthy,
I blame it on lousy imaging...

452
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,914
you call a duodenal ulcer
blocking the duct. Saved her life.

453
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,615
Just so you know.

454
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,760
You're the best I ever worked with.

455
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,470
A bottle of Macallan says
they win the division.

456
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,775
Twenty-five or 17?

457
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,279
Twenty-five.

458
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,382
It's a sucker bet.

459
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,150
Hey, it's my funeral.

460
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,098
I'll look forward to that Scotch.

461
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,018
I got you something.

462
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,697
You saved me.

463
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,093
No.

464
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,540
I was just in the right place...

465
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,075
at the right time.

466
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,875
That was all you.

467
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,487
You're gonna be okay, Claire.

468
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,896
There is something
I need to tell you.

469
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,194
Me too.

470
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,268
I go first.

471
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,437
You...

472
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,869
are...

473
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,543
a terrible bowler.

474
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,584
Maybe the worst I've ever seen.

475
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,924
And I wanted to tell you
that I hate your tattoo.

476
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,058
Way too much antler.

477
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,634
And I love you.

478
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,074
I love you too.

479
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,979
It's the start of a new day.

480
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,685
Yes, it is.

481
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,849
That was both literally true
and a metaphor.

No, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...

488
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,354

Hey, is Kellan there?

494
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,437

I'd like that.

502
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,024
I made a promise to Vera.

503
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,770
I don't know what that was.

504
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:16,133
It could be a practice kiss,

505
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,369
- or a pity kiss, or a goodbye kiss.
- No, that was...

506
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,244
an "I'm such a stupid idiot
for not seeing it...

507
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,112
but I love you
