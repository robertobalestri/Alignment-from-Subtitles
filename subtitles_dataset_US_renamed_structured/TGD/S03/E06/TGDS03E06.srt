1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,578
Sorry, Dr. Andrews, I had a patient
with some post-op arm pain.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,048
- How can I help you?
- What's happened to all the nurses?

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:25,557
Hello. My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy,
surgical resident, year three.

4
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:31,190
I will be assisted by Dr. Claire Browne
on today's open appendectomy.

5
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:35,794
I will not be putting on my sterile gloves
myself, as I am lead surgeon.

6
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,103
Nurse Fletch, can you adjust
the overhead light?

7
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,572
- How many degrees, Dr. Murphy?
- Yes, I should be more specific.

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,245
A 35-degree angle.

9
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:52,284
Nurse Hawks,
please hand me the 10 blade.

10
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,061
Straight clamp, please, Nurse Fletch.

11
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:08,227
Hello, Dr. Andrews. I'm going to try
to pretend you're not here.

12
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,564
You have not pretended to scrub in

13
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,503
and may not be here
when here is there,

14
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,302
there being OR Two later today.

15
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,270
You don't need a full surgical team
to rehearse.

16
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,608
Some of the staff needs
to get back to their stations.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,376
No, they can stay here.

18
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,613
Chief Lim has assigned me
my second first surgery.

19
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,418
And she assigned them all to me,
and told me to rehearse with all of them

20
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,425
unless and until there's an emergency
on their floor.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,630
Dr. Browne, please hand me the Bovie.

22
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,330
Dr. Browne had a dental appointment.

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:45,265
I'm doing my best to be annoyingly
caring and empathetic in her stead.

24
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,732
There's the baby...

25
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,361
and there's the mass...

26
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,874
way too close together.
A biopsy is out of the question.

27
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,375
The best course is to go in
and remove the entire mass.

28
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,670
Will that be dangerous for the baby?

29
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,307
The odds of your daughter
being harmed are very low.

30
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,909
And what about recovery time?
How long?

31
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,181
Normal recovery's about three weeks.

32
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,487
We're opening a specialty toy store.
I need to be up and about in a week.

33
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,095
- Tell them, Andre.
- Sustainable natural toys.

34
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,888
Good for the kids,
good for the world.

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,363
I don't really wanna leave Andre
to fight the crowds alone.

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,936
A week is not realistic.

37
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,662
Too much stress after the surgery
could put the pregnancy at risk.

38
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:56,876
It's okay.

39
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,538
Andre worries.

40
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,743
Thought it was too much
to start a business and a family

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,840
all before our first anniversary.

42
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,388
Business and family are easy.

43
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:12,018
If I'd known it was business
and family and cancer, I...

44
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,093
might have waited on one of them.

45
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,094
Let's just worry about the surgery
right now.

46
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,098
Dr. Lim.

47
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,404
Just came from Dr. Murphy's
improv class.

48
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,811
Don't remember Browne getting a full
team rehearsal before her first surgery.

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,748
Our residents are not homogeneous.

50
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,549
Each one requires different attention
and training.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,715
I agree. And for Shaun,
that means less training wheels

52
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,315
and more scabbed knees.

53
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,260
Trust me, his knees will get scabbed.
I'm trying to prevent a decapitation.

54
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,574
- If he's not ready...
- Why don't you follow your own advice?

55
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,227
You think this is the wrong option,
stop telling me.

56
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,099
Let me fail and learn.

57
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,003
But be sure to apologize
when you realize I was right.

58
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,235
The appendix can be removed
in various ways,

59
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,941
including suture ligation,
purse-stringing

60
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,676
and inversion appendectomy.

61
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,311
I will be using
the suture ligation technique.

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,322
Dr. Browne,
place a clamp just proximal

63
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,654
to the distal ligature
on the appendix.

64
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,921
How's it going with Carly?

65
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:25,364
Divide sharply and cauterize
the exposed mucosa.

66
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,924
Isn't dating life wonderful?
Everything you hoped it would be?

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,603
Okay.

68
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,971
Please refrain from asking
non-surgical questions, Morgan.

69
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,979
I need to concentrate on the next
step in my OR management.

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,776
And I need to be Claire.

71
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,373
Any chance she's not concerned

72
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,817
about your personal well-being
and inquire repeatedly?

73
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:56,125
Things are going well, Dr. Browne.

74
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,824
We make out a lot.

75
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,099
Let's close the peritoneal cavity.

76
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,899
Did you guys have lots of fun
on your last day off?

77
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,231
I went to the museum.

78
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,010
Nurse Hawks, please check
the patient's vitals.

79
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,841
Everything looks normal.

80
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,245
You went alone?

81
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:19,718
I called Carly at her house to see if
she wanted to play Chinese checkers.

82
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,518
Close the external oblique fascia
with a continuous 2-0 Vicryl stitch.

83
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,388
Although, they're not really Chinese,

84
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,895
it's actually a game of German origin
called "Sternhalma."

85
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,996
It's very fun.

86
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:36,162
I will use 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular
interrupted sutures for skin closure.

87
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,264
However, Carly said she could not
hang out because she was busy.

88
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,899
If the wound was contaminated,
we could leave in a Penrose drain

89
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,446
and remove it two to three days later,
but it is not.

90
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,449
She had friends over. I could
hear laughing in the background.

91
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,043
Dr. Browne, approximate
all split muscle layers.

92
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,557
That's odd.

93
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,192
Nothing is odd.

94
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,162
We just have two more steps and...

95
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:09,260
No, that whatever she was doing,
she didn't invite you.

96
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,705
Why?

97
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,106
She isn't treating you
like a boyfriend.

98
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,737
You don't exclude your significant other
from a get-together.

99
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,907
Not true.
It could've been a family thing.

100
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,451
Or she thinks it's too early
to introduce you to friends.

101
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,248
It's also possible that there was
no get-together at all.

102
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,551
I mean, maybe you just heard
the television.

103
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,422
Maybe she just doesn't see you
as her boyfriend.

104
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,927
Has she ever called
you her boyfriend?

105
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,837
We have practiced enough.

106
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,021
You had a dental appointment
this morning.

107
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,858
The reason you're late.

108
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,626
So brush extra well
and don't forget to floss.

109
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,794
Thanks.

110
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,531
Don't take this the wrong way,
but when did you get so slutty?

111
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,933
I'm not.
Thank you for covering, now...

112
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,305
This smells like it's been dipped
in Drakkar cologne.

113
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,470
Do you really care what I wear
or what I do?

114
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,108
I care when you're late. About the
extra work I do covering for you.

115
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,812
I was an hour late, how much
extra work could that be?

116
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,186
One hour's worth.

117
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,323
You can thank me by taking
two hours off my hands.

118
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,328
Thank you.

119
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,134
Hey, Shaun.

120
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,809
Hello.

121
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,571
Waiting for Carly?

122
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,643
I want to know why she did not
invite me to her get-together.

123
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,181
Might have a better chance of finding out
if you were physically closer.

124
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,283
Maybe later.

125
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,230
This prescription should help him
feel a little bit better.

126
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,594
And if I may suggest,

127
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:24,432
don't store the chocolate laxatives
in the candy drawer.

128
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,340
- Hi.
- Hey.

129
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,707
I was wondering
if you could get away for lunch.

130
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,948
Yeah. Let me see if I can move
some things around. Come on in.

131
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,072
All right.

132
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,686
I got fired.

133
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,822
- What?
- Mm-hm.

134
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,382
- What happened?
- I was giving away free coffee.

135
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,461
We work in a hospital
and I hear a lot of sad stories.

136
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,395
And sometimes, when they're really sad,

137
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,299
I like to give that person a free coffee
and it makes them smile.

138
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,228
And yes, okay, I know
it's against policy.

139
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:02,332
But you'd think my asshat boss
would give me more than two warnings

140
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,243
- before giving me the ax.
- Okay.

141
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,771
What do you want me to do?
Beat him up?

142
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,643
I want you to come home for lunch
and I wanna bitch about my ex-boss

143
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,619
and I want someone there to...

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,051
listen.

145
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Okay.

146
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,623
Use a tenaculum to grasp the
lesion to create countertraction.

147
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm gonna separate the mass
from the underlying myometrium.

148
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,931
Damn it. Let's get suction.

149
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,571
The mass has surrounded
the uterine arteries.

150
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,591
We can't remove the mass
without killing the baby.

151
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,244
Dr. Reznick, if you were lead,
how would you proceed?

152
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,253
We're already in, so...

153
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,948
I'd biopsy the mass for testing.

154
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,500
Then perform an embolization
of the arteries feeding the tumor.

155
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,284
Very good. Dr. Park, what does that do?

156
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,761
It should allow us
to control the bleeding

157
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,991
so we can leave the baby
in place for two months.

158
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,264
That'll give the baby time
to become viable outside the womb.

159
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,135
At that point, we go back in,
safely take out the baby and the mass.

160
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,673
Sounds like the right call to me.

161
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,385
We'll be performing an embolization
of the arteries feeding the tumor.

162
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,038
- I'll inform Chief Lim.
- Not necessary.

163
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,046
It's protocol to run all decisions

164
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,844
about complex procedures
by the chief of surgery.

165
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,315
There's only one clear path,
which means there is no decision.

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,566
In my office, please.

167
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,670
I didn't think you'd mind.

168
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,209
We always complained about Andrews
and his red tape.

169
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,546
I hoped our relationship is better
than whatever you had with Andrews.

170
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,945
It is. But you're busy,

171
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,488
- you don't need...
- You know how this makes me look?

172
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,083
You know how this makes me look?

173
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,661
This job was on your to-do list.

174
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,094
The lab must have made a mistake.
I'll deal with it.

175
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,829
We might have a bigger issue
than you lying about the blood test.

176
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,996
I'm not lying.

177
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,097
Like I said, this is a bigger issue.
Shaun is distracted.

178
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,210
- Well, why would he be...
- Because you were at the dentist.

179
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,111
Nurse Hawks asked questions.
Carly didn't invite Shaun to something,

180
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,358
and now he's worried
they're not boyfriend and girlfriend.

181
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,284
- So did you talk to him?
- No, that's what you do.

182
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,753
Think I put it on your list,
"Be kind and care," so I don't have to.

183
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,690
- Okay, I'll talk to him.
- Talk to Carly first.

184
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,354
Do it when you drop off the blood vials
and pretend it's the second time.

185
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,889
This is good, you were wasted there.

186
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,366
I was happy there.

187
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,561
I love that hospital.

188
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,096
I love... I love the staff
and the patients. It just...

189
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,575
It felt like home.

190
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,243
Here's a thought.

191
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,607
What if I come work with you?

192
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,052
I saw your waiting room,
you need the help.

193
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,522
- We have an office manager.
- She doesn't manage. She's never there.

194
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,615
I was a nurse.

195
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,459
I could schedule your appointments,
I could triage the walk-ins.

196
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,065
It's like a win-win.

197
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,096
I don't think we have the budget
for new employees.

198
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,238
Aaron, that's horse crap.

199
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,443
You're the president.

200
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,910
What's the real reason?

201
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,583
I... I think couples...

202
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,417
that are apart now and then,
it's a good thing.

203
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,285
Couples together 24/7?

204
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,758
I don't want to get to the point
where we come home

205
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,455
and we run to opposite
sides of the house.

206
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,427
Okay, it was just a thought.

207
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,969
Just gonna...

208
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,638
keep looking.

209
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,443
Hi, Carly.

210
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,107
Replacement vials.

211
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,117
For some reason the bloodwork
for Shaun's case was never processed.

212
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,279
- That doesn't sound right.
- Why is not important.

213
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,984
But if you could put a rush on them.
If the tests get delayed any longer,

214
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,526
Shaun's surgery
could get rescheduled.

215
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,892
There's no record of bloodwork
dropped off for Shaun.

216
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:21,400
If his surgery gets rescheduled, Shaun
will lose the team he's practiced with.

217
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,628
It might throw him.

218
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,194
Shaun doesn't get thrown by
anything medical.

219
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,865
Shaun is already thrown.

220
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,107
He has it in his head that you dissed him,

221
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,617
that maybe there's a problem.
And now he seems distracted, upset.

222
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,916
I wondered if you could speak with him,
let him know everything's okay.

223
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,192
I'll make sure to put a rush
on the blood tests.

224
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,986
Thank you.

225
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,764
My wife says
that the earth is a womb,

226
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,998
and when you garden, you
become part of its birthing process.

227
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:02,140
Not that I mind sharing hobbies
with her, it keeps us close.

228
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,234
And I don't mind the dirt in my eyes.

229
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,744
Just could do with a little less
of the talking.

230
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,247
I feel you.

231
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,080
You don't by any chance possess
the power of flight?

232
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,679
- What?
- You have a wing in your eye.

233
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,188
- I'm sorry?
- Just hold still.

234
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,189
Ow.

235
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,527
Congratulations. Your womb
just gave birth to a bee.

236
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,462
Ew.

237
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,932
Triplets, in fact.

238
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,768
Dr.. Glassman,
I need to compartmentalize.

239
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,870
Hi, Shaun.

240
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,870
Nurse Hawks says girlfriends invite
their boyfriends to get-togethers.

241
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,603
That means it's possible Carly
did not invite me

242
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,374
because I am not her boyfriend.

243
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,417
But we make out
and she wants to hold my hand

244
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,715
and she lets me touch her breasts.

245
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,253
Those are things you do
with a boyfriend.

246
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,224
Now all I think about is Carly.

247
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,228
Even when I'm supposed to be doing
my job. I do not like it.

248
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,787
I tried to talk to her, but I can't.

249
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,197
- You can't talk to her?
- I can't.

250
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,395
I need to compartmentalize.

251
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,567
Well, Shaun, you're very good
at compartmentalizing.

252
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,075
Were you wearing your white lab coat
when you tried to talk to her?

253
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,079
No, I was in my surgical scrubs.

254
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:17,777
Okay. See, we all struggle to...
To separate our work life

255
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,318
with our personal life, right?

256
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,950
That's why we wear uniforms.
It tells us, it tells the world:

257
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,789
"This is what I have to focus on right now,
I can't worry about anything else."

258
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,824
- That makes sense.
- Good.

259
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,022
So when Carly's wearing
her white lab coat,

260
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,621
she's just a co-worker,

261
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,531
not a girl you happen to be seeing
at the moment.

262
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,365
When you're wearing your lab coat,

263
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,269
you say to yourself,
"I'm a doctor, damn it.

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,632
I'm not gonna worry
about everything else."

265
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:47,146
Say to yourself, "I'm a doctor,
romance doesn't matter."

266
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,315
I'm a doctor,
romance doesn't matter.

267
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,046
I'm a doctor,
romance doesn't matter.

268
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,453
I am a doctor,
romance doesn't matter.

269
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,521
I am a doctor,
romance doesn't matter.

270
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,793
Um, you're wearing a white lab coat.

271
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,500
Wanna be a doctor
and get the other bees out?

272
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,906
You make a fair point.

273
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,471
- Looking for Murphy?
- Yep.

274
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,079
- Blood test being expedited?
- Yes.

275
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,550
Did you own your mistake
or blame some innocent clerk?

276
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,179
How did it feel? Is it eating at you?

277
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,385
You mean, how do I live one moment
behaving how you do constantly?

278
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,727
At least I'm consistent, even when
I'm going through my own issues.

279
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,326
Shaun?

280
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:47,903
- Why aren't you wearing your white coat?
- I am a civilian.

281
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,532
Medicine doesn't matter.

282
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,778
You're not leaving.
Your surgery is in six hours.

283
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,615
Did you speak to Carly?

284
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,685
I need to talk to Carly.

285
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,454
Shaun, why did we practice
this morning?

286
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,559
Because...

287
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,362
- I'm not good at communication.
- Exactly.

288
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,031
But with practice, you can do it.

289
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,766
Talk to me.

290
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,201
Tell me the problem,
tell me how you feel.

291
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,272
Okay.

292
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,844
I have to talk to Carly.

293
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:29,281
Shaun, stop.
You don't have to talk to Carly.

294
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,544
Everything is fine, I talked to her

295
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,477
and it was just
all a misunderstanding.

296
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,820
Why did she not invite me over
to meet her friends?

297
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,292
There were no friends.

298
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,919
Uh, the laughing you heard,

299
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,829
it must have been a podcast
she was listening to.

300
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,896
I need to get my lab coat.

301
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,600
Told you you're better
at this than I am.

302
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,677
Though you could have
jumped in earlier.

303
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,079
We were able to do a biopsy
and the mass is non-malignant.

304
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,251
We've stabilized it, but it does
still need to be removed.

305
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,151
- When?
- Two months.

306
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,594
By then the baby
will be viable outside the...

307
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I don't feel well.

308
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,628
My vision's getting blurry.

309
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,600
- Your blood pressure's tanking.
- What?

310
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,336
- Doctor, what's happening to her?
- Page Dr. Melendez.

311
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,450
Hello. My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy,

312
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,723
surgical resident, year three.

313
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:56,295
I will be assisted by Dr. Claire Browne
on today's open appendectomy.

314
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,961
I will not be putting on
my number seven sterile gloves myself

315
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,635
as I am lead surgeon.

316
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,535
Nurse Fletch...

317
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,670
can you adjust the overhead light?

318
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,075
Adjust to a 35-degree angle.

319
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,750
Nurse Hawks,
please hand me the ten blade.

320
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,507
The arterial embolization
was rejected above the bladder.

321
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,671
The mass is seeping blood,

322
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,507
and we have to go in again
or she'll slowly bleed to death.

323
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,673
We deliver the baby early, have an
incubator and ventilator in the OR.

324
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,677
Even with maximal NICU support,

325
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,584
the baby's chance of survival
is around 15 to 20 percent.

326
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,746
Maybe we were wrong the first time.

327
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,957
Maybe we can leave the child
and work around her.

328
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,529
We can suction resect
this friable lesion

329
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,622
and control the bleeding better
with the argon beam coagulator.

330
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,258
Very easy to go too far,
cause a uterine rupture.

331
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,248
If we don't screw up, the baby gets to stay
in the womb and grow to term.

332
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,700
- Nice.
- I'll go book an OR.

333
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,033
Wait.

334
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,707
One more thing we need to do.

335
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,150
It's a good plan,
but the safest course of action

336
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,277
is to deliver prematurely
and remove the mass.

337
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,452
By "deliver prematurely,"
you mean terminate the pregnancy.

338
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,789
Not necessarily. But yes.

339
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,523
To save her life.

340
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,260
If I place internal
iliac artery balloon catheters,

341
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,392
I can control most bleeding as it happens.

342
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,468
Most?

343
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,032
I've performed surgeries
a lot more complicated

344
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,340
- under more difficult circumstances.
- When you had no other option.

345
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,515
You have a choice, a safer choice,
the mother's life takes precedence.

346
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,049
That's our policy.

347
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,817
Are we sure it's hers?

348
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,549
Okay. Go make your case.

349
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,158
Thank you.

350
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,120
Neil.

351
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,957
Thank you for getting my approval.

352
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,125
It's your job.

353
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,100
I will now use electrocautery

354
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,075
to incise through both
the fascia and muscles.

355
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,137
Can I please get a measurement
on the patient's pulse,

356
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,182
blood pressure and temperature?

357
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,808
Pulse is at 65.

358
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:29,822
Pressure 118 over 82
and temp is normal at 98.6 degrees.

359
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,191
Thank you for hearing and responding.

360
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,454
The appendix can be removed
in various ways.

361
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,989
I will be using
the suture ligation technique.

362
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,161
Dr. Browne, can you identify the
ascending colon and its taenia coli?

363
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,639
- I see it.
- Thank you.

364
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,845
Please free
the appendix-mesoappendix complex

365
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,315
from its adjacent tissue.
Babcock clamps.

366
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,390
We must have nicked an ileocolic
branch of the SMA.

367
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,032
Get suction on it, Dr. Browne.

368
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,901
Nurse Fletch, please use lap sponges
to stem the bleed.

369
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,613
- If she hemorrhages, she could die?
- That is a possibility.

370
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,883
But if you're successful,
then I complete my pregnancy.

371
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,288
No, it's too risky.

372
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,026
If Dr. Melendez says he can do it...

373
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:46,956
Do the other surgery, the one where
you take the baby out and save Patty.

374
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,095
I'm the one carrying the baby.
I'm the one going through the surgery.

375
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,968
- It's not your choice.
- I didn't want this baby.

376
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,637
Sorry, I...

377
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,907
We can have another child
some other time.

378
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,215
But I can't replace you.

379
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,396
I don't want another baby.

380
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,701
I want the one that's been giving me
morning sickness for the last

381
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,169
23 weeks.

382
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,635
I want the one
who's been giving me heartburn,

383
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,768
constipation and insomnia.

384
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,646
That's the baby that I wanna hold.

385
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,711
And I couldn't live with the guilt...

386
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,849
if I killed our baby
to save my own life.

387
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,873
Performing a suture ligation
with two interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.

388
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,462
Dr. Browne, cauterize
the exposed mucosa.

389
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,267
I may owe Dr. Lim an apology.

390
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,774
- Continue.
- Yes.

391
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:41,208
We still need to copiously irrigate
the wound with normal saline,

392
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,475
grasp the peritoneum
with two straight clamps,

393
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,678
and close it up
with a continuous 3-0 Vicryl stitch.

394
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,982
Irrigating.

395
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,657
Straight clamp, please, Nurse...

396
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,029
Straight clamp, please, Nurse Hawks.

397
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,895
You are handing them
to me incorrectly.

398
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,168
I'm sorry?

399
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,837
You are handing them
to me incorrectly.

400
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,814
This is how I always do it.

401
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,180
You do it wrong.

402
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,615
- Shaun.
- I don't know how else to do it.

403
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,085
You can do it the right way.

404
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,218
- What's the right way?
- The efficient way.

405
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,819
- Efficient?
- Yes.

406
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,756
There is historical precedence...

407
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,861
to my preference.

408
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,903
- Please just take the clamp.
- I can't.

409
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,303
Of course you can.
Take the damn clamp.

410
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,472
You need to leave.

411
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,084
Nurse Hawks...

412
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,752
you need to leave the OR.

413
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,220
Leave now.

414
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,506
Dr. Reznick, please cauterize
those bleeders with the argon coagulator.

415
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,279
I nicked an artery.
She's hemorrhaging.

416
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,517
Hang four units on the rapid infuser.
Give me a vascular clamp.

417
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,987
The surgery was successful,
the patient's vital signs are stable...

418
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,323
You can't solve
your interpersonal problems

419
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,261
- by making people go away.
- There was a bleed.

420
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,097
You threw the nurse out
because of a bleed?

421
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,167
Yes.

422
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,170
Because we nicked the ileocolic
branch of the SMA,

423
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,207
Nurse Fletch was attending
to the lap sponges,

424
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:54,303
so Nurse Hawks had to hand me the
straight clamp and she did it wrong.

425
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,973
And she refused to do it right.

426
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,284
Did you tell her how to?

427
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:05,052
I wanted my straight clamp
handed to me at a 45-degree angle.

428
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,353
So I do not have to bend my wrist

429
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,485
to go from handoff
to the surgical field.

430
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,223
Did you explain all of that to her?

431
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,665
I told her to do it the efficient way.

432
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:22,172
I want you to apologize
to Nurse Hawks.

433
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,539
No, no.

434
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:28,307
Why would I apologize
because she did not do it right?

435
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,143
Because you didn't either.

436
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,076
When you're lead surgeon,
you're in charge.

437
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,248
Which means if anything goes wrong,
it's your fault.

438
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,083
Do you understand?

439
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,724
You've gotta make this right.

440
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:47,659
Okay.

441
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,108
You could have stepped in
and kept this situation from escalating.

442
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,115
You have your way
of dealing with Shaun.

443
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,517
And so do I.

444
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,097
We need better control.
Clamp off the common iliac.

445
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,030
There's too much blood to see in here.

446
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,091
We have to take the baby out.

447
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,105
Page the on-call neonatologist.

448
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,145
They're gonna have a 23-week-old girl
coming their way very soon.

449
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:40,219
Second time in as many days
you've dropped by unexpectedly.

450
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,651
Starting to think you like me.

451
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,315
- I got a job offer.
- Well, there you go, that was quick.

452
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,394
- Let's go celebrate.
- I'm not gonna take the offer.

453
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,258
I wanna work here with you.

454
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,230
We've already talked about that.

455
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,959
You talked, I listened.

456
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,224
Now it's my turn to talk.

457
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,404
We got married to be here
for each other,

458
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,600
even when the other one didn't know
they need it.

459
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,141
You're so busy with your patients

460
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,576
you don't see that the clinic
is starting to suffer.

461
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,739
Right now it's
double-booked appointments.

462
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,644
Next, it could be
the wrong medication prescribed.

463
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,151
- I'd never let that happen.
- I'm a good partner.

464
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,284
I'm good at home, on the weekends.

465
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,088
I could be equally as good here
in this office.

466
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,487
Okay, if it doesn't work out, I'll quit.

467
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,096
Or you can fire me.

468
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,326
No harm, no foul.

469
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,928
Nothing is ever as simple
as "no harm, no foul."

470
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,207
Got a resume?

471
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,634
Well, I was...

472
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,144
hoping...

473
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,638
to avoid that.

474
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,411
I read a study that said

475
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:22,750
sharing a cup of coffee with colleagues
promotes professionalism.

476
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,882
My cup is empty because I do not like
the way coffee makes me feel.

477
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,361
I've had a long day.
Can I just enjoy my lunch?

478
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,095
Chief Lim asked me
to apologize to you.

479
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:38,869
Okay.

480
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,239
Okay.

481
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:55,416
The earliest known drawing
of a pivoting surgical instrument

482
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,423
dates back to 1500 BC on a tomb
at Thebes, Egypt.

483
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,755
This does not sound like
the beginning of an apology.

484
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,456
I want to explain why I prefer
the straight clamp handed to me

485
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,396
at a 45-degree angle.

486
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,667
Putting it in historical
context will help.

487
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,691
You need to stop.

488
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:15,231
In the ninth century, Albucasis,
known as the father of surgery...

489
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:20,109
- You need to go away.
- No, I need you to understand,

490
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,805
because if you see why I'm right,

491
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,940
you will see there is no reason
for me to apologize.

492
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,497
- She's gone into unstable V-tach.
- We're gonna need the defibrillator.

493
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,305
Charging.

494
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,007
Clear.

495
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,445
- Continue compressions.
- One milligram of epinephrine.

496
00:31:56,348 --> 00:32:00,308
- She's gone into V-fib. Shock again.
- Charging. Clear.

497
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,084
I'm gonna crack her chest.
I'm gonna do an open-heart massage.

498
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,261
Heart's exposed.

499
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,003
Starting the massage.

500
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,798
Internal cardiac paddles.

501
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,446
Charging.

502
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,608
Clear.

503
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,286
Again.

504
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,818
Charge. Clear.

505
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,391
Again.

506
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,193
Charge.

507
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,324
Clear.

508
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,713
Open the uterus and get the baby.

509
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,767
All you had to do
was say you're sorry.

510
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,708
I tried to explain
why the straight clamp...

511
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:38,576
I don't hear the word "sorry."
I don't hear any taking of responsibility.

512
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,211
You said I had to make this right.

513
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,185
An apology seemed to be
just one possible way...

514
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,283
Shaun, she filed a complaint.

515
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,718
- No. No.
- Yes.

516
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,797
You have a problem with communication.

517
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,389
- But I am...
- I'm going to make this clear.

518
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,798
You screwed up.

519
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,426
- No. No.
- Yes. Yeah, you were wrong.

520
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,437
You are wrong. You screwed up.

521
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,102
This incident will
be noted in your file.

522
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,337
And if this, or anything like this,
happens again,

523
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,812
that will be the end
of your residency.

524
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,253
Now, what do you have to say?

525
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,451
You're sorry?

526
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,094
I failed.

527
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,129
I'm sorry.

528
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,773
Good.

529
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,404
Now go say those words
to Nurse Hawks...

530
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:40,805
and mean them.

531
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,134
I spoke to Carly.

532
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,601
You're a terrible fairy godmother.

533
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,111
You swoop in,
enchant the hero with a lie

534
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,273
and you carry on
like you made his world better.

535
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,674
Shaun was about to talk to Carly.
That's what he needed to do.

536
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,218
I think Carly's pissed at him.

537
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,686
Fine, then she's pissed at him.
They deal with it.

538
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:27,288
Shaun's problem is communication.
You made it worse.

539
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,023
Shaun needed to get his head straight
before his first solo surgery.

540
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,724
That is what I did.
I fixed the problem.

541
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,134
You buried the problem.

542
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,932
Which seems to be your general
approach to life right now.

543
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,261
Hey, Shaun.

544
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:52,963
Hello.

545
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,433
We need to talk.

546
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,217
You're mad at me.

547
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,080
Yes.

548
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:12,017
Because whenever you have a problem,
I hear it from Glassman,

549
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,024
or Claire, or Morgan.

550
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:15,893
Anyone but you.

551
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,135
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,171
Good.

553
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,500
Shaun, stop!

554
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:38,179
This is the problem. You have to tell me
what's bothering you.

555
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,748
Why did you not invite me
to your get-together last Sunday?

556
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,220
I had some old friends over.

557
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,529
We were gonna drink
and play a little poker.

558
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,225
My friends are snarky.

559
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,994
They tease and play practical jokes
on each other,

560
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,565
and I knew that you wouldn't like that
and that it would get weird,

561
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,167
so I decided not to invite you.

562
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,579
That's it...

563
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,345
the whole story.

564
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,414
My father...

565
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,049
always sent me to my room...

566
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,788
when he would play poker
with his friends.

567
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,762
They were loud...

568
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,266
and they would tease me.

569
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,600
They said I talked funny.

570
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,933
Is that what your friends
were going to say?

571
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:37,170
- No, Shaun. Of course not.
- Then what were they going to do?

572
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,903
Nothing, I guess.

573
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,273
It's just...

574
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,180
Sometimes, when you bring the guy
that you're dating into the mix,

575
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,913
that relationship changes.

576
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,081
It can be a disaster.

577
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,989
Was it a disaster...

578
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,062
every time you brought a date
to meet your friends?

579
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,992
- No, some fit right in.
- Then how did you know...

580
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:10,731
How did you know
it would be a disaster with me?

581
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,206
I didn't.

582
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,319
I made an assumption...

583
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,454
and I shouldn't have done that.

584
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,585
I'm sorry too.

585
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,291
Can you forgive me?

586
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,704
I wasn't a great girlfriend.

587
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,965
"Girlfriend"?

588
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,644
- You're my girlfriend?
- Yeah.

589
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,946
- Does that mean I'm your boyfriend?
- You are.

590
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,784
Oh. I forgive you.

591
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,890
- Can I kiss you?
- Okay.

592
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,539
- I'm glad we talked.
- Me too.

593
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,747
I'll introduce you
to my friends next week.

594
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,378
No, thank you. I would not like
to meet your friends.

595
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,286
- Okay.
- Okay.
