1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,571
Okay. Ha-ha-ha.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,300
- Okay.
- Aah!

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,479
Okay.

4
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,886
This is terrifying!

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,801
And very fun!

6
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,607
Are you ready to try lying down?

7
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,238
Because I am ready, Shaun.

8
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,749
I am very ready.

9
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,079
Carly...

10
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,889
Six-hundred-thread count
microfiber sheets,

11
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,985
a shredded memory-foam pillow.

12
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:37,990
A 40-watt A-19
incandescent bulb.

13
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,595
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,624
You didn't return my calls
this weekend.

15
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,174
After a ride up Skyline Boulevard,

16
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,152
60 minutes of Muay Thai,
and a 15-year reserve Scotch,

17
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,847
I had a moment of clarity.

18
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,621
What you said about my objectivity
in the Fields case wasn't about me.

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,858
You were in pain.

20
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,730
I was taking responsibility,

21
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,227
and asking you to take your share.

22
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,664
It was a good surgical plan.

23
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:58,936
You need to accept that despite
being a gifted surgeon,

24
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,946
you are fallible.

25
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,385
I think I should run my procedures
by Glassman from now on.

26
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,320
Audrey, we need some checks
and balances.

27
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,022
I am checked and balanced.

28
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,764
And I'm the chief
of this department.

29
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,107
You will continue to run
your medical decisions past me.

30
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,246
<i>Browne, you're with Melendez.</i>

31
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,086
Murphy and Park, meet me in the ER
observation unit in 20.

32
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,491
I thought I was on ER consults
with Park today.

33
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,539
If I'm being bumped
because I took off the other day,

34
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,930
- Dr. Browne was every bit of...
- Your first lead surgery.

35
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,291
Thank you.

36
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,579
Scheduled for tomorrow.

37
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,697
Study the images,
prep your patient.

38
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,703
Yes! I rock. I rock.

39
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,607
The surgery gods know it.
I know it.

40
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,010
And apparently, so does Andrews.

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,380
Boasting doesn't have the same impact
when you're picked last.

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,215
He was obviously waiting
for the right case to come along.

43
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,286
No.

44
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,448
You're kidding me.

45
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,783
This is much better
than my first surgery.

46
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,420
Damn right.
A med student could do an appy.

47
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,432
The carotid endarterectomy
takes serious finesse.

48
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,468
Fair to say it's really
a fifth-year procedure,

49
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,833
but I don't have time to sit around
debating semantics.

50
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,635
I have the Holy Grail
of resident surgeries to prep for.

51
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,039
The tumor was found on my left lung
at my medical fitness exam.

52
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,974
Tricky spot.

53
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,817
Curable, but tough to remove
without taking the entire lung.

54
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,085
- That's what they said.
- You didn't like that answer?

55
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,423
I need my lung.

56
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,795
I'm going to the moon.

57
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,545
When did the chest pain start?

58
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,946
- Around 9 this morning.

59
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,475
Okay. I'm gonna look at your heart.
This gel may be a little cold.

60
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,886
You see a cardiologist.
Did you use the nitro he prescribed?

61
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,118
It usually relieves the angina,
but not this time.

62
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,457
Are you the same Rosalind Elion

63
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,229
who just published a study
on IDH-2 inhibitors

64
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,237
in myeloid leukemia
in the Journal of Pediatric Oncology?

65
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,533
Yeah.

66
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,698
Wow.

67
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,298
You're famous.

68
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,869
I used an IDH-2
on a kid with AML.

69
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,608
- Now he's doing great.
- Oh.

70
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,345
And your study's revolutionized
leukemia treatment.

71
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,910
- It's an honor to meet you.
- That's kind of you to say.

72
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,615
Noticing anteroapical
wall motion abnormalities.

73
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,353
- Is your chest pain worsening?
- Yes, how did you...

74
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,058
She's having a heart attack.
Contact her family, meet us in Surgery.

75
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,722
She needs a triple bypass.

76
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,405
- The moon?
- The moon.

77
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
In 2020.

78
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,076
It's a private venture partnership
with NASA.

79
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,180
Floating in an expanse
of uninhabitable emptiness

80
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,046
200,000 miles
from the nearest Starbucks.

81
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,650
Not for me.

82
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,219
You never wanted to be an astronaut
when you were a kid?

83
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,148
Had enough challenges here on Earth.
Did you?

84
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,160
- I was a Trekker.
- Ha-ha-ha.

85
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,025
All my friends had Spock ears.

86
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,091
I was all about McCoy.

87
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,228
There's our tumor.

88
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,400
It's embedded in the hilum.

89
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,730
NASA doctor was right.

90
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,605
- We'd have to take the entire lung.
- Not necessarily.

91
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,775
The tumor's growing
into the upper lobe.

92
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,372
If we can remove it from the main
bronchus, we can get a clean margin.

93
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,418
The rest of the lung can stay.

94
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,188
- No-go.
- You'd have 80 percent of your...

95
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,122
If treatment reduces
my lung volume at all,

96
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,093
- I'll be unfit for space travel.
- The mass is too deep.

97
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,924
Major blood vessels,
your airway esophagus,

98
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,761
and heart are right there.

99
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,269
The next opinion you get
will be the same. Or worse.

100
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,202
Thank you for your time.

101
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:02,240
- What do you see at the apex?
- I see perfusion abnormalities.

102
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,881
Her LAD and PD
are completely occluded.

103
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,348
She listed her husband as her proxy.

104
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,287
Update him as soon as he gets here.

105
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,354
The entire left side of her heart
is compromised.

106
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,191
He's not coming.
They've been divorced for two years.

107
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,492
He hasn't spoken to her
in almost that long.

108
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,967
Murphy, anastomose the
internal mammary to the LAD.

109
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,867
See if we can give her heart
a blood supply.

110
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,870
Tracked down her sister
in Santa Cruz.

111
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,771
Hasn't seen Rosalind in years either.

112
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,005
That's a lot of legwork for a
surgeon. No social worker available?

113
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,171
It's good you didn't find anyone.

114
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,647
Family members are the least
qualified people in the room

115
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,776
to make medical decisions.

116
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,689
Judging by the state of her myocardium,
there's only one choice anyway.

117
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,723
She needs a new heart.

118
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,535
I think it's possible to spare her
upper lobe using a surgical robot.

119
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,038
Wren Braxton came to see me.

120
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,105
You're her second opinion?

121
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,337
Or fourth or whatever she's up to?

122
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,177
Surprised you didn't offer
the robotic option.

123
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,740
It's the type of surgery
I usually send your way.

124
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,251
I didn't offer it
because with the robot,

125
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:17,916
if I nick her pulmonary artery, she'd bleed
out before I open her up to control it.

126
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,549
She's gonna keep looking until someone

127
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,618
gives her the answer she wants.
Then what?

128
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,221
What do you think her odds
of survival are

129
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,232
if some hack tries to cut the tumor out,

130
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,823
leaving the lungs intact?

131
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,063
- Roughly zero.
- I agree.

132
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,230
- And with you? With the robot?
- Still lousy.

133
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,865
You can do this.

134
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,408
You're overestimating the risk
and I know why.

135
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,470
And you're doing exactly
what you did last time,

136
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,549
assuming that I can do anything.

137
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,709
So everyone else is biased
except for you?

138
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,912
The one who just had
a patient die on him.

139
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,217
If it's had any effect, it's to make
my judgment more acute.

140
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,091
I won't risk having Wren leave here
the same way Patty Fields did.

141
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,857
People risk things to make
their dreams come true.

142
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,302
If you don't wanna help her,
I'll do it myself.

143
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,081
The intra-aortic balloon pump

144
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,979
will support your heart
until we find a donor.

145
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,574
And when might that be?

146
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,179
A heart is the most
difficult organ to procure.

147
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,689
But since yours
is so badly damaged,

148
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,657
you are very high on the list.

149
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,893
I suppose that's a good thing.

150
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,329
- Not really. The...
- We're doing everything we can.

151
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,094
Thank you.

152
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,995
- Is there anyone you want us to call?
- Yes.

153
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,635
My lab assistant.

154
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:47,270
The next few days are crucial
to my monoclonal antibody study.

155
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,708
Hannah needs to stay
with the cultures around the clock.

156
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,686
I don't want five years of work
to go to waste.

157
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,724
Can I ask why you listed
your ex-husband

158
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,161
as your medical proxy?

159
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,133
I had to name someone.

160
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,193
Leo is the only person
I ever discussed my medical wishes with.

161
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,732
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do, which...

162
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,244
as you've indicated,
I may not have a lot of time to do it.

163
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,525
How are you, Shaun?

164
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,897
These are stat cardiac labs.
I have to go.

165
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,029
I hope you're not embarrassed
about last night.

166
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,036
I want to have sex with you.

167
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,106
That's nice.

168
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,479
I think about it very often.

169
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:01,043
Even when I'm supposed to focus on
more pressing matters.

170
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,420
Like 15 minutes ago when I was
filling out that lab requisition,

171
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,858
- I almost forgot to add a BNP.
- That's good.

172
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,259
No, it's not.

173
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,355
We need a BNP to monitor
her cardiac function

174
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,923
on the balloon pump.

175
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,197
I've been thinking about you too,
sometimes when I shouldn't.

176
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,068
- That's bad.
- Not really.

177
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,074
I've been doing some research.

178
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,876
I came across this therapy
psychologists use to treat phobias.

179
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,547
Apparently it works
in people with autism too.

180
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:35,211
If you're game,
we could try tonight.

181
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:37,823
I'm game.

182
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,733
<i>I need a different first surgery.</i>

183
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,594
Is there a problem
with your patient?

184
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,637
The plaque dissection is too advanced
for a third-year resident.

185
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,239
I was nervous as hell
for my first surgery,

186
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,281
and it was only a tonsillectomy.

187
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,476
I could take out a pair of tonsils
blindfolded.

188
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,611
It's not nerves.
This is a fifth-year procedure.

189
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,247
- You're setting me up to fail.
- This is why I picked you.

190
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,850
You come to me scared
and you couch it in arrogance.

191
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,988
It's rare that a resident
has what you have.

192
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:22,159
The aggressiveness, the work ethic,
and talent to be a leader.

193
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,662
I'm not setting you up to fail,
I'm setting you up to shine.

194
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,434
Or am I wrong about you?

195
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,173
No, sir.

196
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,590
I want you to do my surgery.

197
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,663
The one Dr. Lim suggested.

198
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,500
It was Dr. Lim's idea.

199
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,731
She's an excellent surgeon
and my superior.

200
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,432
And you think I'm an idiot.

201
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,044
I am afraid of this surgery.

202
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,306
And I'm afraid of going
to the moon.

203
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,714
But it's not about the moon,
it's about the fear.

204
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,513
It's about getting beyond that.

205
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,018
That's how great things happen.

206
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,821
How they've always happened.
Because someone took a chance.

207
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,857
From what I've read about you,

208
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,228
you're exactly the kind of person
I need in my corner.

209
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,426
Exactly the kind of person I would
have thought would understand.

210
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,999
Fear is also what keeps us alive.

211
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,240
What are the odds of you
not coming back from the moon?

212
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,206
The reason it's heroic,
the reason it's exciting,

213
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,341
is because you don't know
what to expect.

214
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,751
You can't anticipate everything.

215
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,922
One, two, maybe 5 percent.

216
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,151
Sixty percent.

217
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,594
This surgery, if I were doing it,

218
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,721
there is a 60 percent chance
that you'd die on the table.

219
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,371
It's called exposure therapy.

220
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,704
We'll lie down on the bed
side-by-side,

221
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,973
fully clothed and not touching
for 15 seconds.

222
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,577
When this timer goes off,
you'll go into the other room

223
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,171
for a three-minute break.

224
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,781
And then we'll go again
for 20 seconds.

225
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,321
Over time, we will progress
to longer intervals

226
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,085
and start to lie closer together.

227
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,484
This seems like a good approach.

228
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,797
Whenever you're ready.

229
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,824
Are you okay?
What are you feeling?

230
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,993
I don't know.

231
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,001
I don't... I don't know,

232
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,267
I don't know why it didn't work.

233
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,276
- It's okay, Shaun. We'll try again.
- No. No.

234
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,776
No. No, I can't.

235
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,574
We'll try for less time.

236
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,910
I can't do this.

237
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,787
Go.

238
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,589
What?

239
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,383
Go. Get out of here.

240
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,193
We can watch the end of...

241
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,424
I got the sheets,

242
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,697
the pillow, the damn light bulb,

243
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,928
I read 18 psych journals.

244
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,897
And you give up
after eight seconds?

245
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,743
You're right,
this isn't going to work.

246
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,079
Go home.

247
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,262
How are things with Carly?

248
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,397
I lasted eight seconds.

249
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,407
She kicked me out of her house.

250
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,848
First time is difficult.
I'm sure she didn't...

251
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,081
We tried timed exposure therapy
to get physically closer, but I...

252
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,981
couldn't do it.

253
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,359
So try something else.

254
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,922
When I lie close to her,

255
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,430
I feel diaphoretic.

256
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,460
My heart rate is elevated
and mouth gets dry.

257
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,300
I don't know
how to not feel that way.

258
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,669
You want this, Shaun?

259
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,735
Yes.

260
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,901
Very much.

261
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,875
Then rely on your strengths.

262
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,076
Treat it like a surgical problem.
Do your research.

263
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,515
Carly came up with a solution,
it didn't work,

264
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,418
but that doesn't mean
the next one won't.

265
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,894
Give me good news.
I had a potential donor in San Diego,

266
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,320
but the heart
was just too damaged.

267
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,188
I'm at the GE junction now.

268
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,035
Now she has complete right-sided
failure too.

269
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,265
It's time to discuss a DNR.

270
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,175
She's got one day left in this world.
Let's keep her comfortable.

271
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,184
Sixty percent? That number
is grossly exaggerated.

272
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,017
I spent an hour convincing my patient
I'm not trying to kill her.

273
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,558
She came to me,
I gave her my surgical opinion.

274
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,629
- I could fire you for this.
- Because I contradicted

275
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,630
your opinion after you
contradicted my opinion?

276
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,496
I gave her an option
you were too afraid to present.

277
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,468
No, you proposed a potentially
deadly surgery to a woman

278
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,437
who was desperate for any option.

279
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,474
- You don't have the authority...
- Authority?

280
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,118
I thought we were talking
about the patient.

281
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,872
It was unprofessional, disrespectful...

282
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,708
- If anyone showed a lack of respect...
- Doctors.

283
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,547
My office.

284
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,886
I wouldn't wanna be kept alive
on life support.

285
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,659
Not if there was no hope
for a recovery.

286
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,258
There wouldn't be.

287
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,024
As your heart failure worsens,

288
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,162
you may get short of breath
from fluid build-up.

289
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,730
We can use diuretics
and vasodilators to help control that.

290
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,534
- I recommend both of those.
- Of course, yes.

291
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,169
If that doesn't help,

292
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,973
we could insert a catheter
in your chest to drain the fluid.

293
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,746
The procedure does risk
a lung puncture,

294
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,878
which would worsen
your symptoms.

295
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,583
You should give us every option
to keep your breathing easy.

296
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,626
And we'll be on call all night to make sure
you're as comfortable as possible.

297
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,589
Thank you.

298
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,734
I went through this with my mom
when she was dying of leukemia.

299
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,135
I'm so sorry.

300
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:41,897
Was that recent?

301
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,934
I was 10.

302
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,882
I remember feeling so helpless.

303
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,413
You should reach out to Leo.

304
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,820
It's too late.

305
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,256
I don't believe that.

306
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:08,831
There were, uh, things
between my wife and I...

307
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,432
that I thought we could never
get past.

308
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,297
But last Christmas...

309
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,909
we almost lost our son.

310
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,305
And when I reached out,

311
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,416
Mia was there.

312
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,181
Leo...

313
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,817
always made me feel pressured to
choose between my research and him.

314
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,828
Eventually,
I realized he was right.

315
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,501
So I chose to go where
I was needed the most.

316
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:48,197
To call him now would be
hypocritical and...

317
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,140
unfair.

318
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,448
It took a lot of time
and dedication to push

319
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,488
our understanding of leukemia
as far as you did.

320
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,485
I'm glad I have treatment options
for my patients.

321
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,624
You made a good choice.

322
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,732
Sorry to keep you waiting.

323
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,637
I assume that some of this
is professional,

324
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,302
the other 90 percent
is personal.

325
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,245
- Am I right?
- It's a very difficult case.

326
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,679
We're both just overly invested.

327
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,918
Actually, I'd love for you
to weigh in on this one.

328
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,053
Dr. Lim, are you confident
in this surgical plan?

329
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,386
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

330
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,426
You didn't even look at the case.

331
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,891
- The pulmonary...
- Dr. Lim is my chief of surgery.

332
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,362
I trust her judgment.

333
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm sorry things got out of hand.
It won't happen again.

334
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,736
It better not.

335
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,237
If you two can't control
your interpersonal squabblings,

336
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,899
I'm gonna have to lose one of you,
at least.

337
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,755
We need an endoscopy suite to fetch
the spoon out of this guy's stomach.

338
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:11,987
Cool.

339
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,617
How's the intimacy research
going?

340
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,924
Dr. Elion has had
a very successful life

341
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,555
without a relationship.
So can I.

342
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,299
Success and happiness aren't the same.

343
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,530
You need to decide what will make
you happy in the end.

344
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,164
I don't know
if it's being a great surgeon

345
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,674
or being close to Carly,

346
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,211
but I'm better at surgery
than I am with her.

347
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,279
Dr. Elion is wrong,
you don't have to choose.

348
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,374
I fly to Phoenix to spend time
with Mia and Kellan.

349
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,749
Then you won't be great at either.

350
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,118
I think Dr. Elion is afraid.

351
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,425
I think it was never about the journals
and the lives she could save.

352
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,725
I think she's always been afraid.

353
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,066
Afraid she might lose Leo
just like she lost her mother.

354
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,470
And you,

355
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,932
you lost the person you loved the most
when your brother died.

356
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,942
Your elevated heart rate,
sweaty palms,

357
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,003
they're not about
your sensory issues, Shaun.

358
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,305
It's what we all feel.

359
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,641
Fear.

360
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,418
Why would anyone want
to feel afraid?

361
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,728
Because the thought of
ending up alone is scarier.

362
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,934
I don't think Dr. Elion
refuses to call Leo

363
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,136
because it's hypocritical.

364
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,042
I think she's afraid he won't come.

365
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,240
- Can you handle the spoon?
- Yes.

366
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,876
Okay.

367
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,384
- Morning, Dr. Glassman.
- Morning.

368
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,793
Which shoulder would you like
to hurt for the next 24 hours?

369
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,559
I'm not here for a vaccine.

370
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,527
Okay.

371
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,569
Wrist and thumb joint pain.
I need cortisone shots.

372
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,536
Surgery's in two hours.

373
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,676
Can I ask you something?

374
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,871
If a patient, say a violinist

375
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,880
who concertized three
or four times a week

376
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,881
would have come to you
with achy joints,

377
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,715
would you give them a cortisone shot
or tell them to lay off?

378
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,584
Better question,

379
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,983
if he or she came to you
with achy joints

380
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,153
and pretended they needed
a vaccination,

381
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,821
what would you do then?

382
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,922
It's...

383
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:38,337
It's because I wanted you to know
and no one else.

384
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,115
I saw a rheumatologist last month.

385
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,581
I have rheumatoid arthritis.

386
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,250
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

387
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,332
My mom had it too.

388
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,560
It destroyed her wrist
and finger joints.

389
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,772
Maybe I should leave
Saint Bonaventure.

390
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,642
Berkeley's chief is retiring this year.
I could apply to replace him.

391
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,875
We are entitled to have
differing opinions,

392
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,942
- we can argue...
- Apparently, we can't.

393
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,783
I love you.

394
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,895
I want our relationship to work.

395
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,633
And I wanna be chief.

396
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,877
If we can't find a way to work together
with me as your boss...

397
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,239
something has to change.

398
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,383
Looks like you caught it early,

399
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,746
without any noticeable erosion
of the joints.

400
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,758
That's good.
What's your D-MARD dose?

401
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,660
Twenty milligrams,
but Dr. Baxter just started it.

402
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,633
Okay.

403
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,901
You're gonna have to postpone

404
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,305
your first lead surgery for a while,
see how you respond.

405
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,974
I'd have to explain why
to Andrews and Lim.

406
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,906
As you should. A cortisone shot
is just a temporary fix.

407
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,848
Do you know what the chances are
the D-MARD can maintain

408
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,477
the dexterity you need to perform
an operation in the long run?

409
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,045
Forty-five percent.

410
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,820
- It'll change the way they see me.
- Yeah, you have a condition.

411
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,452
- A medical condition.
- They'll expect less from me.

412
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,862
They'll be looking for me to fail.

413
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,866
That's why I'm confiding in you
instead of them.

414
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,860
You advocated for Shaun

415
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,815
when everybody else thought
he couldn't be a surgeon.

416
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,707
I'm sorry,
you're comparing arthritis to autism?

417
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,074
I'm comparing people's assumptions,
people's prejudices.

418
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,972
I'm asking for a chance
to prove myself.

419
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,853
In this surgery today,
you're gonna have to create a plane

420
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,151
as thin as paper between
two delicate layers of tissue

421
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,823
without disrupting
the major blood flow to the brain.

422
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:22,265
If you miss by one-tenth,
one-tenth of a millimeter,

423
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:26,603
the patient will suffer
permanent brain damage, or worse.

424
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,213
Right now it's a matter of pain,
not function.

425
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:40,619
You think I would put
a patient's life at risk?

426
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,719
That's insulting.

427
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,755
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,187
Without the pain,

429
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,758
I can do this.

430
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,864
You believed in Shaun.

431
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,860
I need someone
to believe in me too.

432
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,036
Okay.

433
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,604
Leo Adan?

434
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:10,910
That's me.

435
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,643
I'm Alex Park.

436
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,653
I'm Rosalind's doctor.

437
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,889
She's dying.

438
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,587
She wants to see you.

439
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,522
Why didn't she call me?
Why'd she send you?

440
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,522
She doesn't know I'm here.

441
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,536
Even when we were married,
I never topped her to-do list.

442
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,739
She wasn't cheating on you,

443
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,468
she wasn't doing anything
except saving lives.

444
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,406
She deserves to be cut
a little slack.

445
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,244
Yeah.

446
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,647
She was saving the whole damn world,
she's a saint.

447
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,048
I made partner, she wasn't there,
everybody understood.

448
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,781
My mother died, she wasn't there,
everybody understood.

449
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:49,981
Well, I didn't.

450
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,190
Look, maybe I was a selfish jerk

451
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,263
for wanting my wife to be around,
but I did.

452
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,094
She didn't send you.

453
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,824
Good for her.

454
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,928
She's not a hypocrite.
That hasn't changed.

455
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,612
Assistant port is secured.

456
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,150
Load the forceps
and electrocautery.

457
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,594
My chief's doing a difficult surgery.

458
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,326
I'm here to help in any way I can.

459
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,504
Instruments are ready.

460
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,251
Time of initial incision, 11:32.

461
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,558
- How is she?
- She's really short of breath.

462
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,398
I gave her vasodilators
and diuretics, but she's not settling.

463
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,237
She has bilateral pulmonary edema.

464
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,904
She needs 40 milligrams
of furosemide.

465
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,675
I'll push two lorazepam too.

466
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:27,413
I can't... catch my breath.

467
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,385
You've got fluid in your chest.

468
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,424
This medication should help ease
your breathing.

469
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,722
She should be improving,
but she's not.

470
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,457
Maybe we should insert a drain.

471
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,929
Shaun, this isn't about the fluid.

472
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,734
She's scared.

473
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:45,930
Rosalind,

474
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,402
I know this is frightening,
but you are not alone.

475
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,670
I'm here
and I am not going anywhere.

476
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,977
As long as you need me.

477
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,923
Leo...

478
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,614
I see the base of the tumor.

479
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,093
There's a lot of bleeding
teasing off the pulmonary vein.

480
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,961
Put a bipolar electrocautery
instrument on the right arm.

481
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,298
It's way more friable than it looks,
the tumor's invaded the vessel wall.

482
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,970
I need to load more
hemostatic matrix.

483
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,039
If I keep going, I'll end up
with a bleed I can't control.

484
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,442
I need to take the lung.

485
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,991
Prep her for an open thoracotomy.

486
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,460
I need a prostatectomy kit.

487
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,697
Now.

488
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,531
Prostate cancers tend to grow along
the surrounding nerves.

489
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,541
Equipment's designed
to dissect the tumor

490
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,042
without injuring the nerves.

491
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,703
Substitute arteries for nerves
and you've got our situation.

492
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:43,852
Load the hot shears.

493
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,555
Unclamp the proximal and distal end.

494
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,588
You have good shunt flow.

495
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:55,733
Loupes.

496
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,871
Forceps and dissector.

497
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,892
Is there a problem, Dr. Reznick?

498
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,959
Nice work, Dr. Reznick.

499
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,617
Did you...

500
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,087
We got it all.

501
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,286
And you'll still need that
flight suit.

502
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,628
Thanks, doc.

503
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,425
He might have helped a little too.

504
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,358
The tumor was more entangled in your

505
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,266
arteries than it appeared,
but Dr. Melendez

506
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,828
pulled off a remarkable win for us.

507
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,338
This is the reason
you still have two complete lungs.

508
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,981
Sign it.

509
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,015
Both of you.

510
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,688
I'm gonna leave it on the moon.

511
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,858
She's very close.

512
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,398
I'll pronounce her.

513
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,340
I'd like to do it.

514
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:31,910
Thank you.

515
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,093
I hope it's not too late.

516
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,330
It's fine. Come in.

517
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,278
You were right.

518
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,942
It was a crazy surgery.

519
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,087
But not as crazy as I thought.

520
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,250
It wouldn't have even happened
if it wasn't for you.

521
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,316
You were right too.

522
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,688
I'm not objective
when it comes to you.

523
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,432
I blew off your concerns
about the risks

524
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,490
because I thought
you'd lost your mojo.

525
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,365
Great. We're both right.

526
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,568
And we found a way
to work together,

527
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,003
and our patient's better off for it.

528
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,975
Today.

529
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,112
What about the next time?

530
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,641
We won't make the same mistakes.

531
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,316
I'm not sure they were mistakes.

532
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:49,520
I think they might have
just been our nature.

533
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,199
I don't think I can give you
the unconditional support

534
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,998
you deserve from a partner...

535
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,332
and the objectivity
you need from a chief.

536
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,137
And...

537
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,406
I don't wanna give up on my dream.

538
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:14,809
I love you...

539
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,015
but it's not enough.

540
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,828
Good night, Neil.

541
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:41,869
Dr. Reznick.

542
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,080
Dr. Glassman.

543
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,543
Thank you for your support.

544
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,510
My pain is 90 percent better
than it was.

545
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,556
The shots helped.

546
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,524
Well, you did a remarkable job.

547
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,701
I'm fine.

548
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,273
Congratulations.

549
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,624
I did extensive further research

550
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,930
on intimacy treatment for autism.

551
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,732
And?

552
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,139
And I found nothing.

553
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,605
You were right.

554
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:51,978
Exposure therapy
is the most effective option.

555
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,745
You're very smart and thorough.

556
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:56,353
Thank you.

557
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,586
I'd like to try again.

558
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,355
It's time to take a break.

559
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,303
I know.

560
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,644
This is terrifying.

561
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,047
And...

562
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,553
very nice.
