1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,071
Someone had a good night.

2
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,008
Do you think all of these people
have had sex?

3
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,016
And if so, shouldn't
they be more happy?

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,576
Maybe their experiences
weren't as recent as yours.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,712
I think about sex with everyone.

6
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:26,157
But mostly with Carly.
She and I are very compatible.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,386
That's great, Shaun,
but HR might not approve.

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,986
About me thinking of sex?

9
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,589
No, about saying
you're thinking about sex.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,534
And stop it.

11
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,662
Smiling while talking to a dying man
is not cool.

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,367
Dr. Blaize recommended we speak
to you about a permanent port.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,568
It would simplify your
chemo sessions.

14
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,373
No more hunting
for a vein every time.

15
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,674
Anything to help with the nausea?

16
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,617
It's a normal side effect.

17
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,681
Anything you can do
for the exhaustion?

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,763
Anything... so that my
muscles don't ache?

19
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,971
But you can keep me
from being stuck by a needle?

20
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,243
- They're trying to help.
- I know.

21
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,904
All the doctors are trying to help.

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,776
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,588
Thank you.

24
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,618
But I don't need the port.

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,727
And I don't need any more chemo.

26
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,600
Of course you do.
It's going to give you more time.

27
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,938
Honey, I'm miserable.

28
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,011
Cerebral cavernous malformations,

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,181
leads to bleeding, clots, seizures,
muscle weakness, even paralysis.

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,792
You have clusters of them.
And they're getting worse.

31
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,987
The woman at Hopkins gave me a year.

32
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,530
Mass General, two years.

33
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,996
So what? Figured I'd give you three?

34
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,601
Some new treatment...

35
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,934
You know the treatment, Caroline.
A lobectomy.

36
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,668
I love the way surgeons
blithely suggest

37
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,676
cutting through my cerebral cortex
to remove part of my brain.

38
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,709
Why not just take an egg slicer
to my ability to paint?

39
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,181
Yes. It will likely lead

40
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,117
to a curtailment
of your ability to be creative,

41
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,315
but all of your other faculties
will remain intact.

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,030
I had a severe prognosis
of my own, recently.

43
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:52,231
Surgery, chemo, radiation, the works.

44
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,172
My greatest fear wasn't

45
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,874
at the edges of the spectrum,
it wasn't life or death.

46
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,346
My greatest fear was survival
as something lesser.

47
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,347
Then you know.

48
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,645
And then I had a revelation of sorts.

49
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,656
Who I am, how I think of myself,
isn't defined by my skill as a surgeon.

50
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,452
I'm seeing you as a courtesy,
I don't do this anymore.

51
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,553
And guess what? I'm fine.

52
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,524
I'm happier.

53
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,526
You could have 20, 30 more years
with your family.

54
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,772
A balanced life isn't necessarily
a lesser life.

55
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:29,901
I disagree.

56
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,586
Twenty bucks says Shaun mentions sex
in front of a patient

57
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,059
- in the next 24 hours.
- He's excited.

58
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,188
I'm sure you were
when a new world opened up,

59
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,266
- but he knows better...
- Twenty bucks.

60
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,095
- No.
- Morgan!

61
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,401
- Oh, I was hoping I'd see you.
- Hello.

62
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,574
Perfect, I was just wondering
where to get lunch around here.

63
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,202
Any genre,
as long as it's locally sourced.

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,114
Is this a friend?
I'm Caroline Reznick.

65
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,549
Oh, hi.

66
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,950
My mother.

67
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,321
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,954
What beautiful eyes!

69
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:26,522
I hope... someone... paints...

70
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,594
Mom! Mom! Mom!

71
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,904
- Mom, can you hear me?
- Code blue. We need a crash cart.

72
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,159
I've come to take you to lunch.

73
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,293
It's only 11:15.

74
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,597
Morgan told me that it might be
considered unprofessional

75
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,667
to discuss sex on the job.

76
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,063
- So when you say "lunch"...
- It's sex.

77
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,365
I am expected to be here working.

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,804
People in the Pathology Lab take two
15-minute breaks on their shift.

79
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,254
If they were combined into one,

80
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:19,014
and we used the bus that stops out front
at 11:25 with one returning at 12:15,

81
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,849
and we borrowed some
of your lunch hour,

82
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,185
you only require 22 minutes
to eat a sandwich,

83
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,454
there would be just enough time
to get to your apartment and back.

84
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,733
Have you noticed the time
you've allotted for lunch

85
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,198
is fairly short?

86
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,464
Long enough.

87
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,974
Long enough for you, not for me.

88
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,244
You've only had sex
once in your life.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,311
No one expects you to win awards,
and it was lovely sharing the moment.

90
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,519
Are you implying
the sex could be improved on?

91
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,627
Yes.

92
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,172
- Does that bother you?
- No.

93
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,169
I have no objection to improving sex.

94
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,703
Although, I thought
it was already excellent.

95
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,943
I'll work on it.

96
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,049
Found the source of the bleed.

97
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,650
Suctioning and
evacuating the clot cavity.

98
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,957
The Cav Mals are everywhere.

99
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,861
She could have a massive bleed
at any time.

100
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,298
I thought Morgan's
parents were doctors.

101
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,179
I heard that too.
Why would Morgan let us think...

102
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,933
Maybe save the speculation

103
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,649
until your hands
aren't in my mother's skull.

104
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,666
Use your inside voice,
Morgan. Turn down the volume.

105
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,737
Irrigate and remove the cottonoid.

106
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,213
Why didn't she tell us she was
one of those Reznicks?

107
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,595
Caroline Reznick, painter.

108
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,633
Her son's a sculptor,
daughter's a composer.

109
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
Didn't know she had another kid.

110
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,761
They're famous,
if you're into the arts at all.

111
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,773
- Mia got you going to galleries?
- Kind of loving it.

112
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,570
I've failed Carly twice.

113
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,603
Did you forget her birthday
or stand her up?

114
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,106
Are you talking about sex?

115
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,916
Oh. Morgan says HR would prefer
I avoid that word.

116
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,625
Just to be clear,
are you saying she...

117
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,122
- Are you saying she didn't...
- There was no parade.

118
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,762
Oh.

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,106
There was a parade for me,

120
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,646
but there was no parade for Carly.
I want to give her a parade.

121
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,186
I'll continue reading.

122
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,283
Wait, Shaun, reading's a great start,
but Carly's a person.

123
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,261
You need to communicate with her,
ask her what she likes.

124
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,322
Yes. I'll make an extensive list
of questions.

125
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,834
It's not just about
questions and answers.

126
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,393
Non-verbal communication
is pretty key in this area.

127
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,496
I'm not good
with non-verbal communication.

128
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,372
Watch her reactions,
see what Carly responds to.

129
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,842
You'll figure this out.

130
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,578
Mrs. Reznick, I'm Dr. Park. Dr. Murphy,
Dr. Browne. How are you feeling?

131
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,686
Excellent,

132
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,224
and flattered that three surgeons
are here to check on me.

133
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,324
They're curious.

134
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,391
About what monster created me.

135
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,393
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

136
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:54,867
Morgan, you're smart and nice
and perfectly normal.

137
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,071
I don't think she's
all of those things.

138
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,170
You guys here to take her vitals,
check her for any deficits,

139
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,402
and maybe let her know

140
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,673
that she's just going
to keep getting worse and die?

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,425
Your daughter's right, Mrs. Reznick,
if you don't...

142
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:13,750
Dr. Browne, the daylilies go so well
with your eyes, please take them.

143
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,453
This variety is from the Himalayas.

144
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,891
Um, heh.

145
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,958
Please.

146
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,423
I really am grateful to you all.

147
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,537
I'm asking other people
to take over my cases.

148
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,134
Check your inbox and you'll see
the three I've given you.

149
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,842
In your language, the word "ask"
must mean something different.

150
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,116
You're a caring, empathetic person
and my mother is sick.

151
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,283
As long as we're having
a moment of honesty...

152
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,259
why do you hate your family?

153
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,495
You told me your mother
was a cardiologist.

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,729
No, you told me
my mother was a cardiologist.

155
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,995
I can't correct all your mistakes.

156
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,602
Was that the mother
you wanted to have?

157
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,472
I used to daydream
my mother was a lawyer.

158
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,916
That's just weird.

159
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,623
I'm Oliver.

160
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,421
I have a malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor,

161
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,088
so I've only got six months to live.

162
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,125
I'm Dr. Melendez.

163
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,501
- What happened to your foot?
- Skydiving. Heh-heh-heh.

164
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,661
First time.

165
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,595
They coached me how to roll,
but it didn't quite work out.

166
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,498
- He rented a plane.
- A small one.

167
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,173
All the classes were full,
I did not want to wait.

168
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,414
- You should have come with me.
- I'm afraid of heights.

169
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,310
So was I. Not anymore!

170
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,715
- Ha-ha.
- Hmm.

171
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,946
Nothing's broken.

172
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,653
Ice it tonight, try to stay off it
for a few days.

173
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,717
Give you 12 hours.

174
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,986
Lots to do, so I might be okay
with limping.

175
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,364
As long as I'm here, can I get
vaccinated for tropical diseases?

176
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,234
Thinking about moving somewhere

177
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,294
the weather will be perfect
the next six months.

178
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,138
The dry season in Costa Rica
is just beginning.

179
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,142
Excellent. I've always wanted
to see Costa Rica.

180
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,511
They have mantled howler monkeys

181
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,378
that make this haunting call at dawn
and dusk.

182
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,180
Wouldn't that be great to wake up to?

183
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,453
Oliver,
skydiving doesn't bring happiness.

184
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,753
Neither do monkey howls.

185
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,590
You're gonna tell a dying guy
he can't do what he wants to?

186
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,503
No.

187
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,574
Get me the shots.

188
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,184
What happened to the patient
who was in here?

189
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,084
She checked herself out.

190
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,363
I knew I had to be in early,
so I tried not to wake you.

191
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,567
Appreciate it.

192
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,130
I've brought you a jelly doughnut
and coffee.

193
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,730
- Thank you.
- To celebrate last night's breakthrough.

194
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,702
What breakthrough was that?

195
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,310
Last night...

196
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,607
You had a parade.

197
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:36,715
During lunch, you made a lot of noise.

198
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,384
One fairly loud noise, a moan.

199
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,722
Oh.

200
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,957
Right, right.

201
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,557
You had your elbow on my hair.

202
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,273
I had a great time last night,

203
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,402
and I really appreciate how much
effort you put into my happiness.

204
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,673
- But no parade.
- Parades aren't always required.

205
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,978
I'll keep working on it.

206
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,186
Cassie, stay in Hong Kong.

207
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,960
It would be ridiculous to miss
the premiere of your symphony

208
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,296
because of a medical glitch.
I have to go, your sister's here. Bye.

209
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,999
You're in time for brunch.

210
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,634
I didn't know where
you were staying.

211
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,265
If you'd left town,
if you'd gone home.

212
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:32,138
I got your new housekeeper on the phone
and convinced her I was your daughter.

213
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,806
- She said you'd never mentioned me.
- Blanca's very forgetful.

214
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,009
Pull up a chair.
Your brother's out getting salmon.

215
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,879
- Ariel's here?
- He got great news.

216
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,615
Million-dollar commission,
a bronze piece on the mall.

217
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,158
I'm thrilled. Can we talk about
the fact that you're dying?

218
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,224
No.

219
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:50,324
I'm having a good arthritis day,
why shouldn't I feel happy?

220
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,627
You're lucky you didn't inherit
anything from me.

221
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,394
Morgan.

222
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,968
I thought Mom ditched
the medical police.

223
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,666
Right, the bad guys trying
to keep her alive.

224
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,406
We've tried to change her mind,
but you know what she's like.

225
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,005
I'm using a little sriracha. Just to
throttle your taste buds. Thank you.

226
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,313
I've been strategizing with Cassie
via e-mail,

227
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,688
trying to figure out a way
to convince Mom...

228
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:19,749
Did it occur to either of you to mention
this to the only doctor in the family?

229
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,657
Plenty of doctors already involved,

230
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,691
and you barely consider yourself
part of this family.

231
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,693
You exclude me, and it's my fault?

232
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:30,760
Morgan, in high school, kids kept
asking about my parents, the spies.

233
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,265
And my friend, Joel, at Georgetown,

234
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,842
said you told people your parents
were in the Peace Corps.

235
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,877
And that you were an only child.

236
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,539
I got tired of fielding questions
about my famous mother.

237
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,581
- It doesn't mean...
- Only child.

238
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,642
You're offended that you weren't
in the family I completely made up?

239
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,218
I got tired of hearing,
"Your mother is so talented,

240
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,921
how wonderful
your brother's an artist,

241
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,226
how amazing Cassie writes music,
what do you do?"

242
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,068
Mom! Grab the towel.

243
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,539
It's not just about
what you do physically,

244
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,069
it's about setting a scene,
offering inspiration.

245
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,247
Do you know what movies she likes
or what actors she thinks are sexy?

246
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,986
She likes the <i>Alien</i> movies.

247
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,552
Something else?

248
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,126
She loves <i>Outlander.</i>

249
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,391
- That is a good idea.
- Where the hell is everybody?

250
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,813
Complex partial seizure,
cut her finger with an electric knife.

251
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,773
Knuckle's still there but we need
to get her to an OR.

252
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,406
Whoa!
No one touches that but the surgeon.

253
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,278
Bloody towels get thrown out all the time.

254
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,714
I'm not dumpster diving
while cells die.

255
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,021
The last of the circumferential sutures.

256
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,660
Good capillary refill in the fingertip.

257
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:10,461
What if this wasn't caused
by the Cav Mals?

258
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,741
First the bleeding, then the seizure,
pretty typical progression.

259
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,245
It's also possible
the bleeding caused the seizure.

260
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,114
Microbleeds can cause gliosis
and that can cause a seizure.

261
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,153
And if the seizure
was caused by gliosis,

262
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,620
we could simply remove
that one bit of damaged tissue.

263
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,559
- She'd still be terminal but...
- Shaun is right, but he's wrong.

264
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,684
Volume!

265
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,861
Shaun's idea could stop the seizures

266
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,027
and let her keep painting
for the time she has left.

267
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,804
That's something she'll agree to,
which is why he's wrong.

268
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,336
If she stops having the seizures,

269
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,971
there's no way she'll have the
lobectomy that will save her.

270
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,039
We don't choose procedures
to manipulate patients.

271
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,278
No, we choose procedures based on
what will have the greatest benefit.

272
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,417
Dr. Melendez, I'd like
to excuse myself

273
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,289
- to speak with the patient's daughter.
- Please.

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,801
I know not disclosing a treatment
is borderline unethical,

275
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,064
but when there is a cure
the patient is ignoring...

276
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,935
- You don't want her to die.
- Thanks for the summation.

277
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,202
But have you considered
it might be more than that?

278
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,743
This cure, it doesn't come
without a cost to your mother,

279
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,907
but to you...

280
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:37,022
If your mother loses her artistic
ability, your relationship changes.

281
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,085
If she loses the thing
she lords over you, she'd...

282
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,763
Maybe she'd be nicer.

283
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,427
You hate the way she looks at you.

284
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,373
But that is who she is.

285
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,848
Let's try it Shaun's way.

286
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,502
Sorry about this all-nighter,

287
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,869
but sleeplessness will increase
the odds of a seizure.

288
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,170
Which isn't pleasant, but we need it.

289
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,006
All this equipment will tell us
if it was caused by the Cav Mals

290
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,477
or by a remote microbleed.

291
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,510
You want me to put on the TV?
I can find something suitably irritating.

292
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,645
Don't bother, I'll be staying.

293
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,622
"Cavernous malformations
may leak blood,

294
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,467
leading to
brain hemorrhage, seizures,

295
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,470
loss of sensation,
risk of paralysis..."

296
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,133
If you have to do this, can't you find
some Harry Potter or something?

297
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,803
We can look forward.

298
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,972
Or we can look back.

299
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,480
Do you want to discuss
what a lousy mother you were?

300
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:14,280
Baby, I know that stress and anger
can increase the chance of a seizure,

301
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,050
- and you're so sweet to try...
- Shall we go chronologically?

302
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,489
First day of pre-school,
when you promised to pick me up,

303
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,721
but you forgot because you
were showing Ariel

304
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,296
how to under-paint with raw umber.

305
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,667
You wore a kilt? How did it go?

306
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,933
We binge-watched six episodes
of <i>Outlander,</i>

307
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,842
and she fell asleep on the sofa.
So I came back to work.

308
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,005
Hi, I'm Oliver,
I have six months to live.

309
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,642
- Hello, Dr. Murphy.
- I'm Dr. Park.

310
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,887
- I went out...
- In a new Ferrari.

311
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:55,488
But when I got home,
I started to feel dizzy,

312
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,222
sick to my stomach,

313
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,188
fainted and hit my head.

314
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,459
I might've been poisoned
by the fugu fish.

315
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,600
You ate a fish
you knew might kill you.

316
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,367
You're emptying the bank accounts.

317
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,966
Only my retirement savings,
which I'm not going to need.

318
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,243
You don't have fugu poisoning.

319
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,076
I know because you're not
already paralyzed or dead.

320
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,911
Ow.

321
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,856
We'll keep you for observation
and run some tests.

322
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:27,992
How long?

323
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,858
- We have a room booked in Costa Rica.
- Enough.

324
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,532
I can't quit my job
and move to the jungle.

325
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,798
Actually, you can.

326
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,765
I won't stay here.

327
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,010
You're gonna leave me?

328
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,574
I've invited you to come with me.

329
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,411
I want us to see Costa Rica together.

330
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,281
You're choosing howler
monkeys over me?

331
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,116
That's where I rank,
behind the monkeys?

332
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,781
Bella, I love you.

333
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,226
I've loved our 20 years together.

334
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,120
I want to see Costa Rica.

335
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,163
I want you to come with me.

336
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,803
But I'm going either way.

337
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:19,837
Go.

338
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,976
I don't want to spend
whatever time is left with...

339
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,851
whoever you are now.

340
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,456
I'm happy.

341
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,921
I thought I made you happy.

342
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,475
Jumping ahead. The day I won
the regional science fair,

343
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,379
beating five other schools, including
those nerds from Alston Prep.

344
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,184
Do you know what you said to me?

345
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,186
That you were so glad
I had something to fall back on.

346
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm aware of your feelings about me
as a mother.

347
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,624
I'm aware that
our values are different.

348
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,725
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

349
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,334
I always have.

350
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,638
It didn't matter
that you weren't creative.

351
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,142
You seriously don't think
there's creativity in what I do?

352
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,220
I think that's something
technical people tell themselves.

353
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,622
But it's not a moral judgment,

354
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,156
it's the luck of the draw.

355
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:47,559
I'm an artist, you're a...
hard worker.

356
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,629
August 12th, 2014.

357
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,199
<i>- Times</i> art section...
- I don't want to hear it.

358
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,244
"Caroline Reznick's
showing at the Armory

359
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,246
is a lesson in what happens
when a once-interesting artist

360
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,511
- sits too long on her laurels."
- That woman hated me for years.

361
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,415
She was waiting for an opportunity...

362
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,885
"Bad judgment doesn't begin
to explain what went wrong

363
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,549
with every stroke
of this ill-conceived..."

364
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:15,253
I mean, really, how many negative
words can you pile together?

365
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,562
And she hasn't even gotten to that
part about that Modern Madonna piece

366
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,599
that you were so proud of.

367
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,361
Remember what she called it?

368
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,369
Put that thing down!

369
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,897
I'm sorry. It's not gliosis.

370
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,795
I went through that for nothing?

371
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,930
Mom, we eliminated a possibility,
that's not nothing.

372
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:07,571
It's a day I spent in this hospital
when I could've been home, working.

373
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,612
How soon can I be discharged?

374
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,414
You need to rest for a day.

375
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,217
And then we can say goodbye.

376
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,468
If I only had six months to live,
I would not stop being a surgeon.

377
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,184
I would. I'd move from spa to spa,

378
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,618
having massages and drinks
with little umbrellas.

379
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,681
Then I'd throw a party in the penthouse
of the Four Seasons.

380
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,553
And after everybody left,

381
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,688
I'd go into the marble bathroom
and painlessly self-euthanize.

382
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,632
But, obviously, I'd leave a big tip
for housekeeping.

383
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,063
You're very like your mother.

384
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,569
- That's not something I hear a lot.
- Well, he's right.

385
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,905
You would reign like a queen
over your own death,

386
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,844
insisting on absolute control.

387
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,075
I just meant you each have a funny way

388
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,485
of picking things up
with both hands sometimes.

389
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,785
I don't think
this is anatomically correct.

390
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,862
Hmm.

391
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,310
Hmm.

392
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,373
Stereotactic laser ablation.

393
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,995
You worked with one of the people
who developed the technique.

394
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,421
We never used to call it that.
I never liked that name.

395
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,925
Also, it's never been used
in cerebral cavernous malformations.

396
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,085
Not yet.

397
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,590
It would allow us
to target the malformations,

398
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,063
without needing to slice
all those cerebral fibers

399
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,896
or remove a chunk
of my mother's brain.

400
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,697
It would have to be applied

401
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,238
to each malformation
with exact precision.

402
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,273
- Okay, so do that.
- You can't.

403
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,340
You're gonna make
a mistake on one or two.

404
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,379
Then you got more bleeding, seizures,

405
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:24,042
you got inflamed malformations
growing out of control...

406
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,243
You can.

407
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:32,052
Even if I was still a neurosurgeon,
which I'm not, I wouldn't.

408
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,423
You don't get to quit who you are.

409
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,423
How long has it been
since you had your hands

410
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:42,457
inside the source
of what makes us human?

411
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,767
That flow, in surgery,
knowing every move

412
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:50,673
and just feeling how right it is,
that's peak existence.

413
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,415
Sorry, I'm not gonna do the surgery.

414
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,695
Are you... Are you scared
to pick up a scalpel?

415
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,196
You had months of chemo
and radiation, maybe it took its toll.

416
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:21,040
Even a 10 percent drop in performance
would be unbearable.

417
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,041
Why risk finding it out?

418
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,437
Get out.

419
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,361
Skydiving? Fugu?

420
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,499
And apparently, a yellow suit.

421
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,928
Do you think a deadline like he has
burns you down to who you really are?

422
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:54,565
Or does it just make you nuts
and desperate?

423
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,166
Why can't it be both?

424
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,242
Hmm.

425
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:04,174
Okay. Um, a little house
in the middle of nowhere.

426
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,148
Two chickens, one dog.

427
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:10,681
Nobody who expects anything from me.
Nobody who's even verbal.

428
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,651
Okay, I'm tired of trying to fix myself.

429
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,354
And I'm tired of being known
as a soft touch.

430
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,462
Not buying it.

431
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,902
There is no way you would get a dog
if you only had six months to live.

432
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,026
It wouldn't be fair.

433
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:30,539
Okay, then, I would foster
a series of rescue dogs.

434
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,103
You're tired of being a soft touch,

435
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,408
and yet your fantasy
involves helping.

436
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,710
We are who we are.

437
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,516
It's called stereotactic laser ablation.

438
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,548
Never liked the name.

439
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,531
He said it's minimally invasive
and if it works, it would save my life

440
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,433
and allow me to continue painting.

441
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,303
If I win, I win everything.

442
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,933
And if I lose, it's over.

443
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,140
When you first came to see
Dr. Glassman,

444
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,738
he didn't offer this option. Why not?

445
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,578
Stereotactic laser ablation
is a new technique,

446
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,679
and it's never been used
on a Cav Mal patient.

447
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,289
So he just didn't think of it,
but then it came to him?

448
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,455
It was my idea.

449
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,336
Well, Dr. Glassman
didn't sugarcoat the risks.

450
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,770
This is the last chance
you've got to keep your art.

451
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,810
I'm not going to complete my work
if I'm dead.

452
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,607
No.

453
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,675
But thank you so much for trying.

454
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,793
Why didn't you back me up?

455
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,231
I didn't know you were going to throw
this crapshoot at us.

456
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,303
Do you even listen
to what she's been saying?

457
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,099
She wants to finish her work.

458
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,539
She could live another 40 years
and her art would grow with her.

459
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,735
Don't pretend those words mean
anything to you.

460
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,210
You don't give a damn about art.

461
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,246
Her family could grow with her,
her children, her grandchildren.

462
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,675
You and her don't give a damn
about anything except for art.

463
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,050
You need to listen to me
and do what I tell you.

464
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,119
This is why we didn't call you.

465
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,273
Well, the competition in that family
must have been like a buzz saw.

466
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,375
Please.

467
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,288
It's perfectly reasonable to get out
of a game you can't win.

468
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,747
You did everything right.

469
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,259
Moved 3000 miles,
found your own calling,

470
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,522
a career people respect and value.

471
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,565
Actually, there's a good
comparative measure

472
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,929
for how people value things,
we call it money.

473
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,268
And my brother's already a million ahead.

474
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,237
See how you went straight
to your brother?

475
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,167
Did you ever think he might be tired
of being your competitor?

476
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,676
He won a long time ago.

477
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,346
That's why I left that
dysfunction behind.

478
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:54,907
Really?

479
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,050
Because it seems to me you re-created
the competition you grew up with

480
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,778
the very first day you got here.

481
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,385
Shingles? Like from chicken pox?

482
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,226
The virus was dormant,

483
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,595
then your chemo suppressed your
immune system and the virus woke up.

484
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,124
It can be painful,
but the treatment is very simple.

485
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,096
Want us to call your wife?

486
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,935
No, thank you.

487
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,206
Just fix me up
and release me into the wild.

488
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,647
Back to the bucket list.

489
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,517
She was right.

490
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,979
I'm not the same person.

491
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,489
I'm doing what we all should be doing.

492
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,250
We all want to cut loose,
but we're just too practical.

493
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,160
If this had not happened,

494
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:49,132
I might have lived to be 90,
never looking up.

495
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,229
Dr. Murphy, what do you want to do

496
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,297
that you haven't done yet?
What makes you happy?

497
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,808
- I want to give Carly...
- Shaun.

498
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,037
Oh.

499
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,478
I like a crisp apple.

500
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:10,383
The way the sunlight
hits my bedsheets in the morning

501
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,956
in a perfect square.

502
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,890
I like the movement of wind in leaves.

503
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:18,329
And the way
the circumference of a circle

504
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,457
is always equal to
pi times the diameter,

505
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,163
no matter what numbers you put in.

506
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,466
You like the happiness
of small things.

507
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,201
Yes. Your happiness is too loud.

508
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,415
Shake your head again.

509
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,684
Didn't he have a muscle issue?
His range of motion seems good.

510
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,319
All the better for zip-lining
in Costa Rica, right?

511
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,358
Not right.

512
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,668
We need more tests.

513
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,679
I'm sorry.

514
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,380
I know we want the same things.

515
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,621
I'd like to show you something.

516
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,259
Neurons that fire together
wire together.

517
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,397
One neuron goes off,
exciting the next,

518
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,870
creating a pathway in the brain
that wasn't there before.

519
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,100
Every time Mom takes a brushstroke,
every time you use a chisel,

520
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,702
it's like we're creating ourselves
in the choices we make.

521
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,715
We're creating this.

522
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,076
It's beautiful.

523
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,716
We target each malformation
with a thermal laser probe.

524
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,387
Just the malformation.

525
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,362
The trajectory has to be perfect.

526
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,158
You can't paint over it.

527
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,933
You could show this to Mom.

528
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,137
But from you, she'll accept it.

529
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,587
Inserting the laser probe
into the cooling catheter.

530
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,497
Locked and loaded, ready to fire.

531
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,199
Dr. Glassman, are you sure
of this location?

532
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:45,300
It seems significantly far from
what we saw on her pre-surgical MRIs.

533
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:50,279
You know what the brain
and breakfast cereal have in common?

534
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,715
Contents tend to shift during transport.

535
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,212
Yes, I'm quite sure.

536
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,865
First ablation complete.

537
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:23,145
Now we just have to do it perfectly
nine more times.

538
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,721
- It's gone?
- Well, not quite, but close.

539
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,023
The infections got into the tumor...

540
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,327
Which allowed your immune system
to find it.

541
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,492
But they said it was
an aggressive cancer.

542
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,836
What makes a cancer aggressive
is its ability to evade the immune system.

543
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,500
That's no longer true about yours.

544
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,217
The tumor has become small enough
to remove surgically.

545
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:08,986
We can make an appointment
to do that in a few days,

546
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,292
once the infection has fully cleared
your system. Meanwhile,

547
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,996
you can go home.

548
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,730
Congratulations.

549
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:21,505
Home?

550
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,738
How do you feel?

551
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,777
Tired of being in this place.

552
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,952
Reasonable answer.
Do you feel your creativity is impaired?

553
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,556
Isn't that the graphic you use
to sign your paintings?

554
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,892
Thank you for knowing that.

555
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,792
Ariel was afraid
you'd feel vandalized.

556
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,036
Don't be silly.

557
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,800
We'll auction off the door.

558
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,416
Mom, you've thanked your doctors,
but you haven't said anything to Morgan.

559
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,688
Getting out of this mess intact,
that's down to her.

560
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,789
Oh, yes, I know.

561
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,185
I owe you everything.

562
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,166
Thank you for saving my life.

563
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,575
You're welcome.

564
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,479
Our little plodder came through.

565
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:57,235
Not everybody gets a parade.
Maybe Carly doesn't have them.

566
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,964
Maybe I haven't practiced enough.

567
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,370
I've worked on my surgical technique
for hundreds of hours.

568
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,968
You can't just take the pizza
out of the freezer and dig in.

569
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,045
You have to put it
in the microwave first.

570
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:18,021
Actually, Dr. Lim, a toaster oven
is better for the crust.

571
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,689
She's not talking about pizza, Shaun.

572
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,665
Men your age run out of patience.

573
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:30,395
They turn off the microwave
before that pizza's ready.

574
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,208
- You want to give a parade, Shaun?
- Yes.

575
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,178
- You want to give a great parade?
- Are there differences in parades?

576
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,417
Some have balloons
and marching bands.

577
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,751
Other parades are sparsely attended.

578
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,788
I want Carly to have
the best parade possible.

579
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,286
I know you do.

580
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,863
Just as you want
to be the best surgeon possible.

581
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,300
When you're in the OR,
you commit totally.

582
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,099
You persevere.
Everything else falls away,

583
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,731
you focus entirely
on what you're doing.

584
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,801
That's your superpower.

585
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,949
Now, I want you to take Carly home
and work that parade route,

586
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,781
and don't stop
until the band begins playing.

587
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,959
And then go three percent longer.

588
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,464
I will.

589
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,407
See you tomorrow.

590
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,576
All that focus...

591
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,713
It's strangely intriguing.

592
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,735
If I only had six months to live,

593
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:15,498
I wouldn't want to be anywhere
but where I am.
