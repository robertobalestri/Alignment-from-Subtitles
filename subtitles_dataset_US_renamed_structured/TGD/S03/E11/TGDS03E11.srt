<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,773
Can we just hold each other
for a little bit?

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:13,011
Deal with your crap
before this is who you really become.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,042
I am sorry for making you meet me
after hours like this.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,382
I'm always available for my patients.
Come on in.

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,922
Your dad's been diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:28,291
You're not like other people.
You're like a spoiled little baby.

8
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,378
Shaun? You okay?

9
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,253
We have to be at the airport
at 7 a.m.

10
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,850
When you're taking
the first flight out of Casper,

11
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,556
you don't need to be
90 minutes early.

12
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,688
Mm.

13
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,033
Or maybe you do.

14
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,537
You wanna talk about last night?

15
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,875
I think we should.

16
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,114
Why?

17
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,378
Because you were in
a pretty bad place,

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,456
- which is totally understand...
- I feel better now, thank you.

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,631
I'm glad I could help you.

20
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,231
But I also think
we shouldn't tell anyone

21
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,433
I stayed here.
People might get the wrong idea.

22
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,642
Okay.

23
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,496
We slept together.

24
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,812
Did you use protection?

25
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,480
No, we did not...

26
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,351
have sex. We just slept...

27
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,321
together.

28
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,820
Held each other.
I was upset and Lea comforted me.

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,829
Lying...

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,695
in bed with her, it felt...

31
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,966
different than it does with Carly.

32
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,307
Well, maybe that's why
you invited Lea

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,576
instead of Carly in the first place.

34
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,147
Mm.

35
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,980
- Lea and I are just friends.
- Yeah, she's made that very clear.

36
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,054
Sometimes you learn
more about someone

37
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,589
by what they do than what they say.

38
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:14,390
Because who knows what she wants?
But more importantly, what do you want?

39
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,221
I don't know.

40
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,493
Well, you better figure it out soon.

41
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,671
Sex or no sex,

42
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,868
the wheels are in motion and...

43
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,000
someone's about to get run over.

44
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,080
They had Mallomars. Let's roll.

45
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,368
Shaun, you're back already?

46
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,871
Why wouldn't I be?
I like being here.

47
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,142
Shaun.

48
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,874
I'm really sorry
to hear about your father.

49
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,917
- How are you doing?
- He died.

50
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,714
And the seat was very uncomfortable
on the flight, so I couldn't sleep.

51
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,724
And they only had the salty peanuts,
and not the pretzels I like.

52
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,819
Yeah, life sucks.

53
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,626
We need a doctor!

54
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,899
We were mountain biking and she fell
down a rocky slide. Her leg...

55
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,143
We'll need an X-ray and an MRI.

56
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,246
Let's also get you something stronger
than this ice pack for the pain.

57
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,408
No. They gave me Vicodin
when I had my wisdom teeth pulled,

58
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,550
I was sick two days.

59
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,548
- We have other painkillers.
- Really, I'm fine.

60
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,116
Look, I made it through childbirth
without drugs,

61
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,592
- I can make it through this.
- That hurts less than childbirth?

62
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,962
Tender and bloated.

63
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,560
We should get you admitted,
get an X-ray.

64
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,698
That's all right.
All I need are laxatives.

65
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,106
Intestinal blockage could be fatal
if we don't treat it.

66
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,846
Please, I'm unemployed
and I don't have insurance.

67
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:22,987
How about this?
We skip the X-ray, give you the meds,

68
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,888
but in exchange,
you agree to stay here

69
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,518
till you've had a bowel movement,
and we have peace of mind.

70
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,464
Deal.

71
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,339
Shaun, you're back.

72
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,872
Hello, Carly. It's good to see you.
I missed you.

73
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,242
Morgan and I have a patient
with a comminuted leg fracture.

74
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,172
We need a rush on a CBC
and coagulation panel.

75
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,179
Shaun, I'm sorry about your dad.

76
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,484
Why didn't you return
my calls or texts?

77
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,057
I was... very busy.

78
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,027
You had time to text me.

79
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,025
I wasn't sure what to say.

80
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,199
Shaun, I know you don't always
understand people's feelings...

81
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,541
but a part of you had to understand
ignoring me would be hurtful.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,178
I'm not sure what to say now.

83
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,921
My patient is getting an MRI.
I need to get back to them.

84
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,358
Are you going to take the samples?

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,773
Hey.

86
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,616
PTSD?

87
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,247
It's an interesting topic.

88
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,188
Organizing notes
for a potential case report.

89
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,725
Nice. Look forward to reading it.

90
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,559
I started seeing a therapist.

91
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Good.

92
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,765
- I hope you find it helpful.
- Mm.

93
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:24,970
She thinks I, uh... I might have PTSD.
Sounds a bit excessive.

94
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,471
You've definitely dealt
with some childhood trauma.

95
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,416
You think she's right?

96
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,920
I think doctors make
the worst patients.

97
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,147
Hmm.

98
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,122
The best patients are the ones
who ask a lot of questions,

99
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,589
and keep an open mind.

100
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,917
We gave him laxatives,
and right away tried to leave.

101
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,449
Ended up passing
out and vomiting.

102
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,307
I'm fine, I can take
care of this at home.

103
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,312
Okay, we need to get him to Radiology.
We need an abdominal CT, stat.

104
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,008
No, you can't keep me against my will.

105
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,879
Wherever you need to be, it can wait.

106
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,904
- You need help now.
- What are you transporting?

107
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,121
Painful constipation,
nervous agitation, refusing scans.

108
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,556
You're obviously packing drugs.

109
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,689
The balloons have either created
a complete obstruction,

110
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,126
or one of them burst.

111
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,025
Please, I just wanna go home.

112
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,334
- Luca, we're doctors, not cops.
- He definitely sounds like a cop.

113
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,838
We won't call the police, I promise.
Whatever is wrong, let us help you.

114
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,015
How's Carly?

115
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,646
She wasn't upset about you ghosting her

116
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,086
- while you were with Lea in Wyoming?
- She said it was hurtful.

117
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,081
You got off easy.
Is this your weird way

118
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,831
of breaking up with Carly
to get with Lea?

119
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,160
- I don't want to break up with Carly.
- But you do wanna get with Lea.

120
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,825
- I didn't say that.
- Not out loud.

121
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,496
And you're making a big mistake.
Carly's smart, pretty,

122
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,665
and the fact she's willing
to deal with your stuff

123
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,801
means you should thank whatever God
you pray to that you ever met her.

124
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,241
While Lea is, well, a flake.

125
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,182
She's not a flake.

126
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:16,322
She showed up on your doorstep without
even a heads-up she was coming back.

127
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,349
Then she needed to move out,
but then she moves in.

128
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,428
Not to mention the
"Let's get drunk on tequila

129
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,464
and teach you how to kiss,
but I just wanna be friends" nonsense.

130
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,433
She's...

131
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,332
not a flake.

132
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,236
There is traumatic avulsion
of the ligaments.

133
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,874
She's going to need surgery.

134
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,414
We hammer a long rod
through the medullary canal

135
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,682
to hold the two ends of the break
together.

136
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,654
It's a broken leg.

137
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,954
Can't you just put a cast on it
or something?

138
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,961
You'll be asleep. You won't feel anything.

139
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,159
I lied...

140
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,228
about the Vicodin making me sick.

141
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,267
My husband doesn't know.

142
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,673
I'm an opioid addict.

143
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,907
I've been clean for 10 years,

144
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,811
but one dose could send me
right back.

145
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,281
Do whatever you need to do
to fix my leg,

146
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,443
but you can't use any narcotics.

147
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,691
Not even an epidural?

148
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,823
Strongest thing
she'll let us give her is Tylenol.

149
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,094
Ketamine. What about ketamine?

150
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,134
It's non-narcotic
and can create a dissociative effect.

151
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,503
It's mind-altering
and potentially addictive.

152
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,267
Hypnosis has been shown to be effective.

153
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,473
Only when used in conjunction
with narcotics.

154
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,709
Studies say playing
the patient's favorite music

155
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,115
can help manage pain
in certain surgeries.

156
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,814
Yeah. We hammer
a nine-inch rod through her tibia,

157
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,720
but she's listening
to the soundtrack from <i>Hamilton.</i>

158
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:02,728
- I said, "certain surgeries."
- Okay. That's the answer.

159
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,822
- Music?
- A different surgery.

160
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,165
Some other way
of putting her leg back together.

161
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,699
An external fixation?

162
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,532
We put two pins
through the proximal tibia.

163
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,121
Another two in the distal end
of the bone beyond the fractures.

164
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,738
Healing will take much longer,

165
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,679
and there's an increased
risk of infection

166
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,048
- and permanent deformity and...
- And small pins

167
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,211
are less painful than a huge nail.

168
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,848
I'll get her prepped.

169
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,730
I got laid off.

170
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,532
I needed money

171
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,768
and this was just a one-time thing,

172
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,106
but it was a mistake.
A stupid mistake.

173
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,081
This works best if you don't talk.

174
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,215
Our plan is to attach a metal frame
with pins into your leg.

175
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,054
It'll stabilize the fractures

176
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,594
and we can do it
without narcotic anaesthesia.

177
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,392
I know she's worried
about an allergic reaction,

178
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,057
but aren't there any other drugs
you can use?

179
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,542
Given your wife's medical history,
this is the best strategy.

180
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,511
Don't worry, sweetie.

181
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,907
Remember,
I'm strong like Wonder Woman.

182
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,016
Right?

183
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,914
There's over 50 balloons
lodged near the ileocecal junction.

184
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,927
They'll need to be surgically removed,
and we need to alert Vice-Narcotics.

185
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,155
No. The only reason
he agreed to treatment

186
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,774
is because we promised
we wouldn't do that.

187
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,790
I didn't promise that.
Neither did Dr. Melendez.

188
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,132
We don't call the police
on overdose victims or addicts.

189
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,036
He's got probably two kilos
of what I'm sure is heroin

190
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,804
in his gut.
He's not an addict, he's a dealer.

191
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,980
I know you feel for this guy,
but hospital policy is clear.

192
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,657
Take a few more deep breaths for us.

193
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,621
Just two more to go.

194
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,988
Kerry, we need you to keep your leg still.

195
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,466
- BP is 190 over 110.
- Push IV beta blockers.

196
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,133
- Wait, no!
- No, they're not narcotics.

197
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,143
We need to reduce the pressure.

198
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,269
Oh, my God.

199
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,650
Back to 150 over 80.

200
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,076
- Kerry, how are we doing?
- Better.

201
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,282
We'll get this last one in
and you'll be good to go.

202
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,191
No, you promised me.

203
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,992
Yeah, you value honesty
and morality over all else.

204
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,795
If you leave this hospital now,
you will die.

205
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,699
I'll take my chances.

206
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,466
Do you know what'll happen
when one of those balloons bursts?

207
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,698
You'll start feeling weak, get cold.

208
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,144
Soon you'll have secretions
filling your lungs and airway.

209
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,181
You'll try to scream for help,
but nothing'll come out.

210
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,614
Can you get the release paperwork?

211
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,151
I'll be back in a few minutes.

212
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,856
Luca, I understand
where you're coming from.

213
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,766
You're a doctor.
Last job I had, I was a busboy.

214
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,179
I grew up in a trailer.
A bunch of them, actually.

215
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,375
My mother wasn't the type
to save for a rainy day...

216
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,416
but we never gave up.

217
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,646
Even when you think you're alone,
you're not.

218
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,714
I want to help you.

219
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,419
You just have to give me
a little more time.

220
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,193
One hour.

221
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,193
If I can't figure out
how to treat you

222
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,359
and keep you out of jail,
you can walk out the door.

223
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,096
One hour, and then I'm gone.

224
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,307
Okay.

225
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,250
You'll have discomfort
the next few weeks,

226
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,287
but all you need right now is rest
and you should be able to...

227
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,446
- Mommy!
- Hey.

228
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,921
Oh, my gosh. That's so cool.

229
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,290
Everyone says their spouse
is the strongest person they know...

230
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,497
but I have actual proof now.

231
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,729
Told you. Wonder Woman.

232
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,771
This is absurd.

233
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
If this was a tumor,
we'd take it out and toss it.

234
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,972
- This time it just happens to be drugs.
- Yeah, because cancer is not a felony.

235
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,138
You can't toss out the drugs
with medical waste.

236
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,445
He's not a gangster
or a hardened criminal.

237
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,282
He's just a scared guy
trying to survive.

238
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,118
You're assuming anything
he's told you is true. And even if it is,

239
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,317
not everyone who needs money
becomes a drug mule.

240
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,293
You can't imagine what it's like
to grow up in that kind of poverty.

241
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,624
Shouldn't you be judging this guy
the harshest?

242
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,290
You made it out just fine
without breaking the law.

243
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,962
That's not exactly true.

244
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,873
My mother used to go on these trips.

245
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,973
I would come home from school
and she'd be gone.

246
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,845
Sometimes hours, sometimes days.
I didn't have any money.

247
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,151
So when I needed supplies
and food from the store,

248
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,187
I would sneak them away
in a backpack.

249
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,020
One day, the bag broke,

250
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,785
and all of the soup and oatmeal
that I had stolen

251
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,360
fell out in front of a security guard.

252
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,694
And she looked at me,

253
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,291
at my face, at my clothes.

254
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,034
And helped me pick them up
and let me go with a warning.

255
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,971
If she hadn't given me a break,
I wouldn't be standing here as a doctor,

256
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,568
discussing this with you.

257
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,478
Maybe there's a way to save Luca

258
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,545
without ruining his life
or breaking policy.

259
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,163
Shaun.

260
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,908
You need the elevator,
use the elevator.

261
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,517
What am I doing wrong?

262
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,823
I never know where I stand with you.

263
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,532
One minute, we're sharing
deep personal fears with each other,

264
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,766
and the next, you're running away
because you can't stand to touch me.

265
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,536
Be honest,

266
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,837
is there anything going on with Lea
that you're not telling me?

267
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,952
- Say something, Shaun.
- It's different.

268
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,095
Like you, Carly.

269
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,393
When I'm around you...

270
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,399
I want to be impressive to you.

271
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,906
I don't feel like
I have to impress Lea,

272
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,444
like I do you.

273
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,887
We will have to keep
whatever medical waste we collect

274
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,155
during your surgery in the lab
for testing,

275
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,130
but we will discharge you before
the pathology report comes back.

276
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,631
At which point, we'll be obligated
to alert the police.

277
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,830
How do I know you're not gonna call
the cops after you put me to sleep?

278
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,466
You'd be a moron not to trust
Dr. Browne at this point.

279
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,977
She's gone way beyond the call
to save your ass.

280
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,139
- Okay.
- Say thank you.

281
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,486
Thank you.

282
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,319
Dr. Murphy, how about
you head home for the night?

283
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,487
We still need to monitor Kerry.

284
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,990
And it's easier for me
to avoid Carly here

285
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,961
than it is for me
to avoid Lea at home.

286
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,862
Okay. I'm only gonna respond
to the first objection.

287
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,263
You've had a long week
and it's important you get rest.

288
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,767
Morgan will take point.

289
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,605
How did you know your wife
was the right woman for you?

290
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,404
Personal advice?

291
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,380
I thought that
was Dr. Glassman's domain.

292
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,680
Dr. Glassman is divorced.

293
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,413
He seems happy with his marriage now,

294
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,784
but I have no way
of knowing for sure.

295
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,516
You're better than him.

296
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,215
For this.

297
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,866
I knew I wanted to be with Isabel
the first time we spoke,

298
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,201
freshman year biology class,
and I have not wavered in that resolve

299
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,796
in the 27 years since.

300
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,745
But how did you know?

301
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,539
It was a feeling I had
in the pit of my stomach

302
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,018
every time I was around her.
I felt...

303
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,619
- Nervous?
- Excited.

304
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,789
It's a cliché,

305
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,889
but my heart sped up
every time I saw her.

306
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,428
Still does.

307
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,623
Not quite in the same way,
but...

308
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,465
Now, if you don't mind,
I need to get home to that woman.

309
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,621
Hey, you.

310
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,921
- How was the first day back?
- Confusing.

311
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,158
Problem with a patient or Carly?

312
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,431
If you don't wanna talk about it,
we can just hang.

313
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,498
- Let's just hang.
- Copy that.

314
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,107
Commencing a hang.

315
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,970
Um...

316
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,666
Shaun?

317
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,866
Hmm?

318
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,610
- What's up?
- This will just take a few seconds.

319
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,689
- Hello.
<i>- It didn't work.</i>

320
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,426
Kerry's leg is swelling up.
I think she has compartment syndrome.

321
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,502
You need to get back here.

322
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,446
We'll have to do the surgery
we've been trying to avoid.

323
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,243
We'll have to make multiple incisions
to relieve the pressure,

324
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,514
then replace the external frame
with an internal nail.

325
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,419
If we don't act soon...

326
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,580
you could be facing amputation.

327
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,424
Okay.

328
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,525
- You'll need to be sedated.
- No. I can take it.

329
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:21,897
Kerry, you had a blood pressure spike
during the fixation procedure.

330
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,203
Without anaesthesia,
you could have a hypertensive crisis,

331
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,467
a risk of stroke, or heart attack.

332
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:32,567
Post-op, we can help you
manage the dosing. And if you relapse,

333
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,911
- we have counsellors that...
- No!

334
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,085
I remember waking up
all those mornings, cold and alone,

335
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,257
wondering if I could ever
be happy again.

336
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,992
If I deserved to be happy.

337
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,463
Any amount of pain

338
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,933
is better than losing everything again.

339
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,101
My husband, my daughter...

340
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,502
How long can you keep secrets
from the people you love

341
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,133
before they stop
being the people you love?

342
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,804
Every relationship has secrets.

343
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,440
But this, it doesn't have to be
one of them.

344
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:16,483
Drug addiction is a disease.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

345
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,918
It happens because of the choices
you make.

346
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,996
When you have lost everything,

347
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,258
but you still manage to find someone

348
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,595
who makes you wanna get up
and live another day,

349
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:34,036
you do whatever you can
to hold on to them...

350
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,144
even if it means burying
a piece of yourself in the process.

351
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,745
If we can't convince her
to change her mind,

352
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,819
- maybe her husband can?
- Impracticality isn't cause

353
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,019
for breaking doctor-patient
confidentiality.

354
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,962
This isn't impractical,
it's irrational and barbaric.

355
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,534
We're not permitted
to reveal any secrets to the husband,

356
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:08,464
but we can tell him that.

357
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,150
Last one.

358
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,082
- What's wrong?
- It's too adherent to the intestinal wall.

359
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,862
We could use Potts Scissors
to dissect it free.

360
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,860
Let's give it a try. Nurse?

361
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,571
Your idea,
only fair you do the honors.

362
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,753
Check it for perforations.

363
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,358
- It's intact.
- Vitals are stable.

364
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,028
Take the specimen container to the lab.
Dr. Browne, you're leading closure.

365
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,769
There's been some complications.

366
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,781
We need to perform
an additional surgery.

367
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,908
- What do you need to do?
- I can't tell you.

368
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,651
I'm unable to go into further detail,
it violates your wife's confidentiality.

369
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,255
Confidentiality?

370
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,746
Haven't you been telling me
everything?

371
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,729
Again, I'm unable to go
into further detail...

372
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,268
Hey.

373
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,167
- Hey.
- What's going on?

374
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,371
Why can't the doctors talk to me?

375
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,308
Kerry, obviously there's something
going on you don't want me to know.

376
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,677
- Are you dying?
- No!

377
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:58,916
No, it's... It's nothing like that.

378
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,086
Hey.

379
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:04,816
Then what?

380
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,259
Whatever it is,
I want to be able to help.

381
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Please.

382
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,196
I'm an opioid addict.

383
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,268
I've been clean for a decade, but...

384
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,940
That's why I never take painkillers,

385
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,309
and that's why
I can't let them use anaesthesia.

386
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,472
Why didn't you ever tell me?

387
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,453
You don't know
the kind of person that I was...

388
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,455
who the drugs turned me into.

389
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,987
I tried quitting so many times,
but it never stuck,

390
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:46,965
until you.

391
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,564
Meeting you saved me.

392
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,803
But...

393
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,438
if I relapse,
I know I'll drive you away.

394
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,671
Hey. Hey.

395
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,641
How could you ever think
I'll stop loving you?

396
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,644
The woman who knows the lyrics
to every Boyz Il Men song?

397
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:14,451
The woman who rushes home to watch
those stupid home makeover shows live?

398
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,224
The woman I'm raising
our daughter with?

399
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:23,098
The woman who will steal from you.
The woman who will lie to you.

400
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,201
- Who will hurt you.
- No.

401
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,535
The woman you won't be able to trust.

402
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:28,606
No.

403
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:36,273
Just do what the doctors tell you.
Take the meds.

404
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:41,553
I will be there for you,
no matter what happens.

405
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,727
I love you...

406
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,890
and I know you mean that.

407
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,568
But I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

408
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,230
- Baby...
- I just can't.

409
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,198
I'm so sorry.

410
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,049
We'll start prepping you for surgery.

411
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,797
"I like your laugh.
I like your smile.

412
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,170
I don't usually look at eyes,
but I think yours are pretty.

413
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,834
I like your breasts."

414
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,469
You can keep going if you want to.

415
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,415
"I like spending time with you.

416
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,913
I like that you are kind.
I like that you are patient.

417
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,113
I like that you're my girlfriend."

418
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,616
Are you going to break up with me?

419
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,855
No. I am not planning
on breaking up with you.

420
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,061
We had a fight. Couples fight.

421
00:29:58,664 --> 00:29:59,664
But...

422
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,758
I'm worried, Shaun.

423
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,271
I'm flattered
that you want to impress me,

424
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:11,510
but that is not worth anything
if you feel like you can't talk to me.

425
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:17,782
You're right.

426
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,186
I have to tell you everything.

427
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,332
I got...

428
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,096
very upset...

429
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,799
in Wyoming.

430
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,637
Lea came in...

431
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:51,616
to comfort me, and we hugged,

432
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,219
and laid down on the bed.

433
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,753
And we fell asleep hugging.

434
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,484
That's everything that happened.

435
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,824
We struggled with lying together
for weeks,

436
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,325
and you...

437
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,504
did it in one night with Lea?

438
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,073
Yes.

439
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:20,542
But she's a close friend

440
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:25,083
- and she wanted to be there for me.
- Please, just stop talking.

441
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,283
Shaun, I... I just...
I need some space.

442
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,023
I can't be around you right now.

443
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:46,771
Shaun?

444
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,600
I wanted to be honest. Carly said
she wanted me to talk to her.

445
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,803
Lea said not to tell what happened.
Lea was right.

446
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,379
- Take a breath, sit...
- I can't.

447
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,473
I have surgery in a few minutes,
and...

448
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,277
I can't focus, and I feel sick,

449
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:05,380
- and is everyone going to leave me?
- What? What are you talking about?

450
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,789
My dad didn't want me.

451
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:13,892
My mom chose him over me.
Carly now hates me.

452
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,331
- Lea will get tired.
- Shaun.

453
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,300
- You'll get sick of me.
- What?

454
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,913
I do everything wrong.
Everyone will go away!

455
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,599
- Look at me.
- I make people upset!

456
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,900
Shaun! Oh, my God.

457
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,999
I make them angry!
I make them hate me!

458
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,771
Shaun, look at me, look at me.

459
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,642
Right here. Look at me here.

460
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,080
Don't ever say that about yourself.
Don't ever say that!

461
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,748
You hear me?

462
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,416
You're gonna get through this.

463
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,354
You're gonna go to surgery
and get this done.

464
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,720
- How?
- How?

465
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,488
Because you're an extraordinary
doctor, that's how.

466
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,325
And that's what you do.
That's what you do.

467
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,264
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

468
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,761
I could not be more proud of you.

469
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,266
You hear that?

470
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,371
And I could never get sick of you.

471
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,947
You're not getting rid of me, pal,
okay?

472
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,481
I'm right here.

473
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,387
I'm right over here.

474
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,328
Okay? I gotcha.

475
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,197
I'm going to be late to surgery.
Can you let me go now?

476
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,664
Yeah, okay.

477
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,807
- Okay.
- Okay.

478
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,881
Numbing cream applied.

479
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,392
Are you ready?

480
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,507
We were able to remove
all the balloons,

481
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,176
so you should be out of here
in 24 hours.

482
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:17,087
It'll likely take another 48 hours
to get the contents tested.

483
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,884
The lab's very busy.

484
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,923
I know I've been a pain in the ass.

485
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,265
I've just got used to people
screwing me over.

486
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,935
You're the first person
that's made me feel...

487
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,829
I don't know, seen.

488
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,868
Maybe I'll find a way
to pay it forward, right?

489
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,332
Reamer's in the intramedullary canal.

490
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,587
This will make space
for inserting the nail.

491
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,753
- You're doing great, Kerry.
- Inserting into canal.

492
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,761
Here comes the nail. You ready?

493
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,235
- BP's spiking.
- Push beta blockers.

494
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,969
Hang in there.

495
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,246
Two-twenty over 170.
She's having a tachyarrhythmia.

496
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,511
Screw it,
we have to push fentanyl.

497
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,151
- Nurse, help Dr. Murphy.
- No.

498
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,248
It's helping distract her.

499
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,190
- You sure, Dr. Murphy?
- Yes. Please hurry.

500
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:44,137
It was a good day.

501
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,506
It must be very gratifying,
saving lives.

502
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,446
I think I might have done
a little more than that today. I...

503
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:54,048
I think I might have changed one.

504
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,289
Last time we met,

505
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,991
you mentioned that your mother

506
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,052
would frequently berate you
when you were young.

507
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,356
What kind of things would she say?

508
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,164
Do we have to get into that
right now?

509
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,140
Can't I just have a good day?

510
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,071
You know, enjoy feeling okay
for once?

511
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,478
Claire, I believe you've fallen
into destructive patterns

512
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:28,077
precisely to avoid confronting
your feelings about your mother,

513
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720

Someone faked a seizure,
staff responded,

517
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,575

broke into the storage locker.

519
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,781

was his specimen.

- Nothing.
