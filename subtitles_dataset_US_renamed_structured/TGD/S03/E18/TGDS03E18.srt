1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,562
<i>Severe winter weather
advisories have been issued</i>

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,130
<i>from Kansas to Western Minnesota.
Severe ice...</i>

3
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,772
Shaun.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,639
Shaun.

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,846
There is a severe weather warning
in Minnesota.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,285
You haven't been at work
in three days.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,189
I want to be left alone.

8
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,722
I'm sorry she hurt you.

9
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,323
But you are strong.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,066
You're the most determined man I know.
You're gonna get through this.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,572
I wish I was...

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,703
normal.

13
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,815
Everyone wishes
they were normal, Shaun.

14
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:03,361
You need to get up.
You need to do your exercise routine,

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,399
then shower, shave, get to work.

16
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,867
Not because patients need your help,
but because it will make you feel better.

17
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,569
I'm not leaving without you.

18
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,572
Your sleep apnea
is worse than we thought.

19
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,482
You have a condition related
to your pseudoachondroplasia

20
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,348
that is narrowing
the base of your skull

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,413
and compressing the part of your brain
that controls your breathing.

22
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,293
People always say I'm too full of myself.
Guess it's actually true.

23
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,456
Finn, this is serious.

24
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,663
Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.

25
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,863
We can remove bone from your skull
and resect a section of your cerebellum

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,406
to reduce brain stem pressure.

27
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,467
You're gonna cut out
a piece of his brain?

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,775
It won't affect your intellect,

29
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,406
but it will cause a speech impediment
and some difficulty with balance.

30
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,014
I'd rather you knock a few points
off my IQ.

31
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,451
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,921
My gift of gab
is what you love about me.

33
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,417
What's option two?

34
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,155
I'm sorry,
but there is no other option.

35
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,622
I'm a salesman.

36
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,689
I don't hear the word "no."
There's always another way.

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,290
You just think outside the box.

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,794
We've done that, which is how
we came up with this surgery.

39
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,602
It's the only way to keep you alive,
no choice but to accept it.

40
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,277
Dr. Murphy is being rude and insensitive,
but he's also right.

41
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,408
Finn, please, I love you.

42
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,851
And I will always be here
no matter how you talk or walk.

43
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,550
Listen to your doctors.

44
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,651
I love you too.

45
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,993
Do whatever you think is best.

46
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,516
Let me guess.
I'm gonna need another surgery.

47
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,221
- What's that now, my tenth?
- Eleventh.

48
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,260
And I still can't work the farm,
can't drive a tractor,

49
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,198
pull the combine lever.

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,067
I can't even twist open
a bottle of beer.

51
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,728
When we met, you were in an ambulance

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,771
and your arms were still
in your harvester.

53
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,365
Today you have sensation
and almost full mobility.

54
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,842
Now we just need to treat

55
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,107
the neuropathy
and improve your strength.

56
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,674
How do we do that?

57
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,241
I'm thinking
a gracilis muscle transfer.

58
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,987
That should improve his grip
and relieve some of the pain,

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,354
but there's only one way
to eliminate all of it.

60
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,194
Tyson, have you given any more thought
to amputation

61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,092
and the osseointegrated
prosthetic arms?

62
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,025
They'd attach directly to the bones
and nerves in your forearm,

63
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,698
and you can control them
like your own hands.

64
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,033
Function would be reduced
in some respects.

65
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,268
Less dexterity, no sensory feedback.

66
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:05,277
But others, like grip strength,
would be better and you'd be pain free.

67
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,242
I want to be a farmer, not a cyborg.

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Okay.

69
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,286
The pain's getting worse.

70
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:23,320
Probably because I've been crazy busy
in the OR with Murphy out till today.

71
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,663
He's back?

72
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,732
Only because Browne went
to his apartment and dragged his ass in.

73
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,767
She shouldn't have done that.

74
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,533
He's trying to work this out
on his own, that's a good thing.

75
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,807
- The DMARDS aren't working.
- I know.

76
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,247
Which is why I've been thinking
about synovectomy surgery.

77
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,910
You're going to remove
the joint linings in your fingers?

78
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,477
That'll resolve the pain temporarily,
and then what?

79
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,453
It would give me at least 10 years.

80
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,651
Then you're gonna be bone on bone.

81
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,990
Every joint in your hand
will be mangled and deformed.

82
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,291
What's your plan then?

83
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,600
Who knows what treatments
will be available in 10 years?

84
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,671
Have you thought about oncology?

85
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,436
Surgeons do the real work.

86
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,204
They cut out the tumor,
they cure the patient.

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,972
Oncologists just sweep up after.

88
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,443
You wanna know an even better job?
Starting pitcher for the Oakland A's.

89
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,778
You wanna know
why I didn't get that job?

90
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,510
Scouts didn't like the way
you wore your hat?

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,180
Yeah, that and I was born
with this arm.

92
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,152
You were born with those hands.

93
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,121
What are you gonna do?
Practice surgery for a few more years

94
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:32,394
and then spend the rest of your life
not being able to pick up a pencil?

95
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,664
You can pursue another specialty,
practice for the rest of your life.

96
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,679
You get rear-ended on the way to work
or you just hate little people?

97
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,681
Neither.

98
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,717
EKG is normal.

99
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,611
So you got dumped.

100
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,619
No, I didn't.

101
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,721
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

102
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,124
We were never even going out.

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,629
Finn? I've been worried sick.

104
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,701
Oh.

105
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,669
Take it easy.

106
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,404
I told you to stay home,
there's nothing to worry about.

107
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,236
Stop trying to act so tough.

108
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,504
You shouldn't have
to go through this alone.

109
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,878
Sorry, baby, but you should wait outside.

110
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,748
Let the doctors finish up
and I'll be right out.

111
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,048
He's not going to the OR for a while,

112
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,282
so there will be time to visit
when we're done.

113
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,557
Okay.

114
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,522
I'll be right outside.

115
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,113
Is there any way she and Nathalie
stay in separate waiting rooms

116
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,184
and aren't allowed to visit
at the same time?

117
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,980
No. We're not helping you cheat.

118
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm not cheating.

119
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,484
I've always made it clear
I'm not ready to settle down,

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,821
but, sometimes,
women make assumptions.

121
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,490
And you don't feel the need
to correct that?

122
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,488
I understand you don't approve,

123
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,932
but all I'm asking is for you
to help me get through brain surgery

124
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,268
without emotional turmoil that I assume
would be harmful to my recovery.

125
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,837
- Okay.
- Thank you.

126
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,518
You seeing the same thing
I'm seeing?

127
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,857
The tendons are encased
in scar tissue.

128
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,754
The gracilis muscle transfer
isn't gonna work.

129
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,732
It still could.

130
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,135
If we attach the muscle further down
the forearm and bypass the scar ball.

131
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,269
It wouldn't hold. There'd be
too much tension on the graft.

132
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,475
We can figure out a way
to work around that.

133
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,309
Wake him up
and put him back in his room,

134
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,747
and pull every paper
on free muscle and nerve transfers.

135
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,177
His only option is double amputation
and osseointegrated prosthetics.

136
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,119
- We don't have a choice.
- Yes, we do.

137
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,387
And as chief of surgery,
I just made it.

138
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,265
He doesn't really look the part.

139
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,893
Ha. He's handsome
with a great sense of humor

140
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,334
and a high-paying job.

141
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,032
He means because women
don't like to be in relationships

142
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,699
- with men who are weird.
- He's not weird, and neither are you.

143
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,674
A week ago you were juggling
two women,

144
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,541
so stop feeling so sorry
for yourself.

145
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,046
Have you ever dated anyone
who wasn't tall,

146
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,310
handsome and neurotypical?

147
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,046
This is not about me.

148
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Talk to me.

149
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,356
He's stopped breathing and I haven't
even administered the paralytics.

150
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,826
What just happened?

151
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,794
Pressure on the medulla
must be getting worse.

152
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,856
He's lucky he didn't wait any longer
to come in.

153
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,060
- Tube him and get to work.
- Wait.

154
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,660
Flex his head
into position again.

155
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,443
Extend his neck.

156
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,113
What's going on?

157
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,813
Flexing the neck offsets
the posterior compression.

158
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,966
That should take the pressure off,
not make it worse.

159
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,216
Doesn't make any sense.

160
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,121
And we're not gonna do
brain surgery on him until it does.

161
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,201
I don't see anything different
in the flexed neck views.

162
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,935
Should his C2 bone be curved inward
like that?

163
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,474
It could exacerbate the narrowing on the
front of his...

164
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,045
It's not significant.

165
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,371
If his apnea's getting worse because
of pressure...

166
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,644
The treatment is the same.

167
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,878
Surgery to create more room
in the skull base.

168
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,978
It's not the same
and stop interrupting me.

169
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,249
If we drill off the C2 in the front
as well as open the back,

170
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,624
we might not have to resect
the cerebellum.

171
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,558
He wouldn't have any speech
impediment or balance issues.

172
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,930
We'd have to approach
through his mouth,

173
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,602
a bacteria-rich environment,
which can't be fully sterilized.

174
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,867
There'd be too high a risk
of a post-op infection.

175
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,841
So we figure out another approach.

176
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,241
There's only one safe way
to access the C2.

177
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,780
Okay, so come up with something
outside the box.

178
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,145
No. That's a stupid expression.
There is no box.

179
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,445
And you are wasting valuable time

180
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,483
just because you want
to be nice to her.

181
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,498
- Murphy...
- We should do the cerebellar surgery

182
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,457
- before he has a fatal apnea...
- Murphy.

183
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,453
I'm not being nice.

184
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,758
I'm using my experience and judgment
to make the call, that's my job.

185
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,822
- You are being nice.
- And you're being a jerk.

186
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,528
You've got the night.

187
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,172
If you two can't come up with
a solution by morning,

188
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,267
we'll proceed with the original plan.

189
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,488
Your patient's in desperate need
of an Oklahoma weather report?

190
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,965
I didn't even want to be here today.

191
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,662
You should try a martial arts class.

192
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,372
Focused distraction is key to dealing
with stress and heartbreaks.

193
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,570
That's just avoiding the problem.

194
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,340
Don't obsess over what you've lost,

195
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,506
focus on what you've gained
from the relationship.

196
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,848
Hate to interrupt group therapy,
but what if we approach

197
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,648
through the side of the neck?

198
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,814
We could transpose
the vertebral artery

199
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,222
and open up the spine laterally
to drill off the C2.

200
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,591
It would leave his spine permanently
unstable and could cause a stroke.

201
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,857
There might be a way
to mitigate stroke risk.

202
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,675
And he'd still have
the instability in his...

203
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,828
Come on, Shaun.
I need help, not criticism.

204
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,367
I've always supported you
trying to come up

205
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,998
with an unconventional option.

206
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,106
You supported me
when you thought I was right.

207
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,347
What do you guys think?

208
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,020
- We gotta go.
- We do?

209
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,224
Remove the scar tissue
and the nerves,

210
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,131
then harvest nerves from his
upper arm to rewire his forearms.

211
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,635
It'll improve his grip,
and with the scar tissue removed,

212
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,034
the pain should decrease too.

213
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,506
It does nothing to solve the blood flow
problem causing the scarring.

214
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,305
I'm sure we can come up
with a solve for that.

215
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,744
- That's what you said last time.
- And I was right. We're making progress.

216
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,783
Would you two give us a moment?

217
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,776
We'll meet you in the Residents'
Lounge when we're done.

218
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,892
Are you so against the prosthetics

219
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,828
because you think it's in Tyson's
best interest or because it's my idea?

220
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,431
You think I care
whose idea anything is?

221
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,962
You're a competitive person
working with the guy who held your job.

222
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,169
I'll admit my competitive drive
may kick up a notch

223
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,677
when we work together.

224
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,477
I'll also admit
that I admire the courage of a guy

225
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,983
who stumbled a half-mile
back to his house

226
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,610
after his arms were ripped off
by a combine.

227
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,955
He opened a door with his mouth
and dialed 911 with his nose,

228
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:15,358
and as long as he wants to keep fighting,
I'm gonna fight with him,

229
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,760
which has nothing to do with my ego.

230
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,567
Good. That's all I wanted to confirm.

231
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,465
But I'm gonna start prepping
for the amputation

232
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,836
because that's the only
rational choice we have,

233
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,808
which I'm confident
you'll realize soon enough.

234
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,582
Making any progress?

235
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,714
Yeah, I figured out a lateral approach...

236
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,492
but Shaun thinks
it would leave his spine unstable

237
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,494
and increase his risk of stroke.

238
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,227
- I agree.
- Yeah, me too.

239
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,632
- There has to be a way to mitigate...
- Dr. Browne?

240
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,831
These just got delivered.

241
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,670
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

242
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,177
Dash is a romantic.

243
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,676
I thought you hated romantics.

244
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,207
Yeah, he's teasing me.

245
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,484
I told him I thought guys
who send flowers are lame.

246
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,121
We haven't even kissed yet.

247
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,759
What are you waiting for?

248
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,631
I don't know.

249
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,193
Um, I enjoy being with him.

250
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,728
Actually, I forgot how funny he is.
It just...

251
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,508
hasn't seemed like the right time.

252
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:45,048
I'm more worried about stroke risk
than spinal instability,

253
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,949
so focus on fixing that.

254
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,147
Okay.

255
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:58,396
And, Claire, if he's the right guy,
stop holding out for the right time.

256
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,604
Your vitals are stable.

257
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,875
The nurses will monitor you
during the night.

258
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,211
Your problem's simple to solve.

259
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,946
Just ask someone else out.

260
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,621
- Lea was special.
- I'm sure she was.

261
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,789
But there are so many others
just as special.

262
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,256
You just have to get to know them.

263
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,199
- No, I don't want to.
- Yes, you do.

264
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,767
You think I don't know how you feel?

265
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:41,330
Afraid of being rejected
because you're too different.

266
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,634
Finally I decided "screw it."

267
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,975
I started talking
to every woman I saw.

268
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,645
Street corners, elevators,
grocery stores.

269
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,811
And I learned I'm pretty good at it.
That's my gift.

270
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,818
Everyone has one.

271
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:00,518
They just have to figure out what it is...

272
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,991
Okay. Code blue!

273
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,028
Code blue!

274
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,779
Murphy and I just inserted
a diaphragmatic pacemaker on Finn.

275
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,989
It'll only trigger shallow breaths,
so he's at high risk for pneumonia.

276
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,495
Got anything?

277
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,359
I was thinking of using
a more inferior transatlas approach.

278
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,970
That would minimize stroke risk.

279
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,495
It won't work.
It would destabilize the C1-2 joint.

280
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,269
You did all you could. Go home.

281
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,648
We'll do the original cerebellar surgery
in the morning.

282
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,726
- So I'll be able to work the farm?
- We still need to increase blood flow.

283
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:15,165
You should regain most of your grip
and forearm strength.

284
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,328
But you'd still be in some pain.

285
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,998
I can handle it.

286
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,939
Can you? How can you know for sure?

287
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,538
As the years go by
and the pain doesn't stop,

288
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,310
will you change your mind?
Because it'll be too late.

289
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,051
- What's wrong? What are you feeling?
- Like a horse just kicked in my chest.

290
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,857
I need an echo and pulmonary
cath kit! And page Lim, stat!

291
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,863
I think the last time that I was
at an actual punk rock show was, uh...

292
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,473
College?

293
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,242
Patti Smith.

294
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,935
Oh, my God,
I completely forgot about that.

295
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,575
You forgot getting your ass tossed
off-stage by a 60-year-old woman?

296
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,084
- Yeah.
- Remember what you said

297
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,916
- when we picked you up?
- Uh... Oh.

298
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:11,253
Something about her being thin
but strong?

299
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,555
- "Thin but wiry." Wiry. Ha-ha.
- Wiry!

300
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,595
Okay, well, I, um...
I have an early surgery,

301
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,436
- so I should probably get going.
- Okay.

302
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,635
Okay...

303
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,243
- I had a good night.
- Good night.

304
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,921
I got an idea.
Actually, you had it first.

305
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,955
It was the right approach,
just the wrong route.

306
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,622
We'd go in from the back,
posterior transdural,

307
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,563
gently move your spinal cord
out of the way,

308
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,828
so we can drill off
the misshaped C2.

309
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,501
There is a risk of paralysis,

310
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,006
but we'd be monitoring spinal functions
to help avoid any nerve injuries.

311
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,138
Let's do it. Where do I have to sign?

312
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,943
You shouldn't sign anything.

313
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:44,308
Consenting to this surgery would be
incredibly short-sighted and reckless.

314
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,390
It is one thing to take your bad mood
out on your colleagues,

315
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,555
but to try and undermine
my surgical advice...

316
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,532
- My opinion's valid.
- Thankfully, he disagrees.

317
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,593
He's risking paralysis
to be charming,

318
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,401
because people expect everyone
to be perfect.

319
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,906
Everyone's opinion is valid

320
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,239
all the way until we go
into the patient room.

321
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,108
We are a team with one opinion.

322
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,078
I...

323
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,613
I don't feel better!

324
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,419
I feel worse!

325
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,894
And doing the wrong surgery
is not going to help anyone.

326
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,598
I don't want to do it,
I'm going home.

327
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,207
You're not walking out
on your patient. Or your team.

328
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:57,621
I still have two sick days
and 76 hours of unused PTO.

329
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,749
You're not sick,
you're in the middle of a case.

330
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,886
I don't care about the case
or the patient.

331
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,734
I don't care about anything.

332
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,650
I've had my heart broken twice
in the last few years.

333
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,848
You want to know what I did?

334
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,587
I came to work every day
and pretended everything was fine.

335
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:40,192
Until, eventually,
I wasn't pretending anymore.

336
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,105
That's not helpful at all.

337
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,203
How about this?

338
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,209
Go and help Claire prep Finn
for surgery, or you won't be my resident.

339
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,181
Or anyone else's at St. Bonaventure.

340
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,383
And I know you care about that.

341
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,350
We were able to clear the clot,

342
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,218
but due to the restricted arteries
in your arms,

343
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,689
we're going to need to keep you
on blood thinners, indefinitely.

344
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,719
Okay.

345
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,028
The blood thinners make
the reconstructive surgery impossible.

346
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,928
We have no choice but to amputate.

347
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,665
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,065
No.

349
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm not letting you cut off my arms.

350
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,674
I don't want false limbs.

351
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,083
I don't want to be that guy.
I want to be who I am.

352
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:19,055
You are the toughest,
most tenacious person I've ever met.

353
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,296
And that is not gonna change

354
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,700
because we replace your hands
with titanium.

355
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,408
It's time to let go.

356
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,045
Okay.

357
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,924
Okay.

358
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,694
Any way you could draw a skull
with a cobra coming out of its eyes?

359
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,773
Would you settle
for a lame smiley face?

360
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,434
Because that is the only thing
I can draw.

361
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,269
Here's my favorite nurse.

362
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,440
Did you check out that Ethiopian place
I told you about last night?

363
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,745
Actually, I did,
and the kik alicha was delish.

364
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,217
Now if you want
a truly life-changing meal,

365
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,222
you try Lennon's on Sixth.

366
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,484
Is it expensive?

367
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,818
Outrageously. But worth it.

368
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,360
Now, it's all white tablecloths
and candles, so you'll need a date.

369
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,858
How about Dr. Murphy?

370
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,665
You told me yourself
he's a gifted surgeon.

371
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,502
That's pretty high praise.

372
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,174
And he told me you're cute.

373
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,485
- Good luck today.
- Thanks.

374
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,892
I totally teed you up.
All you had to do was take a swing.

375
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:57,192
I am not interested in her.

376
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,891
If she's not your type,

377
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,127
I'm sure there are plenty of other
cool nurses roaming around here

378
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,136
who can make you feel better
about yourself.

379
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,037
He's miserable because he's had
two relationships blow up.

380
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,335
I don't think jumping
into another one is the answer.

381
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,144
No. No. No!

382
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,688
Finn, you can't exert yourself
like this!

383
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,585
Just take it easy.

384
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,921
I ran into a woman in the cafeteria.

385
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,096
Real nice but seems stressed.

386
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,363
Turns out that her boyfriend
is having spinal surgery too.

387
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,927
Big coincidence, huh?

388
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,204
But get this.

389
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,607
He also has pseudoachondroplasia.

390
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,875
I mean, what are the chances?

391
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,110
Nathalie, don't you dare. Stop!

392
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,741
Just slow down.

393
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,889
You called me the love of your life.

394
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,418
- Aah! Don't say that!
- I do love you.

395
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,621
I don't wanna hear
any more garbage.

396
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,864
Please, you have to listen.

397
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,766
You need to get back to bed
or you'll pass out.

398
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,117
What's up?
What are you doing in here?

399
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,753
Once you get a patient on the table,

400
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:37,261
there's too much going on
to appreciate what this place is.

401
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:39,997
Mm, it's nice.

402
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,365
It's perfect.

403
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,100
Time to scrub in.

404
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,976
This will be my last surgery.

405
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:59,251
Five months ago, I was diagnosed
with rheumatoid arthritis.

406
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,085
I'm not responding to medication.

407
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,309
Why did you do that?

408
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,544
I felt like it.

409
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,917
It didn't change the fact
that he cheated on you.

410
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,044
It won't make your life any better.

411
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,047
You can't control
how you feel about someone...

412
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,420
but you can control
what you do with those feelings.

413
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,830
I ended the relationship on my terms.

414
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,067
More importantly...

415
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,440
it made me feel better.

416
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,646
- A Louisville Slugger to a Porsche?
- It was insane.

417
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,651
I like her.

418
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,480
What is to like?

419
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,218
I don't know. I just do.

420
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,858
A sudden complete loss
of SSEP and MEP signals.

421
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,158
BP and heart rate are tanking.
We injured his cord.

422
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,029
Push high dose steroids and pressors.

423
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,898
Remove that retractor,
to take the pressure off.

424
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,037
That's the last of the vessels
and nerves ligated.

425
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,202
Mayos.

426
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:37,875
Specimen bag.

427
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,285
We have healthy bone anchor sites.

428
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,487
Same here.

429
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,789
Time to give him functional arms.

430
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,507
Not me. Give it to her.

431
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,076
She's a third-year resident,
a talented one, but...

432
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm sure she's read every article
written on osseointegration,

433
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,524
spent countless hours
in the Skills Lab

434
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,051
and could probably do this with one
of her own arms tied behind her back.

435
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,226
- Blindfolded.
- Get to work.

436
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,304
Push another milligram of atropine.

437
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,951
We may have just paralyzed him
trying to avoid a stutter.

438
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,661
We won't know until we wake him up.

439
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,564
- Where's the pressure still coming from?
- Laterally now.

440
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,124
So if we remove the joints
of the C1 and C2 bones,

441
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,796
that should make enough room
to drill off the odontoid.

442
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,136
Replace with screws and rods
to stabilize his spine.

443
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,435
That's...

444
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,703
a good idea.

445
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,111
Yes, it is.

446
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,377
If he's not already paralyzed.

447
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,655
Colleen Brown. Freshman year.

448
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,294
I took her to the roller-skating rink

449
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,527
because I thought
that's what you're supposed to do,

450
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:39,501
take girls to the roller-skating rink.
I didn't know how to roller skate,

451
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,699
she ended up leaving
with Bobby K's little brother.

452
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,207
Broke me up.

453
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,976
I couldn't go to school for a week.

454
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,642
Convinced my mom that I was sick
for the first three days,

455
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:55,245
and the last two I spent
in a double feature. All day.

456
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,016
<i>Where's Poppa?</i> and <i>Twelve Chairs.</i>

457
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,751
To this day,
I can quote both films verbatim.

458
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,520
So you think I should have
stayed home two more days?

459
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,757
No, I don't think it would have mattered.
It doesn't make a difference.

460
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,993
And then I made a list of all the things
that annoyed me about her.

461
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,664
The way she chewed gum, the way
she sat in the front row of every class

462
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,675
so that the teacher would call on her
when she raised her hand.

463
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:21,043
The way she said, "Excuse me,"
instead of just "What?" or "Huh?"

464
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,580
None of it makes any difference.

465
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,719
Then why are you telling me?

466
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:33,557
Maybe it'll make you feel better to know
that what you're going through,

467
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:37,561
every other young man in the history
of the world has gone through.

468
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:42,359
You tried to make it work
with Lea and with Carly

469
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:46,269
and you're getting beat up,
and that's okay. Join the club.

470
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,098
You're in the mix,
that's a good thing.

471
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,740
I'm proud of you.

472
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,082
You ready?

473
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,250
It's gonna take some getting used to

474
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,689
but they're the same nerves
you used before.

475
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,491
All you have to do is think about

476
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,093
using the arms the way
you normally would.

477
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,747
That's pretty cool.

478
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,121
It's not a beer,
but you've got to start somewhere.

479
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,235
Now pinch your forefinger and thumb
and twist off the cap.

480
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,649
I can't feel a thing.

481
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,556
You'll get used to it. You got this.

482
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,474
Nice.

483
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:46,715
- You want me to say you were right?
- About the patient, or you?

484
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,885
When you offered me a job,

485
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,396
you said it was to help me
get back on the horse,

486
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,898
but what you really wanted
was a mentor.

487
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,696
Which I'm fine with,

488
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,397
but I think maybe you feel threatened
by that need.

489
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,363
Well, maybe that's true.

490
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,745
But maybe also you enjoy it
a little too much.

491
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,612
Maybe because you're having
a hard time giving up being chief.

492
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,375
Maybe we're both right.

493
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:19,382
How did it go?

494
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,394
Can you lift your arms for me?

495
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,531
Okay.

496
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,934
I'm gonna push your arm
and I need you to resist.

497
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,347
Good. More.

498
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,916
Stronger. That's great.

499
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,151
- You should make a full recovery.
- Thank you.

500
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,418
How's Nathalie's hand?

501
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,718
There was no nerve or tendon damage.

502
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:57,795
She'll be fine.

503
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,659
She's a good person.

504
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,292
A little spirited,
but that's what I loved about her.

505
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,869
Are you going to try to win her back?

506
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,635
I'm confident, but not stupid.

507
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,573
Gotta know
when to call it, Dr. Murphy.

508
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,182
There's a whole world
of amazing people out there.

509
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,950
Don't get bogged down
with this notion of a soulmate.

510
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,962
Finn's exam was normal.

511
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,197
But I am not sure
it was worth the risk.

512
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,671
We did a good thing today.

513
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,341
Mostly because of you.

514
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,308
That's kind of you to say.

515
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,508
Your commitment to your patients...

516
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,115
reminds me of why
I got into medicine.

517
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,222
Being around you makes me
a better surgeon.

518
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,564
A better person.

519
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,168
- Well, good night.
- Night.

520
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,554
You did good work today.

521
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,857
And I understand
you're leaving surgery.

522
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,255
And I know that's tough,
but it's the right call.

523
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,994
No, I don't think it is.

524
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:54,078
I love operating, so I'm gonna keep
doing it as long as I can.

525
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm gonna have
the synovectomy surgery.

526
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,882
That's really stupid.

527
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,184
That's incredibly stupid.

528
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,990
Not every dream comes true.

529
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,794
You have other opportunities,
you have another chance.

530
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,265
Not everybody does,
be grateful for that.

531
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,859
Pick another passion and pursue that.

532
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,099
I'm doing the surgery.

533
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,662
Enjoy.

534
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,801
Another, please.

535
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,802
That's one way
to start the night off right.

536
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,069
Hello, Nurse Fletch.

537
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:02,939
You can call me Julie.

538
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,981
Here alone
or are you meeting someone?

539
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,952
- I'm alone.
- Mm. To us.

540
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,689
You have beautiful eyes.

541
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:23,767
Thank you.

542
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,337
Or did someone just tell you that
that's a good opening line?

543
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,808
It's right in our backyard
and I've never even been there.

544
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,285
- Have you?
- No.

545
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,588
It's time we unleash
our inner tree hugger.

546
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,650
You're off next weekend,
I think we should go to Yosemite.

547
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,162
- What do you think?
- Yeah, sounds fun.

548
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,157
- I'm gonna get some hiking boots.
- Mm.

549
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,202
- And like a fleece, a beanie...
- Oh. Mm.

550
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,363
I'm rocking the full lumbersexual look.
Because I gotta blend in.

551
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,498
I hear a bear can spot a tourist
a mile away.

552
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,235
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.

553
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
You okay?

554
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:16,853
You're here but, you know, not.

555
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,184
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's just been a long week.

556
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,626
I'm a bit exhausted.

557
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,522
I think I might call it
an early night.

558
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,136
Oh, you sure?
I mean, we don't have to go to the club.

559
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,005
- We can chill here. Watch a movie.
- I'm sorry, I just...

560
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,840
I just think I should go home.

561
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,706
Okay.

562
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,250
Shaun?

563
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,788
I want to smash your car up.

564
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,599
I think that's a bad idea.

565
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,367
I want to hurt you...
the way you hurt me.

566
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,178
- I'm sorry...
- You...

567
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,443
You...

568
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,178
You're...

569
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,330
I can't.

570
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,641
I can't.

571
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,514
You acted like you cared about me...

572
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,146
but you don't even respect me.

573
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,320
You're flaky.

574
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,351
And...

575
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,023
And you can't keep a boyfriend.

576
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,498
And you can't keep a job.

577
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,439
And no one likes you.

578
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:22,637
And you're going to
end up alone and you deserve it!

579
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:27,947
Because you're a superficial,
selfish and prejudiced person!

580
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,332
Ready to tell me
what's on your mind?

581
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:52,903
Not really.

582
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,796
I think I'm in love with my boss.
