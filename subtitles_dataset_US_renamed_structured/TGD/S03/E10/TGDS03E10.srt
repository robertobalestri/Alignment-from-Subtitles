1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,370
Shaun, you need to make a decision.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,043
Shaun, please,
your mom's been calling.

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,104
Your father wants to talk to you.

4
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,185
Say something, will you?
Say anything.

5
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,686
I know he wasn't a good father,
but he's the only father you've got.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,594
If ever there was something
you wanted to say to him,

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,100
now's the time.

8
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,774
I have nothing to say to him.

9
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,103
Okay.

10
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,114
But if he wants to say something
to me before he dies,

11
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,149
I'll listen.

12
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,109
Okay.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,851
- Can you come with me?
- Yeah, of course.

14
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,483
- Can I bring a friend?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

15
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,061
I want to bring a friend.

16
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,723
Shaun, how long
have you been dating Carly?

17
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,288
I don't want to bring Carly.

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,433
I want to bring Lea.

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,307
Morning.

20
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,514
- Never seen you here before.
- Yeah, I just joined.

21
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,453
I'm not really a gym person,
but I thought I'd try something new.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,656
Great way to clear your head.

23
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:37,097
Yeah, um, about last night,
in the stairwell.

24
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,600
- Thanks.
- No problem.

25
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,632
I know the boss isn't always the person
you want to talk to, but if you ever do...

26
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,870
Well, thanks again, but I'm fine.
Really.

27
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,139
Is that guy serious?

28
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,510
That's it. That's it.

29
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,483
I'm gonna say yes,
since that's Art Kalman.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,611
Raiders offensive tackle?

31
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,788
That's, like, 800 pounds.

32
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,385
It's the NFL. No pain, no pay check.

33
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,930
Come on. Awesome, man. We got you.

34
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,728
- One more.
- No, man, come on, you're good.

35
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,392
One more.

36
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,665
Push, push, push.

37
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,743
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

38
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,840
- Don't move.
- I'm a doctor. Where does it hurt?

39
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,652
It doesn't but I can't move.

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,719
Call 911.

41
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,051
I can't feel my legs!

42
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,023
Listen to me, Art.
You need to hold still.

43
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,391
- I'm gonna take care of you.
- I can't feel my legs!

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,883
You know, you don't have to go
if you don't want to.

45
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,716
- I can handle it.
- I don't wanna go.

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,681
I, obviously,
have no wisdom to offer,

47
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,692
my own family's a disaster,

48
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,694
and things are crazy busy
at work now.

49
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,690
Okay.

50
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,097
But he's my best friend
and he seems to need my support,

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,725
so no way I'm gonna say no.

52
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,195
Well, don't force yourself to go
if you don't want to.

53
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,299
- Sounds like you don't want me to go.
- It's just that it's...

54
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,741
It's gonna be intense,
it's gonna be emotional.

55
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,007
Really? I thought going home
to visit the parents

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,606
who abused and abandoned him
would be a fun family reunion.

57
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,945
Why are you defensive?

58
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,110
- Why do you have to be controlling?
- How am I?

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,915
- I'm just asking...
- I'm ready to go.

60
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,818
We have to be at the airport
90 minutes prior to our flight.

61
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,328
Can you believe the size of this guy?

62
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,735
Exactly why I don't watch football.

63
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,400
Size is more important than talent
or skill.

64
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,273
I'm gonna guess you never played.

65
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,736
Half the players are morbidly obese.

66
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,443
Yet they can still run 4.9 40s
and have 36-inch verticals.

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,746
It doesn't matter what kind of body
you're born with.

68
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,120
No one makes it to the top unless
they're talented and work their ass off.

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,351
It's just stupid.

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,251
Jocks get paid millions
and get treated like royalty,

71
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,196
whereas people who do jobs
that actually matter...

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,359
Teachers, cops, doctors.
- -we can barely pay our student loans.

73
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,869
Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

74
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,269
Gonna guess someone else's.

75
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,541
I'm not doing that anymore.

76
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,879
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
This is bad.

78
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,781
Burst and facet fractures,
T-3 and 4.

79
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,157
Retropulsion of bony fragments
in the spinal canal.

80
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,627
Yeah, but look here.

81
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,857
No transection
or bruising in his spinal cord.

82
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,393
We're in boarding group A, right?

83
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,663
Boarding group A.

84
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,299
No emergency exit row.
Right side of the plane.

85
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,301
Have you spoken to Carly?

86
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,537
Not since last night.

87
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,774
Don't you think you should call,
let her know where you're going,

88
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,615
and why and with whom.

89
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,654
She won't worry.

90
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,852
She knows I don't like my dad,
so I won't be sad when he dies.

91
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,761
Shaun, call her

92
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,389
and let her know that
you're gonna miss her.

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,034
- She must know I'll miss her.
- Tell her anyway.

94
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,340
You know it must be good advice
if he and I actually agree.

95
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,210
If we can stabilize the fractures
and decompress the cord,

96
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,946
- we should reverse the paralysis.
- Fantastic.

97
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,831
We should start
a preoperative Riluzole regimen.

98
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,221
No.

99
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,386
There's an experimental
hypothermia treatment

100
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,429
shown to reduce cord edema and
cell death when done prior to surgery.

101
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,466
It's also shown a high rate
of bradycardia and arrhythmias,

102
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,569
which is the last thing
I wanna deal with during surgery.

103
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,367
There's an infusion protocol
we can follow to reduce that risk.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,033
The faster we reduce inflammation...

105
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,771
Thank you, I appreciate your input,
but as Art's surgeon...

106
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,937
She's right.

107
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,557
And what makes you think
you're doing the surgery?

108
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,914
Dr. Melendez,
I appreciate all you've done.

109
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,579
But now that he's stable,
my staff will take over.

110
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,989
Well, actually that's not your call.
Or mine.

111
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,456
You are a pro athlete
with a pro athlete's body.

112
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,827
And you need a surgeon
who understands

113
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,766
that this is not just about
making sure you can walk again,

114
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,397
it's about making sure
you can run, block,

115
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:49,409
so you can get back on that field
and play at the top of your game.

116
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,445
This is what I do.

117
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,707
Sure, you do knees, shoulders.

118
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,646
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

119
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,308
Robert Stokes, last year.

120
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,613
Donny Lund a few years before that.

121
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,847
Both players had
similar spinal fractures.

122
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,655
Actually, not that similar.

123
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,723
This is more like what I see
in high-speed motorcycle accidents.

124
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,821
Unfortunately,
I've seen a lot of those.

125
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,163
Not one or two every few years,
but 20 to 30 every year.

126
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,497
That's what I do.

127
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,246
This is gonna be awesome.

128
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,691
Got something to say?

129
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,294
I get you want to deal with stuff
on your own,

130
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,796
for people to mind
their own business.

131
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,560
But whatever pressure
you've been feeling is still here.

132
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,534
If you don't seek help
or rely on other people,

133
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,497
you will fail.

134
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Thank you.

135
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,209
Shall we get back to work now?

136
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,805
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

137
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,373
<i>welcome to Cheyenne Regional Airport.</i>

138
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,677
I changed my mind.

139
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,613
I don't want to hear
what he has to say.

140
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,943
I think you do wanna hear.

141
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,110
- No. No.
- Okay, how...

142
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,711
- I... I don't want to be here.
- Shaun.

143
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,189
Okay, why don't we sit in the car
for a while? No rush.

144
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:48,820
Okay.

145
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,636
I want to go.

146
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,748
Now.

147
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,284
- Shaun, take a deep breath.
- No, thank you.

148
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,583
I don't want to take a breath.
No, I want to go.

149
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,451
I want to go.

150
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,654
I want to go now!

151
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,387
- Go now! Please!
- Okay, okay.

152
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,396
- Okay, okay. Here we go.
- Please.

153
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,489
- Please. Go now!
- We're going back to the hotel.

154
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,966
- Go now! Go now!
- It's gonna be okay.

155
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,403
- Go now, please!
- We'll settle in at the motel

156
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,304
- and then we'll see, okay?
- Okay.

157
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,987
- How you doing?
- I'm ready to go home.

158
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,835
We're not gonna be able to do that
until tomorrow,

159
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:07,601
so maybe we should try
to make the most of our visit.

160
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,480
Shaun, it's okay.

161
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:23,054
Just because your dad's dying
doesn't mean he deserves to be forgiven.

162
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,122
And if he dies
before you're ready to listen

163
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,958
to whatever he wants to say,
that's his fault.

164
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,456
His, not yours.

165
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,162
There is someone I'd like to see.

166
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,174
He's in a peaceful place.

167
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,010
He's decomposed...

168
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,747
except for maybe his face and hands.

169
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,685
That's where they concentrate
the embalming fluid

170
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,349
because that's what people see
at the funeral.

171
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,613
Are you ready?

172
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,511
Okay, you take as much time
as you need.

173
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,051
Your mom and I
are gonna wait in the car.

174
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,525
I'm not going with you.

175
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,095
- Shaun...
- I'm never going with you.

176
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,558
What are you gonna do?

177
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,500
You gonna live in that bus?

178
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,038
You gonna eat out of the trash?

179
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,128
Huh?

180
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,634
- Come on, let's go.
- Leave me alone.

181
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,553
<i>It was an accident, Shaun.</i>

182
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,159
A horrible, tragic accident.

183
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,165
And I know you're hurting.

184
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,099
I promise you, he's hurting too.

185
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,647
You don't get over losing a child.

186
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,153
He wants to see you.

187
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,819
What do you wanna do?

188
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,427
But you don't have to.

189
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,166
If you're not ready yet, that's fine.

190
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,865
Whatever feels right for you,
that's what you should do.

191
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,588
Hi, Shaun.

192
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,858
Hello.

193
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,688
Can I hug you?

194
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,193
No.

195
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,472
Got venous blood return.
I'm in the subclavian.

196
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,977
- Next step?
- Large bore catheter.

197
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,911
FYI, he grew up poor.

198
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,579
He bought his mom a house
with his signing bonus.

199
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,021
Set up a business for his brother
and cousins.

200
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,582
Focus on the procedure.
Write his biography on your own time.

201
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,519
Infusing 400 milliliters
cooling saline.

202
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,932
Core body temp down to 94.5.

203
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,677
- He's bradycardic.
- Push 0.5 atropine.

204
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,838
Let's get the transcutaneous pacer
on him.

205
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,575
Low charge.
We can't allow the contractions

206
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,524
to increase the dislocation
and sever the cord.

207
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,619
- Charge at 40.
- Forty milliamps.

208
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,382
Clear.

209
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,523
Can't feel his pulse.

210
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,462
Ten milliliters epi
on the long needle.

211
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,966
- Start compressions.
- No, can't risk further dislocation.

212
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,547
- Should we up the...
- Keep it at 40.

213
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,093
- Forty milliamps.
- Clear.

214
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,433
No response.
Give him more atropine.

215
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,688
- Push more IV epi?
- No, that'll take too long.

216
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,056
We should increase charge by 100.

217
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,413
- Can't take that risk.
- Better paralyzed than dead.

218
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,756
He's got a pulse.

219
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,936
- Core temp?
- Ninety-three-point-two.

220
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,338
That's cool enough.
Let's monitor him closely overnight,

221
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:12,310
make sure BP and heart rate are steady
before we start surgery.

222
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,292
Mm.

223
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,332
Shaun, I'm sorry.

224
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,868
It's just...

225
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,004
I always wanted a son.

226
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,143
You know, a boy
that I could teach to hunt, fish...

227
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,681
Play catch with.

228
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,448
Have a beer with.

229
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,225
A little kid that I could carry
around on my shoulders.

230
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,867
And I got angry.

231
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,372
Not at you, it was just me.

232
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:18,777
I was pissed off at myself
because I couldn't help my son.

233
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,589
No matter how hard I tried,
I always failed.

234
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,426
But you were a good kid.

235
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,008
You've become a great man,
better than I ever could dream of.

236
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,420
I'm proud of you, Shaun.

237
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,902
And I love you.

238
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,341
I just want you to know that.

239
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
You...

240
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,136
are not a good person.

241
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:07,018
You always drank too much beer,

242
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,756
- which made you stink.
- Shaun...

243
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:16,086
And you always blame other people.

244
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,529
And you hit and punch other people.

245
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,102
Shaun, please calm down.

246
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,404
You killed my rabbit!

247
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,277
- Shaun...
- You killed my rabbit.

248
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,544
And you killed my brother.

249
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,354
So I don't care that you're dying.
I don't care at all!

250
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,127
Shaun?

251
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,758
You done?
We need to follow up on Art.

252
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,092
I'll be right there.

253
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,395
- You said that 10 minutes ago.
- I'm just finishing up some charts.

254
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,901
The charts on your phone?

255
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,039
Satisfied?

256
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,068
Nice. Very dramatic, and stupid.

257
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,237
People need to be able to page you.

258
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,197
- Tequila, stat.
- No, thank you.

259
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,792
Okay.

260
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,536
We need to do something fun.

261
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,034
Like go for a swim.

262
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,539
There is a gorgeous lake
a few blocks away.

263
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,047
I saw it when we first drove in.

264
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,641
It's the Rocky Mountains,
it's December.

265
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,785
So? My family used to do
a New Year's Eve "Polar Bear Plunge"

266
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,379
at our lake house.

267
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:28,155
- Sometimes my dad would...
- The diagnosis is correct.

268
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,790
There's no hope. He's going to die.

269
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:36,966
Yeah?

270
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,972
<i>♪ We'd find our way
Through the joy and the pain ♪♪</i>

271
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,633
Shaun, I don't think
you're done with your dad.

272
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,407
You can't help him medically,
but you can talk to him.

273
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,413
Yes, you have every right
to be angry,

274
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,918
but I'm not so sure
that's all you feel.

275
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,420
I think we should go home
to the motel, get some sleep,

276
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,980
in the morning, go to the Hilltop,

277
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,185
get some pancakes
and then see what happens.

278
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,526
- Sounds like a very wise plan.
- Good.

279
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,529
On the other hand,
there is that lake.

280
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,104
- Oh, my God, do you ever stop?
- No.

281
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,697
- I'm going with Lea.
- Yes!

282
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,005
- The lake is probably half-frozen.
- I'm going with Lea.

283
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,374
Let's do this, Shaunie.

284
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,788
Your heart is stabilized,

285
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,848
and surgery will likely be
in a few hours.

286
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,559
You're gonna walk out of here
and, probably, even play again.

287
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,592
You wanna know why I chose you guys?

288
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,699
Because I thought you didn't care
if I played or not.

289
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,375
I hate football, always have.

290
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,218
But you've dedicated your entire life
to being the best at it.

291
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,890
I was 6'1", 250 pounds
in eighth grade.

292
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:10,863
When I got to high school, the coach,
he didn't ask me to play, he told me.

293
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,063
But from the first practice,
it was...

294
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,030
It's not who I am.

295
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,339
I wanted to quit, but...

296
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,178
college coaches
started calling my mom.

297
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,749
She insisted it was God's plan.

298
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,575
Why else would I be born this way?

299
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,682
But you're not a kid anymore.
You must have plenty of money.

300
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,157
Everybody depend on me.

301
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,855
My mother, my brother,

302
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,956
my cousins, my friends.

303
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,767
They'd hate me.

304
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,767
So I prayed to get hurt,

305
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,434
but no matter how out of control
I played...

306
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,409
I thought I'd go to the weight room
and blow out a knee, then this happens.

307
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,958
He wants closure.
There's no such thing.

308
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,730
Some relationships
are just not meant to be,

309
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,740
which is why people should focus
on nurturing the ones they have,

310
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,800
instead of trying to salvage
the ones they've lost.

311
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,606
- Talking's done. Time for action.
- Okay.

312
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,726
What's wrong?

313
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,430
The majority of drownings are caused
by swimming after drinking alcohol.

314
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,991
Not gonna be a problem
because we're not gonna swim.

315
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,367
It's way too cold for that.
We're just gonna run in

316
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,269
until it's deep enough
to dunk our heads,

317
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,536
- and then run back out.
- No.

318
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,544
Oh, come on. It'll feel amazing.

319
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,841
Like you've just had
an awesome massage.

320
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,440
- I don't like massages.
- It's not at all like a massage.

321
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,110
It's not even close to that.

322
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,747
I don't like the mud.
It gets between my toes.

323
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,120
You won't even feel it.

324
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,024
Your toes will be numb
as soon as they hit the water.

325
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,961
But that feeling when you get out,
that warm, tingly sensation.

326
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,365
It's the best high there is.

327
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,369
That can't be true.

328
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:36,336
Okay, guess I'll just have
to go solo, then.

329
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,206
You're not supposed to swim alone.

330
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,710
I'm not alone, you're here.

331
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,279
And you're gonna regret it
if you don't come with me.

332
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,216
Suit yourself.

333
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,097
Lea?

334
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,001
Lea?

335
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,740
Lea!

336
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,629
Damn it! If only I could hold my breath
longer than 15 seconds.

337
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,560
That is not a good joke!

338
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,707
I knew you would forgive me.

339
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,651
Shaun's not an angry person, right?

340
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,487
He can be insecure maybe,
stubborn sometimes,

341
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,458
but he's not an angry person.

342
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,463
And if that's the last conversation
he has with his dad,

343
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,262
then all I've succeeded in doing
is ripping open an old scab

344
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,428
and this whole trip was a mistake.

345
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:17,573
His dad was a disaster and his mom
did nothing to protect him,

346
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:21,774
so I just don't think you need
to be so worried

347
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,508
about getting him to forgive.

348
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,024
You're gonna become
a parent someday,

349
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,462
maybe, right?

350
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,201
Well, if you do,

351
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:48,169
you're gonna be responsible
for another human being.

352
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:53,142
And your first job, number one...

353
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,807
is to keep him alive.

354
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,791
You're gonna make mistakes,

355
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,735
but you hope that one mistake
doesn't scar you for life.

356
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,663
I'm... I'm sorry.

357
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,485
Shaun's dad needed
a little bit of mercy.

358
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,323
We'll leave in the morning.

359
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,181
I don't like the mud.
It gets between my toes.

360
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,847
Come on, buddy. Can't turn back now.
We're almost to the waterfall.

361
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,124
I can wait here. I...
I'll meet you when you come back.

362
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,195
No, no, no.
You're too young to be left alone.

363
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,253
I tell you what,
I will help you clean

364
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,559
every speck of dirt off your feet
soon as we cross.

365
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,895
I don't want to.

366
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,865
What if I carry you?
You won't even touch the water.

367
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,908
- I don't wanna be picked up.
- Five seconds

368
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,943
for the most amazing
mountaintop picnic ever.

369
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,410
I got all your favorite foods.

370
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:36,141
I got peanut butter and jelly
on white bread.

371
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,409
I got apples.

372
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,576
Chocolate chip cookies. Huh?

373
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,958
Shaun, come on.

374
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,584
- No! Put me down!
- All right.

375
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,458
- No, buddy. It's okay.
- Put me down!

376
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,497
- Okay. All right.
- Put me down! Let me go!

377
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,758
You're good. You're okay.
We're good. It's all good.

378
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,433
- All right, let's do this.
- Put your shoes on, bud.

379
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,180
These are as good as I remember.

380
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:52,115
There's a flight at 11,
if that's what you want.

381
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,490
Are you good with that? Shaun?

382
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,965
You never could get enough
of Hilltop's pancakes.

383
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:07,968
Can we talk?

384
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,240
It'll just take a minute, I promise.

385
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,245
Okay.

386
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,895
The inflammation's definitely
been reduced. Well done.

387
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,092
Thanks.

388
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,095
- Get the rods, place set screws...
- Got it.

389
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,366
While Park and I
compress the spine above

390
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,069
and below the fracture
to improve alignment.

391
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:53,515
All I ever wanted was to figure out
a way to move past...

392
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,216
everything.

393
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,789
I wanted us to be a family again.

394
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,726
Why did you stay with him?

395
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,428
I don't know.

396
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,098
I just...

397
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,434
I love him.

398
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:26,446
You loved him more than me and Steve?

399
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,077
No. No.

400
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,586
That isn't true.

401
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,454
I just...

402
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,728
I guess I knew
what I could do for him.

403
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,293
With you...

404
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,339
I don't blame you for hating us.

405
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,204
We were young.

406
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:52,904
Stupid.

407
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,012
Not like people today.

408
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,805
Like Dr. Glassman.

409
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,477
There was so much
we didn't understand about...

410
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,652
you...

411
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,752
and what you needed from us.

412
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,270
We've missed you.

413
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,774
So much.

414
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,348
Can I hug you?

415
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,016
I need to talk to my dad.

416
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,070
I thought you went home.

417
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,380
I couldn't let you...

418
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,882
put me on your shoulders.

419
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,929
Or let you hug me.

420
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,962
I couldn't...

421
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,365
make you happy.

422
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,737
You're my son.

423
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,279
You're Shaun.

424
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,825
I forgive you.

425
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,396
And...

426
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,440
I don't want

427
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,137
to punish you anymore.

428
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,273
I don't want to punish you.

429
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,016
You're not like other people.

430
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,123
You're so smart.

431
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:33,897
Hmm.

432
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,532
But weak.

433
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,371
You're like a spoiled little baby.

434
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,240
He's delirious from the morphine.

435
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,509
You understand.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

436
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,212
You're damn right Stevie's death
wasn't my fault.

437
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,316
It was yours.

438
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,551
He was always trying to impress you.

439
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,354
- You and that damn rabbit.
- Shh...

440
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,953
Shaun, let's go.

441
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,055
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

442
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,497
Get out of here. Run away again!

443
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,728
Go ahead! Run away again!

444
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,071
Now what?

445
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,579
You need to tell them.

446
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,045
If they care about you,
they will understand.

447
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,283
No one will blame you for retiring
after breaking your back.

448
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,526
Nearly paralyzing yourself.

449
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:41,131
My mom worked minimum-wage jobs
her whole life.

450
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,428
Raised an entire family on her own,

451
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,529
and I should tell her I want to quit
the NFL because I don't like it?

452
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,536
Because it's not fun for me?

453
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,408
You think I don't understand what it's like
to need to please your mother?

454
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,653
No matter how hard you work,

455
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:07,086
you still owe something more.

456
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,958
And every good thing
that has ever happened to you

457
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,961
is pure luck.

458
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,625
But...

459
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,166
every bad decision you make...

460
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,671
that's the real you...

461
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,436
and you deserve to suffer.

462
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,205
Your mom called.

463
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,106
Your dad passed thirty minutes ago.

464
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,190
Do you wanna stay for the funeral?

465
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:20,890
No.

466
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,365
I want to go home.

467
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Okay.

468
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,645
You want me to stay for a while?

469
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,347
Talk?

470
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,015
No.

471
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,892
Well, we don't have to talk,
we can just sit.

472
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,431
Or, um, go for a walk.

473
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,505
I'm...

474
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,136
tired.

475
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,913
I should go to sleep.

476
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:15,946
Okay.

477
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,424
Good night.

478
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:01,996
Hey, it's Claire.

479
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,126
Yeah, I know, I, um...

480
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,300
I got a new phone
with a different number.

481
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,805
I changed my mind.

482
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,842
I think we should meet up. Tonight.

483
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,255
- Ma?
- Yes, baby.

484
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,487
I'm here.

485
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,332
There's something I need to tell you.

486
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,011
I am sorry for making you meet me
after hours like this.

487
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,180
I just...

488
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,384
I really needed someone to talk to.

489
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,120
Of course, Claire.
I'm always available for my patients.

490
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,856
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

491
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,721
Shaun?
