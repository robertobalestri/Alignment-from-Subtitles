1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,534
Good morning.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,371
That's your third ding.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,036
Good morning. It's Carly.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,877
She has arrived
at her pathology conference.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,942
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,585
Shaun, you need to text her back.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,525
Her text wasn't a question,
it doesn't require a response.

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,631
True, but it sucks to be left hanging.

9
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,132
You didn't like how it felt when you
thought Carly was ignoring you.

10
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:47,946
"I have received your message." Sent.

11
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:52,852
Mm.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,248
- You made me breakfast?
- Oh, God, no.

13
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,291
I ordered breakfast.
But I managed to keep it warm.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,122
You don't have to do this. I'm fine.

15
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,730
- Did you get any sleep?
- I got enough.

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,395
Her death's not your fault.

17
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,739
She knew the risks, she made a choice
to save her baby.

18
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:22,507
I bet she'd make the same choice again,
even knowing how it would end.

19
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,018
Thank you.

20
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,425
Thanks for breakfast.

21
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,102
We do a complete enucleation
of the right eye,

22
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,665
then replace it
with the temporary implant,

23
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,711
- and in a few weeks...
- Know why blind people don't skydive?

24
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,105
It scares the hell out of the dog.

25
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,454
- Let the doctors finish, okay, bud?
- Yeah, cancer eye out, fake eye in.

26
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,046
Just like last time, I got it.

27
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,523
Check it out.

28
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,694
Moves and everything.
Can't even tell it's fake.

29
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,896
Very cool. Like a bionic superhero.

30
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:19,838
Yeah, my superpower
is tripping over stuff.

31
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,977
- What time is the surgery?
- Three o'clock.

32
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:28,980
Which means I've got six hours left
to blast some aliens.

33
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,427
<i>♪ We've got to bring the resources ♪</i>

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,729
<i>♪ I wanna play it till the time comes ♪♪</i>

35
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,239
If anyone utters the word "Bubble Girl,"
I will transfer to a different hospital.

36
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,935
When you were his age, would you
have faced going blind with humor,

37
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,406
uh, maturity and acceptance?

38
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,534
I would've burned things down.

39
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,804
He's dealing with it in his own way.

40
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,275
We'll check in while you're
taking care of paperwork.

41
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,505
Make sure Charlie knows there's
people he can talk to.

42
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,756
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,390
Dr. Reznick, take Charlie's blood
to the lab.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,225
Dr. Browne, talk to him,
maybe he'll open up to you.

45
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,802
Heart sounds are normal.
No sign of pericardial effusion.

46
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,576
You are the oldest SCID-patient
I am aware of.

47
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,141
People with your condition
usually die very young.

48
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,122
Yay. I win.

49
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,352
Tara, imaging confirms that you have
infected tissue on your right lung,

50
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,518
that's what's causing
your breathing issues.

51
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,039
We're gonna remove it with
a procedure called decortication...

52
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:27,023
And use the thorascopic approach
to decrease risk of infection.

53
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,433
I'll be in an enclosed chamber
in the OR. What else?

54
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,337
I assure you, we'll be taking
every precaution to keep you safe.

55
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,076
Dr. Melendez, this building
is a glorified incubator

56
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,008
for every infection on the planet.

57
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,343
Considering I don't come with an
immune system, I don't need assurances.

58
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,542
I need you to tell me
how you're gonna not kill me.

59
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:49,322
We will administer a course
of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

60
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,450
You will be transported to the OR
under a respiratory hood.

61
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,722
The room will be equipped
with laminar air flow

62
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,888
and kept at a positive pressure
of eight Pascals.

63
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,989
Surgical instruments will be
double-sterilized

64
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,501
- and blood products will be irradiated.
- Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

65
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,102
Visitors will also have to go
through a strict decontamination.

66
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,700
There won't be any.

67
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,212
The less time I spend with people,
the better. Are we done?

68
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,786
How'd your talk with Charlie go?

69
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,150
- He wants to be alone.

70
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,848
- No, you wanna be alone.
- Yet, here we are.

71
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,621
A precocious pre-teen going blind.
That's Claire catnip.

72
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,525
You have to talk to him.

73
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,129
- Did he have any tests scheduled?
- No.

74
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,658
No one's seen, heard, or smelled him.
I'm calling Security.

75
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,412
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

76
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,177
- Where's Charlie?
- Did something happen? Is he okay?

77
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,582
He's in Imaging.

78
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,419
We'll have him back very soon.

79
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,164
He ordered a ride 15 minutes ago.

80
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,290
- To where?
- It's close.

81
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,196
We could have him back
before anyone knows.

82
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,360
Are you insane?

83
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,696
You're right. It's much better
if we go back

84
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,705
and freak out
two already-freaked-out parents.

85
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,742
And explain to Andrews
you didn't do what he asked.

86
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,088
Which emoji was it?

87
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,163
Just send it to me.

88
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:48,939
<i>Ah.</i>

89
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,240
You told me I have to respond.

90
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,743
<i>There is no response to:</i>

91
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,519
Okay, I think Carly's saying
she misses you

92
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,417
and wants to know
that you miss her too.

93
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,284
You know all of that
from one fake face?

94
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,756
Just text her back
something flirty, casual.

95
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,127
Say something like,
"I can't stop thinking about you."

96
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,429
I have stopped thinking about her
many times today.

97
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,092
<i>Do not text Carly that.</i>

98
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,138
<i>I have to go...</i>

99
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Okay.

100
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,692
This popcorn is terrible.

101
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,195
We have to get you back
before your parents worry.

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,627
We're gonna be three years,
five months too late.

103
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,696
The game is a blowout.
So we leave now...

104
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,635
- What's her name?
- What?

105
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,316
I don't know.

106
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,853
The only words I've ever said to
her are, "Can I have a slushy?"

107
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,057
- I just wanted to see her one last time.
- Go say hi.

108
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,058
- Are you crazy?
- I was asking her that earlier.

109
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,360
Tell her you think she's the most
beautiful girl you've ever laid eyes on,

110
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,301
and with your last few hours of sight,
you wanted to see her face.

111
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,318
- As lovely as this is...
- Don't ruin the moment.

112
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,516
The necrotic debris has
encased the visceral pleura.

113
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,223
Follow with the camera,
I don't wanna spring a leak.

114
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:58,196
Tissue's fused her lungs to her
chest wall. I need Kaiser forceps.

115
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,144
Damn it. Tissue's too thick
to fit through the ports.

116
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,876
We need to do a thoracotomy.

117
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,747
Can't open her up
in an air-tight chamber.

118
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,753
If we have to cauterize a bleed,
the whole thing could explode.

119
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,154
We have to take our Bubble Girl
out of the bubble.

120
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,800
Hey! Get your ice-cold lemonade!

121
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,471
We've been gone too long.

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,846
Calm down. It'll take the kid
15 seconds to chicken out.

123
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,250
Or less.

124
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,763
I'm a wuss.

125
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,829
Most kids wouldn't have
gone over at all. Good for you.

126
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,474
- Can I...
- No.

127
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,276
- I'm just...
- No.

128
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,609
- It better be fast.
- What?

129
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,839
We're giving a sad, nearly blind kid
a few more minutes in the sun.

130
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,781
We could get an award for this.

131
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,118
Change gloves every 20 minutes.

132
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,124
We need to be fast but extremely careful.

133
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,831
Knife.

134
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,986
It's a Northern flying squirrel.

135
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,196
They don't fly so much as glide.

136
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,893
- You're lucky it's not infected.
- It's a fascinating species.

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,595
They're uncommonly high-strung
for a nocturnal rodent.

138
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,765
- Is the squirrel in the bag?
- Yes.

139
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,741
- Henry comes everywhere with...
- No, no, no.

140
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,506
I don't need to see him.

141
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,507
Has he bitten you before?

142
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,220
It's my fault. I provoke him.

143
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,517
- Henry's a good boy.
- It's not your fault.

144
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,889
You can't take him from me.

145
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,229
He's not allowed to hurt you.

146
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,357
- Hi. It's 12:47.
- Thank you.

147
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,426
- You're late for your 12:30...
- Mrs. Pryce and I need to have a talk.

148
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,869
It's okay. Henry and I are fine.

149
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,906
Who's Henry?

150
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,952
You hesitated before
cutting her open.

151
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,157
We had to work fast
once I made the incision.

152
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,956
I was running through the procedure
in my head.

153
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,822
There's no shame in needing
to process a tough loss.

154
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,231
Talk to someone.

155
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,136
I'd prefer to focus on my current patient
rather than my last one.

156
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,743
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Dr. Browne, where is my patient?

157
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,012
And before you say "Imaging,"
I know that's not true.

158
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,011
He is with me and Morgan,

159
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,056
he just needed to process
some things... Watch out!

160
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,858
What's going on?

161
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,490
Morgan just missed a turn,
she's a terrible driver.

162
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,689
No. We're on our way back now.

163
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,267
- Hurry.
<i>- Okay.</i>

164
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,710
- How long was I out in the open?
- Thirteen minutes.

165
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,513
We got all of the infected tissue.

166
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,120
That's annoying.

167
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,589
It was necessary to save your life.

168
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,321
- No, I meant your phone.
- Oh. It is.

169
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,318
Bet it's your girlfriend.

170
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,057
How did you know?

171
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,002
Only annoying girlfriends
text so much.

172
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,502
I used to text my boyfriend
all the time.

173
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,964
It annoyed him too.

174
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:33,344
I am supposed to flirt with her
and I don't know how.

175
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,909
Did your boyfriend break up with you
because you were annoying?

176
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,177
No, he died.

177
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,680
That's the downside
of outliving your prognosis.

178
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,258
You outlive everyone else's too.

179
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,359
That is a downside.

180
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,355
Get out your phone.

181
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,428
I'll tell you what to type.

182
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,903
I'm really good at phone sex.
It's the only kind of sex I can have.

183
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,529
We haven't had sex.

184
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,708
- I'll stick to foreplay?
- No, thank you.

185
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,369
Do you text your parents
or are they dead too?

186
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,551
My parents are in Denver.

187
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,579
My dad's job transferred them there.

188
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,458
They always wanted
to live near the snow.

189
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:26,693
They're outdoorsy
and I'm, you know, not.

190
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,298
I'm not close to my parents either.

191
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,373
I have autism and they don't.

192
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,908
I need to listen to your lungs.

193
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,048
I just got really dizzy.

194
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,323
What's going on?

195
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,764
You have an infection.

196
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,636
Temperature is 103.6.

197
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,772
BP is 80 over 50,
she's showing early signs of sepsis.

198
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,976
Start her on a course
of IV immunoglobulin therapy.

199
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,145
- ADA-enzyme replacement and GM-CSF.
- Okay.

200
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,783
I think we can do more
than treat her.

201
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,484
Gene replacement therapy.

202
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,259
We harvest her stem cells
and use a retroviral vector

203
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,126
to transduce her DNA
with the modified ADA gene.

204
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,462
- If it works, she's cured.
- If it doesn't, she dies.

205
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,112
There's a 50 percent chance her body
will have an acute toxic reaction,

206
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,004
- we're going to treat the infection.
- She'll get another infection.

207
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,371
And another, and another, and
eventually, one of them will kill her.

208
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,308
You don't know that,
she's beaten the odds.

209
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,609
By cutting herself
off from the world.

210
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,510
Traditional treatment is the safer course.

211
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,788
He's blowing off steam,
he's with the doctors, he's safe.

212
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,453
He's scared, overwhelmed, and, obviously,
he felt like he couldn't tell us.

213
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,019
You've been keeping him
under lock and key.

214
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,689
I'm protecting him.

215
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,563
We have to stay strong.

216
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,806
Charlie knows you're strong.

217
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,404
And he knows you love him,

218
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,374
but the moment you all heard
the word "cancer,"

219
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,816
everything in Charlie's life changed.

220
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,052
And I think he needs to know
that at some point,

221
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,886
it's going to start to feel
like his life again.

222
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,671
My mom and dad
used to do these things

223
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,210
called spontaneous
family adventure days,

224
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,444
SFADs.

225
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,550
They were pretty lame,
but they let me skip school.

226
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:04,080
We got to go to baseball games,
drive around blaring music.

227
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,026
I got to eat food that was inorganic
and genetically modified.

228
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,924
Sometimes I got to stay up
past midnight.

229
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,373
Now we go to doctor's appointments.

230
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,281
And my mom makes lists and cries.

231
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,151
And my dad's quiet.

232
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,091
Just one more quick stop.

233
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:53,162
- Morgan, Andrews is expecting us to...
- Please, just 20 more minutes.

234
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,768
Fifteen.

235
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,252
Park told me you rejected
his gene therapy idea.

236
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,754
We can't dismiss plausible
treatment options out of fear.

237
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,487
It's not fear.
It's a reasonable degree of caution.

238
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,529
Since when are you cautious?

239
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,833
The benefit of the cure
may be worth the risk.

240
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,532
Let Park take it to her.

241
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,303
No, it's not worth it.

242
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,205
The cure is riskier
in the short term,

243
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,210
but the long-term
upside is much greater.

244
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,839
We can give you the chance
to live a long, healthy, normal life.

245
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,109
No, you can't.

246
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,484
I've been a freak my whole life.
And curing my disease,

247
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:45,514
letting me take a breath of fresh air
is not gonna make me normal.

248
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,858
Increase the oxygen to 15 liters,
start her on the IVIG.

249
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,425
We need to let her rest.

250
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,305
I'm a freak too.

251
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:11,142
People have called me that
because I am not neurotypical.

252
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,018
And I used to be alone,

253
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,889
like you.

254
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,160
Sometimes that was easier

255
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:28,828
because it is hard to be around people
when you're not like them.

256
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,702
But now, I have Dr. Glassman,

257
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,669
and a roommate who is a girl,

258
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,676
and a girlfriend who is only annoying
some of the time,

259
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,544
and I think it is better
than being alone.

260
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,350
If you're cured,

261
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:53,090
you can be outdoorsy
like your parents

262
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,428
or you can stay inside
and have phone sex.

263
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,796
It will be your choice.

264
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,206
The next time you go over my head
will be the last.

265
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,914
Prep her for the gene replacement.

266
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,221
Nice work, Shaun.

267
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,490
No. No way.

268
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,456
He's going blind. It's his last chance
to see a naked woman.

269
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,229
You're a woman. I bet
under those clothes you're a naked one.

270
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
I'm his sister.

271
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,510
I'll slip you 50 bucks.

272
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,256
My budget proposals
for your approval.

273
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,828
Surgical cases for your review
before the board meeting tomorrow night.

274
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,098
Pregnant woman.

275
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,334
How's Neil taking it?

276
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,842
Five minutes, please,
I'm with Dr. Lim.

277
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,371
I see there's a new member
on the clinic team.

278
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,847
- How's that going?
- It's been half a day.

279
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,713
We're working out the kinks.

280
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,490
If it's still smooth sailing
by close of business,

281
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,114
let me know your secret.

282
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,717
I guess that answers
my initial question.

283
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,729
I mean,
he keeps telling me he's fine.

284
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,823
You're the last person he'd tell
if he weren't.

285
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,131
I'd be the second-to-last.

286
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,665
I'm almost done.

287
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,974
You're the president.

288
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,841
He has to listen when you talk,
or pretend to.

289
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,016
The 4-year-old with the ear infection
has been here half an hour,

290
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,315
his mother just pulled
out finger-paints.

291
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,388
You need to go.

292
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,727
Debbie, this is Dr. Lim,
Chief of Surgery.

293
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,827
I know.

294
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,656
It's very impressive. Come back
if you get an ear infection.

295
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,337
- One more.
- No. We're done.

296
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,340
Surgery can't start without me...

297
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,503
Where are we going next?
Yosemite? The Great Wall?

298
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,189
The top of Everest?
It's never gonna be enough.

299
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:30,581
- Claire, stop.
- You can't pack a lifetime of things

300
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,242
you're gonna miss into one day.

301
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,049
Your situation sucks, and it is unfair,
but you know what?

302
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,922
Life sucks, and it's unfair,
and things end before we're ready.

303
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,355
We are going back now.

304
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,072
No.

305
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,769
I'm not gonna have the surgery.

306
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,795
How long before I know
if I've let you talk me

307
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,593
into something really stupid?

308
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,563
You could have an acute
toxic reaction

309
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,466
and die in the next 24 hours.

310
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,702
But we hope to see some positive sign
your body's responding soon.

311
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:37,215
Okay, your transfusion is done,
we'll check on you in a half-hour.

312
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,983
Dr. Murphy?

313
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,849
Would you sit with me?

314
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,837
What do you want to know?

315
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,378
Nothing, I...

316
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,951
I just want someone to be here...

317
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,151
in case I croak.

318
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,686
Hmm.

319
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,629
That's probably all
your annoying girlfriend wants too.

320
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,861
Just to know you're there.

321
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,207
Carly's in good health
and unlikely to die soon.

322
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,412
Some girls have all the luck.

323
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,519
Debbie!

324
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,062
You bellowed?

325
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,222
This thing is broken.
Can you call someone from IT

326
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,663
and send them over, please?

327
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,362
Oh, I meant to tell you
I upgraded our software.

328
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:07,304
- Gonna be faster, more efficient.
- Not if I don't know how to use it.

329
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:10,537
You can't change my
software system without asking me.

330
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,044
I didn't change it,
I upgraded it. There.

331
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:17,675
Or kick out my chief of surgery,
or interrupt my appointments.

332
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,777
You'll be here 20 hours a day
if you don't stick to a schedule.

333
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,013
It's my call.

334
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,221
I'm not here to slap on band-aids
or to write prescriptions.

335
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,920
That woman had serious issues
we needed to discuss.

336
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,190
With the rodent in her purse?

337
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,732
Squirrel.
It's a Northern flying squirrel.

338
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,678
You weren't gonna fix whatever issues
she has with an extra five minutes.

339
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,900
It's my clinic, okay?
I decide how it runs!

340
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,101
Okay.

341
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,370
I thought you wanted me
to be a part of it.

342
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,882
You know, to actually help and to...

343
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,478
make changes, have opinions, but...

344
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:59,123
if that's not what you want,
then I should do what I promised.

345
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,459
I quit.

346
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,360
You're out of sutures.

347
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,684
I'm sorry.

348
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,847
I shouldn't have said any of that.

349
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,290
I lost somebody recently...

350
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,168
and it hurts a lot.

351
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:49,775
And I took it out on you
and that is unfair.

352
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,348
But if you don't have this surgery,

353
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:03,051
you won't ever drink another slushy
at a baseball game,

354
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,614
or feel the wind in your hair
when you speed down the road,

355
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,961
or... Or touch a naked woman.

356
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,630
I know this sucks.
It really, really sucks,

357
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,806
but it will get less sucky.

358
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:30,880
And the part that hurts
so much right now

359
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,884
will start to hurt less.

360
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:41,054
And life goes on,
and you will have wonderful moments

361
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,526
and you will have sucky moments,

362
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,826
and it will be your life.

363
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,927
It'll be a good life, Charlie.

364
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,838
I suspect it might even be a great life.

365
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,979
Oh, thank God!

366
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,114
Sorry it took a while. Car trouble.

367
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,751
Welcome back.
You had some good people very worried.

368
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,762
I'm really sorry.

369
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,928
You guys can ground me forever
for this, but I just...

370
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,730
I just wanted to have
one last day of fun.

371
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,965
We can be fun too. Again.

372
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,075
I was thinking.

373
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,970
It might be time
to re-introduce the SFADs.

374
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:38,709
Baseball games,
concerts, staying up late.

375
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,544
That sounds pretty lame.

376
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,654
We're running a little late.
And we need to get you prepped.

377
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,534
Sorry, I need some 5-0 nylon sutures.

378
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,905
And, apparently, we need to talk.

379
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,272
You can report back to the
chief of surgery that I'm fine.

380
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,579
You don't have to talk to me,
you don't have to talk to her,

381
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,053
but you need to talk to someone.

382
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm not a med student, Aaron.
I've lost patients before.

383
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,989
But not someone who should've lived.

384
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,260
No one would be fine, I wouldn't be.
You're not fine.

385
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,329
If for no other reason than your boss
doesn't think so.

386
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,801
And the bigger problem is
your girlfriend agrees with her.

387
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,993
We'll be there
as soon as you wake up.

388
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,420
We love you so much.

389
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:25,852
I love you too.

390
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,704
- We'll take good care of him.
- Thank you.

391
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,890
You ready?

392
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,189
Yeah.

393
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:21,379
I forgot to take his vitals.
I'm sorry.

394
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,278
Go ahead, I'll bring him out.

395
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,321
- I thought you already took my vi...
- Shut up.

396
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,732
Bringing the patient down now.
Vitals okay?

397
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:50,071
Temp might be a little up
but he's ready now.

398
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,251
I just need you
to count back from 10.

399
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,851
Ten, nine...

400
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,486
eight, seven...

401
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,858
six, five...

402
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,814
You're right.

403
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,681
I'm not fine.

404
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,056
It's okay not to be fine.

405
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,796
You can't blame yourself.

406
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:56,330
I was the one holding the knife,
blame lies with me.

407
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,246
But the responsibility is ours.

408
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,786
- Yours and mine?
- Yes.

409
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,225
You're not objective about me
because of our relationship.

410
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:20,524
If we weren't together, I'm not sure
you'd agree to let me do that surgery.

411
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,599
You honestly believe
I approved a procedure

412
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,105
that I didn't think you could do

413
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,505
- because we're sleeping together?
- No.

414
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,272
You thought I could do it,
that's the problem.

415
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:40,843
I think your personal feelings
may have led you to overestimate me.

416
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,583
You came to me.

417
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:51,056
You sold me the surgery,
told me that you could pull it off.

418
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,561
And now, I'm at fault
because I believed that you...

419
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,398
It's not about fault,

420
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,937
it's about being aware,
so that this doesn't happen again.

421
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,473
It will happen again.

422
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,645
I will make decisions,
you will have bad outcomes.

423
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,207
That doesn't mean
either of us was wrong.

424
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,144
My approval had nothing to do
with our relationship.

425
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,252
We can't know that for sure.

426
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,220
If we weren't dating,
that woman might still be alive.

427
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,068
And we both have to live with that.

428
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,572
Mom? Dad?

429
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,678
- We're here, honey.
- We're right here.

430
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,285
- You did so good.
- We're so proud of you, buddy.

431
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:54,653
Charlie? It's Dr. Reznick.
How are you feeling?

432
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,521
Not awesome.

433
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,496
Are you in any pain?

434
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,894
No. No, I'm okay.

435
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,135
I'll let you rest.

436
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,111
- Wait, Dr. Reznick?
- Yes?

437
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,045
Thank you so much for everything.

438
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,845
You're welcome.

439
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,921
And Dr. Browne.

440
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,687
Dr. Browne, are you here?

441
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,192
T-cell count increased
and your fever dropped to 99.3.

442
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,962
- Your body's fighting the infection.
- So, what does that mean, I'm cured?

443
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,901
It's too early to use
that word exactly.

444
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,336
We'll keep you in isolation
a few weeks,

445
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,635
make sure your immune system
is developing on pace.

446
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:49,339
And there is still a five-to-seven
percent chance of a toxic reaction.

447
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,149
But, yes, the cure
appears to be working.

448
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,214
You should tell your parents
the good news.

449
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,353
What are they gonna do?
Feed me juice through a straw?

450
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,092
They could just be here.

451
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,097
I'm fine.

452
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,931
Let us know if you need anything.
I'll check on you in the morning.

453
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,041
Thank you...

454
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,735
for not killing me.

455
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,379
You're welcome.

456
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,747
There is still a five-to-seven
percent chance of a...

457
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,547

I owe you an apology.

465
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:59,167
I was out of line today,
I was pushing way too hard.

466
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,575
It's not a gift.

467
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,510
Oh.

468
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,010
Is it punishment?

469
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,316
Nurses swear by them.

470
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,484
The arch supports
are supposed to be spectacular.

471
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,124
I'm not coming back to the clinic.

472
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:21,360
It was a bad idea, terribly executed.

473
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,239
Two of the smartest women
I know, my wife,

474
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:36,004
and my new office manager,
think that I need to make some changes.

475
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,846
You wanted to help, you wanted to be
a part of my life, I fought it.

476
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,517
I proposed and then I freaked out.

477
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,647
- We got married...
- You freaked out again.

478
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,419
Yes, I did,
but for a legitimate reason.

479
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,495
There was a gun in the house,
but that's not the point.

480
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:53,896
The point is,
that in the midst of all of this,

481
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:58,063
I took on not one but two jobs
at the hospital.

482
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,729
- Yeah, which you love.
- Not more than you.

483
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,673
Hmm.

484
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,046
Come back to the clinic.

485
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,020
Do I get to boss you around?

486
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:17,888
A little.

487
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,754
Let's go upstairs.

488
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,539
Charlie asked for you.

489
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,550
You connected with him.

490
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,489
I said what I had to,
to get him into surgery.

491
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,613
No.

492
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,319
- You were your old self again.
- My old self...

493
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,459
was always there for everyone.

494
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:07,334
Just giving away pieces of herself
over and over.

495
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,003
Charlie is still blind.

496
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,245
It was a hell of a day.

497
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,453
The blind kid
didn't get me depressed.

498
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,591
You, on the other hand...

499
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,331
