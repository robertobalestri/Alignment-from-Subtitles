00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,697
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor:

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,864
You work together
and you're sleeping together.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,374
You don't see any way
that can go wrong?

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,642
You went out on a limb for me.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,009
Fire me now, you'll look like a fool.

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,674
Doctor Andrews,
you don't have the votes to carry it.

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,875
I don't need the votes.

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,851
Just as you have
the power to fire someone,

9
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,444
- so do I.
- Hear about Han?

10
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,523
Can't imagine Andrews will survive.

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,200
They're gonna need
a new chief of surgery.

12
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,523
Aoki should be calling you any minute.

13
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,930
Here are flowers and chocolates.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,261
- Are you asking me out?
- Yes.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,459
I would love to.

16
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,206
Why are you smiling?

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,407
I don't know.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,575
I just...
I wanted you to know that...

19
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,848
things are okay.

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,789
Good.

21
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,770
I saw a movie last weekend.

22
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,312
Which one?
What kind of movies do you like?

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,609
Oh. This looks delicious. Thank you.

24
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,414
- I said, no pickles.
- Pardon me?

25
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,858
- It's okay, they can just...
- I said, no pickles.

26
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,988
- I am so sorry.
- I said, no pickles!

27
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,995
It was a disaster.

28
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,968
What happened?

29
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,775
Don't you all have work to do?

30
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,212
- Sorry, we...
- Shaun was on a date.

31
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,413
- Mm.
- Congratulations.

32
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,851
You're our first female chief of surgery.

33
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,415
That's nice... Thank you, yes.

34
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,221
And you're still not working.

35
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,158
Not you.

36
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,029
We need to go to HR and break up.

37
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,205
We need a head CT and a trauma panel.

38
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,509
Please! Help my wife!

39
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,857
We've been married for 45 years.

40
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,027
- Two children.
- So far.

41
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,537
- Oh! Stop it!
- Ricky and Tammy.

42
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,969
Ricky's got two kids of his own.

43
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,641
When did you first notice the pain?

44
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,337
- This morning.
- Saturday.

45
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,109
He has a history of kidney stones.

46
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:05,015
- I try to get him to drink water...
- You try? When did I ever say no to you?

47
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,753
Probably another stone,

48
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,380
but we'll rule out anything more serious.

49
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,490
Thank you.

50
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,359
Did you tell them about the kids?
We have two, you know.

51
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,624
So far.

52
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,426
That's nice.

53
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,697
- Not it.
- What?

54
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,763
He's got dementia, it's boring.

55
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,206
Probably stones. Best-case scenario,
kidney tumor.

56
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,804
We've assisted on eight nephrectomies.
Your case, your chart, you're primary.

57
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,382
Kellan's coming,
I need to be out of here,

58
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:39,250
and we are not children,
we don't decide things by who called it.

59
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,252
- You touched the chart first. Did so.
- Did not.

60
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,621
We walked up together,
Petringa handed the chart to you.

61
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,886
- Did not.
- Did so.

62
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,052
- Did not.
- Did so.

63
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,318
Why?

64
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,529
It just wasn't working out.

65
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,067
Oh. Well, I hope it's not because of

66
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,036
Doctor Lim's promotion to
chief of surgery,

67
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,834
that she's your supervisor?

68
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,440
We knew that arrangement
would be unacceptable,

69
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,635
and since we only recently started...

70
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:08,182
You were seeing each other secretly
before you reported it, correct?

71
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:14,282
So maybe you've just gone back
to seeing each other in secret?

72
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:21,421
No. We made the decision that this
opportunity for Doctor Lim is just...

73
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,162
What are you writing?

74
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,756
I have accepted your explanation
and report.

75
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,028
- Thank you.
- But I don't believe it.

76
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,081
You're going to keep seeing each other,

77
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,337
and I can't do anything to stop that,
nor do I want to.

78
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,344
But know this,

79
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,276
love doesn't conquer all,
lust doesn't either,

80
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,509
and like doesn't even come close.

81
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,620
This is gonna be more
complicated than you think.

82
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,787
Looks like you have a large
uterine fibroid that's bled.

83
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,553
It has to be removed surgically.

84
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,651
Yes, routine surgery. You should be fine.

85
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,288
Uterine? Am I gonna be able to have...

86
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,993
The surgery won't affect
your ability to have children.

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,328
I didn't let her finish,

88
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,532
because I anticipated
what she was going to ask,

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,575
because the uterus
has very few functions.

90
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,066
Nicely done.

91
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,971
To improve OR access,
we're going to automatic block release

92
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,746
and implement staggered starts
for anesthesia. Questions?

93
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,913
Doctor Andrews and Han
wouldn't authorize staff overtime.

94
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,753
- Now, our nurses...
- Good point, thank you.

95
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,858
Yes, authorized.

96
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,823
One other thing, and this is for
third-years, but affects all of you.

97
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,733
Traditionally, you don't lead surgeries
until fourth year. That will be changing.

98
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,432
The earlier you take responsibility,

99
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,839
the more you learn.
When the right surgery comes along,

100
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,008
something simple, basic,

101
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,410
it'll be yours. Start prepping.

102
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,748
Maybe I did touch the chart first.

103
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:02,162
Relax, it's okay. I can stay late
now and again, this is my job.

104
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,093
Stop it.

105
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,859
You don't want the case, it's boring,
I get it.

106
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,902
I know you get it.
Boring is now exciting.

107
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,238
Boring means it's a routine surgery,
which means it's a surgery

108
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,399
Lim just said one of us may lead.

109
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,033
This is probably no surgery at all.

110
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,102
Just kidney stones with
a man with dementia.

111
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,607
I'll take that chance.

112
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,240
- You hate people.
- People don't know that.

113
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,653
People like me.
You need to be with your family.

114
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,713
- Kellan barely talks to me...
- It's who touched the chart first, me.

115
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,315
- And as you said...
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

116
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,889
- Yes, Harvey. Is everything okay?
- Why am I in here?

117
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,065
Nothing to worry about.
Likely a kidney stone,

118
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,570
- you just have to...
- Yes! It's cancer.

119
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,468
Nicely isolated, simple surgery.

120
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,565
Perfect for a resident.

121
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,273
Traction on the uterus
to expose the ligament.

122
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll slide the pelvic retractor
under the fundus.

123
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,818
Did wine spill all over you?

124
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,424
- Did it spill all over Carly?
- Stop!

125
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,824
Look above the posterior cul-de-sac.

126
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,031
- Cancer.
- Yes.

127
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,736
Very extensive, I think.

128
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,345
It appears to have metastasized
everywhere.

129
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,018
Liver, kidney, abdominal wall.

130
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,125
Close her up.

131
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,303
I rang the doorbell.

132
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,376
Yes, you did.

133
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,372
Are you gonna spend the rest of your life
in this backyard?

134
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,710
That and lying next to my future wife.

135
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,646
Congratulations. I heard.

136
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,853
What are you going to do professionally?

137
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,423
When people think they're going to die,
like you did,

138
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,328
they assess their life,
reevaluate what's important.

139
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,999
You need to make a difference.

140
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,706
- You have a puppy for me to adopt?
- I have a vacancy at president.

141
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,201
Again?

142
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,572
You're interested.

143
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,339
But you think things have to change,
they don't.

144
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:40,183
You led a meaningful life before cancer,
and you'll lead a meaningful life after.

145
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,424
Well, thank you. I'm very inspired.

146
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,721
Think about it.

147
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,430
Also, sunscreen.

148
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,434
What's going on behind the pancreas at

149
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,441
the root of the
superior mesenteric artery?

150
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,601
- We need a better angle.
- We're not gonna get one.

151
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,209
Not when we're actually operating.

152
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,247
So, what's the solution?

153
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,582
There isn't one, not surgically.

154
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:18,282
We should refer them to an oncologist.
Chemo might help, but I'm not hopeful.

155
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,726
What are you gonna tell them?

156
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,163
You guys are third year.

157
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,598
You want to learn by doing?
How about sympathetic communication?

158
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,162
Shaun,

159
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,761
let the bride know she's dying.

160
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,180
This morning,
who'd you give the Calderon chart to?

161
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,978
- You guys.
- You handed it to one of us.

162
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,522
One of us actually took it. Me, right?

163
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,915
- What does it matter?
You just came up and...

164
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,924
From the right.

165
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,928
I came up on Morgan's left,
you're left-handed?

166
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,828
- It makes sense I would be closer...
- Excuse me?

167
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,498
Any news about my husband?

168
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,634
Harvey,

169
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,674
you remember
Doctors Park and Reznick?

170
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,743
They did your scan.

171
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,847
- Right...
- They were looking for kidney stones.

172
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,043
Unfortunately, we found some cancer.
It's on your left kidney.

173
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,877
- Cancer?
- The good news is,

174
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,683
it's isolated
and in a very operable location.

175
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,153
Cancer? I have cancer?

176
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,825
- We have to tell the children.
- We'll do a biopsy,

177
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,024
but I'm confident we caught it early.

178
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,834
This is terrible. I can't die, I...

179
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,538
You need me.

180
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,307
I know.

181
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,979
With surgery, radiation and
immunotherapy, prognosis is excellent.

182
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:02,185
- You're supposed to talk to our patient.
- They can wait until we're sure.

183
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,359
We are sure. Doctor Melendez is sure.

184
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,230
Doctor Lim told us
we're ready for more responsibility,

185
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,770
so I can make a decision on my own.

186
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,771
I decided to do more research.

187
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,674
Shaun, you need to learn to do this,
and stalling makes it worse.

188
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,350
I think maybe

189
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,079
you're feeling bad about your date,
and you're in here burying yourself

190
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,781
in things you subconsciously think
you can control.

191
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,190
How do people know what's going on
in their subconscious?

192
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,490
What happened, Shaun?

193
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,228
When you jumped up?

194
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,521
Your phone is...

195
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,555
ringing.

196
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,648
It can wait.

197
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,591
- It's your mother.
- It can wait.

198
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,794
What went wrong?
What was the disaster?

199
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,924
She called earlier, too.
If stalling is bad,

200
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,764
then why are you avoiding
your mother's calls?

201
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,439
Did you ever forgive your mother
for not protecting you?

202
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,472
Is that what your mother
wants to know?

203
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,275
My mother was terrible.

204
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,607
It wasn't all her fault, she was bipolar.

205
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,152
That doesn't change the fact
that she was terrible.

206
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,618
I... I don't think
it's good for her to be in my life.

207
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,791
Are you looking for guidance?
From me?

208
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,766
Am I a role model to you?

209
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,607
On some issues, absolutely.

210
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,220
I don't usually think about the past.
It doesn't help.

211
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,296
- But the date?
- Mm.

212
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,700
Yesterday is part of the past,
and the past matters.

213
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,466
What happened?

214
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,811
I... told a joke.

215
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,115
- No.
- Yes. Lea said I should.

216
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,686
No! That is not what I said.

217
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,087
- Does this tie look good?
- Yes, but not with those pants.

218
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,214
And what I was saying was

219
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,658
jokes are the types of things
people do on dates.

220
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,993
They talk about the weather, hobbies,
where they went to college...

221
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,501
I'm a person. Should I change
my pants with you in the room?

222
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:59,028
No. And yes, I know you're a person,
but we have strengths and weaknesses.

223
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,336
Telling jokes is easy.
There are books full of them.

224
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,909
I said, no.

225
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,903
Yes, there are a lot of jokes,

226
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:11,508
but you have to know how to tell them,
you have to know when to tell them.

227
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,917
So I took a gap year before college,

228
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,124
which I think might have been a mistake.

229
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,457
Staying at home...
My relationship with my dad...

230
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:26,590
Caesar walked into a bar and asked
the bartender for a martinus.

231
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,759
The bartender said,
"Do you mean a martini?"

232
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,396
And Caesar says, "If I wanted two,
I would have ordered two."

233
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,536
Did she laugh?

234
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,143
- I'm not sure.
- What did she say?

235
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,749
<i>She made a sound.</i>

236
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,986
A chuckle, I think. That's good.

237
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:59,395
No, it's not. I read six joke books,
and all I got was a "ha-ha."

238
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,060
- It was a disaster.
- Because of a joke?

239
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,264
Something bigger
must have gone wrong.

240
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,603
What happened?

241
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:20,476
A young woman may be dying.
I have a lot of research to do.

242
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,172
- Boom. My chart, my case, my surgery.
- You took it from me.

243
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,607
It touched my fingers, and you took it.

244
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,612
I'm the one holding the chart.
That's evidence we've got.

245
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,424
- If you could prove...
- Angles? We need more angles.

246
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,610
How many cameras do we have?

247
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,386
Doctor Lim, I'm glad you made
that decision on the overtime.

248
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,498
- You're welcome.
- But you'd want to know

249
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,000
the real issue isn't overtime,
it's being understaffed.

250
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,128
We need two more nurses
on this floor, one in ICU...

251
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:15,505
I'm sorry. I'm sure you're right,
but we just don't have the budget.

252
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,369
- Excuse me?
- Nothing, ma'am.

253
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,538
- I gave you OT, you're not being fair.
- Aren't I?

254
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,207
You told me I was right, then told me

255
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,481
you're not gonna do it.
Who's being unfair?

256
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,582
Nobody said this job...

257
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,366
Shaun.

258
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,178
Come with me.

259
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:04,023
Is everything okay? The nurse told us
you didn't finish the surgery...

260
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,521
Suzanne...

261
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,463
you have very extensive cancer

262
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,233
throughout your abdomen.

263
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,738
It appears to be malignant.

264
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:37,580
And it appears to have metastasized
around every organ.

265
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,063
But there's hope with surgery.

266
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,750
We can't see the retrohepatic part
of the cancer because of the liver.

267
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,513
We can't see the retroperitoneal part
because of the kidney.

268
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,111
Yes, I know. That's why we
should take out the organs.

269
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,527
You wanna remove her liver
and right kidney?

270
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,456
Yes, and also her left kidney,
and her pancreas,

271
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,500
and the intestinal tract,
and the stomach.

272
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,196
- Several of those organs are essential.
- We'll put them back.

273
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,334
We remove them, clean up
the cancer, then put them back.

274
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,643
- Ex vivo surgery.
- It's been done for pancreatic cancer.

275
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,445
- Without much success.
- No.

276
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,910
Think it'd work better here?

277
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,287
Not really, but the alternative is death.

278
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,005
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

279
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,876
Good.

280
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,041
Not working?

281
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,649
Yeah. It's been 72 hours
and I still haven't found a job.

282
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:17,051
Relax, I'll be fine. I got some irons
in the fire. What do you need?

283
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,219
How do you say no to a person?
I'm not doing it right.

284
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,021
Okay. Watch closely.

285
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,068
Really?

286
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,835
If you're gonna give up that easily,
quit now.

287
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,116
The biopsy confirmed the cancer
is a renal cell carcinoma.

288
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,093
Cancer? I have cancer?

289
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,762
Yes.

290
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,222
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,966
We did.

292
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,930
The good news is
it's treatable with surgery,

293
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,767
immunotherapy, and radiation.

294
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,038
- We have to tell the children.
- They know.

295
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,407
How do they know?

296
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,012
What's going on?

297
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,614
Am I dying?

298
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,145
- The cancer is serious, but...
- Ruby,

299
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,083
we'd like to talk outside.

300
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,824
I'll be right back.

301
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,559
The problem isn't how you said no,

302
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,568
the problem is how you said yes.

303
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,434
- She seemed happy with the yes.
- It came too quickly.

304
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,178
You made her think she was helping
instead of the other way around,

305
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,301
so she asked for more,
feeling she was entitled.

306
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,738
So I should have said no
when I wanted to say yes?

307
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:53,309
You shouldn't tell her what you want,
tell her what she needs to hear.

308
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,747
It's your job to figure out
what you can give them,

309
00:20:55,821 --> 00:21:00,191
convince them that's what they need,
and then make them feel they owe you.

310
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,459
None of that sounds like me.

311
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,089
And you wanna do the job your way
without changing?

312
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,793
Is that amusing to you? Yes, I do.

313
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,470
Yesterday you were an attending,
today you're chief.

314
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,338
You are a different person.

315
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,070
Want an espresso?

316
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,649
Without surgery, your husband would
probably live another two to five years.

317
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,786
He would have little discomfort,
until close to the end,

318
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,121
and that can be managed.

319
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:37,323
- You said it was treatable.
- It is, but fighting cancer is never easy.

320
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,389
We have to weigh the benefits
against the suffering.

321
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,792
And the surgery itself is...
usually the easiest part.

322
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,637
- He's strong, he's healthy!
- He's not healthy, not mentally.

323
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,176
And the burden on you...

324
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,008
I am not letting my husband die

325
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,706
because caring for him is inconvenient,

326
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,615
because I'm gonna have
to repeat a conversation.

327
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,017
Just go to hell.

328
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,553
This surgery has never been
done for this condition.

329
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,223
We'd be dealing with
every one of your abdominal organs,

330
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,767
and something could go wrong
with any of them.

331
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:19,737
You could be on dialysis
for the rest of your life.

332
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,368
You could have a very
compromised digestive tract,

333
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,243
lifelong diabetes,
you could have liver failure.

334
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,379
- That's not a complete list.
- You could die.

335
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:40,018
And, uh... if we don't do the surgery?

336
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,020
Chemotherapy and radiation,

337
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:45,959
although the likelihood of success
is slim. About 25 percent.

338
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,462
You may prefer hospice care.

339
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,032
You'd probably live maybe a year,
but it'd be a good year.

340
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,686
Could you give us time to think about it?

341
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,084
Of course.

342
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,902
We're supposed to be at lunch.

343
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,801
- We're gonna be late.
- Why?

344
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,603
Why?
Because I need meaning in my life.

345
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,411
Your heart seems fine,
liver seems to be in the right place.

346
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,214
You're a brain surgeon.

347
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,488
You don't think you can get meaning
being a brain surgeon?

348
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,852
This is a boring patient
with boring symptoms.

349
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,959
Shaun, meet Marco Higgins,

350
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,291
he's a mechanic in between jobs.

351
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,303
Three sons, two of whom he hasn't
spoken to in quite some time,

352
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,338
but he's working on that. Open.

353
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,967
Wide.

354
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,940
It's good to get to know people,
Shaun, it makes you a better doctor.

355
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,106
- Say, "Aah."
- Aah.

356
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,483
You have boring symptoms,
that's a good thing.

357
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,987
You do not want exciting symptoms.

358
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,785
You had a date last night,
didn't you?

359
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,020
- Mm.
- I wanna hear about this.

360
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,556
Marco, you wanna hear about this?

361
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,690
- Yes, please.
- Yes, please.

362
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,033
Open.

363
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,000
It was a disaster.

364
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,677
- Thank you, but it's not...
- No, it's polite and chivalrous.

365
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,379
Even though chivalry
is a problematic notion,

366
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,548
- politeness is a good thing no matter...
- Shaun!

367
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:53,757
Are you okay?

368
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,725
- Oh, my.
- I'm okay.

369
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,319
She might not be okay.

370
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,264
- No, I am okay.
- Okay, don't get up.

371
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,164
I'm pretty sure she's okay.

372
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,102
Take off his...

373
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,204
Boots.

374
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,172
What?

375
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,206
Do you think Marco's diabetic?

376
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,740
Based on the color of his skin
in the crease of his neck, I do.

377
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,906
Based on his chart, I do too.

378
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,314
He could have an infection in his feet

379
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,183
and the pain is masked
by diabetic neuropathy.

380
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,918
That infection could be causing
the abdominal symptoms.

381
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,450
Marco, mind taking off your boots?

382
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,712
I was wrong, it's not boring.

383
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,617
I can do it myself.

384
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,583
I'm sure,

385
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,891
but our job here
is to help each other, and...

386
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,321
today, I didn't do that.

387
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,864
I'm trying to make up for that
with a jar of pickles.

388
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,438
I overstepped and...

389
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,737
undercut you
in front of the patient's wife.

390
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,646
I accept your apology.

391
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,642
What I should have done...

392
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,284
was privately tell you
you're wrong.

393
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,357
- Give me the jar.
- And let you, as lead,

394
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,359
tell them that this
surgery's a bad idea.

395
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,421
Because we should let a 70-year-old man
die of a treatable condition?

396
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,935
Because we shouldn't condemn
a man to years of confusion and fear.

397
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,130
His life still has value.

398
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,532
Seriously?

399
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,000
He has memory issues,
he's not a vegetable.

400
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,644
He's funny, he's charming,

401
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,648
they've lived a life together.

402
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,678
He brings happiness to his wife,
to his children.

403
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,318
- He's happy.
- Exactly.

404
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,687
Let him stay happy
for whatever time he has left.

405
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,204
Nurse Petringa?

406
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,946
- I'm sorry if I overstepped.
- I didn't track you down for an apology.

407
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,179
You're gonna get additional staff?

408
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,513
No.

409
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,357
If I get you additional staff,
you lose hours, overtime.

410
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,155
So you're doing us a favor

411
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,492
by making sure
we never see our families?

412
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,397
Your problem isn't the staff,
your problem is the actual work.

413
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,197
The crap part of work that takes
too long and too many of you.

414
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,672
I authorized purchase
of two Hoyer patient lifts

415
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,403
and a mechatronic ICU bed.

416
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,276
A smart bed?

417
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:06,515
- Ha. Those are supposed to be fun.
- Gotta promise to let me try it.

418
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,113
You got it.

419
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,785
Doctor Lim?

420
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,591
Thank you.

421
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,359
You owe me.

422
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm well aware
of what he'll be going through.

423
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,792
My sister had cancer.

424
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,869
The chemo, the radiation...

425
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,367
They beat the crap out of her,
didn't they?

426
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,411
Yeah.

427
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,448
Now imagine going through that

428
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,608
and not understanding, every day.

429
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,520
The throwing up
and not knowing why.

430
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,322
Losing your hair and not knowing why.

431
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,460
Learning he has cancer,

432
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,468
and being devastated by it,
day after day.

433
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,663
- But at the end...
- There are no guarantees.

434
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,272
He's old
and his body's breaking down.

435
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,740
His mind is breaking down...

436
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,587
and it's gonna end,
no matter what we do.

437
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:27,329
In 45 years, I have never once lied to him.

438
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:36,470
When memory goes,
all that's left is emotion.

439
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,971
What we've learned doesn't matter,

440
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,673
what we had for lunch,
where we went for vacation,

441
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,611
none of it matters.

442
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,581
But how we feel...

443
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,293
who we're close to...

444
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,664
He's the same man I've always loved.

445
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,831
The same sense of humor,

446
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,206
same everything.

447
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,800
He hasn't changed.

448
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,642
And what I owe him...

449
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,474
hasn't changed.

450
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,685
- Have you decided?
- Not yet.

451
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,354
Take your time,
there is no urgency...

452
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,919
What are you waiting for?

453
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,033
Doctor Murphy, they are facing
an impossible choice.

454
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,329
But they have to make it.

455
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,838
What additional information
are you waiting for?

456
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,570
- Shaun...
- I'll be a better doctor

457
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,941
- if I understand the patient.
- True, but right now,

458
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,674
- your skills are secondary...
- Are you debating whether

459
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:53,185
you should find somebody else
to fall in love with?

460
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,450
- Someone healthy?
- No. No, of course not.

461
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,690
You should be.

462
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,355
We're kids.

463
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,698
You shouldn't have to spend the rest
of your life taking care of an invalid.

464
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,098
You think that's the issue?

465
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,800
Me? A burden on me?

466
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,441
- This is so much easier on me than you.
- No, it's not.

467
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,309
Whatever happens to me
is gonna happen...

468
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,483
and I have to live with it.

469
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,492
You...

470
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,455
You have a choice.

471
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,569
In sickness and in health.

472
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,974
That was the commitment I made...

473
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,007
this morning.

474
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,814
Now, if this had
happened yesterday...

475
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:10,924
So it's not that difficult
a decision, then, right?

476
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,034
I guess not.

477
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,895
I can feel her humeral head
outside the glenoid fossa.

478
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:53,500
It's an anterior dislocation.
I can reduce that.

479
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,368
- Here?
- Yes, with traction and external rotation.

480
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,346
Oh. Oh.

481
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,481
Oh, my, that feels better.

482
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,083
- I bumped you.
- No, don't worry.

483
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,653
It happens.
I wasn't watching either.

484
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,394
Come on.

485
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,293
That's it?

486
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,393
You bumped into
a very understanding woman,

487
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,995
you amazingly caught
a bottle of wine...

488
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,037
Where was the disaster?

489
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,877
Unclamp the superior mesenteric
to perfuse the organs.

490
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,924
The small intestines
look dusky and cyanotic.

491
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,920
We need to resect
all the necrotic segments.

492
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,364
Claire, find the first viable part
of the ilium and clamp proximal to it.

493
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,911
I don't think your
irons in the fire are very hot.

494
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,918
Any job interviews you get,

495
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,545
you're gonna spend
a large chunk of time trying to explain

496
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,557
why you lasted less than a year
as president at Saint Bonaventure.

497
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,588
I mean, how do you put a positive spin

498
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,957
on why you spent a fortune
on a chief of surgery

499
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,055
you fired weeks later
to protect a second-year resident?

500
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,394
- You think I made a mistake?
- No, I think you did the right thing.

501
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,666
I admire you.
Which is why I wanna do you a favor.

502
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,108
You need to prove
you haven't burned bridges.

503
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,238
Which means you have to come back
to work at Saint Bonaventure.

504
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,383
As what?
As a surgeon, working for you?

505
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,446
And the fact that you're in need
of a surgical attending

506
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,753
to replace yourself is a coincidence?

507
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,521
It's what you need.

508
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,129
I admire the effort...
but don't con a conman.

509
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,171
Your greatest strength
and greatest weakness

510
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,215
as a leader was your stubbornness.

511
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,147
Don't let it be a weakness today.

512
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,290
My back hurts, on the left side.

513
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:29,127
That's where you had your biopsy.
It's gonna hurt.

514
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,321
What biopsy?

515
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,627
Harvey, you came in because
you thought you had kidney stones.

516
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,159
We did some imaging
and you don't...

517
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,535
What is it? What... what's wrong?

518
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,707
What's going on, Ruby?

519
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,441
Why isn't anybody saying anything?

520
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,646
Am I dying?

521
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:56,954
Ruby?

522
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,324
I... I can't die,

523
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:03,827
I need to take care of you.
I can't...

524
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,397
They didn't find stones.

525
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,529
Everything is okay.

526
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,673
The pain will go away.

527
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,239
We're gonna go home tonight.

528
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,414
- Okay? Okay.
- Mm-hm.

529
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,405
I had a nice time.

530
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,802
That's it?

531
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,141
- It's over?
- Where's the disaster?

532
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,276
I've listened to an hour of this,

533
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,438
I was promised a disaster.
Where's the disaster?

534
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,242
It was exhausting.

535
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,783
Everything was always out of control.

536
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,587
Anything could happen at any time.
Anything did.

537
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,124
There was too much to remember to do,

538
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,605
too much to remember not to do,
and none of it made sense.

539
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,568
It was hard,
uncomfortable, unpleasant.

540
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,613
I spent the whole evening
doing unnatural things

541
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,615
to make her happy,
and I have no idea if she was happy,

542
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:08,016
and I know I wasn't happy!

543
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,354
It was all a disaster.

544
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:29,201
I want you to meet our new attending,
Doctor Marcus Andrews.

545
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,302
Pleasure to meet you.

546
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,514
How long have you been working here?

547
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,912
- Ms. McDougal?
- She didn't ask for ID.

548
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,685
It's policy.
We take a lot of immigrants here.

549
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,660
She also didn't look at me.
Check the symptom I told her I had.

550
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,062
"Cut over the left eye."

551
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,899
You heal very nicely, Ms. McDougal.

552
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,929
You hate it here.

553
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,901
Hate is a strong word.

554
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,431
What would you do differently?

555
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,934
Give me five things.

556
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,036
Diabetes clinical educator,
on-site lab and X-ray,

557
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:13,107
mental health advisor, multidisciplinary
care team, electronic medical records.

558
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,016
We had the clinic at the hospital,

559
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,587
and had to shut it down
because it was a money pit.

560
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,949
Come back as president,
and we'll reopen it.

561
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,524
Your office can be in the clinic.

562
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,701
Do I have to wear a tie?

563
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,676
Hey.

564
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,243
Welcome back.

565
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:46,175
- Am I okay?
- The surgery went very well.

566
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,948
We're confident
that we got all of the cancer.

567
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,187
There's a bag by her side.

568
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:58,594
- Is that just to drain stuff post-surgery?
- There were complications.

569
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,188
We had to remove
a large portion of your bowel

570
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,735
and divert the waste
through a stoma in your skin.

571
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,269
That's an ileostomy bag.

572
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,136
How long will I have that?

573
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,603
Forever.

574
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,970
So I have to go to the bathroom
in this thing for the rest of my life?

575
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,813
Yes.

576
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,850
We'll teach you how to change it,
how to dispose of it.

577
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,111
They'll teach both of us.

578
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,299
You know,
this is why we do it, Shaun.

579
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,373
Every date is a disaster,
every relationship is out of control.

580
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,868
But if you stick with it,

581
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,303
you wind up with someone
in your life

582
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,473
who will help you
when you need to be helped,

583
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,314
love you when you do not feel lovable,

584
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,652
be with you no matter what.

585
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,290
It's not worth it.

586
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Hi, Mom.

587
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,996
My son's coming to town.
Think I'll pick him up at the airport.
