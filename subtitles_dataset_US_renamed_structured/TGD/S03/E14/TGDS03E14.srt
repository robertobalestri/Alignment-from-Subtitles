1
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,650
- What?
- It's time to wake up.

2
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:20,779
- Mm-mm. It's still dark outside.
- I'd like to have sex.

3
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,054
As romantically as that was put,
it's too early, Shaun.

4
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,296
It's exactly early enough to have sex

5
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,197
for the average duration it takes us,

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,498
and still allow precisely enough time
to get ready for work.

7
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,241
How long have you been up
figuring that out?

8
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,005
Since 4:53,
but it only took two minutes.

9
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,446
And you've been waiting since then
to propose this?

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,419
I let you sleep as long as possible.

11
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,356
That's...

12
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,061
very considerate.

13
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,460
Oh.

14
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,578
Sorry I'm late.

15
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,453
- I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
- Kayley has a sore throat.

16
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,068
More like this feeling

17
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,570
like there's something stuck
in my throat,

18
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,156
and I fainted a couple times,
which I first thought was just random,

19
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,062
and obviously losing my voice.

20
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,794
Since I've only just met you,

21
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,632
I have no idea what your voice
normally sounds like.

22
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,737
Not this.

23
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,940
And sometimes when swallowing
I get a super intense pain, like...

24
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,668
worse than an ice cream headache.

25
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,646
My internist sent me
to an ear, nose and throat guy,

26
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,013
an orthopedic surgeon, um,

27
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,746
three gastroenterologists, uh,

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,484
- voice issues specialist dude.
- An otolaryngologist.

29
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,527
A neurosurgeon who thinks it might be

30
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,462
a messed-up nerve
connecting the throat to the brain.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,022
The ninth cranial nerve,
glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

32
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,467
- He recommended brain surgery.
- Microvascular decompression.

33
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,796
Which a second neurosurgeon
said I don't need.

34
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,103
You're not happy with the answers
you're getting

35
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,942
from a bunch of recommended
specialists,

36
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,505
so you came to the ER?

37
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,550
I ran out of recommended specialists.

38
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,986
Hmm. It is an intriguing combination
of symptoms.

39
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,489
We'll admit you and run some tests.

40
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,449
Uh, Dr. Murphy?

41
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,621
You're...

42
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:44,864
interesting.

43
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,293
I have autism.

44
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,334
That's so cool.

45
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,528
I mean, no,
it's not cool that you are...

46
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,469
Be more insensitive, Kayley.

47
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,444
Um... It's cool that you're this...

48
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,710
totally chill,
super knowledgeable medico.

49
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,950
Compliments...

50
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,047
are very awkward.

51
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,589
Cute doctor who's going to cure me.

52
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:21,059
Severe abdominal discomfort,
fever, tachy, hypotensive.

53
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,066
- It's okay, sweetie.
- What's your name?

54
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,707
That's Marla.

55
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,601
No one to leave her with.

56
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,007
I'm going to take care
of your mommy.

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,674
Abdomen tender and distended.

58
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,116
Dehydrated.

59
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,979
Delayed capillary refill.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,011
Rapid respiratory rate.

61
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,490
Skin cool and bluish, looks cyanotic.

62
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,187
- Going into shock.
- We need aggressive fluid resuscitation!

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,571
Start broad spectrum antibiotics.

64
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,273
Place an NG to decompress
distended abdomen.

65
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,028
Trend her lactates
and initiate complete sepsis bundle.

66
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,943
Her CBC, BMP, autoimmune panel,
nasal swab, and blood cultures,

67
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,119
all normal.

68
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,513
Oh. That's exciting.

69
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,650
Negative tests are exciting?

70
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,421
No one's been able to find out
what she has.

71
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,523
I'm going to get brain FIESTA
and time-of-flight MRI

72
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,830
to assess the cranial nerves
and vessels, and doppler ultrasound to...

73
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,797
I have to get back to work.

74
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,966
Our pre-dawn romantic interlude
made me late.

75
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,904
Yes, there was a flaw
in my methodology.

76
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,974
My calculation was based
on the mean duration

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,412
of our sex overall,

78
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,942
but generally we take statistically
significantly longer in the morning...

79
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,044
than at other times of day.

80
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,181
Well, maybe we can discuss

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,953
this whole timing-our-sex thing
at lunchtime.

82
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,290
Mm. No, thank you.

83
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,431
I can't have lunch today.

84
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,424
Too much to do.

85
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,198
Sorry, I'm late.

86
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,575
I was going to cancel our lunch.

87
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,809
Let me guess.

88
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,004
A patient more interesting than me.

89
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,813
Exactly.

90
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,014
Yeah.

91
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,516
She has a mysterious condition,

92
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,877
but I realized I could use our lunch
to help understand it.

93
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,979
- I ordered you a salad.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,592
How do I get an ice cream headache?

95
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,193
I've never had one.

96
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,895
You don't want one.
Brain freeze is horrible.

97
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,296
The scientific term
is sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia.

98
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,468
The trigeminal nerve reacts to rapid
temperature change in the mouth,

99
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,620
sending a signal to the brain,

100
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,239
which responds with changes
in blood flow and dural irritation,

101
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,977
which combat what it perceives
as a dangerous noxious stimuli,

102
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,813
but is just ice cream.

103
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,846
I need to experience that.

104
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,722
Okay.

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,358
The technique I usually use
is eat way too much, way too fast.

106
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,130
I'm quitting my job.

107
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,667
The job you came back
from Hershey for?

108
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,173
Don't tell Glassy,
he already thinks I'm a flake.

109
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,140
You kicking me out
is just what I needed.

110
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,636
I was in a complete rut.

111
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,717
In my personal life, at work,
super stale.

112
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,718
We weren't developing anything,

113
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,913
just market-testing designs.

114
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,252
Ow. Ow.

115
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,189
Ow, ow.

116
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,751
- That's awful! What's the cure?
- Time.

117
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,591
- How much time?
- Depends.

118
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,530
Do you think I should include my job
in Hershey on my resume?

119
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,536
It hurts so much!

120
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,700
Or does it make me look like
I'm not able to commit to anything?

121
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,867
Ow!

122
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,877
Okay.

123
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,746
The ultrasound showed your colon
is distended.

124
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,944
We've placed a rectal tube and an NG
to try and get that decompressed.

125
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,816
- Mommy, can we go home?
- Not yet, sweetie.

126
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,686
It'd be helpful to find out
what could have triggered this.

127
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,489
Any history of Crohn's
or ulcerative colitis?

128
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,594
No.

129
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,723
I, um...

130
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,891
I have had some UTIs lately.

131
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,832
- That's likely not connected.
- Okay.

132
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,734
Diverticulitis?
Any recent international travel?

133
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,602
I have a 3-year-old and no husband.

134
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:24,440
Okay, we're going to need to keep you
on IV antibiotics, monitor the distention.

135
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,242
In the meantime, is there anyone
who can look after Marla?

136
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,647
No one.

137
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,309
My whole family's back East.
It's just us.

138
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,817
I'll get a social worker
to look after her.

139
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,089
Thank you.

140
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,230
Go ahead, honey.

141
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,513
Why is my mom upset?

142
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,387
If her anterior inferior
cerebellar artery

143
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,516
is encroaching on her glossopharyngeal
nerve, it's very minor.

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,857
Certainly not enough to justify
microvascular decompression surgery.

145
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,694
I agree. It could also be
acid reflux, temporal arteritis,

146
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,769
laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia.
We need to...

147
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,830
We need to do $50,000 of tests
and it might be acid reflux?

148
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,000
Or temporal arteritis, or...

149
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,840
It's a constellation
of relatively insignificant symptoms.

150
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,904
Have you ever had
an ice cream headache, Dr. Andrews?

151
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,714
Yes, I believe it didn't require
brain surgery, Dr. Murphy.

152
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,556
As a compromise, we could do an MRI,
and CT her neck,

153
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,893
- and a swallow study...
- Shaun.

154
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,529
You don't compromise with your boss.

155
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,022
Start her on Dilantin for her pain
and send her home.

156
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,506
Can't I leave her with you?

157
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,341
I'm a receptionist,
not a social worker.

158
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,904
And I'm a surgeon.

159
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,583
I didn't mean I'm more important,

160
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,381
I just meant we both have
more important things to do.

161
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,032
When will the social worker be here?

162
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,888
- Half an hour.
- Can you page her again?

163
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,687
I want my momma.

164
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,619
Why don't you play with the toys?

165
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,925
Do you have her number?
I'll call her myself.

166
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,426
I made Mommy sick.

167
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,397
No, sweetie, it's not your fault,
sometimes people just get...

168
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,704
Mommy drawk my poop.

169
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,843
- Your mommy drew your poop?
- No.

170
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,711
Drawk! Mommy drawk!

171
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,944
- Drank?
- Yes.

172
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,887
Mommy drawnk my poop.

173
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,626
The good news is we've ruled out
glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

174
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,095
You don't need brain surgery.

175
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,464
Never good news without bad news.

176
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,935
We've got a list of a few things
you don't have,

177
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,628
but we don't know what you do have.

178
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,771
- So you'll run more tests.
- We can't.

179
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,012
There are 21 different things
this might be,

180
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,981
but they don't want us
to run 37 more tests.

181
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,448
Well, this is lame. I can afford
the tests, I make good money,

182
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,919
I can't keep talking like this!

183
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,026
I need a...

184
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,325
She's hypotensive! Code stroke!

185
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,201
We need stat brain CT and MRI.

186
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,503
Call Angio, she may need
mechanical thrombectomy.

187
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,347
Three cc's of two percent lidocaine.

188
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,541
Wow.

189
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,024
I didn't drink it. I just...

190
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,217
I just used her stool
to do a home fecal transfer.

191
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:38,025
- And you didn't think to mention that?
- You said my UTIs were unrelated.

192
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,964
They didn't get better
with antibiotics,

193
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,970
so I did exactly
what I was supposed to do.

194
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,530
The video swore
that it was completely safe.

195
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,968
<i>Make sure your friend
is completely healthy.</i>

196
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,978
<i>I've had the best results with vegans.</i>

197
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,605
<i>Though if it were between
an 18-year-old carnivore</i>

198
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,479
<i>and a 60-year-old vegan,
well, don't make me choose.</i>

199
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,247
<i>Now we're gonna
add the saline solution.</i>

200
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,785
<i>Should be a one-to-one match,
more or less.</i>

201
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,358
<i>Then...</i>

202
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,494
<i>we're gonna puree...</i>

203
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,290
<i>puree, and then puree some more.</i>

204
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,627
<i>While it's mixing...</i>

205
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,793
<i>let's talk enema bags.</i>

206
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,806
Marla must have seen her
using the blender...

207
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,377
- assumed she drank it.
- Yeah, that's the mystery.

208
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,879
Not how anyone this stupid
is still alive.

209
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,505
It's not completely irrational.

210
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,613
The <i>E. coli</i> strain in drug-resistant UTIs
can hide out in the gut.

211
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,553
Repopulating the colon microbiome
using FMT

212
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,885
has shown some success.

213
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,558
In a hospital, under controlled
and sterile conditions.

214
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,422
Prep her for surgery.

215
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,225
Between dilation and rigidity,
there may be colon perforation.

216
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,833
And test Marla's stool for toxins
and infectious bacteria.

217
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,672
She was suffering a mini-stroke
and I saved her.

218
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,743
I saved her. I need to celebrate.

219
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,364
Outside?

220
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:59,938
I want to celebrate
by kissing you. A lot.

221
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,277
Inside would be inappropriate.

222
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,815
Eagle Syndrome is very rare.

223
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,357
A longer-than-normal styloid bone
coming off the base of the skull.

224
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,790
I only get a five-minute break.

225
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,554
It impinged on her nerves,

226
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,430
causing the confusing symptoms
that baffled eight expert doctors,

227
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,435
and then when she turned
her head suddenly,

228
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,131
it pinched her carotid,
causing her TIA.

229
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,663
Yeah, it's him!

230
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,206
It's Dr. Murphy!

231
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,479
How do I know you?

232
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,982
He is cute!

233
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,784
Is that his girlfriend?

234
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Kayley's hotter.

235
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,887
He's so cute.

236
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,908
My personal...

237
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,869
Chernobyl.

238
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,305
Seriously... Guys... Oh, come on!

239
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,901
A zone of exclusion
should be imposed around my kitchen.

240
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,047
Millions of people have watched that?

241
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,616
As of 9 a.m.

242
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,609
You're an influencer.

243
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,655
And you posted how I saved you?

244
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,021
But I take it I'm not yet,
you still have to operate.

245
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,988
A normal styloid process
is 2.5 centimeters in length.

246
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,053
Yours measures... Don't do that.

247
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,057
There are two surgical options.

248
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,737
Transoral, where we go in
through your mouth.

249
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,272
It's non-invasive
but creates surgical challenges

250
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,366
for physical and visual access.

251
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,240
The alternative transcervical procedure

252
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:42,042
involves an incision in your neck,
with none of those access issues,

253
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,549
but with some
post-operative scarring.

254
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,677
So one way is safer
but the other I'll look better?

255
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,279
It's a pretty badass scar.

256
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,749
Can I take a bit to decide which?

257
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,859
Of course.

258
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,795
You had no right to tell the world
about me.

259
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,102
- It was flattering.
- Not everyone wants to be famous.

260
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,970
If it's any consolation,

261
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,474
you've had over 70 marriage proposals.

262
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,236
It's not.

263
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,378
Some of us are more comfortable
in the spotlight than others.

264
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,945
I think you're great.

265
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,313
Thanks.

266
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,694
I don't have to poop.

267
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,458
Be patient.

268
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,702
I don't have to poop!

269
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,573
Is there something your mom does
to help when you can't go?

270
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,306
Sometimes she hold my hand.

271
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,705
Would you like me to?

272
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,306
You're not my mom.

273
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,510
Well, just keep trying.

274
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,653
Sweetie, we really need you to go.

275
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,363
If you can't, there is another way
we can do this.

276
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,365
How?

277
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,629
Uh, it's not fun...

278
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,496
for either of us.

279
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,010
Isolate and divide
middle colic artery and vein.

280
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,972
It's an epidemic.

281
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,773
People taking online medical advice.

282
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,784
It's not the problem, it's the symptom.

283
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,343
Medical care's a financial stress
for lots of people.

284
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,857
Not to mention physician arrogance,
incompetence, impatience.

285
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,492
So it's our fault?

286
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,154
Resect and cut colon proximal and
distal to the perforation with GIA stapler.

287
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,492
A friend of a friend self-diagnosed
her own Cushing's disease online

288
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,766
after a series of doctors
barely listened to her,

289
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,534
told her to get more rest.

290
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,176
Guessing she didn't then perform
do-it-yourself brain surgery at home.

291
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,374
Claire's right.

292
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,344
I was supporting your point.

293
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,912
She convinced me I was wrong.

294
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,517
Divide mesentery with LigaSure.

295
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,496
We have a bleed. It's major.

296
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,396
Tension during mobilization
must have caused a splenic capsule tear.

297
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,797
Need to do a splenectomy.
Cut connecting attachments.

298
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,532
- Kidney.
- Diaphragm.

299
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,484
Take the vascular pedicle
with a white load stapler.

300
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,170
Do not get the tail of the pancreas.

301
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,848
Dr. Melendez?

302
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,857
- Can this wait?
- I'm not sure.

303
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,086
The fecal sample your team sent me,

304
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,424
it might be normal,
but was it mislabeled?

305
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,760
It seems to be from a
70-year-old.

306
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,389
It's from a 3-year-old.

307
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,602
SCFAs, elevated isobutyric
and isovaleric acid.

308
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,474
She's at high risk
for serious cardiac problems.

309
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,374
Her social media posts have gone viral.

310
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,248
I've got reporters clamoring to speak
to the twice-exceptional Dr. Murphy.

311
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,183
Bad idea. Luckily he won't do it.

312
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,005
He went off on Kayley
about his privacy.

313
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,814
Publicity would be
good for the hospital.

314
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:47,257
I'm sure Dr. Glassman
can make him see the wisdom of that.

315
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,225
I'm with Andrews.

316
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,974
It smacks of patting ourselves
on the back.

317
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,094
Could also come off as exploitative.

318
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,827
But the bigger issue is
it could blow up in our face.

319
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,062
Shaun's a complete communications
wild card.

320
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,263
Who knows what he'll say

321
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,966
about you, about me,
about being demoted, about screw-ups.

322
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,407
- We'd coach him.
- Do we have six years

323
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,910
before they need to go to press?

324
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,537
I can go with him, manage the situation.

325
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
No, no, no.

326
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,513
If we consider Shaun an asset,

327
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,347
we shouldn't treat him like a liability.

328
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,514
I'll talk to him. See what he says.

329
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,128
You can see the proximity
of her elongated styloid

330
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,663
to the nerves and carotid.

331
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,494
The trick is to break off excess length

332
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,693
without injury
to local neurovascular structures.

333
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,997
Well, if done trans-cervically,
entry point is key.

334
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,165
Minimizes risk of a marginal
mandibular nerve injury.

335
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,641
- Has she made a decision?
- Not yet.

336
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,867
I'd like to lead.

337
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,978
Being that it's a rare surgery, I may not
get another chance at it during residency.

338
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,041
When I have the benefit
of supervision.

339
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,211
And it wouldn't have anything to do with

340
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,312
hoping Kayley might then
post about you?

341
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,254
- Not at all.
- Undoubtedly, a little.

342
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,951
Given the attention this has drawn,

343
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,996
I think we should put our best,
most experienced choice forward.

344
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,825
This is a teaching hospital...

345
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,234
it's exactly the type of surgery
we'd give to a third year,

346
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,964
the fact that she has
an online presence shouldn't be a factor.

347
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,098
And yet here you are,
the chief of surgery,

348
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,267
working a case you say
a third year can handle.

349
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,004
It might reflect well on this place

350
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,411
to have a young woman
be the face of Kayley's surgery.

351
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,842
Assuming it goes well.

352
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,182
Live by the Internet, die by the Internet.

353
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,021
Still want to lead?

354
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,090
Yes.

355
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,558
It's yours.

356
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,121
Ann?

357
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,481
Ann.

358
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,190
- Am I okay?
- You're fine.

359
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,970
We had to wake you up earlier
than we'd like

360
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,800
because we need to discuss
something with you. Do you understand?

361
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,608
Your gut biome showed markers
for elevated cholesterol.

362
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,468
Which you don't have.
Your daughter does.

363
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,648
Marla has high cholesterol?

364
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,284
She has a genetic condition,
hyperlipidemia.

365
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,480
Coronary testing showed 90 percent

366
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,491
narrowing of the left main artery
to her heart.

367
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,586
I'm afraid your daughter needs
urgent heart surgery.

368
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,470
I don't want to.

369
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,471
Okay.

370
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,906
I'll tell the reporters that,
but can...

371
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:24,909
Can we talk about why?

372
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,470
Your computer just beeped.

373
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:28,546
I know.

374
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,373
I can think of a few reasons
why you might be reticent.

375
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,564
- You're shy.
- No, I'm not.

376
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,315
Well, you do have trouble
with social interactions,

377
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,118
and you have trouble anticipating

378
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,682
what people might ask
and how you might respond.

379
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,355
Yes, that is a problem
when I'm meeting with a patient,

380
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,366
or I'm at a job interview,
or I'm on a date.

381
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,867
Then my answers matter.

382
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,699
But if I'm talking to a reporter,
they don't matter. It beeped again.

383
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,433
I know, we're digitizing.

384
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,170
Every time a patient needs to take a drug,
we send a reminder.

385
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,339
For some unknown reason
they keep sending me one too.

386
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,938
I think stories do matter.

387
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,280
I think what you do
and what you have done

388
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,787
might be inspirational
for people to hear.

389
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,184
- Okay.
- Okay, you'll do it?

390
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:15,092
Okay, you've convinced me
I should be nervous.

391
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,719
Now I have two reasons not to do it.

392
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,957
- What's the other reason?
- I'm busy.

393
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,398
Between doing my job and having sex,
I don't have a lot of free time.

394
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,395
You should hire Lea.

395
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,267
- No.
- Yes.

396
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,208
She's very good at tech,

397
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,712
and isn't happy in her job right now.

398
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,417
I'll tell you what, Shaun.

399
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,079
You think about this,
you really think about

400
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,281
how your story can benefit people,

401
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,990
and I will...

402
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,720
interview Lea.

403
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,788
Excellent.

404
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,927
I'll think about it.

405
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,893
I'll really think about it.

406
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,971
Okay.

407
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,616
Some people definitely thought

408
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,777
I would look amazeballs rocking
a neck scar,

409
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,343
but the consensus was

410
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,446
there's only so many turtleneck days
in a year.

411
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,083
So I'm going
with the no-scar approach.

412
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,654
Which one did you vote for?

413
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,428
Well, these are my people,
I mean, they know me,

414
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,297
they know what's best for me
and my brand.

415
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,668
- Wisdom of the crowd.
- My warrior goddess lead surgeon.

416
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,307
We'll get you prepped.

417
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,110
New blouse? It's nice.

418
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,276
Dr. Murphy, do you have a minute?

419
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,551
I really am sorry I upset you...

420
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,986
and I really am grateful.

421
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,022
Being sick was...

422
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,894
You don't need to explain

423
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,968
why you're grateful
we diagnosed your illness.

424
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,401
Well, I do.

425
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,530
You saved me and my career.

426
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,575
At first, my followers
were into what I was going through,

427
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,170
but after a while...
you just start being "the sick girl."

428
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,512
You give up your privacy,
doesn't that bother you?

429
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,314
I have nothing to hide.

430
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,652
No one should.

431
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,082
We should all just be who we are.

432
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,658
We are...

433
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,091
the decisions we make...

434
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,204
and you let other people
make them for you.

435
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,108
So you're not being anyone.

436
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,557
You know how you and I
like to do things together?

437
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,526
- We make clay mugs.
- That's right.

438
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,355
Mommy was sick, and...

439
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,554
she needed to be fixed...

440
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,956
and you're sick too.

441
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,759
- I don't feel sick.
- That's good.

442
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,570
The doctors just want to make sure
everything's all better before you do.

443
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,773
How?

444
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,107
- They're gonna go inside you, and...
- How?

445
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,545
- They're gonna make a little cut...
- No.

446
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,613
- You're gonna be asleep...
- No.

447
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,447
- Just like Mommy, I didn't feel anything.
- No! No!

448
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,148
- I'll take good care of you.
- No! No!

449
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,781
- Breathe, count to three.
- Sweetie, you have to be brave.

450
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,984
No!

451
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,095
Code blue!

452
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,990
What's happening?
Please help my baby.

453
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,126
She's had a heart attack!

454
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,928
Marla! Marla!

455
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,601
Marla! Baby, I'm right here.

456
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,375
Marla!

457
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,473
Oh, would you like my CV?

458
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,250
No.

459
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,687
I know you who you are.
I don't need to see a list.

460
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,014
Where do I work?

461
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,761
It's a tech company.

462
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,091
- You were there.
- Cars. Something about cars.

463
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,959
You have no interest in hiring me,
do you?

464
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,630
- No. It's not personal.
- It's a little personal.

465
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,834
I'm doing a favor for Shaun.
I don't really need anyone.

466
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,770
Did he ask you to waste my time?

467
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,840
You know, it's okay.

468
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,114
I didn't really wanna work for you anyway.
You're a bit of a grouch.

469
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:33,710
But make sure whoever does the job
shores up your firewall.

470
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,847
- A kindergartner can hack it.
- Thank you, I'm sure we'll be fine.

471
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,718
And you're right, you know,
we are not a good fit,

472
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,486
and our mutual affection
for Shaun isn't enough

473
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,429
to stop us from killing each other.

474
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,038
Your <i>Chronicle</i> subscription
is about to expire

475
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,016
because they don't have
your updated credit card,

476
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,533
the coffee maker you ordered,
third new one in the last six months,

477
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,704
will be delivered Tuesday,

478
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,647
and you're deducting way too much
out of Debbie's check for FICA.

479
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,742
Would you like to hear
your Google searches?

480
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,349
Thank you.

481
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:19,896
Lea!

482
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,498
Severe proximal LAD disease
with mid-total occlusion.

483
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,831
Angioplasty won't resolve
that stenosis.

484
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,898
High risk of rupture
in someone this young.

485
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,704
A stent?

486
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,212
Won't be enough
effective vascularization.

487
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,374
She needs a left IMA
to LAD anastomosis.

488
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,385
I've never done a coronary bypass
on a 3-year-old.

489
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,510
Neither have I.

490
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,083
Guess it was right to put
her daughter's poop up her tush.

491
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,682
Cost her a chunk of her colon.

492
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,853
- Saved her daughter's life.
- Lucky coincidence.

493
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,123
I'm sure the mother
doesn't regret a thing.

494
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,723
At least she shouldn't. I'm with Claire.

495
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,308
Do you have time for lunch?

496
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,783
- And by lunch you mean?
- Lunch.

497
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,144
I need advice.

498
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,017
I need to really think
about something.

499
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,429
Oh. Then yes, of course.

500
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,121
It could be patronizing,

501
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,465
being put up as some kind of

502
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,398
feel-good human-interest story,

503
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,929
or objectified and glorified

504
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,268
as some kind of a symbol
for people who are different.

505
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,237
But I also know that when I told
my sister your story,

506
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:39,677
she cried.

507
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,941
- She was sad?
- No, she was inspired.

508
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:52,922
I don't know what your advice
is telling me.

509
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,688
I don't know what you think
I'm supposed to do.

510
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,855
Shaun, you aren't supposed
to do anything.

511
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,092
Except what you believe is right.

512
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,502
Oh.

513
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:05,696
Thank you.

514
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,639
Now I'm going to go see
what Lea thinks.

515
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,002
- I thought you had a surgery.
- I'm just going upstairs.

516
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,308
Lea's meeting with Dr. Glassman
about a job.

517
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:17,981
- A job here?
- Yes.

518
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,518
Lea told me at lunch yesterday

519
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,520
that she was looking
for different work so...

520
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:26,319
Wait, you had lunch with Lea yesterday
and you kept it from me?

521
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,367
I didn't keep it from you.

522
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:39,666
There was no reason to mention it
until just now, when I did.

523
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,532
Shaun...

524
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:47,642
you know how I feel about how Lea
hovers over our relationship and...

525
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,043
you're just sneaking around with her?

526
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:55,348
Arranging for her to work here,
where she'll just loom all the more.

527
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,323
She won't be looming or hovering.

528
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,622
She'll be on a whole other floor.

529
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,985
Yeah, where you can go
and get her two cents

530
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,725
whenever the advice given
by your actual girlfriend

531
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,198
is deemed insufficient.

532
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,902
Yes.

533
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:29,787
Hey.

534
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,585
- What are you doing?
- Fresh air. You?

535
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,668
Shaun lied to me
about having lunch with Lea.

536
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:46,871
No, he didn't.

537
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,298
Shaun is incapable of deceit.

538
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,935
He must have genuinely thought
that you wouldn't mind.

539
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,409
Well, then, he's completely tone-deaf
and insensitive,

540
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,780
which are not better qualities
in a boyfriend.

541
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,548
True, but not exactly unanticipated

542
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,484
when you get into a relationship
with Shaun.

543
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,951
And it's never really about the lie,
it's what's underneath.

544
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,760
- You're jealous of Lea.
- I am not jealous.

545
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,824
- I am concerned...
- You don't need to justify.

546
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,562
I'm on team jealousy.

547
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,629
It's flattering, stimulating,

548
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,435
it means you're committed
and you care.

549
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,841
It's ugly and reflects underlying
trust issues that I don't want to...

550
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,506
Yeah, yeah. Like all things,
a little is good and a lot will kill you.

551
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,343
My advice...

552
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,083
admit you're jealous,
give in to it, and then get over it.

553
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:44,656
Finding the styloid

554
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,631
via digital palpitation
of the tonsillar fossa.

555
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:49,960
There.

556
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:56,538
Making incision vertically
along the mucosa of mandible.

557
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,643
Next?

558
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,841
I will free the styloid process
from its...

559
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,382
muscle and ligament attachments.

560
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Done.

561
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,886
Dissecting away
from the internal carotid medially...

562
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,189
and external, laterally.

563
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,961
Now, fracture and excise the styloid.

564
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,537
- Bradycardia.
- Hypotensive.

565
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,544
Loss of EEG waveform.
Cerebral ischemia.

566
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,122
May have injured the carotid.

567
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,891
- Or compressed it by
fracturing the styloid.

568
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,884
See if the fragment is impinging
on the vessel.

569
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,077
Dr. Murphy, extend her head.

570
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,722
Yes! Found it, easing it away.

571
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,197
Carotid decompressed.

572
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,836
EEG back to baseline normal.

573
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,514
Resuming styloid extraction.

574
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,328
Kayley's in ICU, stable,

575
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,898
CT shows no signs
of any permanent damage.

576
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,729
No reason to anticipate
any future problems.

577
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:33,134
So the question is,
what do we tell her?

578
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,103
That the surgery was a success.

579
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,108
She had cerebral ischemia
on the table.

580
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,474
That did no damage,
and there's no evidence of.

581
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,639
Hospital policy is transparency.

582
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,740
We don't tell them what music
we played, what we talked about,

583
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,786
this isn't relevant to the outcome
or to her prognosis.

584
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,098
Would you be taking the same position
if Kayley wasn't someone

585
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,591
- whose criticism could go viral?
- I don't know,

586
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,218
but it would be delusional
to think it's not relevant.

587
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,724
Dr. Reznick, any thoughts?

588
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,458
I don't think I can fairly offer
an opinion,

589
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,764
because my career
could hang in the balance.

590
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,369
None of us are disinterested parties,

591
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,569
given that the hospital's reputation
is also at stake.

592
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,071
Did you screw up?

593
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,175
Could that crisis have been avoided?

594
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,986
If it could have been,
then we are all responsible.

595
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,085
We were watching everything
she was doing,

596
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,124
and none of us told her to stop.

597
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,420
This is an easy call.

598
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,893
There is only one reason
to tell her everything,

599
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,023
and that's you might feel guilty
if you don't,

600
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,966
and there's the future of this hospital.

601
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,711
Okay.

602
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,785
Now, Shaun, if the patient
asks for details about the surgery,

603
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,718
can you limit your answers?

604
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,652
I don't know.

605
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,227
- Okay, we need to know if...
- No.

606
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:08,289
Dr. Murphy,
I hope you'll limit your answers...

607
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,494
but I won't order you
to defy your conscience.

608
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:25,382
We don't normally
have patients share rooms, but...

609
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,642
She's...

610
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,187
- Going to be completely fine.
- When she's recuperated,

611
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,713
we'll begin her on statins, Ezetimibe,
and she'll undergo lipid apheresis.

612
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,723
Kind of like dialysis,

613
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,955
but it'll allow us to extract LDL
out of her blood.

614
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,157
Should get her cholesterol
to within normal range.

615
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,398
She'll need drugs
and that other stuff the rest of her life?

616
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,701
Yes, but, hopefully a very long one.

617
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,478
Thank you so much.

618
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,411
Thank God I did what I did.

619
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,999
Everything went great?

620
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,228
Repair was successful,
you should have no issues...

621
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:21,273
Everything went great!
Say it. Say it to your fans.

622
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,073
Everything went great.

623
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,606
You rocked it!

624
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,237
You'll be with us another few days, then...

625
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:30,577
She rocked it, right?

626
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,712
She was lead surgeon
in a successful...

627
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:39,451
And how gorgeous is that hair?
Dr. Morgan Reznick, take a bow.

628
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,721
She was wrist deep all up
in my mouth, y'all. She's a damn hero.

629
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,328
- You've got work to do.
- We're proud of you.

630
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,303
Any reason you screwed up?

631
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,741
I didn't,
it could have happened to anyone.

632
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,246
Not anyone suffers
from arthritic pain.

633
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:06,444
- That didn't affect anything.
- You sure about that? Because I'm not.

634
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,860
Did you speak to Lea?

635
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,294
Yes.

636
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,300
I know she's a good friend...

637
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,937
and it would be unfair

638
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,605
to expect you
to cut her out of your life...

639
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:43,018
but you going to ask her opinion
right after I had given mine,

640
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,114
it just called up Wyoming
all over again.

641
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,856
That you preferred Lea to me.

642
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,625
I was jealous...

643
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,498
and that's something
that I have to work out.

644
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:07,709
For the two of us to work out.
Together.

645
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,716
What was Lea's advice?

646
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,821
That it'd be selfish
not to share my story with the world.

647
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,897
I liked your advice better.

648
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,415
Hey.

649
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,044
Uh-oh.

650
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:50,415
Actually, yeah.

651
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,552
There's something awkward
we need to talk about.

652
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,952
You and Claire.

653
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,388
You can reopen the door.

654
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,701
There's nothing remotely improper
going on.

655
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,273
I received an anonymous
favoritism complaint.

656
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,441
We need to deal with it.

657
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,714
I don't want to talk to reporters.

658
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,622
I know.

659
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,557
So...

660
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,252
if I talked to reporters,

661
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,229
it wouldn't be honest
to who I really am.

662
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,725
Well, sometimes, Shaun...

663
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,704
people present
a different version of themselves

664
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,900
depending upon the circumstances.
Like, I'm not always...

665
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,840
the same here as I am at home.

666
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,967
I don't.

667
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:47,978
No, you don't.

668
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,273
I considered all the arguments.

669
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,452
I want to be known...

670
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,415
as a good doctor.

671
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,160
Not a good autistic doctor.
