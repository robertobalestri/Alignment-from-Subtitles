1
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,815
This is Andrews' fault.

2
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,680
Agreed. The bourbon may
also bear some responsibility.

3
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,358
Agreed.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,586
You said "fault."

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,994
You don't regret that we...

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,329
No, not at all.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,703
Seriously. It was pretty great.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,838
Yeah.

9
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,804
And definitely
shouldn't happen again.

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,846
- No, it shouldn't.
- No.

11
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:50,749
Make things too
complicated at work.

12
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,217
Let's chalk it up to

13
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:56,017
a "Andrews screwed us, so,
we screwed each other" impulse.

14
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,222
I gotta get going. I'm
covering the ER today.

15
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:07,290
Ooh, right before Christmas?
Gonna be a madhouse.

16
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,594
Yeah.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,433
<i>I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells</i>

18
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,611
<i>Oh, those holiday
J-I-N-G-L-E bells</i>

19
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:26,778
<i>Oh, those happy
J-I-N-G-L-E B-E-double-L-S</i>

20
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:32,326
<i>I love those
J-I-N-G-L-E bells Oh</i>

21
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,726
<i>Jingle bells, jingle
bells Jingle all the way</i>

22
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,134
<i>Oh, what fun it
is to ride in a...</i>

23
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,374
What is that noise?

24
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,474
<i>Jingle Bells?</i>

25
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,376
Two ambulances
coming in back-to-back.

26
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,408
Hey, we need you on
your game today, Murphy.

27
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,483
Okay.

28
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,161
Uh, male, mid-30s, found
unresponsive at Arrivals.

29
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,440
Restarted his heart on-site.

30
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,764
Low O2, wheezing, significant
airway resistance to the bag mask.

31
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,154
We need more
hands on deck, STAT.

32
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,846
I've been calling. Everyone's
left town for the holidays.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,533
- Reznick's around.
- Weird you know that, but glad you do.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,750
- Get Reznick in here.
- On it.

35
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:21,833
Take him to Bay 4.

36
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,774
Murphy, I need you
with me. What do we got?

37
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,642
This is Marianne Southam.
She collapsed in Baggage Claim.

38
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,125
Both patients came
from the airport?

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,460
It's that time of year.
Everyone's traveling.

40
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,112
Right leg is red and swollen.

41
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,163
She's complaining of chest
pain, shortness of breath,

42
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,416
and she has a low-grade fever.

43
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,289
- Did you just get off a long flight?
- Twenty hours, from Malaysia.

44
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,260
Deep vein thrombosis
formed while she was seated.

45
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,990
That explains the
red leg and the fever.

46
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,042
Part of the clot broke
off, traveled to her lung.

47
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,467
That explains the chest
pain. Pulmonary embolism.

48
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,214
We've lost his pulse again!

49
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,365
Take Marianne to Bay 5.

50
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,266
I'll talk you through managing
a pulmonary embolism.

51
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,643
I'm gonna light him up. Clear.

52
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:03,883
Got a rhythm.

53
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,680
Barely. He can't live
on 30 beats a minute.

54
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,618
His lungs are too
stiff to preoxygenate.

55
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,748
Fiber-optic blade
and a 7.5 ET tube.

56
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,820
Murphy, anti-coagulate her
with a 5,000-unit heparin bolus.

57
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,334
Set the ventilator
to assist-controlled.

58
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,201
- Heparin bolus infused.
- Fever's spiking at 103.5.

59
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,073
Could be ARDS from a viral
pneumonia. Get a chest X-ray.

60
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,106
We've lost him again.

61
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,981
O2 sat is 92. Your chest
pain should be getting better.

62
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,018
- It is. Thank you.
- Peak airway pressure's 50.

63
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,890
Switch the ventilator to
PRVC. Pushing IV epinephrine.

64
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,394
Now, you need to insert a central
line in case we go to thrombolysis.

65
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,309
I need you, Murphy.

66
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,674
Still V-fib. Push
300 of amiodarone.

67
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,454
Asystole. He's
still not responding.

68
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,562
That makes over 30 minutes
of brain and cardiac hypoxia.

69
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,267
Stop compressions.

70
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,270
Time of death, 10:07.

71
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,410
Have you had
contact with this man?

72
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,745
He was on my
flight from Malaysia.

73
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,221
They both have vesicular
rashes on their necks.

74
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:56,257
Whatever infection killed
him, she may have it, too.

75
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,490
This is a negative
pressure room,

76
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,107
designed so no air flows out.

77
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,383
It keeps germs from spreading.

78
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,618
Because whatever I
have is gonna kill me,

79
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,963
just like the man
from the plane?

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,149
Your symptoms are
not as severe as his.

81
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,788
Although yours will probably
get worse as the virus progresses.

82
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,355
We don't know for sure
whether you have the same thing.

83
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,832
We know nothing about him,
his condition or his history.

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,800
- When did you start feeling sick?
- On the plane.

85
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,965
I've never even been
outside the US before.

86
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,534
My ex-husband
hated to travel, and...

87
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,046
Was the man who
died sitting near you?

88
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,151
No, he was six or
seven rows in front of me.

89
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,389
Were you ever
physically close to him?

90
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,791
Say, waiting for the
restroom? In line to board?

91
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,662
No, I think he slept
almost the entire flight.

92
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,524
That suggests the virus
can be transmitted in the air.

93
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,981
Which means
everyone in the plane

94
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,372
and this emergency
room has been exposed.

95
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,556
We'll start
conditioning tomorrow.

96
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,481
We use chemo and
total body radiation...

97
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,075
To wipe out my crappy,
leukemia-producing bone marrow

98
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,829
so, you can replace it
with some good stuff.

99
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,877
Well said.

100
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,583
Looks like your dad's good
to go on his marrow donation.

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,770
Please don't call him that.

102
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,427
Bob Cravens walked out on
me and my mom when I was four.

103
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,998
His biological
material gave me life,

104
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,432
and apparently, he's gonna
save me, but he's not my dad.

105
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,467
Any unusual complaints or
pain we should know about?

106
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,340
I've been tired. And the
last day, achy, kind of stiff...

107
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,411
Standard leukemia woes.

108
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,041
Anywhere in particular?

109
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,918
My neck and left arm.

110
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,525
All right, Chris, you're
having a heart attack.

111
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,418
No. My chest feels fine.

112
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,459
We need to get you up
to radiation right away.

113
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,551
Call and let them know we're
coming. Get his donor in here.

114
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,664
How is radiation gonna
help a heart attack?

115
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,598
Your blockage is most
likely excess blast white cells.

116
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,213
The best way to clear out your
heart is to treat your leukemia.

117
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,873
It's what we planned,
just a day early.

118
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,541
It might not be airborne.

119
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,257
Maybe both passengers were already
infected when they got on the plane.

120
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,876
Marianne said she
felt fine before the flight.

121
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,011
Even if she did
contract it on the plane,

122
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,418
it could've been through a
shared water cup or napkin.

123
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,048
Which would make a
quarantine unnecessary.

124
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,489
I'll call the Public Health
Department and the CDC.

125
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,555
They may wanna track the passengers
and anyone they came into contact with.

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,632
<i>- Keep me up to date.</i>
- Okay.

127
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,135
Hey, I'm done.

128
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,969
Jill, you still on?

129
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:58,102
Get me the CDC and a
change of clothes. I'm coming in.

130
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,089
Thanks for getting
me called in, Tyler.

131
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,877
- You're welcome.
- That was sarcasm.

132
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,177
No, it wasn't.

133
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,048
If this turns into a crisis, where
else would you wanna be?

134
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,918
- I hear you're having some stomach pain.
- It hurts a lot.

135
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,854
I figured it was probably
the candy canes,

136
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,086
but I took some
Pepto. Didn't help at all.

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
How many candy
canes are we talking?

138
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,798
Three or four dozen.
Of the little ones.

139
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,443
They pass them out at
the mall where I work.

140
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,427
I like to munch on them.
It keeps me in character.

141
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,835
Sounds like you might be
overdoing it. Take off your shirt.

142
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,273
How'd you know
I was still in town?

143
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,204
Because the holidays are
"an obligatory performance

144
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,959
"where families buy each other
gifts and pretend everything is perfect."

145
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,246
Which is why you tell yours

146
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,650
you have to work every
year, even when you don't.

147
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,883
He's a good listener.

148
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,358
What's that scar from?

149
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,787
Rudolph is an ass.

150
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,766
It's a minor bowel resection for
diverticulitis eight months ago.

151
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,402
Uh, we need to do a contrast CT.

152
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,068
You need to come with me.

153
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,405
Dr. Lim, he has it, too.

154
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,212
There, on his neck, a
rash. It wasn't there earlier.

155
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,711
It hasn't fully developed,
but it could be the same thing.

156
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,811
It can't be. I had
on a mask, gloves...

157
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,482
- You keep on the mask the whole time?
- Not after...

158
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,522
With airborne diseases,
that's important...

159
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,203
It's Marianne. Her
O2 sats are crashing.

160
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,889
Get another dose of
IV methylprednisolone.

161
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,894
We need to move up the transplant.
No, it doesn't change anything.

162
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,501
You'll be anesthetized.

163
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,439
You won't feel a thing
and when you wake up,

164
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,101
your son will be on his
way to being healthy.

165
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,615
We'll see you soon.

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,214
Sorry I couldn't meet
you at the airport.

167
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,451
- That's a cool T-shirt.
- It probably freaks you out, right?

168
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,118
Like, is he gonna
gender-transition or something?

169
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,964
Nah. If that's your
thing, I'm cool.

170
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,580
- How long am I stuck here?
- It's just for the rest of this shift,

171
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,368
then I'm out of
here for three days.

172
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,431
There's a new rock-climbing
gym we can check out,

173
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,600
and the batting cages.

174
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,444
I'm good. I got a season of
<i>Rick and Morty</i> on my phone.

175
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,097
Clear!

176
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,464
That's six rounds of defib,
and 30 minutes of CPR.

177
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,306
Okay, Dr. Murphy, you can stop.

178
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,644
I just spoke with Dr. Andrews.

179
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,220
We're on soft quarantine
while he consults the board.

180
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,015
Call dispatch, put all
ambulances on diversion.

181
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,951
Do your best to
stop all walk-ins.

182
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,856
Say we're at capacity
and send them to County.

183
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,155
Stall all discharges.

184
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,824
Tyler stays in isolation,
and on antivirals.

185
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,334
Fever's likely the next
stage, so, keep a close eye.

186
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,634
What else are we dealing with?

187
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:14,706
I always have lunch by
2:00. It's 2:15. I need to eat.

188
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,571
I've got a banana in
my bag if you want it.

189
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,907
A banana isn't lunch. A turkey
sandwich and milk is lunch.

190
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,743
Dr. Murphy, patients first, then we'll
work on that sandwich. What else?

191
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,462
Sixty-year-old woman with angina
visiting her family for the holidays

192
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,797
forgot her blood pressure
meds, came in for a prescription.

193
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,450
Her refill just got
delayed. What else?

194
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,903
The crib was almost finished
when the screwdriver slipped.

195
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,807
And my family doctor is
closed for the holidays.

196
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,724
They would've sent
you here, anyway.

197
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,737
This type of injury can
cause permanent damage.

198
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,003
Makes me feel less guilty for
bringing my baby into a germ pit.

199
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,562
No offense.

200
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,677
Guessing this is your first.

201
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:55,044
My husband and I waited a long
time. I want everything to be perfect.

202
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,275
Which, as my husband
reminds me, is impossible.

203
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,410
Yet my birth plan
is five pages long.

204
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,882
Mmm.

205
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,589
All closed up.

206
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,786
So I can go home?

207
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,222
Not before we do a nerve study.

208
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,375
I would hate for you to
lose feeling in your fingers.

209
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,991
You can't leave.

210
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,645
I'm sorry. What?
EMT: Hospital policy.

211
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,195
Look, I'm not a
patient, all right?

212
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,749
I just came down here to get
some chips. My dad's a doctor.

213
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,366
- Who's your dad?
- Dr. Alex Park.

214
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,974
- Can you call him?
- My phone's charging upstairs.

215
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,047
I'll call him, so, he knows where
to come find you when he's free.

216
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,313
- But for now, you gotta stay put.
- Why?

217
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,178
Because I'm older than you.

218
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,354
Find the employee
contact list, call Park.

219
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,400
- He should know where his son is.
- Sure.

220
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,805
I feel so much worse than
when I was having a heart attack.

221
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,935
I don't doubt it. Because of
the urgency of your situation,

222
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,480
we used combined
leukapheresis, chemo and radiation.

223
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,475
You're no longer at risk for
another heart attack or stroke.

224
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,086
And I also no longer
have an immune system.

225
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,620
My donor is on his way, right?

226
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,898
I spoke with him. He said
he was getting in his car.

227
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,184
When was that?

228
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,197
I'll follow up.

229
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,265
He's still finding new
ways to let me down.

230
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,477
I thought you guys
were gonna do a CT.

231
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,143
We're doing a KUB X-ray
instead. It's almost as good.

232
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,814
Why would you go with "almost"?

233
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,328
Can you hear that?

234
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,798
Hear what?

235
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,977
- Excuse me. I'm looking for a patient.
- You'll need to speak with a nurse.

236
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,833
I've been waiting
to speak to a nurse.

237
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,315
You must hear that.
The light is buzzing.

238
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,384
I don't hear anything.

239
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,045
It's loud and very distracting.
It needs to be fixed.

240
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,627
You like Italian? La Nostra?

241
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,197
It's great. Barbecue? Ethiopian?

242
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,708
What are you talking about?

243
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,103
Where we're going on our date.

244
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,213
You haven't asked me on
one, and I haven't said yes.

245
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,521
Who turns down the request
of a man trapped in isolation?

246
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,223
What about sushi?
Everybody likes it.

247
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,890
Also, I'm pretty
good with chopsticks.

248
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,261
Never hurts to display
a little manual dexterity.

249
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,365
Tends to impress.

250
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:06,061
I will want a cocktail to
soothe my nerves, but...

251
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,938
Why would you be nervous?

252
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,369
Have you seen you?

253
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,113
You are smart, as
well as beautiful,

254
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,083
and I will need all the tools
in my toolkit to dazzle you,

255
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,249
so, no drink for me.

256
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:30,561
Have one after the appetizers.
I'll be impressed by then.

257
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,738
You have a fever.

258
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,738
He has a fever, and the
rash has fully materialized.

259
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,813
Okay.

260
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,873
Here we go.

261
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,219
Quarantine has been approved.

262
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,482
Yeah. Okay.

263
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,844
Can I have everyone's attention?

264
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,229
This Emergency Room and
everyone in it is now under quarantine.

265
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,186
We're hoping none of
you have been exposed,

266
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,078
but a serious respiratory virus
has infected three patients.

267
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,975
What? This can't happen.

268
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,711
We're starting everyone on
antivirals just as a precaution.

269
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,949
We'll be bringing
in food and water,

270
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,488
so, if any of you have
any dietary restrictions,

271
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,855
- please let us know now.
- You can't make us stay here.

272
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:35,328
That's right. I can't, especially
not if someone's seriously ill.

273
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,172
We are legally entitled
to keep you for as long...

274
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,196
They locked us in.

275
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,163
- Are we locked in?
- Oh, no way.

276
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,033
- I gotta get out.
- Sir...

277
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,443
Sorry.

278
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,450
Like it or not,
no one's leaving.

279
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,077
<i>The decision to
implement the quarantine</i>

280
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,047
<i>was made after
consultation with the board.</i>

281
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,584
<i>The CDC has been
kept fully informed,</i>

282
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,519
<i>and we will be proceeding in
accordance with all protocol...</i>

283
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,753
Shaun, Morgan
and Lim are in there.

284
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,258
And our patient is out here.

285
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,879
There's still no sign of the
donor. He's not answering my calls.

286
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,694
I asked my contact at San
Jose PD to do a home check-in.

287
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,236
Park.

288
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,101
He's down there?
How... Yeah, put him on.

289
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,121
It's security. Kellan's
stuck in the quarantine.

290
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,532
I'll pass along anything I
hear from San Jose PD.

291
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,218
Tyler's started coughing.

292
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,553
Let's up his antivirals,
start high-flow oxygen

293
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,923
and Zosyn to counter
any underlying infection.

294
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:17,953
Santa Pete has a sigmoid
volvulus. He needs surgery very soon.

295
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,398
My call ended 37 minutes ago.

296
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,595
I'm supposed to be
somewhere. It's important.

297
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,769
No, it's not.

298
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,704
We need a non-surgical fix to
a bowel obstruction. Anyone?

299
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,667
Murphy...

300
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,633
- Hmm?
- You got something?

301
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,801
Not really.

302
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,106
Anything at all... Please.

303
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,645
We... We usually...

304
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:17,187
We... We usually make a hole,

305
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:23,718
and come at an obstruction
from the side, but we can't.

306
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,491
We need to use
the existing holes.

307
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,331
An endoscope risks tearing
right through the bowel.

308
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,602
A saline enema doesn't
and it might untwist the bowel.

309
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,644
Simple, but it could work. Nice.

310
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,151
I'm fine.

311
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,210
- Do you have your inhaler?
- Of course, I do.

312
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,251
- What were you doing down here?
- This isn't my fault.

313
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,657
- If you hadn't been working...
- Kellan, I know you must be scared...

314
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,394
I'm fine.

315
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,409
- I'm keeping this hat on. For luck.
- Here we go.

316
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,910
I'm threading the tube into the
rectum. Now, slowly push the saline.

317
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,143
This is... It's not a
pleasant experience.

318
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,051
I'm getting some resistance to flow.
I must have reached the obstruction.

319
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,286
- Push harder. Hang on, Pete.
- Call me Santa...

320
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,892
- Keep pushing the saline.
- Okay. I'm sorry, Santa.

321
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,204
I feel so much better.

322
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:55,616
We've got you on a pretty
high dose of antivirals.

323
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,553
So, what's next?

324
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,057
We're debating nitric oxide.

325
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,061
No, I mean, if this
doesn't turn around.

326
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,955
What happens to me next?

327
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,934
ARDS, then full
respiratory failure.

328
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,405
Hey, I've got a new
idea for our first date.

329
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,477
Archery. I used to
compete when I was young.

330
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,584
Oh, basically, you'd
be showing off?

331
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,750
I can show you some tricks,

332
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,155
teach you a split-finger
hook, how to anchor,

333
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,817
and then proceed
to demolish you.

334
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,559
Now, that sounds
like a reason to live.

335
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,086
I'm here to take you to
your imaging appointment.

336
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,956
- Where's Shaun?
- Shaun is quarantined in the ER.

337
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,785
"Quarantined"? What quarantine?

338
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:13,458
Apparently, for some highly
contagious, deadly virus.

339
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,592
But Shaun sounds fine,
except for some buzzing light,

340
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,036
and his concern about lunch

341
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,767
and you missing your
appointment at the imaging clinic.

342
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,175
- So, let's go.
- Take me to the hospital.

343
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,869
We are going to
your appointment,

344
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,539
and making sure your think
melon remains tumor-free.

345
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,277
Take me to the hospital,
please. I'd like to help.

346
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,082
How? By taking your old
job back and saving the day?

347
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,724
Putting on an outbreak
suit and rescuing Shaun?

348
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,487
Some people may find
your sassy attitude appealing.

349
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,293
I'm not one of them.

350
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,559
And I am crushed.

351
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,009
Sir, I'm sorry, you can't...

352
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,106
My Wife's in there. Viola!

353
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,184
Look, that's her. I
need to get in there.

354
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,462
They're setting up a room
inside for friends and family.

355
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,045
Clifton, what are you doing?

356
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,316
Look, I'm coming
in. Let go of me!

357
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,991
- Calm down, or you're gonna get hurt.
- Stop.

358
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,195
- This is all my fault.
- No.

359
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,706
If I'd put the crib
together like you asked...

360
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,928
Forget about the crib. I need
you to take care of yourself.

361
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,865
Because if something
happens to me,

362
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,605
our son needs someone
to take care of him.

363
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,781
It's a boy?

364
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,608
I'm sorry I'm
ruining your surprise.

365
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,150
No. I...

366
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,751
Oh...

367
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,122
Baby, I love you so much.

368
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,585
I love you, too.

369
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,204
I love you.

370
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,638
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

371
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,342
Shaun, why are you
answering our donor's phone?

372
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,278
Because he's here in quarantine.

373
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,951
What happened to the CDC
getting a team here today?

374
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,887
They've confirmed that it
started in Malaysia last week.

375
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,152
Between the virologists already there
and the ones grounded on the East Coast

376
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,217
- because of the snowstorm...
- Stay on them.

377
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,130
What do we know about the virus?

378
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,228
Similar symptoms to SARS,
but much faster moving.

379
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,204
Bob Cravens infected?

380
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,970
Not so far. Currently
Tyler Durnes, the EMT,

381
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,513
is the only person
displaying symptoms.

382
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,741
I need his bone marrow.
I'd like to go in and get it.

383
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,026
I'll comply with all protocol.

384
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,315
You're not hot-zone
certified. None of us are.

385
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,752
My leukemia patient
has no immune system.

386
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,686
He'll die soon without
a marrow transplant.

387
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,448
Then you best find
him another donor.

388
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,653
Because no one, or their bone
marrow, is leaving that quarantine.

389
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,029
Have we heard from County
about taking our PICU transfers?

390
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,490
How are my O2 sats?

391
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,459
Holding steady.

392
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,529
Do you want to call anyone?

393
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:47,439
I thought about
letting my mom know

394
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,907
what was going on,

395
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,344
but she'd just worry about me
and feel bad that she's not here.

396
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,417
So... She knows I love her.

397
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,723
How's it going in here?

398
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,821
Dr. Reznick was just telling me about
some college lesbian experiences...

399
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,661
Was that just my imagination?

400
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,335
Actually, we were talking
about your mother. Interesting.

401
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:28,772
I don't like the drop in his O2
sats. Let's start him on nitric oxide.

402
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,315
I knew you liked me.

403
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,526
He's in this hospital?

404
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,362
Bob actually came
through for once.

405
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,911
Unfortunately, we can't wait

406
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,767
for him to get
out of quarantine.

407
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,170
But we've found an alternative
donor in the Bay Area.

408
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,479
How compatible are they?

409
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,470
They share five out of
eight of your markers.

410
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,472
Bob is a much better match.

411
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:05,848
I can't handle marrow rejection,
or having to repeat this nightmare.

412
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,957
That's a symptom of the MAC
pneumonia. The antibiotics aren't working.

413
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,365
You need bone marrow, or
this infection is going to kill you.

414
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,438
Soon. Days, not weeks.

415
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,846
Seven years I've
been battling leukemia.

416
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,709
I've been through four
full courses of chemo,

417
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,946
so many trips to the
hospital, I've lost count.

418
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:49,962
Just knowing my father
showed up... I'm grateful, relieved.

419
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:02,837
I'm okay if this is the
end. I'd like to sign a DNR.

420
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,836
Chris, the CDC will
be here tomorrow.

421
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,371
If they can identify the virus,
we can test Bob. If he's negative...

422
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,578
Whatever you can manage
before my heart stops, go for it.

423
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,948
Please, get me the form.

424
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,899
- His fever's climbing.
- Give the nebulizer time to work.

425
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,608
Cooling blankets, that could help.
I'll go get some from the supply closet.

426
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,581
- Put your mask back on.
- Why?

427
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,619
Because I'm infected.

428
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,770
You got it, too?

429
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,075
Are you guys any closer
to figuring this thing out?

430
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,775
Afraid not.

431
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:22,482
On the bright side, I think
I'm growing on Morgan.

432
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,939
There's gotta be a way.

433
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:52,677
You can't go in, Bob can't come
out, the marrow can't come out.

434
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,488
What if it doesn't?

435
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,819
What if the marrow never leaves?

436
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,385
Are you suggesting we put a man with
no immune system into the quarantine?

437
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:08,533
We expand the quarantine,
create a section just for him.

438
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,626
One of the doctors inside could
do the extraction and the transplant.

439
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,262
Then one of two things happens.

440
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,833
He stays in isolation until we know
he hasn't been infected, or it kills him.

441
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,912
There's no way Andrews
will let us expand a quarantine.

442
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,785
Wish me luck.

443
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,156
Going to 360 joules. Clear.

444
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,099
We can crack his chest
and do cardiac massage.

445
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,499
Dr. Reznick...

446
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,685
Have Petringa bring in the internal
paddles from the trauma bay...

447
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:51,709
Morgan...

448
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,300
Hey, Doogie.

449
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,401
You didn't hear me talking to
you? My sugar's crazy high, 650.

450
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,044
Hmm.

451
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,944
That doesn't make sense.

452
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,488
I gave you the proper
dosage of insulin. Ten units.

453
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,649
Ten units? Ten units doesn't
even make a dent with me.

454
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,921
You got a doctor here
knows what he's doing?

455
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:47,125
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy. I'll
give you another 10 units.

456
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,394
- Waste of time. Make it 20.
- I'll give you 10.

457
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,468
What's wrong with you?
You sound like an idiot.

458
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,291
- Don't be a jerk.
- Mind your own business.

459
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,438
Doc. Doc, I don't feel so...

460
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,168
What the hell? Did
he just infect me?

461
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,010
Possibly. I need to
examine your abdomen.

462
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:14,189
Your obstruction has returned.
You need surgery, now.

463
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:18,054
But we're stuck in here...
And there's no operating room.

464
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,100
We will have to improvise.

465
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,476
There's no Neptune Machine.

466
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,480
Without suction, the surgical
field will be filled with blood.

467
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,014
We can use the wall
suction, set to continuous.

468
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,275
That'll do.

469
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,361
No electrocautery to
control the bleeding.

470
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,226
You'll have to do
this combat-style.

471
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,191
Tie off each artery
before you cut.

472
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,050
Dr. Reznick, are you ready?

473
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,527
Because I think we are.

474
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,401
I'll go get the patient.

475
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,346
You should lie down.

476
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,275
- He's out.
- Scalpel.

477
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,261
If we expand the quarantine,
I can do the transplant.

478
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,921
The only technical
breach will...

479
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,065
She's infected.

480
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,578
Melendez. Yeah.

481
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,820
Take down the
adhesions on the sigmoid.

482
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,619
How are his vitals?

483
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,189
Holding steady, Doctor.

484
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,065
That's dead bowel.

485
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,838
- It's perforated.
- Damn it.

486
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,708
- I need a doctor!
- Petringa needs help.

487
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,416
If I don't secure these clamps,
there'll be stool everywhere.

488
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:32,623
Murphy, go.

489
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,021
- He signed a DNR.
- He shouldn't have.

490
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,759
This is battery.

491
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,287
He doesn't need to die. We're
gonna get his donor's marrow.

492
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,699
- Andrews agreed to the plan?
- Not yet.

493
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,196
If he doesn't, we'll
think of something else.

494
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,118
He said he was
feeling light-headed.

495
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,357
I hear you. Please, stay back.

496
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,602
He's...

497
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,899
Is he infected? From when
Santa vomited on him?

498
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,368
He should go to isolation.

499
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:03,447
He's in hypoglycemic shock.

500
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,915
Give him D50.

501
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,894
- It's spreading.
- Kellan!

502
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,629
Kellan!

503
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,598
Kellan!

504
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:34,737
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
- Kellan! Kellan! Kellan!

505
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,519
Dr. Glassman.

506
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:52,863
Hi.

507
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:55,627
We got what we needed for
images. You are okay to go.

508
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,034
- We'll send them to Dr. Blaize.
- Anything I should be worried about?

509
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:01,298
You're seeing Dr. Blaize
before the holiday?

510
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,667
As a matter of fact,
I'm seeing her now,

511
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,642
so, I could just show
her the hard copy.

512
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,443
I'm not supposed to do that.

513
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,984
Oh, no. I know. I've been a
neurosurgeon for 100 years.

514
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,144
I understand protocol.

515
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,459
I'm not gonna look at it. I
just wanna move things along.

516
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,582
Thank you.

517
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,387
It's back.

518
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,403
Suction.

519
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,714
I must've nicked a branch of
the inferior mesenteric artery.

520
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,014
- Can't see where.
- Can you feel it?

521
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,917
- I think so.
- Use your finger to plug the hole.

522
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,232
Now, what?

523
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,097
Dr. Lim?

524
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,805
Everyone, calm down.

525
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,142
Hey, Kellan. Kellan,
look at me! Look at me.

526
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,414
Breathe! Can you hear
me? Can you hear me?

527
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,265
- Crash cart!
- Help my son!

528
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,978
<i>Silent night</i>

529
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:33,753
<i>Holy night</i>

530
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:38,024
<i>All is calm</i>

531
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:42,828
<i>All is bright</i>

532
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:47,466
<i>Round yon virgin</i>

533
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:52,169
<i>Mother and child</i>

534
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,508
<i>Holy infant</i>

535
00:41:55,613 --> 00:42:00,551
<i>So tender and mild</i>

536
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:08,418
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

537
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:17,392
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>
