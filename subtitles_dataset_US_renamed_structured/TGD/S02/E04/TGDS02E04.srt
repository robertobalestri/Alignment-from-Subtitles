1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,950
I got you a donut.

2
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,383
Apparently.

3
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,730
What are you doing today?

4
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,528
My least favorite
thing in the world.

5
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,965
Looking for an apartment?

6
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,803
Yeah, I'll be out
of here in 48 hours,

7
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,101
for both of our sakes.

8
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,771
What about your old apartment?

9
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:50,441
Kenny got arrested, so I
don't think he needs it anymore.

10
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,652
I don't think being neighbors
is such a great idea.

11
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,464
We had a fight.

12
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,059
I bought you a donut.

13
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,399
A really big fight about
some really big issues

14
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,238
that aren't gonna go away
because you got me a donut.

15
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,488
Remember that
Usher-themed party I had?

16
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,254
I remember searching the
entire house for a Tylenol.

17
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,125
Is it too late to
apologize for that?

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,991
No. Never.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,827
I miss you, Daddy.

20
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,529
Who are you talking to?

21
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,970
I'm talking to...

22
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,000
To the chair?

23
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,612
If you can't fall
asleep on your own,

24
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,810
you can have the
Ambien you asked for.

25
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,117
You sleep, I go away.

26
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,984
I don't need an Ambien.

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,983
Okay.

28
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,853
I'll be keeping an eye
on you, Dr. Glassman.

29
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,339
Trying to hop a fence, Mac?

30
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,805
I wanna go home.

31
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,812
We will, sweetie, as
soon as we fix you up.

32
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,848
Mac has Fragile X syndrome.

33
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:32,177
A genetic disorder characterized
by intellectual disability,

34
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,051
behavioral issues,
and hyperactivity.

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,556
The good news is that the
picket hasn't compromised

36
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,752
any vital organs,
major nerves or arteries.

37
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,659
The bad news is that it
splintered inside his shoulder.

38
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,474
All right, let's get this
stick out of you, Mac.

39
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,864
- Will it hurt?
- Not a bit.

40
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,924
You're gonna sleep
through the whole thing.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,774
Third time's a
charm, right, Shaun?

42
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,847
Her name's Bill,
short for Sybil.

43
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,183
She likes things
nice and simple.

44
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,466
Possible internal bleeding,
heel bone calcaneus fractures,

45
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,875
tibial pilon fractures,
and cervical fractures.

46
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,389
Her name's Kitty Kwon.

47
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,711
Kitty, you know where you are?

48
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,807
Unfortunately, yeah.

49
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,977
I was 150 feet from the summit.

50
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,421
Would've been the
first female free solo.

51
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,581
Free solo?

52
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,319
Climbing without ropes.

53
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,308
Let's tidy up these bleeders,
irrigate the wound and close him up.

54
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,244
How do you find a new friend?

55
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,112
Lea is very mad at me.

56
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,157
Well, whatever you
did to her, apologize.

57
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,193
I did. I said, "I'm sorry."

58
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,019
It may take even more than that.

59
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,658
Make a statement. Go big.

60
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,164
An apology's an apology.

61
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,826
If she doesn't accept
it, just walk away.

62
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,464
And there we have the entire
spectrum of male response,

63
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,133
dazzle them or dump them.

64
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,335
Just be nice to her, Dr. Murphy.

65
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,044
I don't like you
looking like this.

66
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,053
I want you in a suit with
one of my famous ties.

67
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,123
I had more ties than birthdays.

68
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,786
How did that happen?

69
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:52,992
You know what's funny?

70
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,193
What?

71
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,627
I only have great
memories of you.

72
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,400
What about all those other
memories? Why can't I remember them?

73
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,500
Good memories are
like a beautiful song.

74
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,870
You don't want them to ever end.

75
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,512
I don't think that's all
we should talk about.

76
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,745
You're looking awfully sleepy.

77
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,317
Our clock is ticking. We
need to get to the good stuff.

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,229
You know, Dad, the
real reason I'm here...

79
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,601
The surgery went very well.

80
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,504
We got every bit of picket,
Mac is recovering well.

81
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,598
- Thank you.
- He can go home today.

82
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,901
This is all good news, Nicole.

83
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,379
I know, I know, I
was, I was just...

84
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,842
I was hoping to have
one night without him.

85
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,357
Katherine.

86
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,853
Mom, Dad.

87
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,557
Thank God you're alive.

88
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,292
Thank you.

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,096
Unfortunately, there's still a
serious issue we have to deal with.

90
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,704
Kitty has cervical fractures.

91
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,539
She broke her neck.

92
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,264
Luckily, we can repair
it by fusing her spine.

93
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,703
Your range of motion
will be restricted,

94
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,955
but when everything else heals,

95
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,471
you should be walking
within three months.

96
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,416
Will I be able to climb again?

97
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,444
Not at that level, and
certainly not free solo.

98
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,259
They should've just left
me on that mountain to die.

99
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,427
Then I think you'll
prefer the second option,

100
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,156
the odontoid screw procedure.

101
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,576
It doesn't involve
vertebral fusion,

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,626
and could maintain
your full range of motion.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,966
Seriously? Sign me up.

104
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,337
The spinal-fusion surgery
is generally preferred,

105
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,137
because it has
higher healing rates

106
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,144
and more favorable
long-term results.

107
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,845
But the screw procedure
is less invasive,

108
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,907
so there's reduced collateral
injury and no permanent damage.

109
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,112
Would she be able to climb
again? Free solo? Everything?

110
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,451
Eventually, yes.

111
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,515
Can I say yes now? Yes.

112
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,320
No.

113
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,156
If you give her this
operation, you'll be killing her.

114
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,172
You can get help.

115
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:27,270
Do you mean IEPs, speech
therapy or behavior mod?

116
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,616
Have you considered a
residential facility, a group home?

117
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,279
Give him away? To strangers?

118
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,821
To professionals
who can help him.

119
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,983
He was abandoned by his
father. I'm all that he has left.

120
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,854
God, he was such
a beautiful baby.

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,302
And he was perfectly
normal, walking, talking.

122
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,734
But just after he turned two,

123
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,535
we noticed a change.

124
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,403
He started to lose his words.
He was going backwards.

125
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,175
When we got the test results,

126
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,555
everything we'd hoped for
our perfect little boy was gone.

127
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,322
By the time he was nine, he
was too much for my husband.

128
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,895
And that was before his growth spurt,
and before his mood swings became...

129
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,102
I don't wanna
give him up. I just...

130
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,600
I just wanted a break
for one lousy night.

131
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,675
Nobody blames
you for that, Nicole.

132
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,048
And you don't have to
send your son anywhere.

133
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,508
I'm sure that'd be
devastating for a kid like Mac.

134
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,788
I don't go to church, I swear,

135
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,261
and I have sex with strange men.

136
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,430
Your room's on the left.

137
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,900
Yes, it would.

138
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,047
Then he'd get used to it.

139
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,780
It started with a broken
arm and a concussion.

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,483
Next time it was
a shattered femur

141
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,117
and a ruptured spleen.
Then a broken pelvis.

142
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,925
Then a skull fracture that put
her into a coma for three days.

143
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,399
She needs this crazy fix.

144
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,596
I'm not an adrenaline
junkie, okay?

145
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,901
When I climb,
adrenaline is the enemy.

146
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,739
I need to be calm, relaxed
and focused, or this happens.

147
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,011
You've always wanted me to
believe I can do anything I want.

148
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,444
Each time that I summit,

149
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,780
every roadblock in
my life melts away.

150
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,946
It's what I live for.

151
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,081
We just want you to keep living.

152
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,318
And I will, Dad.

153
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,526
But I can think of worse things
than dying doing what I love.

154
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,292
Mr. and Mrs. Kwon, I
understand how you're feeling,

155
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,434
but your daughter's 18.

156
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,629
It's her decision.

157
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,137
Thank you, Dr. Reznick.

158
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,506
I'd like to proceed
with your surgery.

159
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,507
Remember you telling
me when you grew up,

160
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,210
you wanted to be a nurse?

161
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,715
A male nurse?

162
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,380
- You're deflecting.
- Yes, I am, I'm deflecting.

163
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,118
I am deflecting.

164
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,169
- What is the point, Maddie?
- Then let's get to this, Daddy.

165
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,193
What do you say?

166
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,387
Who are you talking to?

167
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,725
Shaun, what are you doing?

168
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,662
You don't sneak
up on me like that.

169
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,162
You may be
experiencing delirium,

170
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:40,037
with possible auditory
and/or visual hallucinations.

171
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,665
- I'm fine.
- It may be a symptom

172
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,006
- of severe post-operative...
- Shaun, I'm fine.

173
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,206
I'm just, I'm really...
I'm just really tired.

174
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,479
I'm...

175
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,513
- I'm remembering.
- Lying to your little buddy.

176
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,323
I thought you two were
<i>Gilligan's Island</i> tight.

177
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,516
I'm just remembering.

178
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,921
Okay.

179
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:07,226
Lea said I was a total
jerk and a jackass,

180
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,598
even though all I did
was tell her the truth.

181
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,772
And then I did everything right,
but she still got mad at me, again.

182
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,084
I thought this was Maddie time?

183
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:19,273
I asked for advice and
Dr. Park told me to go big,

184
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,371
and Dr. Melendez
told me to walk away,

185
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,450
and JL, the anesthesiologist,
she told me to be nice,

186
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,951
but I don't know which...

187
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,748
Shaun, Shaun, Shaun, I just...

188
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:33,589
I'm not in the best wisdom
mode at the moment, okay?

189
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,129
I'll tell Dr. Dulay you may
be experiencing psychosis.

190
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,924
I'm not psychotic. There's
no need to bother her.

191
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,900
It won't bother
her, it's her job.

192
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,780
- Shaun, stop!
- He won't listen to you, Daddy.

193
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,932
- He never does...
- Maddie, please! Will you please?

194
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,713
I'm having a vision.

195
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,882
Just a vision.

196
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,750
Maybe it's the
drugs, I don't know.

197
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,055
You're talking to Maddie.

198
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,068
Shaun, can you
keep this between us?

199
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,175
Please, just for a little while.

200
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,780
Okay.

201
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,124
We both know he can't
keep a secret worth a damn.

202
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,321
- Better get to it.
- I don't wanna get to it.

203
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,789
I wanna talk
about the rest of it.

204
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,324
I wanna talk about the
Usher parties and the ties.

205
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,835
Why can't we talk
about your track meets?

206
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,462
Because we're past that, Daddy.

207
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,207
We need to talk about
why you're talking to a ghost.

208
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,676
Why I'm not sitting here for
real, holding my father's hand.

209
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,955
Good dreams,
please, good dreams.

210
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,381
You want good dreams?
Go ahead, take your pill.

211
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,687
This has gotta happen,
Daddy. You know it.

212
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,030
What if they're right?

213
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,005
What if we are, in effect,
killing their daughter

214
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,839
by giving her the
surgery she wants?

215
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,856
These are not issues
doctors should think about.

216
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,143
That's what we tell ourselves

217
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,706
because it makes it easier
for us to just do our job,

218
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,295
and not worry about whether
we're helping or hurting.

219
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,983
For all we know, on her next
climb, she may meet her soulmate.

220
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,757
If, on the other hand,

221
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,151
you're not God, and
like the rest of us,

222
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,196
you have no idea
what will happen to her,

223
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:55,099
then you should back off,
focus on the medical issues.

224
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,830
Because as long as
Kitty is a competent adult,

225
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,498
it's all moot.

226
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,177
This is the two-bedroom.

227
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,212
The one-bedroom
went about an hour ago.

228
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,578
Oh, no. I wanted the one.

229
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,241
Sorry. This has a
much bigger living room,

230
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,183
and a much better view.

231
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,380
And a much bigger price.

232
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,584
Oh, I didn't know
it had a fireplace.

233
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,355
Damn it, Willow, I just
fell in love with this place.

234
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,557
Which is just cruel,
since I definitely can't...

235
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,759
You fall in love very quickly.

236
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,630
Shaun.

237
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,367
I found a cheaper apartment
with comparable amenities.

238
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,134
- I wrote down the address.
- What are you doing here?

239
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:43,873
You said you hated apartment-hunting,
so I decided to help you.

240
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,781
That's being nice. And
don't forget about the donut.

241
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,619
That isn't being
nice. It's being creepy.

242
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,953
Did you follow me here?

243
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,291
No. I saw the rental address

244
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,729
highlighted on your
tablet this morning.

245
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,061
That is creepy, too.

246
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,461
I didn't ask for
your help, Shaun.

247
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,628
I do not need your help,
and I don't want your help.

248
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,342
Katherine, if you won't

249
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,316
- reconsider this surgery...
- I won't.

250
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,149
Then we have to
consider other options.

251
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,921
The decision is yours, unless

252
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,124
we have you declared
mentally incompetent.

253
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,798
You're saying that
I might be crazy?

254
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,266
You were in Vienna
for my sweet 16?

255
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,535
I was the keynote speaker.

256
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,686
And that birthday card
signed by your secretary?

257
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,939
What's the point, Maddie?

258
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,004
All the committees and
councils and boards.

259
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,878
Evenings, weekends, holidays...

260
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,177
I was working my ass off.

261
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,116
That's an excuse.
You were avoiding me.

262
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,496
- I - was avoiding you?

263
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,785
When I was home, you
paid no attention to me,

264
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,222
or anything I had to say.

265
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,526
Heard you've been
experiencing some delirium.

266
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,689
Possibly hallucinations.

267
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,989
Shaun?

268
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,962
I kept our secret

269
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,224
for 30 minutes.

270
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,569
He betrayed you.
He's not a friend.

271
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,799
It could just be ICU psychosis
brought on by lack of sleep.

272
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,536
But as you know, or would
know, if you weren't psychotic,

273
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,701
it could be a lot worse.

274
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,646
It could be an indicator
of surgical complications,

275
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,511
like infection or
cerebral ischemia.

276
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,346
I'm not psychotic,
I'm just tired.

277
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,215
Oh, my God.

278
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,244
Either take the pill, or
I'm gonna knock you out.

279
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,832
All right. Nighty-night.

280
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,574
How sweet.

281
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,249
You're willing to risk
your life to finish our story.

282
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,229
- This is ridiculous.
- Why do you say that, Kitty?

283
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,530
This is about two overbearing
parents who just can't let go.

284
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,864
She wants to kill herself.

285
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,371
I fell off that
mountain, I didn't jump.

286
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,272
You said you'd be happy to
die as long as you were climbing.

287
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,436
Mom, what I meant is
people take risks all the time,

288
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,574
risks that reduce
their lifespan,

289
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,478
every time they get into a
car, or they smoke a cigarette.

290
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,074
We're all doing the same thing,

291
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,220
just calculating our chances
and hoping we defy the odds.

292
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,581
What about when you
took the sleeping pills?

293
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,653
It was four years ago, after
I'd been dumped on Twitter.

294
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,891
And I called my parents
as soon as I had done it.

295
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,823
It was hardly a suicide attempt.

296
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:51,098
You spent the night in the
ER. They said you nearly died.

297
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,336
I'm such an idiot.

298
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,237
I thought the window was open.

299
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,646
That's what I get for
keeping them so clean.

300
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,428
Possible nerve, vessel,
and ligament injury.

301
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,920
And she's lost a lot of blood.

302
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,187
Let's get her into an OR, now.

303
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,023
Mom, no!

304
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,287
I'll stay with him.

305
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,523
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Ask Deezer.

306
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,098
Mom, where are you going?

307
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,031
No.

308
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,763
No.

309
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,861
Two milligrams lorazepam.

310
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,532
And some ice.

311
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,046
Kitty believes the surgery

312
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,446
her parents want will
make her an invalid.

313
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,518
That's not true. She won't
be able to be a top athlete,

314
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,646
but the impairment
will be minor.

315
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,559
She'll be able to enjoy
an active and safe lifestyle.

316
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,658
That minor impairment could be

317
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,527
as much as a 50%
restriction of head rotation,

318
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,827
and a reduction in
flexion extension.

319
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,197
That's worst-case scenario.

320
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,667
It's a permanent disability.

321
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,564
All kids make bad choices.

322
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,402
Kitty's may be worse than most,

323
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,635
but are we really gonna
hobble an adult woman?

324
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,472
"Adult"? She's 18.

325
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,978
Fits the definition.

326
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,017
And two months ago, she
was 17 and a helpless child?

327
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,676
I mean, she's obviously just as
immature and unreasonable as ever.

328
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,382
This is about your
mother, isn't it?

329
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,814
If you could've controlled her,

330
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,326
you would've prevented a lot
of pain to herself and others.

331
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,186
Thank you.

332
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,723
I think I have enough
to make my decision.

333
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,404
I'm sorry

334
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,340
that I hit you.

335
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,738
When you get scared,

336
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,583
do you think about
something that helps you?

337
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,014
Deezer.

338
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,890
Do you think about something?

339
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,896
School change their dress code?

340
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,204
I'm not going to school.

341
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,742
Mr. Decker's still substituting.

342
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,715
I know Ken.

343
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,280
Dated him in high school.

344
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,987
He's a real horse's ass.

345
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,495
Tough titmouse. Get dressed.

346
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,993
Tough titmouse.

347
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:47,113
I see a vibrant,
engaged young woman,

348
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,410
but I also see a reckless
disregard for your life.

349
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,450
And it's not clear to me if
that's a pathological state,

350
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,959
or simply a product of youth.

351
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,160
But either way,

352
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,431
I have to err on the side of
the preservation of that life.

353
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,594
No.

354
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry, Kitty.

355
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,366
Oh, my God.

356
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,509
Nothing I ever did was enough.

357
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,718
When I was home, you were
out, or you were high, or both.

358
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,100
You don't remember that, do you?

359
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,386
You've always found
lots of time for Shaun.

360
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,959
Oh, stop. Shaun has special
needs, he had no one else...

361
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,224
I had needs. I was lost and
confused. I needed my father...

362
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,888
Now? Now you tell me?

363
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,329
Now, when it mattered, when
it might've made a difference,

364
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,031
you turned me away every time,
screaming, "You don't know me."

365
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,697
- You don't!
- I know.

366
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,002
I know.

367
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,742
I have no idea who you are!

368
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,372
I have no idea what you
wanted, what you wanted from me!

369
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,712
- I wanted you to be there!
- I was there!

370
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,185
- Not enough, obviously. Otherwise...
- Otherwise?

371
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:03,888
Otherwise?

372
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,918
Otherwise?

373
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,355
You were such
a happy little girl.

374
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,398
- My God.
- We were best friends.

375
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,764
I don't get it.

376
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,599
What happened?

377
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,872
What made you so unhappy?

378
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,170
You did.

379
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,368
My only sin was growing up.

380
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,014
When I couldn't be your
pinafore princess anymore,

381
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,676
- you wanted nothing to do with me.
- That's not true.

382
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,417
I loved you, and
I still love you.

383
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:42,789
I hate you.

384
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,926
And I died hating you.

385
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,112
Think I'm gonna
let you off that easy?

386
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,590
The night,

387
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,431
let's talk about that.

388
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,839
Tequila, stat.

389
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,279
I went big.

390
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:47,417
<i>Baby, when I met you
there was peace unknown</i>

391
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:50,258
<i>I set out to get
you with the fine...</i>

392
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,597
Karaoke?

393
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,472
Hershey meant
everything to me, Shaun.

394
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,170
I took the biggest chance
of my life going back there.

395
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:11,374
And then it just went away.

396
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:18,282
But I knew I could come back
here to get the support of my friend,

397
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,723
who was so different,

398
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:24,889
because he was so
open and nice and honest.

399
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,830
But you gave me nothing.

400
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,568
You never even asked me once

401
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,034
what happened in Hershey.

402
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:45,644
You just... You
just didn't care.

403
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,735
It went very well.

404
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,751
You should get most of the
sensation back in your hand,

405
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,609
but we do need to monitor your
motor strength and perfusion.

406
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,872
Okay.

407
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,177
We know Mac caused your injury.

408
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,547
No, I told you, I
cut it on a window.

409
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,378
No, Mac has never hurt anyone.

410
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,221
What were you doing to him?

411
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,189
Trying to help him.

412
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,232
You need to find
a place for Mac.

413
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,298
That is not our call.

414
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,899
You're overwhelmed, Nicole.

415
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,405
There's no shame in admitting
you need help, to get Mac help.

416
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,536
He'll hate me.

417
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,784
You gotta move out,

418
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,557
soon as they find
someone who'll take you.

419
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,398
Okay, stop.

420
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,470
Not everything is about you.

421
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,831
Doctors say I'm dying,

422
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,976
and there's nothing
they can do about it.

423
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,983
Tough titmouse.

424
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,927
He won't hate you.

425
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,862
He'll just be very scared.

426
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,671
You have been given
an enormous challenge

427
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,706
that a lot of people
couldn't handle.

428
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,801
But I know you'll find the
strength to keep going.

429
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:54,972
I will.

430
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,708
Thank you.

431
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,459
Five years from now...

432
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,161
I want you to tell my
parents something.

433
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,370
Tell them I never
wanna see them again.

434
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,480
Dr. Melendez, I knew a
kid who had a lot of issues.

435
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,913
Got into a lot of trouble,
fights, mainly with his dad.

436
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:34,142
And when I met his dad, I
understood. He was a real piece of work.

437
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,181
So I stepped up, found
the kid a place to live,

438
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,656
got him a pretty decent job.

439
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,357
But he was already too broken.

440
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,093
He needed a lot more than a
friendly cop. He needed a doctor.

441
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,430
The next guy he got
into a fight with had a gun.

442
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,035
Nicole trusts you,

443
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,072
and that's why you have to
give her permission to let go.

444
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:18,860
How are we supposed to give advice
without dragging our baggage into it?

445
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,938
Maybe our baggage
informs our advice.

446
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,067
Gives us perspective,
maybe even wisdom.

447
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,776
Maybe you're confusing
baggage with experience.

448
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,810
What's the difference?

449
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,255
If I knew, I
wouldn't be up here.

450
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,635
Mom was out of town...

451
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,259
I can't take any
more of this. I can't...

452
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,422
You caught me high
for the umpteenth time.

453
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,574
Maddie, why are you doing this?

454
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,430
The night I broke
another promise,

455
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,128
you decided to
quit the bargaining

456
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,432
and the threats and take action.

457
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,944
So you dragged me
outside and locked the door.

458
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,516
I prayed you would
come and find me.

459
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,351
Why didn't you come and find me?

460
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,819
I thought that you
would go to Jessica's.

461
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,023
I thought you'd go to Aunt
Becky's. If I had any idea...

462
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,177
If you thought I'd die that night,
you would have let me back in?

463
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,201
Good to know.

464
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,364
How could you do that?

465
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,539
Why would anyone
do that? I don't get it!

466
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,345
How dare you do that?

467
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,179
Maddie, look at me.

468
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:50,989
I died that day. Maddie,
I died that day, too.

469
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:55,892
I don't get it! I don't
get it! I don't get it!

470
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,966
- Is there a problem?
- No.

471
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:09,066
I just wanted to talk to you
before we started the surgery.

472
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,504
Kitty doesn't want you
here when she wakes up.

473
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,405
She'll change her mind.

474
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,912
With time, she will
change her mind.

475
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,718
I have somebody in my
life who's self-destructive.

476
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,922
And there have been times

477
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,853
when I could have
forced her into treatment,

478
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:36,830
and I'm sure it would've
helped, for a while.

479
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,607
But I think I have
been pushing you

480
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:49,204
because I sometimes think
I made the wrong choice.

481
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:57,018
But she would've hated
me, and I would've lost her.

482
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,435
You're trying to
save your daughter,

483
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,021
but I think you're
gonna lose her. Forever.

484
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,265
If we do this, she
will grow and learn.

485
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,207
And when she walks down the
aisle with her loving husband...

486
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,813
And when she holds her baby
in her arms for the first time,

487
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,618
we may not be there,

488
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,424
but those are the
gifts we're giving her.

489
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,924
And it's enough.

490
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,599
It will have to be enough.

491
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,977
Maddie, please.
Maddie, look at me.

492
00:31:58,817 --> 00:31:59,944
Maddie, don't do this.

493
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,681
Maddie!

494
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:03,949
Two milligrams Haldol.

495
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,952
No, don't.

496
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,119
I can't have her
leave me like this.

497
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,330
Maddie... Please
don't leave like this.

498
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,429
I should've held onto you.

499
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,806
I should've held onto you.

500
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:25,603
Until you'd talk to me.
I should've held on.

501
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,976
Your mother wanted
to send you to rehab,

502
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,716
and I said no! I said no!

503
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,788
I can fix it!

504
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,685
She's my little girl.
She'll listen to me.

505
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,822
I wanted to be the hero.

506
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,028
I wanted to earn you back.

507
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,303
I wanted you to love me again,

508
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,469
like you did once upon a time.

509
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,536
It was stupid.

510
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,178
I don't know what to say,

511
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,314
except I'm sorry.

512
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,519
I'm sorry.

513
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,391
I'm sorry.

514
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,766
I know you loved me, Daddy.

515
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,110
I loved you, too.

516
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,713
If you send Mac away,

517
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,491
there will be people who
think you let him down,

518
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,452
question your love for him.

519
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:27,562
They'll say you gave
up on him as a parent

520
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,598
and took the easy way out.

521
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,229
They may even hate you for it.

522
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,143
But those people,

523
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,312
they don't understand.

524
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,780
I didn't.

525
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,257
Giving him up will
be the hardest thing

526
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,158
that you will ever have to do.

527
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:03,869
But maybe you need to do it
because of your love for him.

528
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,854
The surgery went well.

529
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,824
As long as you
stick to the program,

530
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,227
you'll be walking within
8-12 weeks, or less.

531
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,155
Great.

532
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,735
You know, your parents did
this because they love you, Kitty.

533
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,667
So much.

534
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,709
I know.

535
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,217
No!

536
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:07,521
I'm sorry I hurt
you, I didn't mean to!

537
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,694
No...

538
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,607
No! Shut up! Stop it!

539
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,761
You gather up all your crap?

540
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,199
Yes, I checked three times.

541
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,569
Good, 'cause anything
you leave, I'm chucking.

542
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,145
I'm scared.

543
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,047
Tough titmouse.

544
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,652
I'm not a hallucination.

545
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,926
You've been asleep for 13 hours.

546
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,198
Was seeing Maddie therapeutic?

547
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,638
She said she loved me.

548
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,143
Hmm.

549
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,044
That's very good.

550
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,124
Or maybe it was just
me telling myself that.

551
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,456
You always tell the truth.

552
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,863
Thank you, Shaun.

553
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,412
Hey, kid.

554
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,720
Neil.

555
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,852
Hey.

556
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,758
I almost did my puzzle.

557
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,590
I can see that.

558
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,330
That's a great job, Gabi.

559
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,370
Mom and Dad gave it
to me for my birthday.

560
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,168
Yeah, I remember.

561
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,704
Are Mom and Dad
coming for me today?

562
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,413
Oh, mama.

563
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,089
No, no, they can't.

564
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,193
Gabi, we love you,

565
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,730
but you have way more
fun here than at their place.

566
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,135
I think I see a
piece of the cow.

567
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,332
Thank you for letting me crash.

568
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,137
Yes.

569
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,442
You rented an apartment?

570
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:18,280
No. I'm gonna get an Airbnb.

571
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:25,919
All right.

572
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,084
What happened in Hershey?

573
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,032
Do you care?

574
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,604
I tried to be nice.

575
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,373
And I tried to go big.

576
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,618
And I don't want to walk away.

577
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,050
And everyone likes donuts.

578
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,485
And I don't know
how to answer that.

579
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,455
Just be honest.

580
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:19,466
I don't care what
happened in Hershey,

581
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,481
but I care that you care.

582
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,662
You wanna try that song again?

583
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:44,901
Yes!

584
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,228
Okay.

585
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,532
Okay.

586
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:03,583
<i>Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication</i>

587
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,089
<i>All this love we
feel needs no...</i>

588
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,715
I went bigger.

589
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:11,729
<i>We ride it together, ah-ha</i>

590
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:15,358
I rented that apartment
you liked for us to share.

591
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:20,635
<i>Oh, islands in the
stream That is what we are</i>

592
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,705
<i>No one in between
How can we be wrong?</i>
