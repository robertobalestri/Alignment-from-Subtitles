1
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,544
Good morning.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,107
Morning.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,716
I'm Jake. We met last week.

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,644
Yes, we did.

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,690
I was just gonna get some
juice. Hope you don't mind...

6
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:26,816
Are you a drummer?

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,423
Am I a drummer? No.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,061
No, I'm a chef. Well,
actually, just a cook, but...

9
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,598
Lea dates drummers.

10
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,100
I played clarinet
in junior high.

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:40,806
Hmm.

12
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,875
What are you doing out here?
I told you to stay in my room.

13
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,579
I just snuck out
to grab some OJ.

14
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,984
Mmm-hmm.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,515
I was really thirsty.

16
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,378
Okay.

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,165
I'm sorry. I should've told
you he was spending the night.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,256
I like Jake.

19
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,662
That's nice of you to say.

20
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,735
I know it's difficult to have
a stranger in your home.

21
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,266
I have to drive Dr. Glassman
to his chemo appointment.

22
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,440
He's five days in
and doing very well.

23
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,777
I'm helping him.

24
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,218
Jake is very sweet.

25
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,753
You know, when you get to know
him, I'm sure you really will like him.

26
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,084
I said I like him.

27
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,853
Will he be spending
the night here a lot now?

28
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,950
No, not a lot.

29
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,732
But would that be a problem?

30
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,733
No.

31
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,870
So, is it cool if I have him
over tonight to watch a movie?

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,400
It's cool.

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,407
- I have to go.
- Okay.

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,988
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

35
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,361
I let myself in. I'm downstairs.

36
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,865
How are you feeling today?

37
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,963
Good, actually.
Better than yesterday.

38
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,335
Yes, your skin was
a bit pale yesterday.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,204
Today, your color
looks much better.

40
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,334
I brought you your electrolytes.

41
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,881
Thank you. Cheers.

42
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,954
Why did you do that?

43
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,419
I don't like the
flavor of the grape.

44
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,725
Are you experiencing nausea?

45
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,398
No. I didn't like the
flavor. I told you.

46
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,335
I'm fine.

47
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,932
I'm glad you're feeling well.

48
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,534
Let's go, or we're
going to be late.

49
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,708
Yep. The cancer's
not gonna kill itself.

50
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,489
Hey. I was just
thinking about you, too.

51
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,561
Actually, can I call you at lunch?
I'm with some people right now and...

52
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,060
Yes, exactly.

53
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,030
We'll talk later.

54
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,656
Love you.

55
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,101
New girlfriend?

56
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,270
Still in the "call each other
the next morning" phase?

57
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,409
Yeah, you got me.

58
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,053
Actually, no. It was Mia.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
We're giving our
relationship another shot.

60
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,079
Wow.

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,717
Park, that's great.

62
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,118
Yeah, I told you because
part of the thing with Mia is...

63
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,288
I'm trying to be more open.

64
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,031
Thanks. You didn't need
to explain, but sounds good.

65
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,999
She sounds like
she's good for you.

66
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,574
Yeah.

67
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,003
Of course, if it
doesn't work out,

68
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,244
I'll have to talk to you
about that too, admit I failed.

69
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,885
Or I can be a supportive colleague,
regardless of what happens.

70
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,387
70-year-old female. Neighbor
saw her collapse in her yard.

71
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,630
Unresponsive. No
heartbeat. EKG is flatlined.

72
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,994
Then she'd be cyanotic.

73
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,964
Good capillary refill.

74
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,671
- She's perfusing.
- Stop CPR.

75
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,742
She's breathing. Your
EKG must be broken.

76
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,486
It worked fine on our
call right before her.

77
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,274
Everything works
fine up until it doesn't.

78
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,510
- Nothing.
- Told you.

79
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,291
Hook her up. Let's
check her vitals.

80
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,161
Blood is definitely
flowing to her extremities.

81
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,961
Should we push
epi? Get the crash...

82
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,799
Wait. Everyone, quiet.

83
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,812
Listen.

84
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Is that...

85
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,054
She doesn't have a rhythm
because she has a mechanical heart.

86
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,735
Lana Moore, 34-year-old female, was
slurring her words, symptom passed,

87
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,012
but we found a Grade 2
arteriovenous malformation in her brain.

88
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,779
Are we going to do
endovascular embolization,

89
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,445
or stereotactic
radiosurgery, or resection?

90
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,052
Endovascular embolization.

91
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,888
Patient requests she's
only served green Jell-O

92
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,086
and that we dim all of our
incandescent light bulbs?

93
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,194
Lana has autism.

94
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,242
What are you looking at him for?
It's not like they all know each other.

95
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,235
I was just curious what
his thoughts might be.

96
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,896
I think we should go with
endovascular embolization.

97
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,766
Hmm. Now you know.

98
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,233
The AVM is dangerous,

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,775
but the embolization is a
relatively minor procedure.

100
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,356
We'll make a small incision in your leg,
so we can insert a catheter into your...

101
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,507
Are you okay, Javi?

102
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,412
The lights aren't
bothering you too much?

103
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,752
A little.

104
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,389
Lights.

105
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,899
Please, continue.

106
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,532
We'll insert the catheter
into your femoral artery.

107
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,397
Then we'll feed it up
into the arteriovenous...

108
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,071
You brought a dictionary?

109
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,239
Is there something I'm saying
that you don't understand?

110
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,677
Lana loves learning new words.

111
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,647
She's memorized the scientific Latin
name of every bug in South America.

112
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,314
Go ahead, name
any six-legged critter.

113
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,477
I love being quizzed.

114
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,121
Rhinoceros beetle.

115
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:41,961
<i>Megasoma actaeon.</i> Found in Guyana.
It's the heaviest insect in the world

116
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,497
and weighs as much
as 300 grasshoppers.

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,266
Is she right?

118
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,592
I have no idea.

119
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,670
I have to go.

120
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:01,137
Javi? Javi. Where are you going?

121
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,480
It's 11:15. I have to be home by
noon to watch <i>Judge Judy</i> before work.

122
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,783
It's important to us that your
girlfriend doesn't get stressed out,

123
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,019
so we'd prefer it if you stayed
with her as long as you can.

124
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,254
Lana's not my girlfriend.
We're just roommates.

125
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,371
Still stable?

126
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,506
Diuretics have her O2 sats
up, but she's hypotensive.

127
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,120
And we checked every center
approved to implant mechanical hearts,

128
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,204
but none have any
record of her as a patient.

129
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,312
- Check overseas. I'd start with...
- Mom?

130
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,350
Is it her heart?

131
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,849
The implanted device
appears to be malfunctioning.

132
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,466
Do you have any contact information
for the surgeon who implanted it?

133
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,490
Yes, of course.

134
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,861
Dr. Li Wei. He's in Beijing.

135
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,868
When did she have it implanted?

136
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,358
A little over nine months.

137
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,699
She just went back for a follow-up
exam last month. She was fine.

138
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,007
Can you fix it?

139
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,238
I'm gonna find out.

140
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,187
Hello.

141
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,990
Hello.

142
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,331
- Don't be stupid.
- What? There's no cameras in here.

143
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,199
Dr. Lim. Dr. Melendez. How
were your respective weekends?

144
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,072
- Good. Checked out some bikes.
- Brushed up on some reading.

145
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,144
Excellent.

146
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,271
I hear the search for
Chief of Surgery is back on.

147
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,941
As is our legal department's
response to the DPH complaint

148
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,130
against both of you, so I
wouldn't get your hopes up.

149
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,923
Probably just as well. I'd rather not
see the two of you competing again.

150
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,550
You seem to be
getting along better.

151
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,864
It's weird.

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Is it weird?

153
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,442
They act like a couple, right?

154
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,070
I live with Lea, but
we're not a couple.

155
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,937
Yeah, but you wish you were.

156
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,584
Do you?

157
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,077
Lea has a new boyfriend.

158
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,951
You must be a little jealous.

159
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,489
Why? Lea's my
friend and Lea's happy.

160
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,097
Okay.

161
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,067
Jake, Lea and I can
all be friends together.

162
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,143
Shaun, Lea's new boyfriend

163
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,044
doesn't want to hang
out with the three of you.

164
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,332
If Lea really likes this guy,

165
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,510
she's gonna want to
spend time just with him.

166
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,308
I know. For the sex.

167
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,714
Her AVM has microbleeds.

168
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,749
Her risk of rupture is doubled.

169
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,776
They paged Sunny's surgeon.
He's going to call you in an hour.

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,612
Tell them I can't wait that long.
Her cardiac output is low and...

171
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,636
Got it.

172
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,644
He's in surgery.

173
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,220
Excuse me, Dr. Melendez?

174
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,926
I'm Grace Lee,
Sunny Lee's daughter.

175
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,692
They told me downstairs
that you're my mother's doctor.

176
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,829
Yes.

177
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,409
Get them to send her records and
everything they can about the device.

178
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,197
Manufacturer, model
number, manuals...

179
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,903
Your mother's stable.

180
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,582
But we're struggling to
get the information we need

181
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,972
from her doctor in China.

182
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,673
I don't understand.
Her doctor's in China?

183
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,370
Like, on vacation?

184
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,776
No. Her cardiac surgeon.

185
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,582
Your sister can fill you in on
everything we've done so far.

186
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:58,994
I really need to get
back on this phone call.

187
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,018
Wait...

188
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,053
I don't have a sister.

189
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,766
We met 10 years ago, while I
was volunteering at a senior center.

190
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,728
We hit it off.

191
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,402
Neither of us had anyone
in our lives at the time.

192
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,186
People assumed we
were mother and daughter

193
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,111
because we did
everything together.

194
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,347
After a while, we
just went with it.

195
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,990
She'll be glad to see you.

196
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,316
You look like you've put
your problems behind you.

197
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,088
"Problems"?

198
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,856
She told me about
your issues with drugs.

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,424
Oh, my God. She
caught me smoking pot.

200
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,059
Once. I was a teenager.

201
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,236
- So, you're fine?
- Of course I'm fine.

202
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,601
Then you don't really have an excuse
for not calling for 15 years, do you?

203
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,273
They want her back.
They've arranged for transport.

204
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,741
They'll do the
repairs in Beijing.

205
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,046
Is that safe? Can she travel
for that long in her condition?

206
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,745
It's a specially-equipped plane

207
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,740
for patients requiring
urgent medical assistance.

208
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,623
And 20 hours in the air is
much safer than at least that long

209
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,925
on an operating table here
while we basically fly blind.

210
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,128
- Okay.
- Okay.

211
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,424
Prep her for transport.

212
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,811
The microbleeds indicate that it
may already be starting to rupture.

213
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,142
If it goes, you could suffer
permanent brain damage or death.

214
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,546
Because of that, embolization is
no longer our preferred approach.

215
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,983
We want to open
you up and cut it out.

216
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,459
Can you try talking to her?

217
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,964
Just because I
have autism doesn't...

218
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,711
I'm not asking you
because you have autism.

219
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,430
I'm asking you because you're
her doctor and I'm getting nowhere.

220
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,321
The sting of the Japanese giant
hornet can dissolve human flesh

221
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,856
and attack the nervous system.

222
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,360
Recommended treatment includes
oral antihistamine and acetaminophen.

223
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,425
Comforting choice of words.

224
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,509
It's 6:30. Dinner time.

225
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,079
I brought burgers and
Jell-O. This one's yours.

226
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,341
Lana can't eat now. We're
trying to schedule surgery to...

227
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,545
I could die.

228
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,057
Surgery sounds scary,

229
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,720
but necessary, so I'll do it.

230
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,843
"big feet got there first. Johnny
stumbled, caught himself,

231
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,177
"and swung silently
about at Dove.

232
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,512
"" Gosh, Johnny, I'm
sorry, ' snickered Dove.

233
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,547
""Sorry? You're going to be a
lot sorrier. I just didn't notice...""

234
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,767
Shaun, what are you doing?

235
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,832
Reading to you
from <i>Johnny Tremain.</i>

236
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,305
You're reading words.
You're not reading sentences.

237
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,277
This edition of <i>Johnny
Tremain</i> is 320 pages long.

238
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,546
To get through the entire thing, I
need to read 270 words per minute.

239
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,384
You don't have to finish
the book in one sitting.

240
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,083
Oh, yes, that's
how I read novels.

241
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,837
I want to know where
the characters end up.

242
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,232
You know what? Let's just stop.

243
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,487
I can go slower.

244
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,027
I'm not listening, anyway.

245
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,028
- Are you in pain?
- No, no, I'm not in...

246
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,460
You seem fatigued.

247
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,927
You know what? I
have a good idea.

248
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,400
Why don't you take
out the garbage?

249
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,646
Thank you.

250
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,857
Where is your recycling?

251
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,314
It's under the sink.

252
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,460
Dr. Glassman, this
cannot be recycled.

253
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,427
If it's broken, it cannot be
recycled, because shards of glass...

254
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,164
I don't care, Shaun. I didn't
ask you to re-sort the garbage.

255
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,899
I just asked you to take
it out. Can you do that?

256
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,110
Your call light is on.
How can I help you?

257
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,113
Any new symptoms or discomfort?

258
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,491
Lana?

259
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,624
Rhinoceros beetle?

260
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,764
I'm gonna get Javi on the
phone. You can talk to both of us.

261
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,037
Do these doors lock?

262
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,097
No.

263
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,067
Do you want them to?

264
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,442
Is there someone
you're worried about?

265
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,443
Is it Javi or someone else?

266
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,384
I'm nervous about the surgery.

267
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,785
Dr. Lim is an excellent
surgeon. I've seen her do...

268
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,688
I'd like Javi to come
and have sex with me.

269
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,023
I think an orgasm
would help calm me.

270
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,663
Do the blinds close?

271
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,015
She's gonna need
a norepinephrine drip

272
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,008
to maintain her
pressure during transport.

273
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,848
Mom?

274
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,556
You look pretty.

275
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,058
Mom, I've been so worried.

276
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,062
You shouldn't have. Teresa
takes good care of me.

277
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,258
I'm so glad.

278
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,775
Why did you never call me?

279
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,073
You made it clear. You
wanted nothing to do with me.

280
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,512
I just wanted to
live my own life.

281
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,783
So that's what you got.

282
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,446
Your own life, without me.

283
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,881
- This isn't a good time to...
- You were so good.

284
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,460
Straight A's, always so
smart. You threw it all away.

285
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,128
You never understood.

286
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,764
Dad did. Dad wanted
me to be happy.

287
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,368
He wanted you to have fun
as a child, not waste your life.

288
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,632
Singing is not a career.

289
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,739
Sunny, you need to calm down.

290
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,141
Grace, your mother cannot
handle this stress right now.

291
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,203
Teresa... Teresa is a teacher.

292
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,612
Mom, stop. Listen
to the doctor...

293
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,077
You forgot about me.

294
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,985
I wish you'd stayed away.

295
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,602
Would have...

296
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,817
Her arterial blood
pressure is dropping.

297
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,694
Start bagging and give her
40 Lasix. I'm calling a code.

298
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,598
<i>Say, can you hear?</i>

299
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,639
<i>Is there a meaning
to your grief?</i>

300
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,948
<i>Where there is pain</i>

301
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,649
<i>You see grace</i>

302
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,116
- Shaun?
- Yes, it's Shaun.

303
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,624
I've picked out a very good movie
that we can all watch together.

304
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,656
Not the time, Shaun.

305
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,195
I made popcorn.

306
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,301
Mmm.

307
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,866
I'm just gonna...
Just stay here. Sorry.

308
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,007
Shaun, we kinda need
some privacy right now.

309
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,340
I also bought orange juice for Jake.
He was looking for some in the fridge.

310
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,319
Okay.

311
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,355
I thought you said
you were okay with this.

312
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,260
Jake will like the movie,
Lea. It's about a chef who...

313
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,558
Shaun, but you're not
respecting boundaries.

314
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,667
If Jake and I are friends, then
we can all spend time together.

315
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,707
Shaun, of course
we can all be friends.

316
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,473
That would be great.
It's just, sometimes,

317
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,072
it's gonna be just me and Jake.

318
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,809
Without you.

319
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,576
For the sex?

320
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,421
And some other times, too.

321
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:26,658
Okay?

322
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,061
Okay.

323
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,235
Just give us a minute,

324
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,964
and we can watch the movie
in the living room together.

325
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,077
Okay.

326
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,040
Having sex right now
is extremely dangerous

327
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,447
for someone in Lana's condition.

328
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,450
I studied the pre-op list
of things I couldn't do.

329
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,483
Sex was not on the list.

330
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,085
We'll update the list.

331
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,589
Anything that elevates
her blood pressure

332
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,975
could rupture the AVM before
we get a chance to remove it.

333
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,894
You will definitely need to
abstain until you're fully recovered.

334
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,600
Seems like you two are
more than just roommates.

335
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,273
Why?

336
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,573
You care for each
other, you have sex.

337
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,939
It's convenient. He's available.

338
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,277
And it's frequently
better than masturbation.

339
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,948
- High praise.
- And he leaves afterward.

340
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,992
She doesn't like being
touched when she sleeps.

341
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,020
- Mmm.
- Are you two exclusive?

342
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,418
Lana and Javi don't have
to define their relationship

343
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,484
in order to make it
more digestible for you.

344
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,494
Clearly, whatever it
is, is working for them.

345
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,663
Now, you need to get some rest.

346
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,365
We're gonna do your
surgery at 10:00 a.m.

347
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,802
Sunny's on full life support.

348
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,236
Unfortunately, she
can't be flown to China.

349
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,674
Her condition is beyond the scope
of the plane's medical facilities.

350
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,640
Dr. Melendez is discussing next
steps with Sunny's surgeon in China.

351
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,989
No daughter would treat a wonderful
woman like Sunny the way you did.

352
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,856
Does a wonderful woman refuse
to go to her daughter's recitals?

353
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,256
Then, when she gets
accepted to Juilliard, cut her off?

354
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,643
Tell her she'll never make
it, that she'll wind up broke

355
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,862
and on the streets?

356
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,842
Gently incise the dura.

357
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,614
Nicely done.

358
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,153
And there's our
AVM. Aneurysm clips.

359
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,290
It'd be nice to have
what Lana and Javi have.

360
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:49,500
All the benefits of a relationship
without the emotional baggage.

361
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,335
The emotional baggage
is the relationship.

362
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,369
Everybody has their issues. The
point is to sort them out together.

363
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,446
"Yeah, that's all it takes," agreed
all the single people in the room.

364
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,349
I can't get under the AVM.

365
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,850
It's much closer to Broca's
area than the MRI indicated.

366
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,655
Any damage could
destroy her ability to speak.

367
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,728
And what if we use
stereotactic image-guidance?

368
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,489
That would only
show us where we are.

369
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,577
It wouldn't tell us if
we're affecting function.

370
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:27,898
But if we track Lana's vocal
function during the operation,

371
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,577
it will help us avoid the
speech center nerve tracts.

372
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,214
You want to operate on
her while she's awake?

373
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,218
We can barely get answers
out of her at the best of times.

374
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,431
How do you think it'll go while her
skull is open in the middle of an OR?

375
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,890
Well, it's a good thing she
has a roommate who can help.

376
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,298
It's hard to walk away.

377
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,774
We get angry, we
want to run away,

378
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,671
but when it's family...

379
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:06,969
I'm not angry.

380
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,244
When I got the call
telling me she was here,

381
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,783
all I could think about was
how my lousy, bitter mother

382
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,824
was about to die alone.

383
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,094
That it wasn't her fault,
it was just her nature.

384
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,767
So, I needed to be
here, to let her know

385
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:34,068
that she was loved,
in spite of everything.

386
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,168
And then I found
out about Teresa.

387
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,709
Saw them together.

388
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,643
Saw that my mother
was capable of caring,

389
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,317
capable of warmth and love.

390
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,026
Just not for me.

391
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,710
<i>Dr. Park, please
report to ICU 2.</i>

392
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,346
She's bleeding from her cannula
site. She's intolerant to the ECMO.

393
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,170
We can't wait for the new heart.

394
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,039
We have to try and
repair this one ourselves.

395
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,389
China thinks
Sunny's heart failure

396
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,926
is most likely due to a
broken blade in the impeller.

397
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,838
They're suggesting
we weld it back together

398
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,388
using an intraoperative
device, which we don't have.

399
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,493
We could repair it
with fibrin BioGlue.

400
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,666
The blade spins at 1,200
RPMs. The glue won't hold.

401
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,702
What if we use the schematics
to 3D-print a new impeller?

402
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,674
The plastic replacement
probably wouldn't hold up long term.

403
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,169
We don't need long term.

404
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,405
We just need it to work until the
replacement arrives from China.

405
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,761
Let's get these to the lab.

406
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,648
- You need me in the OR?
- Yes.

407
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,254
While you operate on her
brain with her head open?

408
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,285
You wouldn't be able
to see what we're doing.

409
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,734
You won't see any blood...

410
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,728
What's the central
illuminance of the OR?

411
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,391
- I don't know.
- 140,000 lux.

412
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,306
140,000 lux is way
worse than a grocery store.

413
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,404
I can't go to grocery stores.

414
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,544
We can provide you
with protective gear

415
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,943
and eye shades that can
filter out some of the lights.

416
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,010
Bright lights are like
needles in my eyes.

417
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,223
<i>Megasoma actaeon.</i>

418
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,023
Found in Guyana.

419
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,923
It's the heaviest insect in the world and
weighs as much as 300 grasshoppers.

420
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,862
Do you like playing
insect trivia with Lana?

421
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,138
This is crazy. You shouldn't
do it because of trivia night.

422
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,474
You should do it
because you love her.

423
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,806
Your life is better with her.

424
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,614
You're a better person with her.

425
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,186
You need her.
That's what love is.

426
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,890
Do it because you love her.

427
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,594
I don't love her.

428
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,828
She's my roommate.

429
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,253
The impeller blades are fine.

430
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,582
The bearings are
functioning properly.

431
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,519
Electrical consumption is good.

432
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,771
Maybe the machine
isn't the problem.

433
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,431
Heart failure is either caused

434
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,834
by insufficient pumping
or constricted outflow.

435
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,771
Since her pump is fine...

436
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,835
She doesn't have
valvular stenosis.

437
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,778
The surgeons removed her aortic
valve when they implanted this device.

438
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,640
It could be the aorta itself.

439
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,051
If it narrowed, that
would reduce her outflow,

440
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,346
cause her pressure to drop.

441
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,532
If we do an intraop-angio,
we'd see evidence of that.

442
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,048
Call X-ray. Have them
bring a C-arm, stat.

443
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,260
Dr. Glassman.

444
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,965
I got you cherry Gastrolyte.

445
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,663
Shaun, I'm fine. You
can go back to work.

446
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,831
At the Nathan
County Fair, I was 14,

447
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,569
and you got a cherry
slushy and said it was your...

448
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,539
Why do you have an IV?

449
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,575
It's just fluid, Shaun,
with potassium.

450
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,313
I had a nurse come
by from the hospital.

451
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,752
I could have done this.

452
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,225
You're busy.

453
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,185
I'm helping you.

454
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,289
You wouldn't need the
fluids if you listened to me.

455
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,397
I know.

456
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,924
You didn't drink the Gastrolyte
I brought you, but now...

457
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,570
Shaun, my head
really hurts right now.

458
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,271
How long have you
been experiencing pain?

459
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,405
It pretty much never stops.

460
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,505
That's not true.

461
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,278
I asked you if you were in pain
last night and you said you weren't.

462
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,582
I was in pain last night, Shaun.
I just didn't want you to worry.

463
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,360
Why would you lie
about a symptom?

464
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,995
Why would you lie, Dr. Glassman?

465
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,258
This could...

466
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,366
This is why, Shaun. This is why.

467
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,803
I can handle the pain. I
can handle the nausea...

468
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,633
- You have nausea?
- Yes, yes, I have nausea.

469
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,903
Okay, you should
stop the PCV chemo.

470
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,407
- Shaun...
- Okay. You should stop.

471
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,711
- I'm going to call Dr. Blaize.
- No, Shaun! No!

472
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,080
I am trying to help you.

473
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:54,223
I am trying to help you, but
you are not a compliant patient.

474
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,784
You don't rest...

475
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,556
- Shaun.
- When I tell you to rest.

476
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,463
You don't follow the
diet that I am giving you.

477
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,931
Shaun, will you just go,
please? Will you just go?

478
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,966
I promised that
I would help you.

479
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,165
You're not my doctor, Shaun!

480
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,834
I don't...

481
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:17,877
I don't want you here.

482
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,445
I'm sorry. I don't
want you here.

483
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,096
I don't know how to help you.

484
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,463
Then stop trying.

485
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,368
You're not helping.

486
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,709
You can't help, Shaun.

487
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:13,367
He's in pain and frustrated and
nauseous, and taking it out on you.

488
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:17,634
He's in pain and frustrated and
nauseous, and I can't help him.

489
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,807
- That may be true.
- So, what do I do?

490
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,582
When there is nothing you
can do, you have to accept that.

491
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,985
You have to stop trying to help.

492
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:35,585
That's what he said.

493
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:46,604
Thank you, Lea.

494
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,641
My life is better with you.

495
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,078
Mine, too.

496
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,071
We're in the aorta now.

497
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,036
If there is a narrowing, we should
see a sudden rise in pressure.

498
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,634
We should be able to replace

499
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,324
the narrowed part
with a graft. Metz.

500
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,491
This is a...

501
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,636
Horse.

502
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,606
This is a...

503
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,602
Lana, what do you see here?

504
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,709
We need you to
keep talking to us.

505
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,288
- Have we already done damage?
- It's too soon, I think.

506
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,381
We need to stop.

507
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,153
If we leave the AVM intact
and it ruptures, it will kill her.

508
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,268
Lana, do you understand?

509
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,139
I have to keep going,
but if you stop talking,

510
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,471
you may never talk again.

511
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,586
Hand me the bipolar forceps.

512
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:47,056
Dr. Lim, there's a Javi Maldonado
insisting he should be in here.

513
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,841
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
The surgery was a success.

514
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,711
You can see her
once she wakes up.

515
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,023
Thank you.

516
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,668
She wasn't great with you,
but she's great with Teresa.

517
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,035
That doesn't mean she
loves her more than you.

518
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,277
May just mean...

519
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,940
She's not the same
person anymore.

520
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,285
As soon as she saw me,
she started giving me crap.

521
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,387
The same crap.

522
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,283
Actually, the first
thing she said was,

523
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,625
"You look pretty."

524
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,147
Lana, what's on the screen?

525
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,345
A lion.

526
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,097
And what is that?

527
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,798
Lana, what's on the screen?

528
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,612
Javi?

529
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,985
Madagascan hissing cockroach.

530
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,960
<i>Gromphadorhina portentosa.</i>

531
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,695
One of the few insects

532
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:20,104
who give birth to live young,
rather than laying eggs.

533
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,707
Keep going. You
both are doing great.

534
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,882
Long-tailed South
African scorpion.

535
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,515
<i>Hadogenes troglodytes.</i>

536
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:36,590
Reaches a length of over eight
inches, the longest scorpion in the world.

537
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,562
You'll still need to fly to
China to get checked out,

538
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,794
but everything looks great.

539
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:45,660
Thank you.

540
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,037
Mom, Grace is outside.

541
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,378
- I think you should talk to her.
- Why?

542
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,345
Because she's your daughter.

543
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,859
- I'll step out.
- It's okay.

544
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
Mom.

545
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,336
Since we stopped talking,

546
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,775
there hasn't been a day I
haven't thought about you.

547
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,578
That I haven't missed you.

548
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,611
I'm sorry,

549
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,351
for everything.

550
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,792
I sat in the back,

551
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,804
at the Troubadour.

552
00:37:56,541 --> 00:38:00,103
You were singing <i>I Wish It
Would Rain</i> with that band.

553
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,111
I cried.

554
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,114
It was beautiful.

555
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,194
Can you tell me your name?

556
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,637
Do you remember your name?

557
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,308
Of course I remember my name.

558
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,619
Lana.

559
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,154
And you're Javi.

560
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,460
I think I love you.

561
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,025
I think you do, too.

562
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,412
Do you want to stay in bed
with me after we have sex?

563
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,239
No.

564
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,787
Dr. Glassman?

565
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,294
Dr. Glassman?

566
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,100
I'm not here to help.

567
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,182
<i>Take me to the station</i>

568
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:30,881
<i>And put me on a train</i>

569
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,890
<i>I got no expectations</i>

570
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,825
<i>To pass through here again</i>

571
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:47,432
<i>Once I was a rich man</i>

572
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,341
<i>Now I am so poor</i>

573
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:59,280
<i>But never in my sweet short life</i>

574
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,346
<i>Have I felt like this before</i>

575
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,845
Thank you.
