1
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,506
Good morning.

2
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,777
What time is it?

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,282
6:28.

4
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,491
You should be asleep,
but I'm glad you're not.

5
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:29,029
Your post-op pathology
and MRI results are finally in,

6
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,353
and...

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,389
They're good.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,459
Very good.

9
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,067
Was the pause
for dramatic effect?

10
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,597
Yes.

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,138
The surgery was a success.

12
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,178
The only thing you
need now is rest.

13
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,278
And chemo and radiation.

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,920
Have you been here all night?

15
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,022
I slept in a chair in the lab.

16
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,921
Well, you should go
home and go to sleep.

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,521
I can't go home.

18
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,133
My next shift
starts in 31 minutes.

19
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,198
The surgery was a success.

20
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:28,415
<i>I used to think maybe you
loved me Now baby I'm sure</i>

21
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:35,962
<i>And I just can't wait till the
day When you knock on my door</i>

22
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,460
<i>I'm walking on sunshine Wow!</i>

23
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,899
<i>I'm walking on sunshine Wow!</i>

24
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,479
<i>And don't it feel good</i>

25
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,414
<i>Hey, all right now And
don't it feel good, hey</i>

26
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,955
The surgery was a success.

27
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,984
All Dr. Glassman
needs now is rest.

28
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,421
- That's great news.
- And chemo and radiation.

29
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,985
How are you?

30
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,999
I don't need rest. I fell
asleep in a comfortable chair.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,365
Good. Someone screwed
up the on-call schedule

32
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,669
and left the ER short-staffed.

33
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,471
I need two
volunteers to fill in.

34
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,148
Good news is, you won't have
me breathing down your neck.

35
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,676
Bad news is, it's
a 36-hour shift.

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,614
This new flex-time
policy is ridiculous.

37
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,447
Aren't our salaries
low enough already?

38
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,679
It's not about the money.

39
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,391
Andrews believes that
surgeons need to be at their best

40
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,891
even when they're exhausted.

41
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,154
The only way for residents
to learn it is to do it.

42
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,820
You gotta practice
like you play.

43
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,797
And you can't do
either without sleep.

44
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,294
You're free to take it up
with Andrews anytime.

45
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,493
Pick a number
between one and five.

46
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,168
Two-point-five.

47
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,372
- One.
- No, that's not between...

48
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,136
- Five.
- Three.

49
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,210
Oh, damn it.

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:06,013
Good news. Dr. Melendez won't
be breathing down our necks.

51
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,015
You're second-year residents.
This is a great opportunity

52
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,720
for you to prove that you don't
need a babysitter anymore.

53
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,195
And I have a ton of personal
crap I gotta take care of today,

54
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:22,429
so I'm on-call, but don't call me
unless you absolutely need to.

55
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,547
But you better not need to.

56
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,904
We've got an MI in One, and
a compound femur in Two...

57
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,373
I'm gonna kill that bastard!

58
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,000
He's dead! I'm gonna kill him!

59
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,842
And a bleeding, angry
drunk guy in Five.

60
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,075
Get your hands off of me!

61
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,208
What the hell are
you looking at?

62
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,141
Excising the endometrial lesions
should only take about an hour.

63
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,067
We'll be operating through a
single incision in your belly button.

64
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,761
You won't even be
able to see the scar.

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,468
How can you operate
through such a small opening?

66
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,235
It's a new technique
using a single port

67
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,368
divided into sections for
the camera and our tools.

68
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,944
New?

69
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,638
To them. Don't
worry. It isn't to me.

70
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,243
I'm confident that this will resolve
your pain and infertility issues.

71
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,643
Thank you, all of you.

72
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,556
Being a mother is
all I've ever wanted.

73
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,790
On our first date, she
told me the babies' names

74
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,105
she'd picked out.

75
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,461
We were 17.

76
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,395
So, let's hear 'em.

77
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,395
Jackson for a boy,
and Cameron for a girl.

78
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,597
Very nice. I like them.

79
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,900
So do I.

80
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,769
And you are going to
be an amazing mother.

81
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,176
Very soon.

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,339
Let's get her prepped.

83
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,847
I thought it was just
because she was so pretty,

84
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,946
and, uh, it had been a while.

85
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,092
But after she left,

86
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,250
it stayed.

87
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,594
You think she roofied
me with Viagra?

88
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,462
Sure, that could've happened.

89
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,653
Or maybe it was the alcohol,

90
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,633
marijuana and Molly
you pre-gamed with.

91
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,672
A lot of different drugs
can cause priapism.

92
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,866
Especially those
cooked up in a garage.

93
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,271
Is it okay if I touch it?

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,335
Uh, okay. Uh...

95
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,515
Rigid corpora cavernosa
and flaccid glans.

96
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,650
What's that mean?
What's she getting?

97
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,485
It's been over four hours. You
don't want necrosis to set in.

98
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,652
Necrosis? Are you saying
that my penis could die?

99
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,695
It could, but it won't because
we are gonna move fast.

100
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,175
What the hell are you
gonna do with that?

101
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,192
We need to remove the deoxygenated
blood to restore circulation.

102
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,669
You're gonna feel a small
pinch, and then pressure.

103
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,795
Is she lying?

104
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,132
I'm not sure.

105
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,710
Holy mother of God, that hurts!

106
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,244
Wow!

107
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,783
I go out for a short walk to
have one moment of peace,

108
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,551
and this is what I come home to.

109
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,816
What's the problem?

110
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,772
His mouth was obviously
big enough to get it in.

111
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,419
He must've strained
his masseter.

112
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,227
It's gone into spasm
and caused lockjaw.

113
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,661
So, give him a sedative
and pry it with a McIvor.

114
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,567
I tried. It won't budge.

115
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,432
- And he said it hurt like son-of-a...
- Inez.

116
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,035
That's what he said.

117
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,472
I put in a bite-block,
but I don't know...

118
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,569
Call Lim.

119
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,719
We're supposed to be
proving our independence.

120
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,081
I will try again
with the McIvor.

121
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,033
You don't wanna
tear the masseter.

122
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,526
If the bite-block
slips, and he gags,

123
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,529
he will have broken glass
and vomit in his lungs.

124
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,664
I could put him under,

125
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,464
then I can dislocate
his jaw if I have to.

126
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,765
We definitely can't do
that without calling Lim.

127
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,200
That's true.

128
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,708
I hope we don't interrupt
anything important.

129
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,609
Don't worry. She's either
sleeping or doing laundry.

130
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,908
There's nothing
interesting in her life.

131
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,642
Not guilty.

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,048
Do you have something
against traffic school?

133
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,819
Your Honor, the defendant's
not eligible for traffic school.

134
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,655
This is her third moving
violation in the last year.

135
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,127
Alleged violation,
thank you very much.

136
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,722
Traveling 100 miles per
hour on a motorcycle?

137
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,097
Do you have a death wish?

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,896
I wasn't going
anywhere near 100.

139
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,562
So, how fast were you going?

140
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,661
Excellent question.

141
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,052
And one I assure you the officer

142
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,234
who issued my ticket
will not be able to answer.

143
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,141
California State
Vehicle code mandates

144
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,236
that all LIDAR speed
measurement devices

145
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,750
be calibrated at least once
a... I'm sorry. I need to get this.

146
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,808
No, you need to turn it off.

147
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,417
Your Honor, I'm a trauma
surgeon at Saint Bonaventure,

148
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,921
and I'm on call, so...

149
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,256
Five minutes.

150
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,691
The court is adjourned
for a five-minute recess.

151
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,570
<i>I thought I was clear.</i>

152
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,927
I'm available to help with
stuff you can't do on your own.

153
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,398
Uncle Fester Junior
does not qualify.

154
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,933
I think the situation warrants
putting him under a general...

155
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,599
And dislocating his jaw?
He's not a damn snake.

156
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,307
So, what should we do?

157
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,469
Prove to me you're as
capable as I think you are.

158
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,745
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

159
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,941
We are the only hospital
on the West Coast

160
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,348
that hasn't adopted
the ACGME mandate

161
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,942
on a 24-hour max shift length.

162
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,751
And numerous studies have shown

163
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,433
the negative effects
that sleep deprivation

164
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,016
has on critical thinking,

165
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,923
which can cause
residents to make mistakes

166
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,964
that not only harm patients,
but that waste money.

167
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,664
You've done your homework.

168
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,996
Um, it's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

169
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,197
I actually did a paper
on it at med school.

170
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,833
Well, Dr. Browne, I've
also thought about it.

171
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,173
In fact, when the new ACGME
guidelines were released,

172
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,077
I joined a nationwide study
analyzing a flex-time schedule.

173
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:39,116
It found that as long as a weekly
max of 80 hours is adhered to,

174
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,019
patient outcomes and resident
satisfaction scores are better

175
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,920
than at hospitals
with a daily max.

176
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,369
So, we're just going to
have to agree to disagree

177
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,693
about whether my foolish
new policies make any sense.

178
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,796
No, I didn't say...

179
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,628
Now, I know I told you
to be more assertive,

180
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,245
but you also need to make
sure that you don't forsake

181
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,364
your normally excellent
judgment in that effort.

182
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,845
Excuse me, yeah.
Hi. I'm sorry. I'm back.

183
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,043
How wonderful. Take a
seat until your case is called.

184
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,246
My case was called.

185
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,255
You said I could have
a five-minute break.

186
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,154
The court took a
five-minute break.

187
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,523
Yours is going to be
considerably longer.

188
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,664
Continue.

189
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,545
Make a stab incision
with an 11 blade,

190
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,764
and I'll insert the Veress.

191
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,335
He'll get over it. Don't worry.

192
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,143
Andrews just likes to hammer
a nail every now and then.

193
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,514
I didn't call him a fool. I just
said his policy didn't make sense.

194
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,281
Insufflation's complete.
Ready for the multi-port.

195
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,225
You said it didn't make sense,

196
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,687
and he explained that in his
opinion it did. What's the problem?

197
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,764
The problem is men who
tell women to be assertive,

198
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,392
then as soon as we
are, they criticize us for it.

199
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,793
We're the bitch.

200
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,569
You didn't call him a fool.
He didn't call you a bitch.

201
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,971
Not to her face.

202
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:12,273
He just suggested she choose
her words more carefully.

203
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,274
So, women have to be
assertive, but careful?

204
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,613
When you're talking to your
boss, yes. Everyone does.

205
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,654
If you're all done debating,
this boss could use some help.

206
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,726
You see that?

207
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,920
There are lesions on her ovary.

208
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,326
That wasn't visible
on the imaging.

209
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,790
It's small.

210
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,099
We can excise it without
damaging the ovary, but...

211
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,802
There are others.

212
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,875
Bowel, bladder, uterus.

213
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,774
No wonder she's
been in so much pain.

214
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,743
We'll start with the
fallopian lesions,

215
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,183
and just go one by one.

216
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,473
Browne, I need you to scrub
out and brief the husband.

217
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,587
Explain the endometriosis is
way more severe than we thought.

218
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,186
Why me? Why not Park?

219
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,838
Because I think you're better
at talking to anxious relatives.

220
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,921
Is there a problem?

221
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,688
No.

222
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,471
Retract that tissue.

223
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,144
Why is she so on edge today?

224
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,505
No idea.

225
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,378
It's one of those days.

226
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,983
I didn't mean one
of "those" days.

227
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,525
I just meant people wake up

228
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,185
on the wrong side
of the bed sometimes.

229
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,964
Dr. Browne explained
exactly why she was on edge.

230
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,593
Did you forget already, or were
you just not listening to begin with?

231
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,002
Excuse me?

232
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,361
We should cut back
on the conversation

233
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,969
and focus on the procedure.

234
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,402
I agree.

235
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,308
I wanna see her.

236
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,511
I'm sorry. You
can't go into the OR.

237
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,330
I'll just... I'll just look
through the window. Please.

238
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,982
Daniel, trust me.

239
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,184
Seeing your beautiful
wife on the operating table

240
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,920
is not gonna make
you less anxious.

241
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,064
Hey, everything
is under control.

242
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,502
The only thing that's changed is
how long the surgery's gonna take.

243
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,210
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

244
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,071
I... I don't mean to be a pain.

245
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,706
You're not a pain. You're
just scared. I would be too.

246
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,949
She's getting the best care
possible, and as soon as we're done,

247
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,750
we'll bring you to her.

248
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,349
Thank you.

249
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,092
Okay.

250
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,453
You're good at this.

251
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,044
Shouldn't you be in the ER?

252
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,172
Lea keeps calling me.

253
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:06,217
She wants to talk about why I
told her to go back to Hershey.

254
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,278
You told Lea to go
back to Hershey?

255
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,653
I thought it would
solve the problem,

256
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,159
but, no, no, it just
made it worse.

257
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,163
Now she wants to talk about it
more, but there's no more to be said.

258
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,291
That's not the way
it works, Shaun.

259
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,595
It can't just be one person
who does the talking.

260
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,969
You have to listen, too.

261
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:30,510
I don't want to listen to her.
It's too hard. It's too hard.

262
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,670
Well, relationships
aren't always easy.

263
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,543
They get complicated and messy.

264
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,947
Exactly. That's
why I don't want one.

265
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,653
Well, that's not true.

266
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,248
The reason that you left
the ER to come talk to me

267
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,986
is because we
have a relationship,

268
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,457
and we both benefit from it.

269
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,462
Lea's your friend. You can't
just wall yourself off from people

270
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,264
in the hope that
you'll never get hurt.

271
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:04,003
Oh, we need to wall it
off so he doesn't get hurt.

272
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,585
Stay calm, buddy.

273
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,449
Just relax your throat and
breathe through your nose.

274
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,582
Clamp.

275
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,442
- Got it.
- Cool!

276
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,546
Now bite down.

277
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,753
This is a surgical pouch. It
can't even be cut by a scalpel.

278
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,294
Come on, you can do it.

279
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:55,958
On the count of
three. One, two, three.

280
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,358
- Inez!
- What? He was being a total wuss.

281
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,740
That was amazing.

282
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,757
You wanna create a plane

283
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,273
between the outer serosa
and muscularis layer

284
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,908
to avoid disrupting the lumen.

285
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,744
Everything go okay
with the husband?

286
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,819
Yes. And, uh, I apologize.

287
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,564
I shouldn't have
questioned your decision.

288
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,018
It's all good.

289
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,856
Two fallopian lesions
down, and one more to go.

290
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,242
You wanna take the
wheel on the next one?

291
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,325
Sure.

292
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Figures.

293
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,401
Nurse Flores, do you have a problem
with Dr. Browne taking the lead?

294
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,239
No. I just find it interesting

295
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,944
that you only gave her the
opportunity after she apologized.

296
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,039
You can scrub out.

297
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,986
No. I'll stay.

298
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,391
I'm not asking, I'm
ordering. Scrub out.

299
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,768
No, I've done nothing wrong.

300
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,271
You're undermining my
management of this procedure.

301
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,093
By answering a
question you asked me?

302
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,530
By making snide comments
questioning my judgment.

303
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,036
I'm not leaving my post,

304
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,832
so why don't we
just get back to work?

305
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,338
You, me and Andrews
will be discussing this later.

306
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,511
I look forward to it.

307
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,494
I'm gonna need more saline now!

308
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,509
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

309
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,558
Have you eaten?

310
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,893
Not yet.

311
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,603
I'll get lunch
after I finish this.

312
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,300
Lunch? It's almost 5:00.

313
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,575
Then dinner.

314
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,877
Look, I'll go now, I'm
starving. I'll be back in 30.

315
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,813
Hey, your erection's back.

316
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,418
She's not talking about me.

317
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,921
Thirty-day suspended
sentence and a $700 fine.

318
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,963
Take all these
documents to room 306.

319
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,190
Mr. Alex Leon.

320
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,869
No way, Your Honor.
I've been waiting patiently.

321
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,029
We'll get to you.

322
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,868
When? At 4:59, so you can
tell me you've run out of time

323
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,817
and make me come back
to do this all over again?

324
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,886
Well, I guess we'll just have
to see about that, won't we?

325
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,004
No, we won't. Take a seat, kid.

326
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,173
Your Honor, I am so sorry

327
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,413
that my two-minute phone call was
such an incredible inconvenience,

328
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,921
but I went out of my way to be
here today to have my case heard.

329
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,787
And that is exactly
what I'm gonna do. Now.

330
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,801
Can I have
Dr. Lim's file, please?

331
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,535
Thank you.

332
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,247
And I promise
this won't take long,

333
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,069
because as I
started to explain...

334
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,537
Guilty. $1,500 fine and
license suspension for one year.

335
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,410
The bailiff will have some paperwork
for you to sign on the way out.

336
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
You can't do that.

337
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,846
I have a thick book in
my office that says I can.

338
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,078
No. This is America.

339
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,781
I pay taxes, which pay
your salary by the way.

340
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,000
- I wouldn't go there.
- Oh, I'm definitely going there.

341
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,993
I strongly advise you
don't say another word.

342
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,392
You can appeal this
verdict to a different judge.

343
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,422
I don't want a different judge. I
want this one to do her damn job!

344
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,843
We keep the TP up front. Just
give a yell if you need some.

345
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,543
Is it gonna die?

346
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,988
Just relax. Everything's
under control.

347
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,891
That's not a no.

348
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,489
We're gonna review your lab
results, and we'll be right back.

349
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,939
Excuse me. We've
already reviewed his labs.

350
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,498
There's no sign of a malignancy,
sickle cell, lymphoma or leukemia.

351
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,271
I know. I just need
a minute to think.

352
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,471
I think we should...

353
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,740
No, we're not calling Lim.

354
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,991
We got our asses
chewed out last time,

355
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,540
and this is not life and death.

356
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,417
We can inject diluted phenylephrine
every five minutes for an hour.

357
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,991
That's a lot of
injections in his penis.

358
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,986
I'll give him a lidocaine local.

359
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,153
Fine. A dorsal nerve block.

360
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,508
- You guys are such wimps.
- That much phenylephrine

361
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,524
could also cause a
hypertensive crisis.

362
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,831
Okay, Dr. No, what's
your idea, then?

363
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,271
You already rejected it.

364
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,342
We are not calling Lim.

365
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,914
Are you awake?

366
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,214
Yes.

367
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,222
If a patient has reoccurring
low-flow priapism,

368
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,163
but there is no sign of sickle
cell, blood dyscrasia or Hodgkin's...

369
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,723
Why are you asking
me? I'm a neurosurgeon.

370
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,201
My work is up
here, not down there.

371
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,933
Because Morgan
won't let me ask...

372
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,530
Dr. Glassman,

373
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,133
why do you ignore
Dr. Ko's medical advice?

374
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,267
I'm not.

375
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,245
Really? She advised you do
consults from your ICU bed?

376
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,907
I didn't ask him
to come in here.

377
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,208
Go to sleep.

378
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,427
What do you think
I've been trying to do

379
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,920
for the last 14 hours
and... What time is it?

380
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,546
8:17.

381
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,885
Forty-seven minutes.

382
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:03,122
I would like some more
morphine, please, and an Ambien.

383
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,888
You know you can't have either.

384
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,934
Well, then, how the hell
am I supposed to fall asleep?

385
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,832
Every time I turn,
I strangle myself.

386
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,631
You nurses come
here every 30 minutes

387
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,467
to steal my bodily fluids.

388
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,684
Have you tried easing
yourself onto your side

389
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,085
and putting a pillow
between your legs?

390
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,944
Of course, that's the problem. I
don't know how to use a pillow.

391
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,976
Try it. And I will turn
the light all the way off,

392
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,483
and Dr. Murphy
will leave you alone.

393
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,287
Winter's procedure.

394
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,618
It's not the solution,

395
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,321
but it'll buy you enough time
to maybe find another one.

396
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,429
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

397
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,859
Goodnight, Dr. Glassman.

398
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,460
Seems like for every lesion
we excise, we find two more.

399
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,631
- What time is it?
- 1:12 in the morning.

400
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,135
My bladder is about to burst.

401
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,104
After I finish this one,
I'm gonna take a break.

402
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,538
While I'm out,
Park, you take over.

403
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,185
Start on the lesions I
showed you on the bladder,

404
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,905
but be careful...

405
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,307
Her pressure's dropping.

406
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,614
She's bleeding out.
I can't see anything.

407
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,210
We're taking out the scope.
We're gonna have to open her up.

408
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,848
I've got two units
on the rapid infuser.

409
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,584
MAP is still hovering at 60.

410
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,048
As fast as I can.

411
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,320
Paint her with chlorhexidine

412
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,971
and don't make a
Picasso. It's a crash lap.

413
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,515
- On it.
- Knife.

414
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,961
Yeah, the bleeding's
under control.

415
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,244
What about her bladder?

416
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,211
There's infiltrating
lesions all over it.

417
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,388
Even the walls are involved.

418
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,516
We're gonna have to remove it.

419
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,659
And give her a urostomy bag?
There has to be another option.

420
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,389
If I had another
option, Nurse Flores,

421
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,724
I would've suggested it.

422
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:33,043
What if we excise part of her
bowel, reconstruct a bladder?

423
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,512
That's a lot more
dangerous than...

424
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,048
Making a 28-year-old
woman urinate

425
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,226
through a hole in her
abdomen for the rest of her life?

426
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,850
I think the additional
risk is worth it.

427
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,387
See if the husband agrees.

428
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,621
- Okay, I'll go.
- No, Park will.

429
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,231
And while he does, I
want everyone but JL,

430
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,091
Dr. Browne and Nurse
Flores to clear the OR.

431
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,925
You, monitor the patient. You
two, we need to have a talk.

432
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,531
Do I have a choice?

433
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,106
Do you want to keep a
fully-functioning penis?

434
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,404
- Of course.
- Then no.

435
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,738
That's even bigger
than it was last time.

436
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:13,817
Winter's procedure requires
an extra-large-gauge needle

437
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,253
to poke a hole big enough
to restore blood flow.

438
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,800
We'll give you a
lidocaine nerve block.

439
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:19,824
You won't feel a thing.

440
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,118
Why wasn't I
given that last time?

441
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,593
The risk wasn't worth it before.

442
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,288
Trust me, it was
worth before too.

443
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,431
Good choice.
We'll be right back.

444
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,334
You said we needed
to do this now.

445
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,307
We do. I just need to confer
with my colleague for a moment.

446
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,916
You talking to Lim
behind my back?

447
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:44,983
No.

448
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,916
Don't lie. You're
not good at it.

449
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,948
I saw you delete her text.

450
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,665
I knew Glassman didn't
give you the Winter's idea.

451
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,853
The text wasn't from
Dr. Lim. It was from Lea.

452
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,856
If it was from Lea, then
why'd you delete it so fast?

453
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,156
Claire thinks I shouldn't
push a good friend away,

454
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,498
but thinking about her...

455
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,732
I don't want to talk to her.

456
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,908
You shouldn't listen
to them. Either of them.

457
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,843
Lea and Claire are
nice to you, but...

458
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,517
They're not your friends.

459
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,385
They wanna take care
of you, like a cute pet.

460
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,392
They take you seriously as
a doctor, but not as a man.

461
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,790
Lea kissed me,

462
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,801
after we sang karaoke.

463
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,207
Shaun, it was a pity kiss.

464
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,044
You've never even met Lea.

465
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,477
True. But I know that
she's not in middle school,

466
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,283
which means if she really
thought of you as a man,

467
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,047
she wouldn't have settled
for just one innocent peck.

468
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,789
I just...

469
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,354
What are you looking at?

470
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,463
Hey, Shaun.

471
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,860
What's going on?

472
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,780
I thought I couldn't be
released until I was arraigned.

473
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,103
Judge decided nine hours
was enough punishment.

474
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,775
She's the one who should
be punished. I should sue her.

475
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,808
What you should do is
learn to keep your mouth shut.

476
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,377
You're lucky I'm hungry.

477
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,483
This stops now. We
need to work together.

478
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,153
We are. That's how we came up
with the idea to rebuild her bladder.

479
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,771
There's a way to offer your input
without undermining my authority.

480
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,730
The only thing that
undermines your authority

481
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,426
is your comments about
Dr. Browne's supposed PMS.

482
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,560
- What?
- I never said you had PMS.

483
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,638
I just asked Park if he knew why
you were more irritable than usual.

484
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,782
I'm not irritable,

485
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,806
and I'm not a whiner!

486
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,818
- I never said you were...
- You told me to take it up with Andrews.

487
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,209
- This was your idea.
- If anyone's a whiner, it's you.

488
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,391
That's enough!

489
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,947
You're 12 hours into an operation
you thought would take one,

490
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,495
so I think it's safe to say you're
all more irritable than usual,

491
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,885
but you need to get a grip.

492
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,966
Dr. Melendez, maybe it's
time you took a little break.

493
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,618
Get an energy
bar and some juice.

494
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,957
- I don't need a...
- Do it anyway.

495
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,295
And when he gets back, I
expect everyone in this OR

496
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,997
to conduct themselves with
the utmost professionalism.

497
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,746
Can I get two
brisket tacos, please?

498
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,469
You know what?
Actually, make it three.

499
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,444
Thank you.

500
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,105
You're out of order!

501
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,274
Hmm.

502
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,812
She's out of order!

503
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,886
This whole traffic-court
hearing is out of order!

504
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,853
Okay, very funny, smart-ass.

505
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,816
Actually, I gotta
give you props.

506
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,156
You were right about
the LIDAR calibration.

507
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,320
- Hmm.
- If your phone hadn't rung,

508
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,126
you might've gotten off.

509
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,628
Next time, I will
turn my phone off.

510
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,865
Next time? You're
done. Case closed.

511
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,169
You're gonna start having to work
on upping your ride-share rating.

512
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,504
I'm obviously gonna appeal.

513
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,737
She was biased
against me from the start.

514
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,678
I see it all the time. Women
in power are worse than men.

515
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:37,706
No comment.

516
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,078
Order up. Brisket tacos.

517
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,049
Thanks.

518
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,660
- Oh, thank you.
- You want one?

519
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:53,864
I would love a beer, but I can't.
I'm on call for the next 17 hours.

520
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,400
You're still on call?

521
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,080
What would you have done if they
needed you while you were locked up?

522
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,882
I would've had them phone
my secondary coverage.

523
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,340
- Hmm. Hmm.
- I didn't see the point

524
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,568
in waking another doctor.

525
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,372
Or publicizing your predicament.

526
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,671
I'm competing for a promotion.

527
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,214
I didn't feel the need to
tell my boss I was locked up

528
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,548
unless I absolutely
had to. No harm, no foul.

529
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,199
Husband consented. We're
good to go whenever you are.

530
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,497
Scrub back in.
I'll be right there.

531
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,246
Oh, I'm gonna kill them.

532
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,610
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

533
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,445
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

534
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,114
What?

535
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:53,090
We had a patient come in this
morning with low-flow priapism.

536
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,424
We thought it was drug-induced,
but then I noticed a foot drop...

537
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,588
<i>Cut to the chase.</i>

538
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,132
We found an epidural abscess
with pelvic extension, and...

539
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,099
Get him prepped.
I'll be there in 15.

540
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,329
- What?
- I gotta go.

541
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,667
No. Is someone dying?

542
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,312
Not if I can get there in time.

543
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,604
Oh, um,

544
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,340
can you give me a ride?

545
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,783
Irrigate with
diluted bacitracin.

546
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,150
Morgan, irrigation.

547
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,660
Sorry, it's been a long day.

548
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,830
And you only have another
nine-and-a-half hours to go.

549
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,531
Only nine hours, 21 minutes.

550
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,499
Browne's right. This
flex-time schedule is absurd.

551
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,296
Yeah, it has its drawbacks.

552
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,173
But if this penis had been
passed on to the next shift,

553
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,753
they would've assumed
you missed something,

554
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,212
and they would've done
a whole new workup.

555
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,712
The delay could've
paralyzed him.

556
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,348
Or maybe they
wouldn't be so tired,

557
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,816
and would've noticed
the foot drop faster.

558
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,252
Guys, you're doing fine.

559
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,166
And you'll get
used to the fatigue.

560
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,022
After a while, it won't
even bother you.

561
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,125
It's easy for you to say.

562
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,313
You were on home call,
chilling on your couch all day.

563
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,235
Good point.

564
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,642
Orthotopic
neobladder's in place.

565
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,974
Let's make sure it drains
properly before we move on.

566
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,245
Flow looks good.

567
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,905
Hold on. Push it back again.

568
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,415
What's that, at the
base of the uterus?

569
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,312
It looks dusky.

570
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,908
Can I get some more dye?

571
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,265
That's a polyploid mass.

572
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,000
It extends from the
uterine to the ovarian artery.

573
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,703
All collateral blood
supplies have been invaded.

574
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,244
We're gonna have to
do a full hysterectomy.

575
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,514
What if we resect the mass and
graft the saphenous vein for bypass?

576
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,242
Risk of graft occlusion is
too high. She'd go septic.

577
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,261
The last thing she told us

578
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,325
was her lifelong dream
was to be a mother.

579
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,228
It's an innovative idea, but...

580
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:14,958
It's not our decision.

581
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,578
I'll scrub out and
talk to the husband.

582
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,468
No, I'll do it.

583
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,587
No, I can't make that
decision for my wife.

584
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,911
Yes, you can. You've
already done it once.

585
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,181
This is different.

586
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,988
But this is what Gina wants.
It's why she made you her proxy.

587
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,682
No, I'm her proxy
because she didn't think

588
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,056
she should ask her mother
and sisters to fly from Maine

589
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,720
for a minor surgery.

590
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,763
Look, you have to call them.

591
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:49,299
No, Gina chose you.

592
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:54,296
You are the one who knows
her, who truly understands her.

593
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,270
What would she want us to do?

594
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,571
I don't... I don't know.

595
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,839
I mean, how can any man...

596
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,484
Please, just tell me what to do.

597
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,181
I met her yesterday,
I barely know her.

598
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,333
So, you can be objective,
you can make the right call.

599
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,669
No, Gina didn't choose someone
to be objective, she chose you.

600
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,337
- Please, just tell me what to do.
- I can't.

601
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,761
You have to, because I won't!

602
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,227
I can't do that to her.

603
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,295
Please, just... Just help me.

604
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,269
Whatever you say, that's...

605
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,772
That's what I'll do.

606
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,841
Whatever you say.

607
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,647
<i>Do you feel sorry for me?</i>

608
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,051
Why would I?

609
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:47,221
Morgan says Lea is only nice to
me because she feels sorry for me.

610
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,856
Does Morgan have a theory
for why Morgan is so nice to you?

611
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,364
I'm being honest,
which is better than nice.

612
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,831
Cut this fibrinous tissue.

613
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:56,960
Bipolar.

614
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,633
Some women put a
guy in the friend zone,

615
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,641
and they end up treating him
more like a pet than a person.

616
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,356
Morgan has a point.
Some women do that.

617
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,804
But the only way to find out if
Lea does that is to talk to her.

618
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,342
The wound is clean.

619
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,351
No more macroscopic
signs of infection.

620
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,886
Any spinal nerve damage?

621
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,080
Won't be able to
tell until he wakes up.

622
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,402
So, what'd he decide?

623
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,003
He didn't.

624
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,076
He refused to make a decision.

625
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:46,244
He, uh, insisted
that I do it for him.

626
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,618
She really wants to be a mom,
so I think that we should try to...

627
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,751
No.

628
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,396
He chose me to
make the decision.

629
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,546
Her life matters
more than a dream.

630
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,844
Do a full hysterectomy.

631
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,592
You're right.

632
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,794
Let's go. She's already
been under for 22 hours,

633
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,593
and we got a lot more work
to do. Metz and a forcep.

634
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,408
Cut the uterosacral ligament.

635
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,005
Large pan.

636
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,986
Time?

637
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,649
4:10. She's been under
26 hours, 10 minutes.

638
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,255
All right, let's close her
up so we can wake her up.

639
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:02,956
I'll go tell the husband.

640
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,986
No, I'll do it.

641
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,365
Dr. Browne, you
take lead on the close.

642
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,980
Wiggle your toes.

643
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,117
All 10 are going to market.
You're gonna be fine.

644
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,421
And, uh, what about my...

645
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,819
He'll be fine, too.

646
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,220
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

647
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,191
Those two are the
ones who saved you.

648
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,353
All on their own...

649
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,220
Almost.

650
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,759
What happened?

651
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,203
The endometrial lesions
were much more invasive

652
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,863
than we saw on the imaging.

653
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,237
In order to remove them all,

654
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,036
we needed to
reconstruct a new bladder

655
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,771
out of a section
of your intestine.

656
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,680
And we had to
remove your uterus.

657
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,746
Honey, I am so sorry.

658
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,558
It's gonna be okay.

659
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,032
I love you so much.

660
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,771
I love you, too.

661
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,280
Now that we've handled
the surgical crisis,

662
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,550
it's time we deal with the
unprofessional behavior.

663
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,322
The only question I have
is who exactly is to blame?

664
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,624
It was a 27-hour surgery.

665
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,801
There were some tense moments,

666
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,448
but I was very pleased
with how everyone

667
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,100
ultimately worked
together as a team.

668
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,707
I was especially impressed

669
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,407
with how Dr. Browne
aggressively stood her ground,

670
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:40,747
and insisted that I respect
the husband's final decisions

671
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,447
regarding his
wife's hysterectomy.

672
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,025
Is there anything the two
of you would like to share?

673
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,331
No, I'm good.

674
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,733
Well, I'd like to say,

675
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:09,212
I was very impressed with
Dr. Melendez's openness

676
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,114
to hearing input from
all of the surgical team.

677
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,847
It's definitely something all of
us on the nursing staff appreciate.

678
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,786
Very good.

679
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,763
Go home. Get some rest.

680
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,647
You're here.

681
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,149
Yeah, I am.

682
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,563
I shouldn't have
told you to go away.

683
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,540
It wasn't very nice, and
you've always been nice to me.

684
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,945
You've been a good friend.

685
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,523
If you want to
talk, I will listen.

686
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,030
You're right. I have
been a good friend.

687
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,632
Actually, I've been
an awesome friend,

688
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,261
but you have been a total jerk.

689
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,707
You were so worried
about me hurting you?

690
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,243
What about how you hurt me?

691
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,523
What, you think you're the
only one who has feelings?

692
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,740
You think you're the only
one who needs someone

693
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,545
who doesn't judge them, doesn't
make them feel totally alone,

694
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,128
like there's not one
person in the world

695
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,296
who actually gives
a damn about them?

696
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,618
Okay, I'm sorry.

697
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:57,745
No, you're not.

698
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,333
You're just... You're
just uncomfortable,

699
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,701
and you're trying
to get me to shut up,

700
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,203
which don't worry, I will, just
as soon as I finish telling you

701
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,128
that friendship is a
two-way street, Shaun.

702
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,425
A two-way street, you jackass!

703
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,773
Guess I was wrong. She does
think of you like a real man.

704
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,685
Are you awake?

705
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,427
Hi, Daddy.

706
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:43,995
Maddie?

707
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,032
How are you feeling?

708
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,808
It's so good to see you.

709
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,308
You're dead.

710
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,447
Don't you think I know that?

711
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,712
Am I dead?

712
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,556
No, dummy.

713
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,885
You're just tired.

714
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,361
Yeah.
