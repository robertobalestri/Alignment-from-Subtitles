1
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,525
Morning, roomie.

2
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,498
Morning, roomie.

3
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,635
I'm going to the market
later. We need more apples?

4
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,500
No. But we need
more toilet paper.

5
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,367
No prob.

6
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,671
May I?

7
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,704
No prob.

8
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:53,844
Angel fluff plus, two-ply,
unscented, ultra-wide, extra-soft.

9
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,653
Two-ply. No prob.

10
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,523
You have to hang the toilet paper
on the dispenser the correct way.

11
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:08,192
The paper goes over on the top,
not under hanging against the wall.

12
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,336
Sorry, I forgot
you like it like that.

13
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,736
I don't like it like that.

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,841
It's right like that.

15
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,609
NBD.

16
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,342
It's no big deal. I gotta run.

17
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,421
Ms. Kohli? Hi. I'm Dr. Melendez.

18
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,894
Sorry. I have to
practice whenever I can.

19
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,932
I practice whenever I can, too.

20
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,095
We heard you hurt your
finger. Can we take a look?

21
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,271
I got a crappy manicure
a couple of days ago,

22
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,705
and now my nail
looks disgusting.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,240
Paronychia. It's an abscess caused
by a common bacterial infection.

24
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,208
We'll drain it, pack it
and send you home.

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,874
In 72 hours, the pain and
swelling will be much better,

26
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,439
and you'll be back to Paganini.

27
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,814
Apologize already.

28
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,584
- I did nothing wrong.
- So?

29
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,823
You don't wanna be iced out by
the future chief of surgery forever.

30
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,061
Lim could be chief, too.
Andrews hasn't decided yet.

31
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,599
Hey, Browne, Park, hustle in.

32
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,192
EMTs are less than a minute out.

33
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,270
Park, make sure Bay
Three is good to go.

34
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,171
Thirteen-year-old female,
progressively worsening epistaxis.

35
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,638
Bolus on the bus.
BP's 86 over 51.

36
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,075
It won't stop! I
can't get it to stop.

37
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,114
I got home, and she
was calling 9-1-1.

38
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,559
Not your first
nosebleed, huh, Dad?

39
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,127
These things usually
go away on their own,

40
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,162
but Riley claims it's been
like this for over an hour.

41
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,155
Ugh, it's not a
claim, it's a fact.

42
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,818
Gonna need to get her
on a monitor right away,

43
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,756
and apply 4%
phenylephrine solution.

44
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,488
Gonna need to
cauterize the bleed.

45
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,687
It's not my first
nosebleed, either.

46
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:53,068
I have my premiere at Davies
this weekend, hence the manicure.

47
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,470
Rosin, beeswax. That
stuff is tough to get off.

48
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:57,977
You play?

49
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,210
I know my way
around bow strings.

50
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,010
I dabbled in archery
when I was in high school.

51
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,112
- I started when I was five.
- Mmm.

52
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,620
I used to hum melodies

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,752
doing my homework, eating
dinner, taking out the trash.

54
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,118
I wanted to be
a train conductor.

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
There's still time.

56
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,899
She's numbed up,

57
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,028
she shouldn't have
any pain in her finger.

58
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,608
It's not my finger, it's
further up, by my knuckle.

59
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,837
No fever. Any body aches?

60
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,306
Uh... A little. Playing violin all day
stresses out my neck and shoulders.

61
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,383
It's likely tendonitis
or mild arthritic pain.

62
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,578
Or it might be flesh-eating bacteria,
and we may have to cut off your finger.

63
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,202
There's the bleeder,

64
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,602
at the posterior rim of
Kiesselbach's plexus.

65
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,841
You called 9-1-1?

66
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,908
She did.

67
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,910
- How you feeling, baby?
- Peachy.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,673
It's a nosebleed.
I'm handling it.

69
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,077
She's my kid, too, Bruce.

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,116
Bet you couldn't
tell they're divorced.

71
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,149
Why don't I take Riley's parents
to the waiting room, so we can...

72
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,520
Talk about me. <i>Adi√≥s.</i>

73
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,792
We need to know.

74
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,361
Shaun, what do we need
to do to know for sure?

75
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,905
We need to cut
deeper and get a swab.

76
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,973
Fingers have thousands
of nerve endings.

77
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,277
Clipping off even the
tiniest portion of Jas' finger

78
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,939
could cause permanent
damage and be career-ending.

79
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:45,213
But if it is necrotizing fasciitis
and we do nothing, she could die.

80
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,248
That would also end her career.

81
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,392
True, but the numbers,
Shaun, the data.

82
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,753
There's almost no
chance that it's nec fasc.

83
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,265
On the other hand, if we test for
it, we will definitely do damage.

84
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,101
Anything else?

85
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,133
Do you hang your toilet
paper going over or under?

86
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,472
Doesn't matter.

87
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,008
Before the nosebleeds,
it was tummy aches,

88
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,877
insomnia, breathing pain...

89
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,283
Every time we'd rush
her to the pediatrician,

90
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,013
but they couldn't find anything.

91
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,856
So, we stopped taking her.

92
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,323
You think she's faking it?

93
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,653
A therapist said it was

94
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,428
likely her subconscious way of
trying to get her family back together.

95
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,629
Divorce isn't easy for adults,

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,828
why should kids be able
to deal with it any better?

97
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,595
She disengaged.

98
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,532
Not just from us, but
her friends, school.

99
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,810
It's been five years.

100
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,542
She should have found
her new normal by now.

101
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,577
Looks like someone's
doing better.

102
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,452
Nosebleed's stopped, but Riley's
nasal membranes are pretty thin.

103
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,787
You should be on the
lookout for future bleeds.

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,364
Riley, have you been sniffing
or snorting any drugs lately?

105
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,658
What? No way. I
wouldn't do that.

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,978
There's a lot of stuff out
there that looks harmless, but...

107
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,061
She said no.

108
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,602
Does Flonase count?

109
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,579
I was coughing, I had a
stuffy nose, itchy throat.

110
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,547
I looked up my symptoms,

111
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,880
because what the hell
else was I supposed to do?

112
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,049
Vasomotor rhinitis fit.

113
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,782
So I went to the drugstore
and I got some Flonase.

114
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:32,083
Misuse of steroid sprays
can thin out nasal membranes,

115
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,524
causing terrible nosebleeds.

116
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,787
Quit the Flonase,
and you're good to go.

117
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,822
Thank you.

118
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,963
I need you to take her tonight.

119
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,559
I had to skip a pitch to an
important VC to get here.

120
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,971
Sorry. Didn't mean to take you
away from anything important.

121
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,085
You're provoking her. You
know she's an anxious kid.

122
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,668
I'm not anxious, I'm sick.

123
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,188
- Could you, for once, have my back?
- What?

124
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,580
This is your fault. She's
playing us against each other.

125
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,282
What's wrong?

126
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,282
My breathing, it... It hurts.

127
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,649
Just relax, sweetie.

128
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,052
Just stop, both of you.

129
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,389
Vasomotor rhinitis.

130
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,133
That is a pretty unique
diagnosis for an eighth-grader.

131
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,702
You'll be numb in a minute.

132
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,600
Seventh. And I was
wrong. Doesn't matter.

133
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,666
I get what you're going through.

134
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,102
You were smart, popular.

135
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,074
We don't have
anything in common.

136
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,945
I was never popular.

137
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,282
I wore hand-me-downs
from Goodwill.

138
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,111
I never knew my dad.

139
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,153
My mom was sick, I
couldn't rely on her.

140
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,654
- Kids that age can be total...
- Jerks.

141
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,263
Ass-hats. Turds.

142
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,729
I wouldn't send my worst
enemy back to junior high.

143
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,239
I got so many Ds on
my report card last year,

144
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,005
I got held back.

145
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,713
Now everyone treats
me like I'm stupid.

146
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,482
It's humiliating.

147
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,948
How'd you deal with it?

148
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,656
I said, "Screw it."

149
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,850
They already think I'm bad.

150
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,460
I mess around in
class, leave campus.

151
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,829
I do whatever the hell I want.

152
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,460
But you're still angry.

153
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,642
I didn't let my past define me,

154
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:40,018
and yours doesn't
have to define you.

155
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,718
Repeating a grade
doesn't make you...

156
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,622
What? What's wrong?

157
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,119
Nothing.

158
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,329
There doesn't seem to
be any active bleeding.

159
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,932
But I coughed up
blood. That was real.

160
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,933
It's possible it's just
post-nasal aspiration.

161
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,835
That the blood you coughed
up was from the initial nosebleed

162
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,171
and it went down your
throat into your lungs.

163
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,877
But my chest, it really hurts.

164
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,711
<i>Hey, Shaun. What's up?</i>

165
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,813
You forgot to put your coffee cup
in the dishwasher before you left.

166
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,285
<i>Sorry, I was in a rush.</i>

167
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,158
And remember, rinse it out
before you put it in the dishwasher.

168
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,489
<i>- Noted.</i>
- And on the top rack.

169
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:25,992
<i>- I gotta go.</i>
- Me, too.

170
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,864
Morgan doesn't want to know
what's wrong with our patient.

171
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,369
I find that hard to believe.

172
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,408
They talk about bowstrings.

173
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,805
I don't know anything
about bowstrings.

174
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,709
They should be talking
about what's wrong with her.

175
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,444
You can't always know, Shaun.

176
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,750
Sometimes tests aren't worth it.

177
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,049
Sometimes we don't
have the right tests.

178
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,726
What are you doing in here?

179
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,258
Lea and I disagree
about toilet paper.

180
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,134
And you made a good point
about finding the right test.

181
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,066
Thanks.

182
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,405
I just did a test.

183
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,642
On the toilet paper?

184
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,685
Every toilet paper roll in this restroom
has the paper hanging over, not under.

185
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,980
And they were installed
by professionals.

186
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,280
Does it matter?

187
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,955
"I-D-G-A..."

188
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:35,925
I think it's an acronym, or
maybe even an anagram.

189
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:41,274
I don't think Lea cares
about the toilet paper debate.

190
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,104
It's not a debate, I'm right.

191
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:48,114
I think you should talk
to Lea. Not text, talk.

192
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,753
Did you talk to Dr. Melendez
after you got in trouble with him?

193
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,652
- No.
- Why not?

194
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,786
Because I did nothing wrong.

195
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,692
Because you were right.

196
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,124
- Yeah.
- So am I.

197
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,395
Make sure all four tips are touching
the ground before you take a step.

198
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,270
Well, thank you, Iris. I never
would have figured that out.

199
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,242
I'm required to show you how
to use all medical equipment.

200
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,990
Well, I'm not gonna use it.

201
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,710
- You wanna know why?
- Huh.

202
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,851
Because I'm not gonna use it.

203
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,818
You remind me of
my Grandpa Eddy.

204
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,852
So grumpy, so adorable.

205
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,825
See? Look, no hands. I'm fine.

206
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,331
Chicken soup. Heard
it's good for the soul.

207
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,159
I wasn't expecting you.

208
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,031
Thank you. That's
very thoughtful.

209
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,397
I... It's... Really,
it's no big deal.

210
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,996
I signed up to bring
you food at the hospital,

211
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,632
the Meal Train that they set up.

212
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,505
- The Meal Train, yeah.
- Yeah.

213
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,640
How... How are you doing today?

214
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,844
Well, today is
actually looking up.

215
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,046
You wanna come
in, have some soup?

216
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,022
I have other plans.

217
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,121
- Oh. Yeah.
- But...

218
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,252
I'm actually free tomorrow.

219
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,890
Do you like lasagna?

220
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,063
I kinda love lasagna.

221
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:16,201
Great. Finally get
that second date.

222
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,394
- You know, you don't have to...
- No, Aaron.

223
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,105
I want to.

224
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,135
Well, then, I want to.

225
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,113
Okay, great. Then, um, I
will see you, then, tomorrow.

226
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,947
I'll see you tomorrow.

227
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,817
No one dabbles in archery
unless they're at summer camp.

228
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,315
How long did you do it?

229
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,559
Seven days a week
for seven years.

230
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,792
Why'd you stop?

231
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,393
It was just time...

232
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,398
To go to college, medical
school, be a grown-up.

233
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,633
It was that easy to just quit?

234
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,470
Archery doesn't fill
concert halls or pay the bills.

235
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,139
She has a slight fever.

236
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,533
Her rash is spreading
and she has edema.

237
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,806
This is definitely
not paronychia.

238
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,914
I know. I've moved on to MRSA.

239
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,043
That's possible, but
you should want proof.

240
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,950
If we do an open,
deep-tissue biopsy,

241
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,834
we will know for sure if
you have flesh-eating...

242
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,917
Shaun.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,366
Part of being a good doctor

244
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,969
is knowing when to not
scare the crap out of a patient.

245
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,240
I don't think so.

246
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,274
This is your problem, not hers.

247
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,937
Your need to be
sure. Your obsession...

248
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,010
We need to cut off a
small piece of her finger

249
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,777
so we know if we
have to cut off a larger...

250
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,979
Shaun, you're acting like you
want to amputate her hand.

251
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:45,651
No, you're acting like you
don't want to amputate her hand.

252
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,192
I don't.

253
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,656
But that's not
medically relevant.

254
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,127
Her temperature is 102.

255
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,172
It's gone up two degrees
since we've been arguing.

256
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,812
Okay. We'll test her.

257
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,051
That tissue has begun to die.

258
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,017
Or it's inflammatory
infiltration.

259
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,784
Find anything?

260
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,124
We're at an impasse.

261
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,967
Look here, at the margin.

262
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,840
Subcutaneous fat
and fascial necrosis.

263
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,198
Shaun was right.

264
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,502
Let's go try to save her hand.

265
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,286
She is a young girl
with a lot going on.

266
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,862
We agree on that much.

267
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,409
That's why she
needs to see a shrink.

268
00:14:58,765 --> 00:14:59,765
Hmm.

269
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,636
This... This feels different.

270
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,337
What, you don't believe
in emotional intelligence?

271
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,903
If I have to choose

272
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,312
between the battery of tests
we've done and your gut,

273
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,607
it's an easy choice.

274
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,844
No. You don't relate to her.

275
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,753
And if you don't relate to
her, you can't understand her.

276
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,554
You're probably right.

277
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,924
You think you do relate?

278
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,298
And do you have a kid?

279
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,229
My opinion about
Riley is medical.

280
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,244
Why haven't you told
any of us you have a kid?

281
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,902
That is a huge chunk of
your life you've been hiding.

282
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,972
I don't feel the need to share
everything about my personal life

283
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,414
with the people I work with.

284
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,104
That's your passive-aggressive
way of saying I'm an over-sharer?

285
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,253
Yeah.

286
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,083
Your opinion on
Riley is clearly skewed

287
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,385
because you're looking at
her through a parental lens.

288
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,428
I've been in her shoes, I am better
equipped to evaluate her situation.

289
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,428
You're the poster
child of skewed.

290
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,797
You're too emotionally
involved, and are overreacting

291
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,463
because you had a crappy
mom who didn't care about you.

292
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,102
And why do I know all that?

293
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,141
Because you're an over-sharer.

294
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,241
The scan's clean.

295
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,949
It's time to send her home.

296
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,582
Clamp.

297
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,360
Whoa. That is not good.

298
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,931
Muscle's weak, clamp
slid right through the fascia.

299
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,791
Murphy, pull the skin back.

300
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,400
Smells like rotten eggs.

301
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,662
There's only tissue damage.

302
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,059
If we debride her
hand carefully,

303
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,167
we can preserve some
mobility and dexterity.

304
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,878
She's gonna need close
monitoring post-op tonight.

305
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,503
Scissors.

306
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,164
We need to talk.

307
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,386
Can it wait? I'm late for
an all-night coding session.

308
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,278
You hung the toilet
paper incorrectly.

309
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,205
Right. Did you flip it?

310
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,908
Great. We're done.

311
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,682
You left the TV
remote on the couch.

312
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,084
Shaun, I am running late.

313
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,184
You have to put it on the
tray on the coffee table.

314
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,862
That is where it belongs.

315
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,492
If it doesn't have a set place,
then it will be in many places.

316
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,366
And then it will get
lost, and if I can't find it,

317
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,978
I can't watch the
Weather Channel...

318
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,838
Okay, enough about
the damn remote!

319
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,408
Everything in this place
has to be your way.

320
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,336
We have to make sure to use
two pods in the washing machine,

321
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,091
we have to keep the
cups to the left of the plate,

322
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,641
we have to keep the
air-conditioner at exactly 74,

323
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:09,313
and we have to use one very
specific, very hard-to-find toilet paper.

324
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,450
And I'm trying to be accommodating,
but you are not cutting me any slack!

325
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,532
Oh, God. Shaun.

326
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,267
Shaun, I am sorry.
Are... Are you okay?

327
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,509
You have a ruptured Achilles.

328
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,426
I'm afraid your weekend
warrior days are over.

329
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,816
Help! Can we get some help here?

330
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,918
Right there.

331
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,880
What happened?

332
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,978
She couldn't sleep.

333
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,956
Uh... She spiked a fever.
It's only getting worse.

334
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,651
I can't breathe.

335
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,463
Okay, take a deep
breath. In, out.

336
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,830
104.6.

337
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,931
I need IV acetaminophen
and cooling blankets, ASAP.

338
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,897
She's tachypneic
with an O2 SAT of 87.

339
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,279
Is this... Is this
something new?

340
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,680
Or... I mean, did
she do this to herself?

341
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,070
She has an infection.

342
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,699
I think she's developed pneumonia
due to an underlying condition.

343
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,342
- What underlying condition?
- I have no idea.

344
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,639
Page Park and Lim.

345
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,012
No signs of PE or pneumonia.

346
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,347
CFTR was negative
for cystic fibrosis.

347
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,115
I think we may have
missed something on her CT.

348
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,785
There.

349
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,622
That slight shadow
on the bronchus.

350
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,431
A slow-growing carcinoid tumor could
cause chronic airway inflammation.

351
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,399
As the tumor grows,
the symptoms worsen,

352
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,867
leading to airway
obstruction and infection.

353
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,768
Or it's just a shadow.
A slight shadow.

354
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,303
It is pretty subtle.

355
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,343
I would like to do
exploratory VATS.

356
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,776
You wanna poke holes in her chest,
and go rooting around in her lungs?

357
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,677
Riley's body's
already compromised.

358
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,317
There are no obvious lesions,

359
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,995
and her symptoms are
more likely indicators

360
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,351
of a simple sinus infection.

361
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,889
The safer, better plan
is to treat with antibiotics.

362
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,648
If she has a progressing tumor,

363
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,885
we can't just send her
home with medication.

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,226
Pitch the surgery to
the parents, and Riley.

365
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,597
Okay.

366
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,378
Hey! Hey, hey! Don't touch
those, those are vintage.

367
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,040
Well, I'm just scooting
your toys over,

368
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,844
so it's easier to get
to your medication.

369
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,713
Toys. "Toys"?

370
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,418
Those are not toys.

371
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,417
That's Reggie Jackson.

372
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,762
Well, when that timer goes off,

373
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,587
Roger Johnson can
give you your medicine.

374
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,752
- Reggie Jackson.
- Mmm.

375
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,926
Hey. Guess what?

376
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,626
Quitting time.

377
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,095
Okay. Have fun. Take your pills.

378
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,264
Yeah.

379
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,541
I think I broke Shaun.

380
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,750
Hi.

381
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,061
We got into a big fight, huge,

382
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,748
and I was yelling, and he
just fell apart. It was awful.

383
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,381
I mean, he pushes and
pushes. I pushed back!

384
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,287
Shaun's not easy,
but you knew that.

385
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,226
I knew it was gonna be
hard, but living with him is a lot.

386
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,295
I know.

387
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,607
There's stuff I've never
even thought about.

388
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,943
And I know he has idiosyncrasies,
but there's a lot of them.

389
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,731
- I mean, a lot.
- I know.

390
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,131
- Is Shaun okay?
- Yes. No. I don't know.

391
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,536
He's at work.

392
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,041
Glassy, you know him.
Like, really know him.

393
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,773
How do I deal with Shaun?

394
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,814
Well, it's been 12 years
and I'm still learning.

395
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,003
He just always has to
be right. I mean, do you...

396
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,213
Do you know how many
calls and texts and notes

397
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,586
he's left me about how
I'm doing stuff wrong?

398
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,070
I have a pretty good idea, yeah.

399
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,456
Yeah, well, it's exhausting.

400
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,621
You know what?
We all have quirks,

401
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,254
we can all be a pain in
the ass from time to time.

402
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,357
Okay, admittedly,
Shaun a little more so.

403
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,765
That is not helpful.

404
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,302
- Sit down.
- What?

405
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,404
- Sit down.
- Why?

406
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,067
Why? Because you're
agitated and you're annoying me,

407
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,337
and I can't give you
good advice in that state.

408
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,341
- Sit.
- Right.

409
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,309
Thank you.

410
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,115
Do you like Shaun?

411
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,189
- Of course.
- Why?

412
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,956
He's sweet, kind, honest.
Sometimes brutally honest.

413
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,627
There's never an
agenda with him.

414
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,226
He's just Shaun.

415
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,037
So?

416
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,275
So, I want him
to change a little.

417
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,069
You moved in
expecting him to change?

418
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,806
He doesn't want you
to change, I know that.

419
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,685
And if I made the
wrong decision?

420
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,052
Then you move out
and you do it right now.

421
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,752
It'll devastate him, but the
longer you wait, the more...

422
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,366
The worse it will be for him.

423
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,698
If Riley has a tumor,

424
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,140
we need to open her up to
find out what we're dealing with.

425
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,538
Why do you think
she has a tumor?

426
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,811
It's consistent
with her symptoms.

427
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,883
The same symptoms
she's been having for years?

428
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,254
Yes.

429
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,621
The same symptoms we've
been told are psychological?

430
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,253
The same symptoms

431
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,292
a dozen doctors have run
100 tests for and found nothing?

432
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,557
There is a shadow
on her CT image.

433
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,994
A shadow?

434
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,231
And it's a risky surgery?

435
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,035
Opening her up in a weakened
state could be dangerous.

436
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,649
Look, I know Riley frustrates
you, drives you crazy,

437
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,053
but I also know you love her.

438
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,620
You have a chance
to show her that.

439
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,893
So, you wanna do
this as a statement?

440
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,390
We want you to
believe in your daughter.

441
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,226
Because that's
what a parent does.

442
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:06,737
When she was little
and had a bad dream,

443
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,979
she used to come into our room
and snuggle up under your arm,

444
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,880
just like she's doing to me.

445
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,948
You would stroke her face

446
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,893
until she was finally at
peace and fell asleep.

447
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,632
She's in so much pain,

448
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,496
and I don't know how
to make it go away.

449
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,236
Riley?

450
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,511
Hey, um...

451
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:48,080
The doctors, they wanna see
what's going on in your lungs.

452
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,453
They think you
might have a tumor.

453
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,725
And we want them to operate.

454
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,464
You think I have a real tumor?

455
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:12,610
It's scary, I know,
but, yes, we do.

456
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,686
Her BP's dropping
out, 73 over 50.

457
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,285
Heart rate is spiking, 137.

458
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,120
Hang an IV saline bolus.

459
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,559
We need a 12 lead.

460
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,871
The necrosis has
migrated. She's septic.

461
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,997
There's definite
infiltration to the bone.

462
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,039
We're gonna have
to amputate her arm.

463
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,088
Polish the bone to
help stump healing.

464
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,549
Rasp.

465
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,762
Margins appear to be clean.

466
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,746
There's still a small chance microbes
may have spread to her organs.

467
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,633
If they did, then her mortality
rate just increased exponentially.

468
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,442
What if we put her in
hyperbaric oxygen therapy now?

469
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,373
Oxygen's toxic to bacteria.

470
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,337
There's a lot of things that
could go wrong in there.

471
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,314
We wouldn't be able to decompress
the chamber in time to help her.

472
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:32,347
We wouldn't have to wait to help
her if someone goes in with her.

473
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,559
I'll do it.

474
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,992
Okay. Get the chamber ready.

475
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,762
Lung tissue looks normal.

476
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,868
And there are
healthy-appearing bronchi.

477
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,796
Nothing yet.

478
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,970
Damn it! Tore a lobar artery.

479
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,808
BP's 81 over 49.

480
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,179
Oxygen sats 93, heart rate
is going up, she is tanking.

481
00:26:58,484 --> 00:26:59,524
Park, I need more suction.

482
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,914
I can't see a thing in here.

483
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,606
We need to do an
open thoracotomy now.

484
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,146
- Browne, crack her chest.
- Ten blade and a rib-spreader.

485
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,128
There are only 7.18
cubic meters in there.

486
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,429
How does it feel?

487
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,566
It's fine.

488
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:24,005
I thought it might feel claustrophobic
for someone neurotypical.

489
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,334
It is.

490
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,179
Got it, but it's still bleeding.

491
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,089
Her stroke volume
just bottomed out.

492
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,315
Rapid infuse four
liters of whole blood.

493
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,925
Get ready to start
cardiac massage.

494
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,292
Wait, I think I have an
anchor in the arterial wall.

495
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,826
Stroke volume is rising.

496
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,859
BP increasing, 90 over 60.

497
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,628
Pulse is 90 and regular.

498
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,640
She's stable for now.

499
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,873
This was a mistake.

500
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,044
We need to close her
up as soon as possible.

501
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,780
It doesn't make any sense.

502
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,317
Her arterial wall
shouldn't be this fragile.

503
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,422
Something else has
caused it to thin out.

504
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,632
What else is going on in here?

505
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,567
Browne, I need more light.

506
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,336
Yeah. See that?

507
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,039
A localized granuloma
on the right lower lobe.

508
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,372
You think it's cancer?

509
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,880
Not sure, but
something's in there.

510
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,347
Park, retract the lung.

511
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,455
It's a LEGO.

512
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,695
Riley must've
inhaled it years ago.

513
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,868
It settled in your lung, became
encased in inflammatory tissue.

514
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,874
Your body's immune
response attacked it,

515
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,076
making you progressively
more sick over the years.

516
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,311
It's small, thin and
made of plastic,

517
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,573
there was no way of seeing
it on any of the imaging.

518
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,878
Ugh, this is so gross.

519
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,845
I'm gonna make
it into a necklace.

520
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,054
Good luck. Excuse me.

521
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,424
We're sorry that we
didn't believe in you.

522
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,031
We're sorry that we put
you through all of this.

523
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,737
We're sorry that
we got divorced.

524
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,038
Whoa.

525
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,106
You guys are way
better off apart.

526
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,948
We always thought you were
upset because we split up.

527
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,815
I was upset because
you fought all the time.

528
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,716
You still do.

529
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,658
And it freaked me out.

530
00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:02,258
So, I'd hide in my princess tent,
bite my nails, gnaw on crayons,

531
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,635
chew on LEGOs.

532
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,331
We screwed up.

533
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,834
And we promise we can do better.

534
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,692
I am not saying that <i>Ordinary
People</i> is not a good movie.

535
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:31,997
It's a great movie.

536
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,031
It's a great movie.
Okay, what I'm saying

537
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,296
is that <i>Raging Bull</i> is a
superior cinematic experience.

538
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,203
It is raw, it's,
like, romantic...

539
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,900
It's romantic? It pummels
you from start to finish.

540
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,169
Yeah. Exactly.

541
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,371
Exactly. It's like adrenaline's
pulsing through your veins,

542
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:50,206
it leaves me breathless
every time I watch it.

543
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,149
Oh!

544
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,849
Do you... Do you wanna
maybe go for a walk?

545
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,184
It's a little cold outside.

546
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:06,925
I'm gonna kiss you.

547
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,625
You are? Okay.

548
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,999
Listen, maybe we
ought to walk upstairs?

549
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,134
- Okay.
- Yeah?

550
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,003
- Yeah.
- This way?

551
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,308
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

552
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,150
Whoa!

553
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,715
- Can I help?
- No, thank you.

554
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,115
I'll get there. I'm okay.
I'm okay, I'm okay. Ow!

555
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,539
Is my hand okay?

556
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:00,051
Your biopsy was positive
for necrotizing fasciitis.

557
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:05,918
We had to do multiple surgeries to
remove the infected muscle and bone.

558
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,584
Bone?

559
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,058
I'm so sorry, Jas.

560
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,088
We had to amputate your arm.

561
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,924
No.

562
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,833
No, my arm... My
arm still hurts, I can...

563
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,470
I can feel it. It's still there.

564
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,438
What you're experiencing
is phantom pain.

565
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,472
Your arm is gone.

566
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,988
He told you.

567
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,425
My arm.

568
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,961
My arm is gone.

569
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,566
It's gone...

570
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,270
And it's...

571
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,003
It's your fault.

572
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,323
Get out.

573
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,029
Get the hell out.

574
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,697
I can't.

575
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,762
Neither of us can.

576
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,821
- You called it.
- Hmm.

577
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:52,990
Well done.

578
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,327
Thanks for your help.

579
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,796
Finally a believer in the
power of emotional intelligence?

580
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,235
It did get her parents on board,
even if it's only for a little while.

581
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:03,835
They believe their kid,

582
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,310
and they're working on
their family relationships.

583
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,812
It's pretty big steps.

584
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,241
It was a nice moment.

585
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,349
But if you think
you changed them,

586
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,881
that they'll be different people
tomorrow than they were yesterday,

587
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,254
then you're kidding yourself.

588
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,523
Right now, my
emotional intelligence

589
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,061
is telling me even
you don't believe that.

590
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,107
Kitchen's clean,

591
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,105
leftovers are in the fridge.

592
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,608
How you doing?

593
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Fine.

594
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,886
I just got a little
light-headed.

595
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,418
Balance isn't quite
back to normal.

596
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,161
Now that you're feeling a little
better, you wanna watch <i>Raging Bull?</i>

597
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,791
No.

598
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,232
Okay. Another time.

599
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,372
No.

600
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,808
I can't do this.

601
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,738
We can take it slow.

602
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,474
I'm... I'm happy to just
be here with you, like this.

603
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,910
No, I can't... I can't
be here like this.

604
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,785
I... I don't want you to...

605
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,284
I just...

606
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,662
I don't want to...

607
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,298
I'm sorry, I just...
I need you to go.

608
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,559
Please.

609
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,557
Jas practiced violin every
day since she was five.

610
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:41,262
She put all her faith in me
to do the right thing, and...

611
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,069
I thought I did, I...

612
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,498
Shaun didn't care. He...

613
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,135
He didn't see her dreams,
he just saw her symptoms.

614
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,008
Sometimes that'll
be the wrong choice.

615
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:12,689
My second year in the
program, there was this resident.

616
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,558
She was kinda weird.

617
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:20,634
She wore comic-book T-shirts,
always ate the exact same lunch.

618
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,698
But she was smart.

619
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,169
She would get surgeries and
knock them out of the park,

620
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,713
over and over again.

621
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,907
I couldn't stand her.

622
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:40,389
And one day I realized, I
was competing against her,

623
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,961
but she wasn't
competing against me.

624
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,730
She spent her time observing,

625
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:53,464
asking questions, preparing
herself to be a great surgeon.

626
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,137
Is she?

627
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,545
Dr. Lim is one of the best
trauma surgeons in the country.

628
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,445
- Dr. Melendez.
- Dr. Browne.

629
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,112
Dr. Lim.

630
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,246
Nice save today.

631
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,253
I heard. Yes, good
work, Dr. Browne.

632
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,658
Thank you.

633
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,361
Good night.

634
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,307
You know she
showed bad judgment.

635
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,181
You got something
to say, just say it.

636
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,783
Wanna grab a beer?

637
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,548
Yes.

638
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,623
Hey.

639
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,899
Are you okay?

640
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,563
Yes.

641
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:42,077
I am so sorry for my
outburst yesterday.

642
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,846
I'm fine now.

643
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,786
I'm not, Shaun.

644
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,193
Coming back to California,
and starting a new job,

645
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,220
and moving in with you,
it's been so stressful.

646
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,432
Harder than I anticipated.

647
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,907
You're moving out?

648
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,570
No, I am not moving out.

649
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,705
We are still figuring
out each other's quirks.

650
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:19,579
Yes, you're very
difficult to live with.

651
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,756
I know I forget stuff, a lot.

652
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,127
And sometimes I snap and yell.

653
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,588
I promise to work on that.

654
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,795
And I don't need you to change,

655
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:41,703
but I do need to know that you
know you're annoying as hell.

656
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,610
I need to know that
you'll try to compromise.

657
00:40:56,154 --> 00:41:01,149
I don't think I can use
one-ply toilet paper.

658
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,727
No, you were so
right about the two-ply.

659
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,592
Totally worth the extra $1.50.

660
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:12,064
But maybe the cups can
go to the right of the plates.

661
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,299
Sometimes.

662
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,976
Everything's unpacked.

663
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,076
We're officially
moved in together.

664
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,145
I'm gonna take these
down to the recycling.

665
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:34,191
And I know I probably didn't
put everything in the right place,

666
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,319
but maybe we can
rearrange it together.

667
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,998
I like that idea very much.

668
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:19,168
I like that idea very much.
