00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,595
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,104
Shaun, I have cancer.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,767
I have to undergo brain
surgery, which is really scary.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,552
To be clear, Jared, I
don't want you here.

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,512
- I fought for my job.
- You compromised your integrity.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,790
<i>My former mentor</i>

7
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,875
is head of the surgical residency
program at Denver Memorial Hospital.

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,255
A surgeon needs to communicate.

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,566
Can Dr. Murphy do that?
Can he do that under stress?

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,683
Can he do that

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,392
knowing that a human life
literally hangs in the balance?

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,890
- Shaun?
<i>- If Shaun proves anything</i>

13
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,192
<i>less than excellent,</i>

14
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:34,564
I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,236
I know why Caden has DIC.

16
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,532
It was my mistake.

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,302
I have to tell Dr. Andrews
about the mistake I made.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,502
Shaun, you can't.

19
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,645
I'm not gonna ask him
to lie to save my job.

20
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,211
It's up to Shaun.

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,020
Hello? Yes, of course.

22
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,825
Dr. Murphy, the
President will see you now.

23
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,076
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

24
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,482
I'm a surgical resident at San
Jose Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

25
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,590
So, what did Andrews
have to say to you?

26
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,018
Shaun.

27
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,763
You've exceeded my expectations

28
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,457
in terms of expertise
and technical execution,

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,929
but your communication
skills are sorely lacking.

30
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,596
That has to change if you wanna
stay here at Saint Bonaventure.

31
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,733
He told me I
exceeded expectations.

32
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,570
Great.

33
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,583
- Sounds, uh, sounds great, Shaun.
- Yes.

34
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,744
I think you should have
gone to your review.

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,883
Since it's my last day,

36
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,923
not much opportunity
to make use of feedback.

37
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,982
Dr. Andrews could
have some wisdom

38
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,323
that you could use in
Denver at your next job.

39
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,624
Even if I did care
about his opinion,

40
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,462
it was made pretty obvious
by the fact that we're here.

41
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,633
This is Glassman's project.

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,495
Andrews thinks
it's a money trap.

43
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,610
How'd your review go, Claire?

44
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:27,971
Went well.

45
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,049
Andrews said I connected
nicely, and I cared about people.

46
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,177
Interesting.

47
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,119
I'd have thought he'd want
you to be more aggressive.

48
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,822
I think you need to be
more assertive, Dr. Browne.

49
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,520
Okay.

50
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,854
No.

51
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,463
What'd he say about you?

52
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,001
Figure out how to be a
little less self-centered

53
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,767
and realize you're
part of a team?

54
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,174
You're sometimes overbearing.

55
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,944
Often egotistical.

56
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,570
You need to be
more of a team player.

57
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,593
Melanie Arnott.

58
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,415
The patient has
pulmonary hypertension.

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,696
The only treatment
is medication,

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,552
which reduces the
lung blood pressure,

61
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,716
but not enough. Her heart's
failing due to the extra strain.

62
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,852
That is a factually-correct
diagnosis. What about a fix?

63
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,464
Isn't it just a transplant?

64
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,823
Nope.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,845
There's nothing inherently wrong
with Melanie's heart. It's healthy,

66
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,213
it just needs a
little bit of help.

67
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,536
So, we're gonna leave
her current heart inside,

68
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,508
and slot in another
one to support it.

69
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,711
A piggyback transplant?

70
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,040
Nice, huh?

71
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,374
- Do you live in a tent?
- Uh, yeah.

72
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,437
I lived in a tent, too.

73
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,412
It wasn't very good,
so I moved to a bus.

74
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,005
You should move to a bus.

75
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,844
You will be much less likely to
develop ulcerative tinea pedis.

76
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,214
Very early stages.

77
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,932
Just keep it dry and clean,
and we'll give you some...

78
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,393
Would you rather we
continued to discuss this inside?

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,528
We are discussing
things with the patient

80
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,006
that are potentially
sensitive, so I...

81
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,150
We're done with the patient.

82
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,969
Did Andrews happen to speak
to you about communication?

83
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,979
Yes. I'm trying very hard.

84
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,074
It's definitely something
you should work on.

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,118
Things might be different...

86
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,678
More difficult for you now
Glassman's not around.

87
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,815
Dr. Glassman is still around.

88
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,287
He's alive and he
is not going to die.

89
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,494
He's meeting his
oncologist today.

90
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,098
You... you didn't go with him?

91
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,503
No. That would be stupid.

92
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,766
I am a resident.

93
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,239
I don't know as much
about brain cancer

94
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,144
as a double board-certified
neuro-oncologist.

95
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,944
True. But this has gotta be
challenging for him, emotionally.

96
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,684
I can't help him, emotionally.

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,522
Excuse me. Please.

98
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,825
Excuse me. Please.

99
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,594
Thank you for
keeping me waiting.

100
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,468
We doctors are busy,
important people.

101
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,770
Yeah, we doctors are.

102
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,108
So, pre-op, clearance,
surgery, radiation and chemo.

103
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,289
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

104
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,782
I hope you don't mind
if I start with pre-op.

105
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,909
Did you change the
policy on pot use?

106
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,577
Are you using again?
Should I worry?

107
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,186
I'm clean. I miss
it, but I'm clean.

108
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,924
They test me every week now.

109
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,048
Good.

110
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,357
I think you had me reinstated,

111
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,366
as your last official act before
they booted you as president,

112
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,663
because I am the
best oncologist around

113
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,496
and you would like to
get the best treatment.

114
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,631
Yeah.

115
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,232
So, I'd like to
ensure that the brain,

116
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:19,404
in this instance, my brain, stays
as dry as possible during surgery,

117
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,141
maintain minimal swelling.
I would still like to be able

118
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,207
to swing my nine iron
when we're done here.

119
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,981
Of course, it's also possible
that you had me reinstated

120
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,420
because you'd like an oncologist
who thinks they owe you,

121
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,047
and you wanna push them around.

122
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,227
Look, Dr. Blaize, I am
like any other patient,

123
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,423
entitled to have a say
in my own treatment.

124
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,397
But unlike any other patient,

125
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,937
I have spent my entire adult
life digging into people's brains.

126
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,769
So, if you think I'm gonna sit
around and watch, you're mistaken.

127
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,144
Well, if you think you
can operate on yourself,

128
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,873
I'd happily add you to the
list of potential surgeons.

129
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,716
Today you're gonna be waiting.

130
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,242
And waiting.

131
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,777
And waiting.

132
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,219
Test, test, test. You've
had them all before.

133
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,952
I want them again, my versions.

134
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,185
You free all day?

135
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,764
Yeah, sure.

136
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,859
I'm free.

137
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,093
Sir?

138
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,750
We're going to need
you to give those back.

139
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,901
What's your name?

140
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,272
I'm Harry. These are my meds!

141
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,174
Those pills are for people
with chlamydia, Harry.

142
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,771
No. You're all the same.

143
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,408
See, I know better. That's why
I have to hide out on the streets.

144
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,147
I had to move next
door to Mr. Googly-Eyes.

145
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,155
I... I trust him!
He's my friend!

146
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,421
I trust him.

147
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,755
- I trust him.
- Okay. Okay.

148
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,571
- Disorganized thinking...
- He's always watching me.

149
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,257
Paranoia and delusions.

150
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,267
I think you have
schizophrenia, Harry.

151
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,062
Do you have chlamydia as well?

152
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,965
Harry? Harry, are you okay?

153
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,471
That smells very bad.

154
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,779
I get that this
is rare, exciting.

155
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,651
The sort of surgery you
guys must jump at doing.

156
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,165
I... I just... I wanna
make sure that we don't...

157
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,350
They're not.

158
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,331
I have three months left. This
will give me at least 10 more years.

159
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,293
Should give you
10 more years, yes.

160
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,690
Elliot, I understand
your concerns, but...

161
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,236
And Dr. Melendez is one of the
best cardiac surgeons around.

162
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,702
Dr. Andrews told
us all about you

163
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,275
when he convinced me to
come here for surgery instead of...

164
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,537
You spoke to Dr. Andrews?

165
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,810
And they've both already spent
half the morning raving to the press.

166
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,509
Well, it's... That's very kind.

167
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,699
<i>You spoke to the press?</i>

168
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,286
You spoke to the
patient? My patient?

169
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,489
As I explained to
Elliot and Melanie,

170
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,057
the press attention is a necessary
element for funding this surgery.

171
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,464
But as you didn't explain to them,
it's simultaneously a vanity project

172
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,365
to create buzz for
your new presidency.

173
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,562
As I didn't explain to them,

174
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,334
this surgery can change the way
our entire hospital is perceived.

175
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,909
I'm hoping this
"buzz," as you put it,

176
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,639
will help us establish a
Surgical Center for Excellence.

177
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,911
It'll be a nice
feather in the cap

178
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,214
for whoever replaces
me as chief of surgery.

179
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,056
Okay. Swill your mouth
out with alcohol now.

180
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,990
- Never said no to that.
- You will have to spit.

181
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,393
Oh, well.

182
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,233
Over here.

183
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,802
Are you having trouble
with your neck, Harry?

184
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,536
It's stiff.

185
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,707
A stiff neck could be an early
indicator of bacterial meningitis.

186
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,911
There are many possible
explanations for a stiff neck,

187
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,989
most of which are much more
likely than bacterial meningitis...

188
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,100
If the abscess has invaded
the meninges of his brain,

189
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,491
it could be exacerbating
his paranoia.

190
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,580
We need to bring him back to
the hospital for a lumbar puncture.

191
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,602
Come on, Shaun. There's
nothing to lose by trying.

192
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,900
I have something to lose.

193
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,807
It's not my last day
at Saint Bonaventure.

194
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,402
Dr. Andrews won't be happy.

195
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,971
Look, it's my responsibility.

196
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,814
If anything happens,
I'll take the blame, okay?

197
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,109
Okay.

198
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,286
It's probably best that Jared
isn't here on his last day.

199
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,320
It's gotta be awkward.

200
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,362
I mean, how do you
say goodbye to someone

201
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,922
who must have meant
that much to you?

202
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,961
What Jared and I had is over.

203
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,737
It was never all that
much of a big deal, anyway.

204
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,614
You worked with
him for over a year.

205
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,644
You were sleeping with
him for most of that time.

206
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,909
For me, anyway, you can't sleep
with someone and not feel anything.

207
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,917
And for you... You're way more
decent and caring than I am.

208
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,578
Hey.

209
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,087
Melanie has an aortic aneurysm?

210
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,693
Two hearts beating into that.

211
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,023
Yeah. Not so good.

212
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,165
We could reinforce the dilated
aorta with an endovascular stent.

213
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,003
But we can't attach
the donor heart's aorta

214
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,906
to an aneurysm
over a metal tube.

215
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,510
Why not resect the dilated tissue
and re-approximate the artery ends?

216
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,172
Great.

217
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,448
Except the wall's
inherently weakened.

218
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,817
How long do you think
it'll take to dilate again?

219
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,213
It was nice while it lasted.

220
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,351
I'll let Andrews know.

221
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,399
I didn't wanna say
anything, I'm not entirely sure,

222
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,000
but you suggested
resecting the dilated tissue.

223
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,233
What if we resect the
entire abnormal segment?

224
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,569
Shorten the ascending aorta...

225
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,735
You were very right
not to be entirely sure.

226
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,745
You need to have enough
aorta to plug in the donor...

227
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,612
Actually, a version of
that could maybe work.

228
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:03,289
We'd reduce the risk of the aortic
aneurysm if we used a Teflon graft.

229
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:08,853
I, um...

230
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,591
I didn't know
you lived in a tent.

231
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,429
Yes. We got to travel lots.

232
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,060
We saw all of Natrona
County, Wyoming.

233
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,607
What was your favorite part?

234
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,732
My brother.

235
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,744
He took care of me.
He knew I needed help.

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,311
Now I'm fine on my own.

237
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,014
<i>Mary had a little lamb</i>

238
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,441
Keep still.

239
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,745
<i>Little lamb, li...</i>

240
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,737
Don't you want to help Glassman
the way your brother helped you?

241
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,253
I can help people with medicine.

242
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,096
And you can help Dr. Glassman
just by being there, with him,

243
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,400
letting him know
you're his friend.

244
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,597
He knows I'm his friend.

245
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,310
I don't have to be
there to tell him that.

246
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,434
Okay, Harry,

247
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,777
we're done, but you have
to stay here for a while.

248
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,507
Got a minute?

249
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,411
<i>I get it.</i>

250
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,791
It's your last day, you hate
me, wanna prove me wrong,

251
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,098
prove that you're a better
doctor than I gave you credit,

252
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,595
and leave here with a victory.

253
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,325
It was my medical opinion that
he could have bacterial meningitis.

254
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,835
And if you're right, then
I owe you an apology.

255
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,771
But if you're wrong, then I
will be on the phone to Denver

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,332
and I will make your life
infinitely more complicated

257
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,803
than you think
you're making mine.

258
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,884
You don't seem disappointed.

259
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,818
You think I like passing up
on a once-in-a-lifetime surgery?

260
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,131
I think you don't
mind telling me

261
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,215
that a surgery I publicly
supported can't be done.

262
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,815
I spent half a day with my team

263
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,572
trying to figure out a
way to make it work.

264
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,227
We think there's a way to do
this surgery by using a Teflon graft.

265
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,991
A modified David Procedure.

266
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,798
We cut out the entire
aneurysm segment and replace it.

267
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,015
The dilation starts
above the aortic root.

268
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,237
That leaves enough room
to plug in the donor heart.

269
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,640
That's a great idea.

270
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,670
Isn't it?

271
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,090
There's two hearts, not one.

272
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,725
There'd be about a 20% chance

273
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,058
the graft would blow
at the suture line.

274
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,497
It's not worth it.

275
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,462
Whose idea was it?

276
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,983
It was a joint thing. We
were all talking, and we...

277
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,602
Come on, Claire. You
know that's not true.

278
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,580
It was Claire's idea.

279
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,351
That's very gracious
of you, Dr. Reznick.

280
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,512
I thought we talked about this.

281
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,725
Andrews was right.

282
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,800
I did think Harry
had meningitis,

283
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,475
but maybe I only
really believed it

284
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,305
because I wanted
to prove him wrong.

285
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,814
If this test is negative, we've
wasted the hospital's resources

286
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,441
on my self-indulgent,
pointless gesture.

287
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,777
Your results are ready.

288
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,158
We've wasted hospital resources

289
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,788
on a self-indulgent,
pointless gesture.

290
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,236
Don't worry, Jared.

291
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,277
You're young.

292
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,543
There's still time for you to fulfill
your potential somewhere else.

293
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,320
I think, one day, you're
going to be very happy.

294
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,334
I can unload the
mobile clinic by myself.

295
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,768
I haven't been assigned
anything else to do.

296
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,669
- I'll help you.
- Do something else.

297
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,550
I'm sure there's better ways
you could be spending your time.

298
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,544
I'm halfway through a chapter
of my book. It's very good.

299
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,442
But you shouldn't be
alone on your last day.

300
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,537
Seriously?

301
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,648
You're worried about
me being on my own?

302
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,781
The guy going to a new job?
Not the... Not the guy facing death.

303
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,332
- Not the guy who mentored you for...
- He is not facing death.

304
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,754
No, but he's facing...

305
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,083
He's facing death, Shaun.

306
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,633
That's all he's thinking about in
every one of those waiting rooms.

307
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,526
Are you scared?

308
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,666
And you think by...

309
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,868
by separating yourself
you'll make it easier?

310
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,114
- It does.
- For you, Shaun, not for him.

311
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,053
I'm going to finish my chapter.

312
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,597
How's everything going?

313
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,531
Pretty good.

314
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,665
"Pretty good"?

315
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,109
It's your first week
running a major hospital.

316
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,379
How "pretty bad" has it been?

317
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,779
You heard about the
piggyback surgery falling through.

318
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,475
Read your draft press release.

319
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,779
When does that go out?

320
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,081
Soon as Melendez
informs the family.

321
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,953
You know, I was sure
he'd seize the chance

322
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,220
when Dr. Browne came
up with a potential fix.

323
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,422
He's arrogant, always just does
stuff, knowing he'll find a way.

324
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,056
You assumed he'd
make the call you wanted.

325
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,330
It is his call.

326
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,063
What would
Dr. Glassman have done?

327
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,340
He held on to the
presidency long enough,

328
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,307
he must have been
doing something right.

329
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,075
Don't buy into his
fuzzy warmth, Marcus.

330
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,014
He was a manipulator.

331
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,080
He manipulated the board
into hiring Dr. Murphy.

332
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,485
And he always found a way to
do exactly what he wanted to do.

333
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,645
Sitting around waiting for
tests is a waste of my time,

334
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,780
much less yours.

335
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,820
I know. I told Jared that.

336
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,415
I wanted to read my book,

337
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,122
but he kept saying that I
should just be here with you.

338
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,825
But then I realized that I could be
here with you and also read my book.

339
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,178
I want you to stop doing that.

340
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,695
Harry has kaleidoscopic
disintegration.

341
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,602
We thought he had schizophrenia,

342
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,872
but he does not. He
has a brain tumor.

343
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,362
Thanks. Shaun,
is everything okay?

344
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,762
I have a solution. I
need to find Jared.

345
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,643
Can I ask you something
important really quickly?

346
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,795
- I need to find Jared.
- This is about Jared.

347
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,698
How is he?

348
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,377
Is that your important question?

349
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,037
Well, it, um... It's
just... It's his last day.

350
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,417
No, I'm sorry. You should go.

351
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,686
Um... Just...

352
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,617
Say hello to him for me, okay?

353
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,156
Hello.

354
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,338
Also, your day is not over.

355
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,638
Harry doesn't have
schizophrenia, he has a brain tumor.

356
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,408
- Did you go and see Glassman?
- Yes, that's where I got the idea.

357
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,780
Harry's tumor won't kill him,

358
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,979
but removing it might change
him back to who he was before.

359
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,851
I was hoping Andrews
wouldn't bother

360
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,796
following through on
his threat to call Denver.

361
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,796
I do this, Shaun, and I really
don't leave him any choice.

362
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,325
We need to bring Harry in for
an MRI to confirm the diagnosis.

363
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,702
You need to help me find
him because I can't do it alone.

364
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,881
Have you told the piggyback
patient the surgery is off?

365
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,926
- Not yet.
- How come?

366
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,895
I haven't gotten around to it.

367
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,295
Is it because you're wondering
if you made the right call?

368
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,298
I'm not gonna do it.

369
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,500
The Teflon graft
isn't worth the risk.

370
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,869
- That's a judgment call.
- Yeah, my judgment.

371
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,908
- Your judgment's biased.
- And yours isn't?

372
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,032
Of course mine is.

373
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,177
But as you've made quite
clear, mine doesn't matter.

374
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,374
You're biased because if this fails,
you will publicly pay a huge price.

375
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,716
And if it succeeds, I
will reap a huge windfall.

376
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,381
And I think both those scenarios
are deeply unpleasant to you.

377
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,653
But the only issue
that matters is

378
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,826
are you surgeon enough to
pull this off? I think you are.

379
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,824
Am I wrong?

380
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,003
Get out of my office.

381
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,989
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

382
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,230
Have you seen Harry?
He lives in a tent.

383
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,129
- He's about 6' tall with red hair.
- No.

384
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,723
He said that he lives in a...

385
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,045
- Have you seen a guy named Harry? No?
- Haven't seen him.

386
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,093
Hello. Harry?

387
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,569
Hello. Have you seen
Harry? He lives in a...

388
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,472
We need to find
Harry. You don't...

389
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,279
Have... Okay, you
don't understand.

390
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,443
Okay.

391
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,078
Okay, we...

392
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,588
We need to find Harry. Harry!

393
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,714
Harry!

394
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,352
Ah!

395
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,725
- Shaun.
- Okay.

396
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,862
Hey!

397
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,058
What the hell is wrong with you?

398
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,961
We need to find... Hello? Harry!

399
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,832
Okay.

400
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,445
- He's...
- We need to find him. We need to...

401
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,110
- Shaun, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

402
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,651
- Shaun, it's okay.
- No.

403
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,652
It's not okay. We
need to find Harry.

404
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,613
- We need to find him.
- Shaun.

405
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,051
Okay, please be... Can
you please be quiet?

406
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,527
We found an issue.

407
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,531
An aneurysm near your heart.

408
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,967
So, we can't do the surgery?

409
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,199
We have a solution.

410
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,642
It's an addition to what
we had originally planned.

411
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,904
A Teflon graft.

412
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,453
It's finally time to prepare
you for your surgery, Melanie.

413
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,179
Thank you.

414
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,181
Nurse should be by shortly.

415
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,092
The surgery...

416
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,822
It was already
complicated, and now...

417
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,659
How confident are
you this graft will work?

418
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,571
There are always risks.

419
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,541
But I believe I
can make it work.

420
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,075
Thank you.

421
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,058
That's it, Shaun.
Keep holding it. Good.

422
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,023
- Hold. Hold. Okay.
- Good. Keep your eyes closed.

423
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,092
- Feel the scalpel, Shaun.
- We need to find Harry.

424
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,890
- No.
- Hey, Shaun, it's okay.

425
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,696
It's... It's not okay

426
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,198
- We need to...
- Hey.

427
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,762
- We need to find Harry.
- Hey, Shaun.

428
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,569
- We need to...
- Shaun! Look over there. Look.

429
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,373
Remember Harry
said he had a friend?

430
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,838
Harry.

431
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,783
Harry and Mr. Googly-Eyes.

432
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,346
Yes.

433
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,853
Yes. Harry! Har... Harry!

434
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,284
- Harry!
- What do you want?

435
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,859
This is... This is my
home. My home! Go away!

436
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,899
We're not coming
in, Harry. Okay? We...

437
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,935
We made a mistake, and we
want to run an MRI scan on you...

438
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,232
Always mistakes. Always
blaming others. You see?

439
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,637
I knew you were a
doctor. I knew it. I knew it.

440
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,901
We think you have a brain
tumor and we can help you.

441
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,519
- If we can just get you back...
- Didn't I say, "Go away"?

442
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,188
- If we can just...
- Didn't I say, "Go away"?

443
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,148
- I said go away.
- Edward Austin Thomas.

444
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,120
Harry is not who you really are.

445
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,720
You are Edward Austin Thomas.

446
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,461
You live at 3458
Brookland Avenue.

447
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,470
I have a neurological condition.

448
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,580
I will always have it.

449
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,311
You have a neurological
condition, too,

450
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,153
but yours can be cured.

451
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,923
You just need some surgery,

452
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,023
then you can be Edward
Austin Thomas again.

453
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,107
You're not a doctor, are you?

454
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,346
Let's go.

455
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:29,998
Knife.

456
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,848
Another thing about being president,
it's always your ass on the line,

457
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,546
but ultimately, you're
just a bystander.

458
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,702
He has a wife and daughter.

459
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,343
And I checked out the
address, and it all adds up...

460
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,007
You had to mess with me.

461
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,886
You didn't care that it might
mean the end of your career?

462
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,590
Didn't care what happened to Shaun,
dragged him along? Unforgivable.

463
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,608
Your day's over.

464
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,680
And I'm making
that call to Denver.

465
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,045
The reason we're here right
now is because of Shaun.

466
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,413
Not me.

467
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,993
Shaun believed there was
something wrong with the patient.

468
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,430
Shaun communicated with him,

469
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,900
connected with him,
got him to come in.

470
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,380
And whether he's right or not, I
couldn't be prouder to back him,

471
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,804
because he sticks to his gut,

472
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,931
and he fights for
what he thinks is right.

473
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,681
Excuse me, please. I
have something to say, too.

474
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,381
Edward has a right
parietal brain tumor.

475
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,336
Find Dr. Lim. You can
have OR number two.

476
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,682
There she goes. What's left?

477
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,811
Replace the damaged
segment of aorta with a graft,

478
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,800
then plug the donor
heart into the aortic stump.

479
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,289
Exactly. 3-0 Prolene.

480
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,355
Damn. Give me a pledget.

481
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,038
The aorta wall's too thin.

482
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,534
It's like sewing tissue paper.

483
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,012
I can't anchor the graft here.

484
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,856
We're going to replace the whole
ascending aorta, not just a segment.

485
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,686
We're building an entirely
new aorta of Teflon.

486
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,475
But you'll be plugging the
heart directly into the graft.

487
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,523
That's even riskier.

488
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,726
That's true.

489
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,903
Get me three Teflon grafts
and some monofilament sutures.

490
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,154
Now we just have to
wait to see who wakes up.

491
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,417
Edward or Harry.

492
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,689
Flush it.

493
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,237
- No leaks.
- Put your back into it, Park.

494
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,140
This needs to hold a
systolic pressure of 180.

495
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,269
Good.

496
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,877
Okay, let's plug the donor
heart in, see if this thing holds.

497
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,169
They're connected.
Let's take her off bypass.

498
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,266
We have a heartbeat.

499
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,897
Two heartbeats.

500
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,846
- Who wants to do the closing?
- I'll do it.

501
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,888
The Teflon graft was
my idea. I'd like to finish it.

502
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,471
What we've accomplished
tonight is the type of radical surgery

503
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,108
that we plan to do
more of at this hospital.

504
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,976
I love Dr. Glassman,

505
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:45,220
you love Dr. Glassman,
we all loved Dr. Glassman,

506
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,154
but now is the time
to build on his legacy.

507
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,228
Now is the time to
take Saint Bonaventure

508
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,355
to the forefront of the
medical profession.

509
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,501
I'd like to introduce you

510
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,967
to Elliot Arnott, Melanie's son,

511
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:09,713
and the phenomenal surgeon
who masterminded this surgery,

512
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,339
Dr. Neil Melendez.

513
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,225
He wouldn't take the medication.

514
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:33,801
He just became more
erratic, more disruptive,

515
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,806
and eventually,

516
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,235
for Hannah's sake, I, um...

517
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,576
I had to ask him to leave.

518
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,344
I didn't have a choice.

519
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,610
You couldn't have known it
was the wrong medication.

520
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,449
We were making him worse.

521
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,280
That's true.

522
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,685
He doesn't blame you.

523
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,523
That's kind of
you to say, but...

524
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,697
I know he has a distrust
of doctors, not of you.

525
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,210
- Where am I?
- You're in a hospital.

526
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,735
You're okay.

527
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,271
Eddie?

528
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,478
Mary.

529
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,126
Oh... My lamb.

530
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,095
Daddy.

531
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,515
Shaun.

532
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,563
I meant what I said to Andrews.

533
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,528
He might never fully appreciate
what you accomplished out there,

534
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,302
but I did.

535
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,975
I know.

536
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,185
Thank you, Shaun.

537
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,487
Thank you, Jared.

538
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,293
Do you have my book?

539
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:43,885
Yeah.

540
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,207
I said goodbye to Jared.

541
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,214
He has to go to Denver,

542
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,016
and I have to stay
here, with you.

543
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,613
No, you don't, Shaun.

544
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,562
It's not up to Jared,
it's not up to me,

545
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,895
it's not up to anyone
to tell you where to be.

546
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,936
I've got a long
journey ahead of me.

547
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,403
And in the end,

548
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,813
I've got to take it alone.

549
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,314
Yes. I understand.

550
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,488
I'm going with you.

551
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,322
Jared.

552
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,681
I missed having you
around as a colleague.

553
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:54,682
But I...

554
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:01,394
I also miss what
we had together.

555
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,071
You know, I th... I think
we made a mistake.

556
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,238
I made a mistake.

557
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,083
And I'd like you to stay.

558
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,621
No.

559
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,401
It's hard saying goodbye,

560
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,376
but it doesn't
mean it's a mistake.

561
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,544
Yeah.

562
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,111
I think you'll be okay.

563
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,956
I'll be okay.

564
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,563
I think one day we're both
going to be very happy.

565
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,304
Hey.

566
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,196
<i>I wanna wake up
Where your love is</i>

567
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:43,791
<i>'Cause your love Is
always waking mine</i>

568
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,862
<i>I wanna break down
Where your heart gets</i>

569
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,137
<i>So torn It's almost
breaking mine</i>

570
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:57,013
<i>I wanna tell you
What my truth is</i>

571
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,812
<i>But it's buried down inside</i>

572
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:03,218
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm</i>

573
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,018
<i>It's buried down inside</i>

574
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,132
Aren't you gonna say hello?

575
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,326
Hello.
