1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,676
We should not live together.

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,112
That makes no sense.

3
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:18,413
I rented that apartment, and
neither of us can afford it on our own.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,382
It has a fireplace.

5
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,356
We shouldn't live together.

6
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,585
It has a fireplace.

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:36,196
Do you ever think
about us being together,

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,967
as a couple?

9
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,096
Sometimes.

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,241
I don't want that.

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,642
You don't want
us to be a couple?

12
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,275
Or you don't want me
thinking about us as a couple?

13
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,411
Neither.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,083
If we get an apartment
together, I feel like that's a signal

15
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,891
that you and I might end
up as boyfriend and girlfriend.

16
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,398
And that's not going to happen.

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,832
You can't predict the future.

18
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,904
Feelings change.

19
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,462
I used to hate hugs but
now, sometimes, I don't.

20
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,806
But I don't want my feelings to
change. I like being your friend.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,005
And romantic relationships
are unpredictable,

22
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,947
so much can go wrong,
especially when I am involved.

23
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,608
And if we live together,
it's gonna be awkward.

24
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,814
You're bound to walk in
on me when I'm naked,

25
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,153
or hear the weird sex sounds I
make with some out-of-work drummer,

26
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,769
or find me crying when
that drummer dumps me

27
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,093
even though I was
totally gonna dump him.

28
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:46,663
I was so unhappy when
we weren't getting along.

29
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,674
You were, too, right?

30
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,535
Yes.

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,384
Anything that puts our friendship
at risk isn't worth it to me.

32
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,508
Okay, Shaun?

33
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,114
Yes.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,128
Our gallbladder removal's off.

35
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,366
Patient took an Ambien last night,
woke up eating a roast chicken.

36
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,150
Let's check the consult list for
something a little more interesting.

37
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,143
See, gallbladders are boring.

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,679
You're a resident. You don't
get to call any surgery boring.

39
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:26,805
See...

40
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,416
This is interesting.

41
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,588
Fizzy urine.

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,989
Forty-two-year-old
female, syncopal episode

43
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,410
with persistent loss
of consciousness.

44
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,528
On the ride, she went
into PVT, rate of 180.

45
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,731
We shocked her back
to normal sinus rhythm.

46
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,898
I'm starting to feel...

47
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,436
She's going back into PVT.

48
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,653
We need to shock
her, get her into a bay...

49
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,077
No, no.

50
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,777
That was cool, but you may
have just cracked her sternum.

51
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,718
- What happened?
- Get her into Bay Two.

52
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,551
- You're her husband?
- Yes.

53
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,223
Your wife is pretty frail. Any
idea what could have caused that?

54
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:16,458
She did, she's anorexic.

55
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,074
I'm Dr. Murphy.
This is Dr. Park.

56
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,444
We're here about your urine.
How long has it been fizzy?

57
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,881
I hadn't even noticed.
Is that a problem?

58
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,217
It can be a symptom of several
conditions, many of them minor.

59
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,900
You're here for ortho, a
scope on your right knee?

60
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,723
It's been sore. I've
been training for a race.

61
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,786
Joint pain plus fizzy urine.

62
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,561
You could have emphysematous cystitis,
bladder cancer, kidney problems...

63
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,796
Those sound serious.
Should I call my husband?

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,906
Emphysematous cystitis is
a treatable bladder infection.

65
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:04,001
Your symptoms could also be
from a kidney stone or dehydration.

66
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,839
Could my issues be caused
by gastric bypass surgery?

67
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,745
Depends. When was it?

68
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,851
Fifteen years ago. I
used to be 377 pounds.

69
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,113
That's a lot.

70
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,090
Your surgery wouldn't
cause those symptoms.

71
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,925
But we need to do a
cystoscopy to find out what did.

72
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,022
I'll cancel the ortho,
and get Lim to sign off.

73
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,133
Hey, wait, what... So,
what is a cystoscopy?

74
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:35,005
It's like a knee scope, except
the camera goes up your penis.

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,213
You administered amiodarone?

76
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,509
Her rhythm's normal.

77
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,673
That's good, right?

78
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,153
It's better than
when you came in.

79
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,449
Your heart is failing

80
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,788
as a result of a condition
called "mitral regurgitation."

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,321
One of your valves
isn't closing all the way.

82
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,863
Blood keeps leaking
back into your atrium.

83
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,630
That's why you fainted, and why
we need to repair that valve ASAP.

84
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,495
How long have you been anorexic?

85
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:11,678
I've had issues with food
on and off since I was 14.

86
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,375
Mitral valve issues are a frequent
complication of long-term malnutrition.

87
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,713
This bout started
about a year ago.

88
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,312
Skipping meals, lying about
eating, exercising excessively.

89
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,822
I don't know what else I can do. I
can't monitor her 24 hours a day.

90
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,326
I'm not asking you to.

91
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,834
No, but you are
starving yourself...

92
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,056
Mom!

93
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,332
Graham-y, come here.

94
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,164
What's he doing here?

95
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,429
When I got home, I heard
about the ambulance.

96
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,029
I made Cindy bring me here.

97
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,335
What's wrong with my mom?

98
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,075
She needs a surgery to
repair a valve in her heart.

99
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,080
This heart thing, is that
why she's so skinny?

100
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,953
Look, what matters, Graham,

101
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,557
is that these doctors are
gonna help your mom. Okay?

102
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,031
You haven't moved your bowels.

103
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,469
Thank you, Shaun, for that announcement.
Saves me the trouble of tweeting.

104
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,632
The nurses already knew.

105
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,301
They told me. They also said

106
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,709
you're no longer talking
to your dead daughter.

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,982
Constipated but no longer
psychotic. A narrow win.

108
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,416
Your first defecation event

109
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,478
is a vital part of the
discharge criteria.

110
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,217
Event? What is this,
the post-op decathlon,

111
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,702
pooping, peeing,
walking, talking...

112
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,924
Yes, you have to walk
a full lap of the floor.

113
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,761
But you canceled physical
therapy this morning.

114
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,266
Those nurses have big mouths.

115
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,269
I canceled because
my leg is a little sore.

116
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,602
That could be
phlebitis or a DVT or...

117
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,006
It could also be
unsurprising complications

118
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,010
from a surgeon poking
around in my pons.

119
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:55,071
Every day in the hospital
increases your risk of infection

120
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,344
by 1.37%.

121
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,579
You need to move your bowels,
and we should walk right now.

122
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,151
I'll go very slow.

123
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,989
Shaun, is there any chance that
you are needed elsewhere right now?

124
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,123
I have eight minutes until
my patient's cystoscopy.

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,829
Good. Be early.

126
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,503
Urethra looks clean.

127
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,932
No lesions, no stones so far.

128
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,800
How do we check for
obstructions, or stones further up?

129
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,210
Contrast cystogram.

130
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,780
Since you found this patient,
how about you do the honors?

131
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,482
You know, this guy used
to weigh 370 pounds.

132
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,650
Thread the catheter
further into the bladder.

133
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,018
That's a big drop. Good for him.

134
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,856
He did have gastric bypass.

135
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,392
That makes it less impressive?
Now, infuse the contrast.

136
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,832
Well, yeah. It is the easy way,
compared to just diet and exercise.

137
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,570
The contrast dye is dissipating.

138
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,196
It's supposed to.

139
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,832
You said he's training for a race.
Obviously, he turned his life around.

140
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,173
Still dissipating.

141
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,145
The bypass made it
physically impossible

142
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,457
for him to eat as
much as he wanted.

143
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,041
It's gone. The contrast is gone.

144
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,798
That makes no sense.
- Where did it go?

145
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,259
He probably has a fistula.

146
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,852
A tunnel connecting his
bladder to his intestine.

147
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,921
Air and bacteria moving
the other direction

148
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,499
caused bubbles in his urine.

149
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,065
Her liver and thyroid are
normal, but her electrolytes are off.

150
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,041
Her albumin is at 2.1.
She's severely malnourished.

151
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,706
She'll be totally vulnerable
to post-op infections.

152
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,842
She needs a surgery to survive, but
she may be too sick to survive the surgery.

153
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,389
In order to operate safely, we
need to boost your caloric intake,

154
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,461
optimize protein.

155
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,087
Can't you do that through my IV?

156
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,223
It's more efficient to pump
nutritional supplement

157
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,597
directly into your stomach.

158
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,636
We use a tube running
down from your nose.

159
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,069
I had an NG tube once...

160
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,274
It didn't work. She
couldn't tolerate it.

161
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,247
Because it's not really
about food, it's about control.

162
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,545
You've lived for decades
with a condition that has killed

163
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,590
more people than any
other psychiatric illness.

164
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,449
You didn't just
survive, you had a child.

165
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,488
Can you tell us how?

166
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:30,636
When I got pregnant, it
was like this terrifying miracle.

167
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,608
I mean, the thought of
gaining all that weight...

168
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,441
But I wanted him so much.

169
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,774
We both did.

170
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,977
Every meal, I would sit with
pictures of his ultrasound,

171
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,952
imagining the food
going directly to him.

172
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,518
Can you do that
again? Eat for Graham.

173
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,435
We've determined the fistula
between your bladder and intestine

174
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,309
was caused by Crohn's disease,
an inflammatory intestinal condition.

175
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,109
Once we reverse your
gastric bypass, you'll need...

176
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,447
Wait. What? Reverse
my bypass? Are you sure?

177
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,213
Bypass surgery shortens
the digestive tract.

178
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,866
People with Crohn's disease need
every inch of intestine they have,

179
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,985
or they risk critical,
even fatal malnutrition.

180
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,188
Okay, but I don't want
my husband to know.

181
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,295
And he'll be here soon.

182
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,724
We would never reveal
anything without your permission.

183
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:39,295
But Crohn's disease is going to
require some major adjustments.

184
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,574
I'll tell Spence
about the Crohn's,

185
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:47,204
and I'll tell him I'm having
surgery on my bladder.

186
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,580
Your husband doesn't
know you had gastric bypass?

187
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,662
That would require him knowing
I was obese to begin with.

188
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,766
That's not going to happen.

189
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,390
Your husband must
be very shallow.

190
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,553
Even if I don't disclose
that I reversed your bypass,

191
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,254
your scars might. It
requires a separate incision.

192
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,243
I'll tell him there
was a complication.

193
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,260
Our obligation to protect your
privacy doesn't include lying.

194
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,014
And you shouldn't have to
go through this without him...

195
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:16,032
The single abdominal
umbilical port.

196
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:22,580
We can repair Wade's
fistula and reverse his bypass,

197
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,584
all through a single incision.

198
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,586
We can help
deceive your husband.

199
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,386
Honey, I'm so sorry.

200
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,534
- That's okay, Spence.
- Got here as soon as I could.

201
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,357
It's all right.

202
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,228
And, since my husband is surrounded
by surgeons, what's the issue?

203
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,425
What are you gonna do about it? And
how often have you done it successfully?

204
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:50,967
How're you doing?

205
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,443
I'm fine.

206
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,116
Graham, would
you mind filling this?

207
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,223
You've had one spoonful of
tuna, two ounces of apple sauce.

208
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:12,129
That's it? Mom, if that's all I had,
you'd never let me up from the table.

209
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,396
This is different. I
can't eat too quickly.

210
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,833
I don't believe you.

211
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,805
It's true. Your mother's
suffering from severe malnutrition,

212
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,273
and she's trying her best...

213
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,312
I knew it. You're too skinny,
that's why you're here,

214
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,622
that's probably why
your heart's messed up.

215
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,842
- And you still won't eat.
- Graham, I'm trying.

216
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,110
- How hard can it be to eat?
- I'm not feeling well.

217
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,295
Me and Dad are really worried
about you. Don't you care?

218
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,346
Of course, I do,
Graham, so much.

219
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,016
Then do something. Prove it.

220
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,798
Did you provoke that argument?

221
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,362
Yep, and I may have
just saved our patient.

222
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,704
She requested an NG tube.

223
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,336
Understanding is
nice, calories are better.

224
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,676
He's screwing this up.

225
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,194
His husband's scared, and he
just wants to know what's going on.

226
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,949
Nothing like marital
advice from the divorced.

227
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,114
You're divorced, too.

228
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,383
And I'm not advising.

229
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,824
I'm not judging the health of a
marriage based on a single secret,

230
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,022
which is neither shocking nor
a sign of its imminent demise.

231
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,962
What, truth in a
marriage is overrated?

232
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,467
It was in mine. Not
every single insight,

233
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,560
opinion or impulse
needs to be shared.

234
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,198
Marriage sounds confusing.
No wonder you both failed at it.

235
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,412
How's it going in here?

236
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,876
Not as bad as I remember.

237
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,675
Does it hurt, Mom?

238
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,648
No. Just a little awkward.

239
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,487
Makes it hard to
talk. But I'm okay.

240
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,363
I am so proud of you.

241
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,740
Dr. Glassman hasn't defecated,
or done his physical therapy.

242
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,941
I'm aware, and yet
unalarmed. Who are you?

243
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,575
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

244
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,210
Oh. Right.

245
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,755
You're Dr. Glassman's friend.

246
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,056
Please order him to
do physical therapy.

247
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,892
And give him 15
milligrams of ex-lax.

248
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,864
The ex-lax is a decent idea.

249
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,130
As for the physical therapy,
of course, he's stalling.

250
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,467
Glassman's a proud
man. He ran this hospital.

251
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,234
He's reluctant to feel
weak and vulnerable

252
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,027
in front of people who
used to work for him.

253
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,536
That doesn't make sense. He is
weak, he just had brain surgery.

254
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,072
Well, sensical or not, that's
my take. He'll walk eventually.

255
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:49,085
Every day in the hospital
increases his risk of infection

256
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,056
- by 1.37...
- You tell him that,

257
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,922
and maybe, he'll
hop right out of bed.

258
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,927
I did. It didn't work.

259
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,088
He didn't respond to the stick.

260
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,826
Try the carrot. Although,
really, I would just advise...

261
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,233
Dr. Glassman
doesn't like carrots.

262
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,296
What should I do with the stick?

263
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,605
It's a metaphor.

264
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,644
Uh, Glassman,
appropriately, is the donkey,

265
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:18,844
the stick signifies punishment,
the carrot signifies reward.

266
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,577
But he's recovering
nicely and your best bet

267
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,590
is to just be patient with him.

268
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:29,493
So, I should use a reward
to motivate Dr. Glassman

269
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,961
to do physical therapy.

270
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,335
Actually, what I'm saying is that
you should be patient and supportive.

271
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,304
And please, please answer that.

272
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,013
Close the door.

273
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,290
We were headed to pre-op
when he started projectile vomiting.

274
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:02,693
It's green. That could mean bile
and a partial bowel obstruction.

275
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,127
We need an NG tube.

276
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,962
An obstruction? Did
the Crohn's cause that?

277
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,126
It's hard to know for
sure. NG tube, stat.

278
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,539
You're doing great.

279
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,047
You should try
and get some sleep.

280
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,085
I can't.

281
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:31,419
There's this voice in my
head, and it won't be quiet.

282
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:37,521
It keeps telling me that this
bag has 60 grams of protein,

283
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:43,161
forty grams of fat,
1,200 calories in total.

284
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,670
It just won't stop.

285
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,741
Try to think of Graham and Sam.

286
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,339
I'm trying.

287
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,276
I'll get something
to put over that.

288
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,413
Louisa, no!

289
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,918
No!

290
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:16,259
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't stand it.

291
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,806
I got your deposit back.

292
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,538
Why?

293
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,778
Shaun, I told you that you
and I can't live together.

294
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:38,051
No. You told me we can't
be boyfriend and girlfriend.

295
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,717
We can still be
friends with benefits.

296
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,796
The benefit is, we
would be living together.

297
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,408
I was clear, it's
too complicated...

298
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,567
You were. We can't
date, or kiss, or have sex.

299
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,472
But I thought you
wanted to be friends.

300
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,742
Yes, of course.

301
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,176
And spend time together.

302
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,515
- Right.
- Then it's simple.

303
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,152
She begged us to reinsert the NG tube,
then pulled it out again an hour later.

304
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,856
Do we try again with
the tube and restraints?

305
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,489
We'd just be raising
her risk of self-injury,

306
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,693
pneumonia, blood clots.

307
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,698
What about going
back to solid food?

308
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,363
Anything less than
1,200 calories a day,

309
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,168
and her malnutrition
wouldn't be improving.

310
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,038
In fact, she'll
keep losing weight.

311
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,009
We should go ahead
with that valve repair, now.

312
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,119
I think we can improve her
nutrition, without force-feeding or IVs.

313
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,382
I found a small study
where deep brain stimulation

314
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,893
was used to treat anorexia.

315
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,895
You want to use brain surgery
for a psychiatric disorder?

316
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,796
Surgical procedures
have been effective

317
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:58,167
for depression, OCD, addiction.

318
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,573
This surgery could reduce
her anxiety around eating.

319
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,576
Once she's eating, her
malnutrition will improve

320
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,805
and reduce the risk
of the valve repair.

321
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,007
It could also cause
personality changes.

322
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,653
And this study covers six
subjects, with only 50% success.

323
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,884
This could be Louisa's only
shot at getting free of this illness.

324
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,925
And it was done in the UK.

325
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,160
DBS isn't FDA-approved
for anorexia treatment here.

326
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,666
So, we call an IRB ethics hearing,
and argue emergent use approval.

327
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,163
Which we shouldn't
get off such little data.

328
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:35,068
Nice work digging this
up, but it's not a real option.

329
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,537
Let's go talk to her
about the valve surgery.

330
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,776
Can I help you?

331
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,913
I'm looking for a carrot.
Seventeen, 18, 19...

332
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,753
No... Sorry, we don't
have any carrot muffins.

333
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,761
How about a lemon-poppy, Shaun?

334
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,099
Hello, Debbie Wexler.

335
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,931
It's a metaphor for
moving a donkey.

336
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,471
I need a carrot because
I don't want to beat

337
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,873
Dr. Glassman with a stick.
He likes blueberry muffins.

338
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,277
How's Aaron...
Dr. Glassman recovering?

339
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,611
He moved his
bowels this morning.

340
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:22,287
But he doesn't want to appear weak,
so, he hasn't done physical therapy.

341
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,589
I want that blueberry
muffin, please.

342
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,594
It has 23 visible blueberries.

343
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:32,928
You know, Aaron once told
me that his absolute favorites

344
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,230
were the chocolate-chip ones.
Do you want one of those instead?

345
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:40,296
Yes, I want one
of those instead.

346
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,107
Oh, hi, Dr. Park.

347
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,446
I have a few questions
about Wade's surgery.

348
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,182
Sorry, I'm pretty busy. I
actually need to get going.

349
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,446
I'll walk with you.

350
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,290
I know Wade's
surgery is this afternoon,

351
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,021
but I've been researching
treatments for Crohn's lesions.

352
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,238
What did we do
before the Internet?

353
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,822
I talked to two experts who
felt that Wade should be put on

354
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,629
Remicade or Azathioprine
before any surgical intervention.

355
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,422
Interesting recommendations,
but considering

356
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,748
they haven't seen
your husband's chart...

357
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,950
Well, this doctor felt strongly that
you should see how he responds

358
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,151
- to medication before...
- Wade's care

359
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,753
is completely appropriate
for his condition.

360
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,354
But if his Crohn's
lesions could be treated

361
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,280
- without cutting him open...
- That's not what we're treating.

362
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,044
Excuse me?

363
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,179
Go talk to your husband.

364
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,122
I brought you a
chocolate-chip muffin.

365
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,657
I love chocolate-chip.
Thank you.

366
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,466
Where is it?

367
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,531
At the nurses' station.

368
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,371
You can walk out to get it.

369
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,241
Shaun, you see, here, I thought
you were doing something nice for me.

370
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,744
- I am.
- No, you're not.

371
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,011
You're manipulating.
My leg hurts,

372
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,247
and I have a sore throat,
and I don't feel like walking.

373
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:06,151
Dr. Blaize says you don't want
to seem weak in front of people

374
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,523
who used to work for you.

375
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:11,189
Dr. Blaize is wrong. I don't wanna
walk because I don't wanna walk.

376
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,325
And this is condescending,
and it's insulting and it's annoying.

377
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,068
Should I get you your muffin?

378
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,870
That would be nice.

379
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,377
An orderly is eating it.

380
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,099
Mr. DeLeon, can I help you?

381
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,232
My wife's decided against
the valve repair surgery.

382
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,536
At least until she's tried

383
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,544
the deep brain
stimulation for her anorexia.

384
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,048
Did Dr. Browne tell you that it's
an experimental brain surgery,

385
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,030
which could alter your
wife's personality forever?

386
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,250
That's if we get the
special approval required.

387
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,814
She's explained all the issues.

388
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,112
I got our apartment back.

389
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,644
I had to pay $300
more as a deposit

390
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,945
because someone else
wanted it, but that's okay

391
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:42,648
- because it has a fireplace.
- No, Shaun...

392
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,246
Why aren't you listening to me?

393
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,656
You're not listening to me.

394
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,287
Okay...

395
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,865
I'll be okay running
into you naked.

396
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,841
Or hearing sex noises,

397
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,880
or seeing you cry over
breakups with drummers.

398
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,313
I know that you think you
can, but how can you be sure?

399
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:14,285
Because living with
you will be good for me.

400
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,652
It makes me happy.

401
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,797
You remember
what you said, Shaun,

402
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:34,397
that no one can predict the
future, and feelings can change?

403
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,143
What if I end up
hurting you again?

404
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:46,015
I don't want to risk our friendship
over an apartment. Do you?

405
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:57,060
If we don't live together,

406
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,155
you will have to buy
your own batteries.

407
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,868
- We'll still see each other.
- That will be hard. I work a lot.

408
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,839
We'll find a way.
I know we will.

409
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,344
I need to go to work.

410
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:31,186
I'll stop on the way
home and tell the manager

411
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,198
we don't want the apartment.

412
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,059
No, I'll do it.

413
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,420
The subjects who
responded in this study

414
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,257
are all long-term sufferers
with a target BMI of 13 to 16,

415
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:06,094
who actively pursued this
treatment, much like our patient.

416
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:10,261
Additionally, DBS surgery
requires lighter sedation

417
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,295
and places less strain on her
system than an open chest procedure.

418
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,467
You're referring to the valve repair
recommended by Dr. Melendez?

419
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,147
Yes, I propose delaying that
surgery by a couple weeks.

420
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,773
Which would be well worth

421
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,479
it in terms of the reduction of
risk if the DBS is successful.

422
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,750
Excellent presentation,
Dr. Browne. Very thorough.

423
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,660
Agreed, though I do have concerns
about approving this procedure

424
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,789
based on the small subject
pool. But I'll confer with...

425
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:45,099
There is one more person I
want you to hear from. The patient.

426
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,164
This is an IRB, not
a therapy session.

427
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,439
Actually, patients who had the
opportunity to air their concerns

428
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:59,008
are eight times less
likely to sue their hospital.

429
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,684
You paged me?

430
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,123
You can step out.
Dr. Park's got this.

431
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,824
Grab the sheet.

432
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,528
You talked to Wade's husband.

433
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,495
Maybe we should
discuss this later.

434
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,836
I can patch him up
while tearing you down.

435
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,899
You violated our
patient's confidentiality.

436
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,872
I told him what we weren't
treating, that's not a violation.

437
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,347
And their marriage is better off for
having his secrets out in the open.

438
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,193
That'd be meaningful if you
were a marriage counselor

439
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,708
instead of a surgical resident.

440
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,082
Whatever lie blew up your marriage
won't be undone if Wade tells the truth.

441
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,556
I was just trying
to help our patient.

442
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,060
Our former patient.

443
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,357
Wade's demanding a
transfer to another hospital.

444
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,897
I have tried cognitive
behavioral therapy,

445
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,341
food psychodynamic therapy,

446
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,247
family therapy,

447
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,341
inpatient treatment,
outpatient treatment,

448
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:12,187
antidepressants, NG tubes, TPN,

449
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,362
and yet, here I am, dying.

450
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,868
Killing myself.

451
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,067
And I can't stop on my own.

452
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,977
Please, help me to stop.

453
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:44,250
Are you aware DBS has been
known to cause personality changes?

454
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,317
In your case, the electrode would
be at the nucleus accumbens...

455
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,724
Dr. Browne explained
all of the risks.

456
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,510
It's important we know
that you understand.

457
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,400
The nucleus accumbens plays
a role in maternal attachment,

458
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,303
delivering dopamine when
moms interact with their children.

459
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:09,481
Now, what if in trying to
overcome your eating disorder,

460
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,278
you lose the ability to
feel love for your son?

461
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,952
My son is everything to me.

462
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,768
For the past year, he has been
watching me starve myself to death.

463
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:37,036
I'll risk anything to keep
him from seeing me succeed.

464
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,610
Thank you, Ms. DeLeon.

465
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,323
We'll need a few
minutes to talk.

466
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,127
You kept it a secret
because you think I'm shallow.

467
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,360
I said the same thing.

468
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,733
I kept it a secret because
of "friendly fatties."

469
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,032
Any news on my transfer?

470
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,166
San Francisco General
should have a bed tomorrow.

471
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,844
- Come on. It's a joke.
- I'm here to clamp

472
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,471
- your nasogastric tube.
- A joke?

473
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,344
About a couple we've
known for years?

474
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,318
We were at their wedding, and
yet, you treat them like a punch line.

475
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,629
This used to be green,
and now, it's brown.

476
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,054
You're the one who lied. If I'd
known you were offended, I...

477
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,183
The point is, is that's
why I didn't tell you.

478
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,157
Red and green makes
brown. Your bowel is bleeding.

479
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,996
You need surgery now.
Page Dr. Park and Dr. Lim.

480
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,197
- He has a strangulated bowel.
- Spence...

481
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,398
It's gonna be okay.

482
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,497
We need to open up an OR now.

483
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,942
By a margin of two to one,
this Internal Review Board

484
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:52,006
has decided in favor of
allowing this procedure.

485
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,518
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

486
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,610
Hope the surgery goes well.

487
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,264
Use the 45
millimeter gold stapler.

488
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,796
The truth coming out
didn't help Wade's marriage.

489
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,802
Well, hopefully, with some time.

490
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,034
Secrets are corrosive. Wade
should've been honest from the start.

491
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,942
Maybe, Wade thought
Spencer would feel the same way

492
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,914
you did about his bypass.

493
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,749
That he lost weight
the easy way.

494
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,720
Okay, it's time.

495
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,244
Graham-y.

496
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:10,619
You are the
highlight of my life.

497
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,423
You know that, right?

498
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,829
Yeah. I love you, too.

499
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,264
I love you more than
any person on the planet

500
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,207
ever loved any other
person on the planet.

501
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,345
I know.

502
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,515
- Mom, you're gonna be okay, right?
- Of course, baby.

503
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,375
Of course.

504
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:39,154
We'll see you
guys in a few hours.

505
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,620
I love you.

506
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:59,372
The chocolate-chip muffin didn't
work. The donkey won't walk.

507
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,811
I told you that Glassman's
probably embarrassed...

508
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,875
No. He's not. I asked him,
and he said you were wrong.

509
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,148
Doesn't mean I'm actually wrong.

510
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:18,322
Yes, he needs help recovering.

511
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:23,033
I'm trying to help,
but it's not working.

512
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,730
He got angry at me.

513
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,332
Dr. Glassman is your patient.

514
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,936
- You need to fix his lack of mobility.
- This is your problem.

515
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:38,278
I don't know what to do. I
don't know how to help him.

516
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:42,787
Being sick is hard. Being
around sick people is hard.

517
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,886
We wanna help.

518
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,425
We all struggle with what
to do. Your obsession...

519
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,619
Okay!

520
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,287
More than a muffin,
or a bowel movement,

521
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,262
or a walk around the ward,

522
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,097
what Glassman needs is
someone to be there for him.

523
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,537
A patient, supportive friend.

524
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,111
I know the perfect person.

525
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,809
Okay.

526
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,923
Hey, there. How are you feeling?

527
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,662
I'm okay.

528
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:37,299
I feel like I want
something to eat.

529
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:40,738
I'm hungry.

530
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,450
All right, buddy.

531
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,922
Let's get you home, get
you a decent night's sleep.

532
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,712
I'll see you in the morning.

533
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,466
I'll go get you some food.

534
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,142
Are you sure you're all right?

535
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,443
Yeah. I just...

536
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,850
I wonder if that hug
felt different for him.

537
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,449
Did it for you?

538
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,699
Your husband's
surgery went well.

539
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,708
He's in recovery now.
I think he's awake.

540
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,038
Thank you.

541
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,589
Wade told me
where to find these.

542
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,720
This is him before bypass?

543
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,524
He said that seeing these
would help me understand

544
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,226
why he never told me.

545
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,497
Which I said was ridiculous.

546
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,243
Is he gonna end
up like this again?

547
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,846
It's possible.

548
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,861
I wish I didn't know that.

549
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,241
Yeah.

550
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,956
Debbie, hi.

551
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,460
Oh, um...

552
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,060
Shaun thought you
could use a visit.

553
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,731
- Huh.
- Oh, and, uh...

554
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,764
And another muffin.

555
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,468
Thank you. I wish I'd
known you were coming.

556
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,402
I would've slipped into
something a little less comfortable.

557
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,499
- You look good.
- Huh!

558
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,840
- Yeah, well...
- Unlikely, but thank you.

559
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:33,183
I'm sorry that I've
been out of touch.

560
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,253
Well, I had a brain tumor.

561
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,120
Understandable we
both dropped the ball.

562
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,797
Okay. Here we go.

563
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,768
- What's happening?
- We're taking a walk.

564
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,804
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
No, my leg hurts... Ow, ow!

565
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,582
Yes, sweetheart. Yeah.
That... Which is exactly

566
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,837
- why you need to take a walk.
- Yeah.

567
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,539
- Wow. You're really good at this.
- Now, here we go.

568
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,089
Are you sure you
haven't done this before?

569
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,209
Well, I spent a
little time as a nurse.

570
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,157
I always liked the night shift.
Everything gets really quiet.

571
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,319
It's almost peaceful.

572
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:36,504
I just came from Louisa's
room. She's eating.

573
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,510
That's great news.

574
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:42,711
Yeah. Hopefully, we'll be able to
do the valve repair in a couple weeks.

575
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,186
I hope you're right.

576
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,090
But you won't be a
part of the surgery.

577
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,526
Or any of my surgeries.

578
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,992
You went around me,
directly to the patient.

579
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,402
I had a good idea that
you didn't take seriously.

580
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,195
I considered it, and then I decided
against taking it to the patient.

581
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,710
And yet, I managed to get Aoki
and Andrews to sign off at the IRB.

582
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,549
You didn't get Andrews.

583
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,219
You voted for me?

584
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,455
You made a strong case.

585
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,220
But you're booting
me off your service?

586
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,362
Disagree with me all you want.

587
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,920
I expect my residents to.

588
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,932
I expect them to argue
passionately for their position.

589
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,534
And I expect them to
then accept my decision.

590
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,133
Even when you're wrong.

591
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,978
I can't run my
team any other way.

592
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,664
You know what was insane,
was the 1928 Torpedo Roadster.

593
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,566
- With the purple-heart trim?
- Oh. And the lizard skin interior?

594
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,076
My neighbor in Wyoming
had a Silver Arrow.

595
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,668
Oh, I'd love to drive
one of those, just once.

596
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:19,016
Good job. You got him walking.

597
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,951
Debbie Wexler did it.

598
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,114
She's a better carrot than I am.

599
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,356
She's a better friend.

600
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,132
Hey, it's me.

601
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,001
Yeah, just making sure
the check got there okay.

602
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,332
Great, great.

603
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:47,870
I have a question about Phil.

604
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,177
I know, I know, he's long gone.

605
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,375
I was actually wondering,

606
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,889
what do you think would've happened
if I hadn't seen you two together?

607
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,336
I found my next apartment.

608
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,867
Okay.

609
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:21,470
It has a fireplace,
and natural lighting...

610
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,174
No... No...

611
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:27,912
And a really great
roommate who's also a friend.

612
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,512
He works a lot, so, it might
be hard to see him, otherwise.

613
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,086
I'm talking about you, Shaun.

614
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,326
I don't want to risk anything
hurting our friendship.

615
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,270
If you say you can handle
living together, I trust you.

616
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:58,212
We're going to be roommates.

617
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,255
- It has a fireplace.
- Yes, it does.

618
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,453
Oh! We're going to be roommates.

619
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,055
We're going to be roommates!

620
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,258
Okay!

621
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,528
- Yes!
- Okay!

622
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,934
Yes!

623
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,630
- Yes!
- Yeah!

624
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:21,933
Yay!
