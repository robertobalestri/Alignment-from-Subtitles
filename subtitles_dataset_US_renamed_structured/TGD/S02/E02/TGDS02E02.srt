1
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,125
You're here early.
Trouble sleeping?

2
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,259
No.

3
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,427
Just wanted to get out of
my apartment and to work.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,971
We work you plenty
hard enough. Go home.

5
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,565
Making sure you're rested
is also part of the job.

6
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,765
I understand.

7
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,374
What should I tell a patient
if they don't think they're sick,

8
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,473
but I think they have
pancreatic cancer?

9
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,780
You think one of our patients
has pancreatic cancer?

10
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,726
Seventeen.

11
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,630
He's burped 17
times in 10 minutes.

12
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,462
It's a frequent symptom
of pancreatic cancer.

13
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,430
Shaun, it's acid reflux.

14
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,335
He's also jaundiced.

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,134
No, he isn't.

16
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:23,340
Paul's skin is definitely not the
same color it was six months ago.

17
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,613
- Paul?
- I looked at his mouth

18
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,678
when he was telling
me about his daughter.

19
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,017
- She just...
- Walk with me.

20
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,515
Say nothing.

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,875
Hey, Shaun.

22
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,812
Do a CBC, CMP, amylase, lipase,

23
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,515
CA-19-9 levels and CT abdomen,

24
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,889
pelvis pancreatic protocol.
And do not tell him why.

25
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,393
You want me to lie?

26
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,985
I don't want you
to tell the truth.

27
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,554
The discoloration, if
there is any, is very minor.

28
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,509
I don't want you scaring the
crap out of the man over nothing.

29
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,162
Excellent. I've
been practicing lying.

30
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,670
I lied to you when I said

31
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,230
I just wanted to get out of
my apartment and to work.

32
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,033
Take Claire.

33
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,077
Hello, I'm Dr. Lim. How
can I help you today, Asha?

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,145
I want plastic surgery.

35
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,650
Sweetheart, this is
the Emergency Room.

36
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,837
If you want, I can make an
appointment for you with...

37
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,887
You do vaginal
rejuvenation, right?

38
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,493
Yes. On much older,
much vainer women,

39
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,559
generally after
having many children.

40
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,015
I don't know what the
boys have told you...

41
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,063
Examine me.

42
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:55,834
Please.

43
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,203
Please take off your underwear.

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,463
Were you in an accident?

45
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,140
No. Can you help me?

46
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,969
- Did your father do this to you?
- No. Please, just...

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,058
Did your mother? I need
to know who did this to you.

48
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,914
No, you don't. It
doesn't matter who.

49
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,056
When I was two years old,

50
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:52,591
I was tied down, and
I was circumcised.

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,129
Please. I'm hideous.

52
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,674
Will you help me?

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,774
Yes.

54
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,328
Why do you need to confirm
a diagnosis of acid reflux?

55
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,766
Because we're doctors.

56
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,430
It's what we do. We just
like to be sure of everything.

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,973
There are a few
remote possibilities...

58
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,101
I've got this.

59
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,446
Are you familiar with the
hospital employee manual?

60
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,883
Section 17, subsection C-Ill?

61
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,647
- No.
- Good.

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
- "Good"?
- Yes.

63
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:53,192
It requires that all
employees shall be subject to,

64
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,818
and I quote,

65
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,660
"Any and all possible
necessary tests to confirm

66
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,223
"any and all diagnoses,
no matter how mundane,

67
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,031
"the cost of which tests shall be
borne by the hospital," end quote.

68
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,914
The board wants to make sure
that no one is exposed to patients

69
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,645
if there is any chance that they
have any communicable condition.

70
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,023
I had the flu last week.

71
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,419
Why didn't anybody
do anything for me then?

72
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,192
- It's a new policy.
- You might have pancreatic cancer.

73
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,899
What? What'd he say?

74
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,339
Female genital mutilation
is the ritual cutting,

75
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,438
or removal, of some, or all, of
the external female genitalia.

76
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,176
Over 200,000,000
victims worldwide,

77
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,014
it is almost
universally practiced

78
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,520
in a number of African
and Asian countries.

79
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,851
Where was she born?

80
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,791
Wisconsin. Yeah, it's way more
common here than you think.

81
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,225
What religion is she?

82
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,114
- I didn't ask.
- This isn't about religion.

83
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,858
No legit religious
organization endorses this stuff.

84
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,213
We're gonna do the labiaplasty
first thing in the morning.

85
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,937
The damage done to her
nerves is not going to get undone,

86
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,198
nor is the psych damage,

87
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,700
but at least she'll
look like other girls.

88
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,638
We should be able to have her
out of here by 6:00 in the evening.

89
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,542
Outpatient? Why the hurry?

90
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,581
So her mother will simply
think she's in school,

91
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,277
then out studying
with her friends.

92
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,697
She loves her parents
and doesn't want to tell them

93
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,883
that she's rejecting one
of their cultural traditions.

94
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,734
They won't stay
in the dark for long,

95
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,556
since we're legally
obligated to report them.

96
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,896
That "cultural tradition" also
fits the definition of abuse.

97
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,454
They'll also find
out when we ask

98
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,296
for their permission to do
this surgery. She's a minor.

99
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,067
Her ID says she's 18.

100
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,470
Yes, her fake ID says she's 18.

101
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,151
Her number starts with an H, which
means she was born in the '50s.

102
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,610
Also the photo background
is green instead of blue.

103
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,469
Also, six other things.

104
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,658
Maybe we can get Legal
to get a court order...

105
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,310
If I believe that ID is real,

106
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,818
then I am entitled to
perform this surgery

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,754
without seeking consent of
anyone other than the patient.

108
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,758
And, as legally
required within 36 hours,

109
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,418
I'll report the
evidence of abuse

110
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,259
under the name and
address listed on that ID.

111
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,127
If the investigation
of that report

112
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,634
doesn't begin until
the girl is long gone

113
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,831
and happens to lead nowhere
because the name wasn't real,

114
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,305
that's no fault of mine.

115
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,501
You sure you wanna
risk your medical license

116
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,976
- to protect an abusive mother?
- If we do this by the book,

117
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,085
we never see that girl again
and no one gets helped.

118
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,345
If we do this by the book, maybe
the cops lock the parents up,

119
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,662
we shine a light on this thing,
her community gets scared,

120
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,655
and maybe the next girl
doesn't need our help.

121
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,623
Or maybe the testimony of the
girl about what happened to her

122
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,853
when she was two
doesn't help the cops at all.

123
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,458
Maybe the parents just
take their daughter home,

124
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,863
and maybe we scare the next
girl into not even asking for help.

125
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,231
I'm doing the
surgery, to this girl,

126
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,801
under this name, tomorrow
morning at 7:00 a.m.

127
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,176
I can't believe people ever lie.

128
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,424
There are so many questions
people might ask you.

129
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,188
But if you tell the truth, you
already know the answers.

130
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,696
And also, it's wrong.

131
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:23,499
But sometimes you
shouldn't tell the whole truth?

132
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,267
No. Of course not.

133
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,737
Because that lets
you be honorable,

134
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,574
and tell the truth and
be a good person.

135
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:37,110
But at the same time, you get
to completely deceive the person.

136
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,079
- No, I don't think that's...
- Lea came back.

137
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,346
Wow, Shaun, that's great.

138
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,786
She's staying with me
until she finds her own place.

139
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,023
You must be so excited.

140
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,553
Yes.

141
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,225
You're not excited?

142
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,266
I said, "Yes."

143
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,399
Paul has one year to live.

144
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,107
He has pancreatic
cancer, stage three.

145
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,979
No metastatic lesions, but
local nodes are involved.

146
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,752
And there's partial encasement
of the superior mesenteric artery.

147
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,665
That puts it past the point where
we can cure it with a local resection.

148
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,624
We could do Whipple surgery.

149
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,962
That's not advised for stage
three pancreatic cancer.

150
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,662
Not quite. It's not
advised for stage four.

151
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,499
For stage three,
it's discretionary.

152
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,473
In my discretion, he's better off
with 12 semi-comfortable months

153
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,010
rather than the risk of
dying on the table tomorrow.

154
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,774
If he doesn't die on the table,
he could have many years.

155
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,949
It isn't our call to make.

156
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,247
I'll talk to Paul, advise
him of the parameters.

157
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,809
Let him make his own decision.

158
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,420
No. Shaun should do it.

159
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Claire can do it.

160
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,458
Yes, she can, which
is why you should do it.

161
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,964
This is a teaching hospital.

162
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,192
Andrews is right. Being a
surgeon isn't just about cutting.

163
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:28,060
Would it be okay if we
spoke someplace more quiet?

164
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,197
You need someplace quiet
to tell me I have acid reflux?

165
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,196
I think we should
be someplace quiet

166
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,398
because people
sometimes get very upset

167
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,705
when they find out they probably
only have less than a year to live.

168
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,847
Okay, uh... Can
I call my family?

169
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,683
They should probably hear
what you have to say, too.

170
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,349
I'd rather just talk to...

171
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,653
Of course you can.

172
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,449
I'll elevate it with a
6-inch Ambler tissue hook.

173
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,023
You separate the underlying
tissue with iris forceps.

174
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,864
I got it. Tenotomy scissors.

175
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,361
Think we're ahead of schedule.

176
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,770
Might get her home in
time to do her homework.

177
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,865
Back to the bosom
of her loving family.

178
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,048
We'd remove as much
of the cancer as possible

179
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,517
by removing the head of the
pancreas and other attached organs,

180
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,020
but then we'd have to
reconstruct the anatomy.

181
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,182
The easiest way is to
bring up a loop of jejunum...

182
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,257
Shaun...

183
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,750
Sorry.

184
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,295
The jejunum is part
of the small intestine

185
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,889
between the duodenum and ileum.

186
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,960
It's a complicated,
very dangerous surgery,

187
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,436
and even if it's successful,

188
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,440
post-operative complications
are frequent and serious,

189
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,936
and recovery can
be very painful.

190
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,105
But if it works, he's
better? He'll be healthy?

191
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,241
He would still need chemotherapy,
and a lifetime of monitoring,

192
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,084
but hopefully a long lifetime.

193
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,786
Let's do it, Dad.
What do you say?

194
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,487
What should I do?

195
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,634
It's your decision.

196
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,935
All we can do is present
you with the facts.

197
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:26,940
Yeah. Here are the facts.
Dad, the surgery may kill you.

198
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,779
Not doing the
surgery will kill you.

199
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,420
- Can you give us a few minutes?
- Of course.

200
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,371
It was very nice of Dr. Andrews
to give you an office,

201
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,203
even though you're
on medical leave.

202
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,674
Yeah, he is a prince.

203
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,211
- Who's your surgeon going to be?
- I haven't...

204
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,644
I haven't decided yet.

205
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:07,117
You should definitely go
with Dr. Joshua Atkinson

206
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,452
at Stanford Medical Center.
His mortality index is 0.3.

207
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,616
It's too low.

208
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,657
Not enough of his
patients are dying?

209
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,128
No, Shaun.
Sometimes patients die,

210
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,674
doesn't matter how
good the doctor is.

211
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,566
But when your mortality
rate is as low as Atkinson's,

212
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,637
it means you're
turning away patients.

213
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,783
You turn away patients, it
means you lack confidence.

214
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,569
You lack confidence, I don't
want you inside my head.

215
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,873
And I'd like to be able to
dress myself when I'm all done.

216
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,509
Shaun, what are you doing here?

217
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,748
You showed up at
work early this morning.

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,512
Go home. Get some rest.

219
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,023
I won't rest if I go home.

220
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,096
The surgery went great.

221
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,268
Once everything's healed,

222
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,842
I think you'll be very
happy with the results.

223
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,502
What time is it?

224
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,170
Not quite 5:45.

225
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,686
We just need you to pee, and...

226
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,014
- I need to go home.
- And you will, very soon.

227
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,114
- It hurts.
- I told you it would.

228
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,022
We did a lot of cutting and
scraping. You had a lot of scar tissue.

229
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,222
- It hurts a lot.
- We'll give you some Tylenol,

230
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,287
and you can tell your
mother you're cramping.

231
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,093
Ow!

232
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,795
Hang ketamine, 130
micrograms per kilogram per hour.

233
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,941
Why does it hurt this much?

234
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,304
I don't know.

235
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,573
But you're not going home.

236
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,607
No!

237
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,588
She's heavily sedated.
What did we do to her?

238
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,282
What if this is good news?

239
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,731
I know you haven't been
a doctor all that long,

240
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,557
but pain is rarely a
sign of good news.

241
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,932
It is if you're talking about a part
of the body you thought was dead.

242
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,225
What if this means there are
still viable nerve endings in there?

243
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,747
What if this means we can
actually reconstruct her clitoris

244
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,433
and that it's capable
of sensation?

245
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,770
Maybe. All we know for sure is she's
not gonna be home anywhere near 6:00,

246
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,472
which means we're about to
have a missing child on our hands.

247
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,412
We have to bring
Andrews up to speed.

248
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,823
I did a bad job of telling
you that you're dying.

249
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,933
Is there a good way?

250
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,875
I can't figure out when
I'm supposed to lie,

251
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,037
when I'm supposed
to tell part of the truth.

252
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,345
And it doesn't really matter

253
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,782
because I can't figure
out how to do it anyway.

254
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,684
You did fine with me.

255
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,223
You never need to lie.

256
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,858
Lies don't protect
you from the truth.

257
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,523
I don't like your haircut.

258
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,392
Okay.

259
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:17,066
Maybe sometimes, when
the truth can't help someone,

260
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,042
we should definitely just lie.

261
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,887
Do you think praying will
help you reach a decision?

262
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,159
I've already reached a decision.

263
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,388
I'm praying to help me find
comfort with that decision.

264
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,234
My family wants surgery.

265
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,402
And what do you want?

266
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,372
I want what my family wants.

267
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,106
- I love them.
- But they love you, too, right?

268
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,679
Don't they want what you want?

269
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,289
Long ago, I made a decision.

270
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,049
To be there for them,

271
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,391
no matter what.

272
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,799
And if the last choice I make
in my life is consistent with that,

273
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,142
I'm comfortable with that.

274
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,793
I'm surprised by you.

275
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,887
I arguably made
errors in judgment,

276
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,433
but it was all in an
effort to help a patient.

277
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,100
Yes, that would make
sense if you thought

278
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,899
you'd never have
another patient ever again.

279
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,139
And if there wasn't currently
an opening for chief of surgery.

280
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,566
I didn't know that
was on the table.

281
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,111
See, that's the difference
between you and Melendez.

282
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,805
I have no doubt that as
soon as I got this promotion,

283
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,612
Melendez had done the
math and reacted accordingly.

284
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,446
But I suspect that even
if you had done the math,

285
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,781
it wouldn't have changed
how you handled this patient.

286
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,616
I don't view that as a weakness.

287
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,756
I'll handle the
administrative fallout.

288
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,968
You notify the
parents immediately.

289
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,632
I can't.

290
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,684
We don't know the girl's real name,
and we have to keep her sedated,

291
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,785
so there's no way to track...

292
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,778
She's a teenager.
She's got a phone.

293
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,836
Next time it rings, answer it.

294
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,320
- Feel the mesenteric artery pulsing?
- Yes.

295
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,449
You shouldn't. You're
too close to the vein.

296
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,823
Great. Dr. Browne, pass
a Penrose drain through.

297
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,154
Bovie.

298
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,860
Suction.

299
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,537
Got it all.

300
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,344
I see leaking pancreatic fluid.

301
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,149
That'll eat holes in
everything it touches.

302
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,656
- Our duct tie didn't hold.
- Suction. Needle driver.

303
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:24,595
Excellent. You have approved a
scrub nurse, and a circulating nurse,

304
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,325
and seven other personnel.

305
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,096
Everyone and everything is
covered except for an actual surgeon.

306
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,170
Yeah, I think we
may have to postpone.

307
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,248
Have you notified your tumor
to stop growing in the interim?

308
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,434
I think any possible
damage from the delay

309
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,534
may be more than offset by
having somebody competent

310
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,580
- digging around in my brain.
- "Competent."

311
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,913
- What's wrong with Sanders?
- 6% mortality rate.

312
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,861
- Taylor?
- I don't like the way he's planning

313
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,751
on dealing with a carotid tear.

314
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,898
- That's nowhere near your tumor.
- It's the principle.

315
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,220
- Unger?
- He doesn't like me.

316
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,418
- No one likes you.
- No. You don't like me.

317
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,858
He doesn't like me. That's two.

318
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,361
Just pick a name.
I don't care who.

319
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,297
I don't care if they're a
doctor. Just pick a name

320
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,543
because in 48 hours, you're
either getting your surgery,

321
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,559
or you're getting
a new oncologist.

322
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,735
She's in pain?

323
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,752
That's why she's asleep right
now, because of what you did to her?

324
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,488
What I did to her,

325
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,619
I believe, revealed
that what you did to her

326
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,292
didn't do as much damage
as we initially feared.

327
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,426
- We wanna do a second surgery...
- How can you stop her pain?

328
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,562
It's called "clitoral
reconstruction."

329
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,766
The nerves of her clitoris are
exposed. We can sheath them...

330
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,561
Our daughter wants this?

331
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,640
Asha wants to be like other
girls. She wants to be able to fully...

332
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,909
Mara told you that?

333
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,088
That's our daughter's
name, not Asha.

334
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,487
You don't know her at all.

335
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,421
We need to do this
surgery to relieve her pain.

336
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,794
No. There must be another way.

337
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,959
We want a second
opinion, not at this hospital.

338
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,369
How soon can our
daughter be moved?

339
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,937
Excuse me. Dr. Lim?

340
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,371
I'm Ellen Vahtra, from
Child Protective Services.

341
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,105
Until I complete my review,

342
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,168
I'm afraid you're not going to be
moving your daughter anywhere.

343
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,950
How did it go? Is Dad okay?

344
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,521
There were complications,
but we found solutions.

345
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,999
It went very
well. We got it all.

346
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,028
Oh, my God!

347
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,738
There's still...

348
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:54,071
I don't think I did that
well. They're too happy.

349
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,412
Post-surgical complications are
still a major concern that they should...

350
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,644
Let them enjoy the good news.

351
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,313
Is deceiving someone in a
way that makes them happy

352
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:05,358
better than deceiving someone
in a way that makes them sad?

353
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,588
Shaun, I think there's
someone here to see you.

354
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,397
Hey. I had some time,

355
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,024
so I thought you might wanna
have some lunch with me.

356
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,436
I do not have time.

357
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,113
What's wrong? What did she do?

358
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,257
Shaun. Shaun.

359
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,221
You don't want to talk to
Lea. I don't understand.

360
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,029
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

361
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,369
You're not being
fair to her, or yourself.

362
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,773
- She's always been nice to you...
- No, she hasn't.

363
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,140
She's your friend.
Whatever's happened,

364
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,291
you have to talk to her about it.
Be honest about what you're feeling.

365
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,715
I can't be.

366
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:05,817
Of course you can.

367
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,080
I don't know!

368
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,154
I don't know how I feel.

369
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,726
I can't be honest if I
don't know how I feel.

370
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,904
Our 16-year-old daughter
is lying in a hospital bed,

371
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,943
unconscious, to protect
her from overwhelming pain

372
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,777
because of what this place
did to her without our permission,

373
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,938
and you are investigating us?

374
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,485
Your daughter is suffering
because you butchered her

375
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,665
when she was two years old.

376
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,154
Dr. Lim, please refrain from
unsubstantiated allegations.

377
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,775
Either they're the butchers, or
they're protecting the butchers.

378
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,352
If you didn't do
it, tell us who did.

379
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,429
It was an aunt and a
grandmother from Kenya.

380
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,601
They were watching Mara
while we were on vacation.

381
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,935
Well, you must
have been horrified.

382
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,840
Did you take her to a doctor?

383
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,501
That girl's sex organs were
covered with scar tissue.

384
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,309
She had no medical attention
to treat any of her wounds.

385
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,818
She was fine. She
was happy, laughing.

386
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,714
It's not that big a deal.

387
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,388
I was cut.

388
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,958
My mother was cut.
Her mother was cut.

389
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,990
It is a rite of passage, connecting
our women to their ancestors.

390
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,112
She will not find a husband
in our culture if she is not...

391
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,365
So, she'll find someone else.

392
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,667
It's not that big a deal.

393
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,452
These parents forfeited
the right to make any calls

394
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,001
about their daughter
a long time ago.

395
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,240
Our daughter is
an honor student,

396
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,340
taking three AP
classes in her junior year.

397
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,484
Went on a mission to
Haiti to build a school.

398
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,382
We have raised her well.

399
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,152
She's a good person.

400
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,985
We're proud of her.

401
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,654
I'm sure she is a good person,

402
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,831
but you're not gonna convince
me that what happened to Mara

403
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,893
when she was two years old is
anything short of an abomination.

404
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,263
But that's not the issue today.

405
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,733
The issue is how do we
best help this girl now.

406
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,041
The clitoral reconstruction
should protect the exposed nerve...

407
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,114
"Should"?

408
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:20,118
That is the surgery that, in my
medical opinion, is called for.

409
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,619
But it's not the only option?

410
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,424
We could ablate
the peripheral nerves,

411
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,618
and remove the
remaining clitoral tissue.

412
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,596
And is that surgery
safer or more dangerous?

413
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,892
It's simpler, but that's
not the only factor here.

414
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,934
It's the only factor to us.

415
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,030
We want to know
that our daughter

416
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,436
won't spend the
rest of her life in pain.

417
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,774
Please. For a moment,

418
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,903
can we think about something
other than Mara's pain?

419
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,441
Can we think about her pleasure?

420
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,717
We have a chance
to give her a healthy,

421
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,482
meaningful sex life.

422
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,488
That is what she
came here looking for.

423
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,753
Wake her up.

424
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,827
She's in pain, and she's
already told me what she wanted.

425
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,630
Yesterday, she was
requesting cosmetic surgery.

426
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,102
Today, you're asking her to risk

427
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,265
a lifetime of pain for
a chance at pleasure.

428
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,972
From everything I've heard,

429
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,976
she's mature enough
to make the call herself,

430
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,104
even if it means suffering
for a few minutes to do so.

431
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:30,855
Dr. Unger has a mortality index
that is not too high and not too low.

432
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,424
It's not gonna be Unger.

433
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,086
You have not eliminated Dr. Ko.

434
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,423
Not yet.

435
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,760
I may have to go out of
state to find a neurosurgeon.

436
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,928
Plus, I may have to find
myself a new oncologist.

437
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,129
You've used Dr. Ko many times.

438
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,471
Did you think she
might kill your patients?

439
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,769
No.

440
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,708
Do you think you're
better than them?

441
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,335
Yes. A little.

442
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,506
That was a joke.

443
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,211
You don't want
to talk about this.

444
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,983
No, I don't want to
talk about this, Shaun.

445
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,118
That, in fact, is the
point of the alcohol.

446
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,455
Okay, I understand.

447
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,056
Good.

448
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,971
Why can't we talk about it?

449
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,205
Because it's upsetting.

450
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,006
Is that why you're stalling?
Because you're afraid of dying?

451
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,845
I'm not afraid of dying.

452
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,174
Really? Why not?

453
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,917
You should be.
Dying is terrible.

454
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,814
Yes, dying is terrible,
but there are worse things.

455
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,150
What's worse than dying?

456
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:47,556
Not dying.

457
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,769
That doesn't make sense.

458
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,270
Makes sense to me.

459
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,373
That doesn't make sense.

460
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,171
It's the middle ground, Shaun.

461
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,272
Brain surgeries have a tendency
to end in the middle ground.

462
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,112
Brain surgeries can be
considered a success,

463
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,280
even when the patient
ends up compromised.

464
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,520
He can't walk. He can't talk.
His hand can't stop shaking.

465
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,928
I've been terrible at a
lot of things in my life,

466
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,362
but I am damn smart,

467
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,403
and I am a damn good surgeon.

468
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,102
And if I can't be those things,
then I don't know who I'd be.

469
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,714
You'd be my friend.

470
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,961
Well, thank you, Shaun.

471
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,466
I have to go. My
patient just crashed.

472
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,943
It's not enough, is it?

473
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,322
No. I'm sorry. It isn't.

474
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,030
Mom? Dad?

475
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,003
We're here. We love you.

476
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,445
We just don't understand
why you'd turn your back...

477
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:46,007
Hello, Mara. I'm Ellen
Vahtra. I'm a social worker.

478
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,782
Your parents know what happened,
and Dr. Lim gave you a nerve block.

479
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,518
- It hurts. It still hurts.
- I understand that,

480
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,026
and we are going to try to get you
back to sleep as quickly as possible.

481
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,193
But something
happened during surgery,

482
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,062
and we need you to make a
decision about what is done next.

483
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,203
We believe that despite what
was done to you as a child,

484
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,798
the reason you're in so much
pain is because you still have

485
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,639
functioning nerves
in your clitoris.

486
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,975
Nerves that had been
covered with scar tissue.

487
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,074
I'd like to repair that. We can
make you physiologically complete.

488
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,084
But there's no
guarantee that will work.

489
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,647
I am confident.

490
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,215
There is a safer choice.

491
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,098
We could remove
your entire clitoris.

492
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,724
This is your choice.

493
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,169
You will be protected,
no matter what.

494
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,377
- Take it out.
- Mara, we could make you whole...

495
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,106
I made a mistake! Take it out.

496
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,937
She's on medication,
she's in pain...

497
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,073
Dr. Lim, please let
her go back to sleep.

498
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,209
And prepare to remove
the damaged tissue.

499
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,066
Hang fresh frozen plasma. It
looks like he's going into DIC.

500
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,364
Give me another hemostat.

501
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,873
BP's 71 over 53. We should
have warned the family.

502
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,684
Can't see anything in here. There's
too much blood. More suction.

503
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,370
I think you got
the hepatic artery.

504
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,687
A warning wouldn't
have made any difference.

505
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,204
Bleeding is not slowing down. We
need to ascend the aorta to the celiac.

506
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,727
- I need to see it to clamp it.
- They would have been prepared.

507
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,617
A-line systolic's 54.
He's bottoming out.

508
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,244
- No, they wouldn't.
- You two, shut up

509
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,257
and pack his abdomen with
laps while I sort through this mess.

510
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,789
I won't do it. Can we
appeal this? Do you know?

511
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,487
I've spoken with
our legal department.

512
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,474
Unless we can prove the
social worker was biased,

513
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,932
we're stuck with this ruling.

514
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,332
Well, then you're also
stuck with "I won't do it."

515
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,429
You're a good doctor.
This hospital will miss you.

516
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,434
You're gonna fire me because
I won't butcher a teenage girl?

517
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,273
Of course I am. This
hospital will face lawsuits,

518
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,506
suspensions, perhaps
criminal charges.

519
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,276
And this little girl will still
get the surgery you hate.

520
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,854
Could Dr. Lim at least
talk to Mara again?

521
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,954
You wanna wake
her up again in pain?

522
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,691
Every woman deserves the right to
make decisions about her sexuality

523
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,424
without her parents
hanging over her.

524
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:19,861
Okay.

525
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,324
When I was 15 years old, my
father caught me with a boy.

526
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,030
I mean, we weren't doing it,

527
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,570
but my top was off and,
well, it doesn't matter.

528
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:54,973
My father hit me.

529
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,903
I still have a small scar.

530
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,704
Our relationship was never the
same, but that's what growing up is.

531
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,913
Not everyone gets called a slut,

532
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,884
not everyone gets butchered,

533
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,147
but everyone becomes
a man or a woman

534
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,715
and stops being a child.

535
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,763
I wanna take a piece of
tissue from inside your cheek,

536
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,092
and I wanna graft
it to your clitoris.

537
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,671
We can make you feel love.

538
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,680
I can't turn my back on
my family, on my traditions.

539
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:46,246
Traditions connect
us to the past.

540
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,223
What about the future?

541
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,632
Please. No. I'm in pain.

542
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,619
Cross-clamping his aorta.

543
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,451
He's in ventricular
fibrillation.

544
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,756
Starting chest compressions.

545
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:28,927
- Okay.
- Everybody, clear.

546
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,150
Prep the cheek as well.

547
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,939
She's taking the graft?
The paperwork doesn't say...

548
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,261
She consented verbally.

549
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,994
I didn't wanna keep her awake
longer than absolutely necessary.

550
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,801
I wanted to help
her as much as you,

551
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,669
when she wanted help,
but if she doesn't want this...

552
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,641
She wants this.
Dr. Lim just told us.

553
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,106
Prep the cheek.

554
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,725
I'll tell the family.

555
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,328
No. Claire, you do it.

556
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,963
This isn't the
time for learning.

557
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,499
I'm sorry. Paul
died during surgery.

558
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,396
He had a gastroduodenal
artery rupture.

559
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,340
It is a common complication
of a Whipple surgery,

560
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:22,074
especially when someone's
cancer was as advanced as his was.

561
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:27,344
We did everything we
could, for as long as we could.

562
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,086
He didn't suffer.

563
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,056
You did this to him.

564
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,930
Dad didn't want this.

565
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,764
You saw that look on
his face. He was scared.

566
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,864
In my experience, it
does no good to dwell on...

567
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,738
Of course he was scared.
That doesn't mean...

568
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,386
He just wanted to live
his last few months...

569
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,108
Stop it. Nobody made
your father do anything.

570
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,739
He knew the risks.

571
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,998
It's your fault, too, Mom.

572
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,617
All of us.

573
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,259
He would do anything for us.

574
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,460
We killed our father.

575
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,966
It's not true.

576
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,071
Paul wanted this surgery.

577
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,984
He told me he
wanted this surgery.

578
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,544
Was that true?

579
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,716
Paul told me

580
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,160
when the truth can't help
someone, we should lie.

581
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,566
Mom?

582
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,847
How are you? Does anything hurt?

583
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,146
Not much. I'm better.

584
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,713
Looks like she's doing well.

585
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,215
Thank you, Doctor.

586
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,226
There should still be some
discomfort at the surgical site.

587
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,932
A nurse will bring you some...

588
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,734
Sorry. A nurse will
bring you some Tylenol,

589
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,109
which should really
be all you need.

590
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,672
Thank you.

591
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,015
You're gonna be great.

592
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,244
You're here?

593
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,810
Yes. I live here. You know that.

594
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,208
Well, I was starting to doubt
it the last couple of days.

595
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:50,221
You come home after I'm asleep.

596
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:53,486
You leave before I
can even get up. Wow.

597
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,427
Thank you.

598
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,835
Please take this.

599
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,237
No, this is yours, Shaun.

600
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,768
I gave it to you to
remember me by.

601
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,107
It hurt.

602
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:22,249
I didn't want to tell you the
truth because I didn't know it,

603
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,846
but I have to tell you the
truth because it will help.

604
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,824
Every night, I would come home,

605
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:38,292
and I would look
at that baseball,

606
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,304
and I would think of you.

607
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,932
The baseball was
here, but you weren't.

608
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:51,005
- That's sweet.
- No, it isn't!

609
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,778
It hurt. You hurt me.

610
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,320
Okay, Shaun, you know...

611
00:40:56,387 --> 00:41:00,518
You went away, and it
hurt, and it kept hurting,

612
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,991
and now you're back.

613
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:09,831
If you stay, you will go away
again, and it will hurt again.

614
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,364
So, I want you to
go back to Hershey.

615
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,539
I know you don't
mean that, and I know...

616
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,737
Please, go back to Hershey,

617
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,905
or anywhere other than here.

618
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,333
Feeling okay?

619
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,539
Yeah, sure. Super-duper.

620
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,542
I wanna thank
you for your trust.

621
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,717
I will do my best to deserve it.

622
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,450
Well, that's all I can ask.

623
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,787
You know the drill.

624
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:15,956
Ten,

625
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,225
nine,

626
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:21,864
eight,

627
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:23,874
seven...
