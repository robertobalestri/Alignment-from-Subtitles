1
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,002
I'm incising the uterine wall.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,874
You're doing great, really
great. It's gonna be okay.

3
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:14,941
You promise?

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,817
Baby's out.

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,751
Umbilical clip. Suction.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,813
Please, can I see my daughter?

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,056
Yes, of course.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,021
Sorry. We'll need to
get her into surgery.

9
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,066
We'll take good care of her.

10
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,841
Your new chief
is fashionably late.

11
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,616
Our chief.

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,350
Just because I endorsed
Dr. Han to the Board

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,980
doesn't mean I don't
have any concerns.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,650
Connections like Dr. Han's
come at a premium.

15
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,522
And he assures me,
will be well worth it

16
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,673
given our current predicament
with the Medical Board.

17
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,129
I'm not just worried
about the money.

18
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,190
When you pay that much,
they tend to think they're worth it.

19
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,437
Makes a person think
they don't have to show up

20
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,938
for their own welcome brunch.

21
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,241
Hi.

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,577
The baby's bowel protrusion seemed
less severe in the prenatal imaging.

23
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,016
And it'll have to wait until we're
done with her heart problem.

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,892
Now that I'm in here, her septum
looks more like Swiss cheese.

25
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,790
Page the on-call
neonatal cardiac surgeon.

26
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,529
<i>That won't be
necessary, I'll scrub in.</i>

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>And who are you?</i>

28
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,739
I'm Jackson Han, your
new chief of surgery.

29
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,657
Echo probe, please.

30
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,255
And let's turn that music on.

31
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,259
Advance the delivery sheath.

32
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,569
It's in the patient's
heart, Dr. Murphy.

33
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,634
I think the music
is a little distracting.

34
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,009
I feel the same way about
operating without music.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,342
Take a longer sheath and
Dr. Murphy will need some forceps.

36
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,690
Five-second rule?

37
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,091
It was a joke.

38
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,560
What about her bowels?

39
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,469
Why isn't Dr. Lim inserting it
into the abdomen right now?

40
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,167
There is not enough room...

41
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,110
There's not enough room without
increasing abdominal pressure,

42
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,376
which would critically
decrease blood flow to the bowel.

43
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,178
According to what
hemodynamic principle?

44
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,447
- Dr. Browne?
- Vascular impedance.

45
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,198
Blood flow is driven by the force
induced by the pressure gradient.

46
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,622
And how do you calculate it?

47
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,454
Uh... Um...

48
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,061
I'd have to look it up.

49
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,862
Eight times L-Nu,
divided by Pi-r-four.

50
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,493
Very good, Dr. Murphy.

51
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,704
That's also why this
occluder won't work.

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,331
It won't hold up against a huge
pressure gradient in her heart.

53
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,509
- Is there a fix?
- Long-term, I don't have one.

54
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,445
Right now, I need
umbilical tape and PE tubing.

55
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,288
You're making a
pulmonary artery band?

56
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,756
That should buy us some time

57
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,659
to come up with a plan
before we lose this baby.

58
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,069
You canceled my hernia repair?

59
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,043
With no advance
notice, sorry about that.

60
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,741
But so great to meet
you. Jackson Han.

61
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,578
- Neil Melendez.
- Oh, I know.

62
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,852
You did great work on that
piggyback heart transplant.

63
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,882
I need a consult on Minesh Goyal,
he's the founding CEO of a company...

64
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,552
- What's his diagnosis?
- He doesn't have one.

65
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,619
He's here for a full physical,
complete diagnostic workup.

66
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,927
I have a long-standing
executive wellness...

67
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,467
I'm a surgeon, not an internist.

68
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,766
I don't do preventative medicine.
No matter how rich the patient is.

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,631
You know what's great
about rich patients?

70
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,502
They allow us to
treat poor patients.

71
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,242
Also, I promised Minesh the very
best. So, really, who else am I gonna get?

72
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,158
BP is 110 over 70.

73
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,784
Jackson...

74
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,056
Dr. Han says great
things about you.

75
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,165
That's very kind.

76
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,332
Normal EKG, optimal BMI,
heart and lungs sound good.

77
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,948
Any reason you're worried
enough about your health

78
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,941
to endure an
entire day of tests?

79
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,670
I'm not worried.

80
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,007
Knowledge is power.

81
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,382
Whenever I enter a new market,

82
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,008
I learn everything I can
about the landscape,

83
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,054
consumer needs, target
market, competitors.

84
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,113
Are you aware your
body isn't a business?

85
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,289
I know I sound
like a rich lunatic

86
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,591
with fantasies about controlling
every aspect of my life.

87
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,189
And I guess I kind of am.

88
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,996
My dad was in good shape, too.

89
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,372
Until he dropped
dead on his daily jog.

90
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,652
Hi.

91
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:17,275
Hi. Hi, I'm Larry Childs.

92
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:21,440
I'd shake your hand, but you
know, no functioning immune system.

93
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,847
- Aaron. Hi.
- Good to meet you.

94
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,408
What flavor cancer do you have?

95
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,678
- What flavor?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,755
Glioma.

97
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,483
Shut the front
door. Brain or spine?

98
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,791
- Brain.
- Dude, we're tumor twins.

99
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,956
What...

100
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,000
What do they have you on?

101
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,399
Ooh. "Vincristine."
I hear that's intense.

102
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,631
My doc thought it
would wipe me out.

103
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,764
You doing okay or
longing for death?

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,102
I am hanging in
there. Thank you.

105
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,704
I'm on my third round
of Temozolomide.

106
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,688
I've seen you in
here a few times.

107
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,891
I've seen you in here a few times.
You kinda keep to yourself, huh?

108
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,292
Yeah.

109
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,334
Well, I'm happy to
introduce you around.

110
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,512
- It's a really friendly group.
- I'm okay, thank you.

111
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,027
You have a support
group you go to?

112
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,239
I do not.

113
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,473
Everyone needs a
cancer community.

114
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,138
And try to hold still.

115
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,779
Thank you.

116
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,910
For bringing us in.

117
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,748
This is the new chief's
patient, it's a great opportunity.

118
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,118
Or it's a bunch
of pointless tests.

119
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,952
For which I thank you.

120
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,053
Tell us about Dr. Han.

121
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:18,064
He's direct, charming,
very sure of himself.

122
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,131
Big ego.

123
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,973
There's nothing wrong with
an ego if you can back it up.

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,442
Dr. Han's arterial switch technique
is performed all over the world.

125
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,939
The tests aren't all pointless.

126
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,572
Way to stand firm, Park.

127
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,276
No, look at the
monitor. He has a tumor.

128
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,136
Percy's stable?

129
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,674
We're naming her Persephone.

130
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,013
Yes, I put in a central
line for nutrition.

131
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,484
Percy is stable right now.

132
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,044
We're looking for
solutions to her problems.

133
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,086
Wait? Why does...

134
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,489
Why does she have
all these birth defects?

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,994
Diane.

136
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,530
We spoke to her obstetrician.

137
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,259
She said these defects can
happen for no reason, right?

138
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,461
That's true.

139
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,937
Over 50% have no known cause.

140
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:38,769
I was taking Paroxetine
for clinical depression...

141
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,576
And you went off the meds as soon
as you found out you were pregnant.

142
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,310
She was five, six weeks at most.

143
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,182
My OB told me studies show

144
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,653
antidepressants are safe
to take during pregnancy.

145
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,623
But is that true, or
is she protecting me?

146
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,857
There was a study that associated
Paroxetine with these kinds of defects.

147
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,298
It is a possibility.

148
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,077
You can't tell whether
it's cancerous or benign?

149
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,516
Not until we do the biopsy,
which I've scheduled for later.

150
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,315
We'll know what's
going on by the morning.

151
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,990
Good. That's good.

152
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,092
Maybe you'd like
to call someone?

153
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,426
A family member, a friend?

154
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,297
I'll worry when I
know it's cancer.

155
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,775
We could use a transcatheter
route and patch each hole individually.

156
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,378
Her heart's the size of a walnut,
it's too small to maneuver inside.

157
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,582
A single large patch to close the
holes would withstand the pressure.

158
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,784
Yes.

159
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,253
It would also block
electrical conduction

160
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,161
causing deadly arrhythmias.

161
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,731
Dr. Murphy...

162
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,030
Did you tell the mom that she
caused her baby's birth defect?

163
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:15,200
No. I said that her
antidepressants could have.

164
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,608
Why did you tell her that?

165
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,973
It's the truth.

166
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,142
And is that relevant to her
current medical situation?

167
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,317
No.

168
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,255
And how do you think that
answer would make her feel?

169
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,053
What did you think would happen?

170
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,154
The mother is devastated.

171
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,063
The father is furious.
I would be, too.

172
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,896
Shaun is a resident.

173
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,629
Residents make mistakes.

174
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,296
Managing these parents'
emotional concerns

175
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,637
is as much a part of this job
as operating on their daughter.

176
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,103
Social cues are hard for Shaun,
but we've been working with him.

177
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,147
You should be focused
on your own shortcomings,

178
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,547
like retaining the formula
for vascular impedance.

179
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,817
Dr. Han...

180
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,354
We could patch each
individual hole in the heart

181
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,290
if we cut open the ventricle.

182
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,987
Don't change the
subject, Dr. Murphy.

183
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,828
I didn't, Dr. Han, we were
talking about the baby.

184
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,898
Really?

185
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,579
You don't see a difference in
the nature of your discussion

186
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,367
before I arrived and after?

187
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,732
We were talking about the baby.

188
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,177
They tried the approach you
suggested at LA Children's.

189
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,743
The baby died a week later.

190
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,415
The suture line didn't hold,
and the cardiac wall ruptured.

191
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,481
Keep looking.

192
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,996
Dr. Murphy, do not talk
with those parents again.

193
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,257
I'll walk with you.

194
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,869
<i>You're pretty tough
on my residents.</i>

195
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,566
Rebuking them in public, pimping
them with questions during surgery.

196
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,545
Shame-based
learning isn't my style.

197
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,444
I'll bear that in mind.

198
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,559
But this isn't about my
treatment of the residents.

199
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,211
You're concerned
about Dr. Murphy.

200
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,414
Well, a lot of doctors have less than
ideal bedside manner. He's young...

201
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,390
Would you ever have said something
like that to a patient as a resident?

202
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,755
As a med student?

203
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,721
And Murphy doesn't even
understand he did anything wrong.

204
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,321
Shaun has hardwired differences
in the way he perceives things.

205
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:23,234
Exactly. No matter how hard he works,
no matter how hard you try and help him,

206
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,863
his limitations are
not going to change.

207
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,272
He's going to continue to
inflict them on our patients.

208
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,641
All in the name of
diversity and inclusion.

209
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,912
Shaun deserves to be here.

210
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,385
Once you see what he's
capable of, you'll agree.

211
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,445
I look forward to
being proven wrong.

212
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,553
Stay seated for 20 minutes.

213
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,073
Don't want you
passing out in the lobby.

214
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,656
I know, I know, thank you.

215
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,733
This disease changed
my relationships,

216
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,971
changed my priorities,
changed who I am.

217
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,445
- Cancer is an identity.
- Cancer is a cellular mutation.

218
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,482
The people in this
room are my people.

219
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,583
What are you, 20 years
old? I'm triple your age.

220
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,962
I don't think
you're my "people."

221
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,956
Last time I hung out with my
law school friends, epic fail.

222
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,084
The fact that you use the phrase
"epic fail," kinda case in point.

223
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,237
They're all focused on what
firm they're gonna land at,

224
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,628
and I'm all about whether

225
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,724
Candice's leukemia is responding
to her new chemo regimen.

226
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,793
By the way, she has this peppermint
oil, it is great for headaches.

227
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,242
Ooh, I know that look.

228
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,611
Here, here.

229
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,577
Got you, brother,
whether you like it or not.

230
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,154
Show me where we are.

231
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,856
That angle runs pretty close
to the sacral nerve roots.

232
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,624
How we doing?

233
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,429
Tumor's abutting
the iliac artery.

234
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm trying not to disrupt the entire
blood supply to his lower body.

235
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,168
Uh, Dr. Han, I'm Morgan Reznick.

236
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,707
I really enjoyed your article

237
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,903
on myotomy for infantile
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

238
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,074
I appreciate the thorough
research behind your sucking up.

239
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,983
And you are?

240
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,986
- Alex Park.
- Park. You were a cop.

241
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,113
Medicine as a second
career, good stuff.

242
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,383
Tends to bring a
fresh perspective.

243
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,620
I hit an artery.
Take the needle.

244
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,062
Blood's pooling in the pelvis.

245
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,542
Should we open him up? DR. - No.

246
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,446
Prep the femoral artery,
get me an art cath-set.

247
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,079
- Pressure's dropping.
- Platinum coil.

248
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,972
Nice save.

249
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,277
Next time, don't hit the vessel.

250
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,775
There is no next time.
The biopsy's too dangerous.

251
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,195
It is likely that it's a
benign notochord cell tumor.

252
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,659
They look like chordomas,
but they're harmless

253
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,927
- and way more common.
- But you don't know.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,628
Since we can't
do the biopsy, no.

255
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,835
This is the problem
with broad testing.

256
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,872
Everyone has abnormalities,
most of them are nothing.

257
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,571
But when we do find them,

258
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,340
we have to make
some tough choices.

259
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,577
So, what exactly
is my tough choice?

260
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,181
We could remove the tumor.

261
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,722
This is a very risky surgery.

262
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,781
There's a chance
of paralysis or worse,

263
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,520
you may not make
it off the table.

264
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,494
Or you do nothing.

265
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,995
We'd continue to monitor it.

266
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,726
Do imaging every few weeks,

267
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,529
but chordomas move very quickly.

268
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,729
By the time any change
showed up on imaging,

269
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,204
it's most likely metastasized
throughout your body.

270
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,674
So, it probably isn't cancer,

271
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,373
but if it is, and I wait...

272
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,439
- Then I'll die.
- That's true.

273
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,314
And if I don't wait,

274
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,378
and I get the surgery, then
there's a good chance I'll die.

275
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,455
Yes.

276
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,189
I'm gonna need
to think this over.

277
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,974
This is the May <i>Annals
of Neonatal Surgery.</i>

278
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,508
I just finished March. I
need to read April now.

279
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,748
- I have April, Shaun.
- No.

280
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:41,157
No, you're supposed to be reading
<i>New Approaches in Neonatal Surgery,</i>

281
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,924
Claire has the <i>British
Journal of Neonatology...</i>

282
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,767
Shaun...

283
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:58,908
I think maybe you should be
quiet around Han for a little while.

284
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,614
But then how will I
answer his questions?

285
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,347
Direct questions,
absolutely answer.

286
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,118
Otherwise outside of the OR,
you should stay out of his way.

287
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,929
If someone had convinced
Shaun to do that with Dr. Melendez,

288
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,090
he would still be on suction.

289
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,397
<i>Code blue, NICU bed four.</i>

290
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,372
<i>Code blue, NICU bed four.</i>

291
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,407
Her O2 sats dropped, and
central venous pressure shot up.

292
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,948
Pulmonary artery band is
failing. Eight of dopamine.

293
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,039
Let's get a mask on her.

294
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,361
She won't last much longer,
we need other options.

295
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,751
I'll update the parents.

296
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,886
Let's get her on
full cardiac support.

297
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,835
What do you got? Anything?

298
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:06,476
This Cleveland group repaired a
bowel protrusion using enterolysis.

299
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,048
I could cut out this
excess inflammatory tissue

300
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,583
and segment of bowel atresia,

301
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,710
might make her intestines
small enough to fit.

302
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,117
Promising.

303
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,678
Given the size of her abdomen,
I need to remove a lot of bowel.

304
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,282
There's a good chance she
wouldn't be able to absorb food.

305
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,624
We'll have to find the right
balance, it's our only workable plan.

306
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,307
Best bet on the heart is
to cut through the ventricle,

307
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,492
like Murphy suggested.

308
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,996
You were concerned
about the suture line holding.

309
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,230
Well, I still am.

310
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,829
But hopefully horizontal
mattress sutures will work.

311
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,983
They should be able

312
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,551
to withstand the
tension at the suture line.

313
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,476
There's still a risk
of an aneurysm

314
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,479
forming in the
tissue underneath.

315
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:44,883
Dr. Lim...

316
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,984
I have an idea I'd like to share

317
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,649
even though Dr. Han
didn't ask me a question.

318
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,989
Yeah, go ahead, Shaun.

319
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,554
If we go in through the atrium,

320
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,691
we wouldn't have to
worry about the suture line.

321
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,530
It's the same
issue we discussed.

322
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,680
There's not enough room
inside the baby's heart

323
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,947
to stitch the
patches into place.

324
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,406
So, we don't need to, Dr. Han.

325
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,136
We can make a plug
small enough for her heart.

326
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,441
A PTFE disc with a
stem like a mushroom,

327
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,124
then we can insert the stem
through one of the holes until the disc

328
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,481
presses against the
wall covering all the holes.

329
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,845
Like a stopper in a bathtub?

330
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,350
Yes. The higher pressure
on the left side of her heart

331
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,916
would keep it in place.

332
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,723
We wouldn't even need to stitch.

333
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,524
Great idea.

334
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,843
We should take
this to the parents.

335
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,597
Great idea for the heart.

336
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,337
But we need to tell
them that our current plan

337
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,739
for the abdominal repair is
considerably more of a long shot.

338
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,141
And that fixing the heart,
takes an option off the table.

339
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,710
Withdrawing care.

340
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,157
You can't move that card.

341
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,485
- Excuse me?
- Who cheats at solitaire?

342
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,005
You're literally only
cheating yourself.

343
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,224
Again.

344
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,565
- Good morning, Larry.
- Is it a macho thing?

345
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,545
Like a real man should
be able to make it through

346
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,266
without leaning on a label
or the people who go with it?

347
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,009
Embracing cancer as an identity

348
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,409
is the last thing any one
of us should be doing.

349
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,539
It underscores everything
horrible right now.

350
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,284
We're in a daily
battle for our lives.

351
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,445
I see no value in
dwelling on that.

352
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,222
Candice is late.

353
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,152
Which means either her
niece forgot to pick her up...

354
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:38,997
Again.

355
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,366
Or she got some bad news.

356
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,730
Or she's already dead.

357
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,932
We are in a daily battle.

358
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,974
I'd rather have some company.

359
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,230
I spoke to my
mother and brother,

360
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,631
and they both think I
shouldn't do the surgery.

361
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,179
Apparently, they're more
scared of your surgical skills

362
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,535
than they are of this tumor.

363
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,435
And where do you stand?

364
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,773
- I need numbers.
- Please.

365
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:33,486
The stats on something like
this. There are a lot of variables...

366
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,078
But what are the odds I
make it through the surgery

367
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,817
without any complications?

368
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,657
It's a challenging procedure.

369
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,286
Zero complications, I'd say 80%.

370
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,131
But it is very unlikely
this tumor is malignant.

371
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,532
Give me a number.

372
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,471
About 5% chance it's a chordoma.

373
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,809
The numbers agree
with your family. So do I.

374
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,261
I've always been more
comfortable with action than inaction.

375
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,765
I want you to do the surgery.

376
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,399
Certainty comes at a price.

377
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,346
She'll be able to get off
the life support machines?

378
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,820
If everything goes well, yes,
she'll have a strong heart.

379
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,151
How soon can you do it?

380
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:49,726
You should know we feel less
confident about our plan for her bowel.

381
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,962
The chance of
failure is quite high.

382
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,292
How high?

383
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,566
I put it at 90% that
the repair won't work.

384
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,435
Which would lead to
irreversible malnutrition.

385
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,908
Your daughter would slowly
starve to death over months.

386
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,210
Right now, her body is working
very hard just to stay alive.

387
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,585
If we were to turn
off the machines...

388
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,045
Turn off the machines?

389
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,386
She would pass
quickly and peacefully.

390
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,757
If the heart surgery is a
success, that won't be an option.

391
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,728
Why not try to fix the
bowel first to see if it works?

392
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,102
We won't know if the bowel
is viable until after the heart is.

393
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,107
We have to do the surgery.

394
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,151
But if this doesn't work,
she could starve to death.

395
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,514
- It's worth the risk...
- It's not our risk, it's hers.

396
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,018
So instead you're ready
to give up on our daughter?

397
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,051
I mean, it's like we're
right back at the ultrasound.

398
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,749
We decided together to
continue this pregnancy.

399
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,817
So, this is as much
my fault as it is yours.

400
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,692
My fault? Because
of the medication?

401
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,696
I cannot turn off that machine.

402
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,738
Your guilt is stopping you from
admitting what we need to do.

403
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,865
My guilt has nothing
to do with this.

404
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,269
I am fighting for my daughter.

405
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,343
So am I.

406
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,809
Since the parents can't agree,
the decision about the baby's care

407
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,183
will be made by a judge who
will rely on our recommendation.

408
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,821
So, we make the choice,
but the parents live with it?

409
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,859
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

410
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,692
For parents to have to decide
between letting their daughter die

411
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:38,169
or fighting for her life knowing
she may suffer horribly,

412
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,706
maybe it's better if
we carry that burden.

413
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,710
Dr. Lim, your decision would be?

414
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:49,973
Take her off life support.

415
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,027
The odds are stacked against
the bowel repair working.

416
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,146
Those numbers reflect the
general population of doctors.

417
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,019
I think Dr. Lim and I
are better than that.

418
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,090
We can beat the odds.

419
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:10,859
One of the things I'm not going to
miss about being chief of surgery

420
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,599
is being responsible
for choices like this.

421
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,541
Dr. Han, it's your
department, it's your call.

422
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,113
You've been here all night?

423
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,885
I've been working on a case with
the new chief of surgery, Dr. Han.

424
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,861
- How's that going?
- Not very well.

425
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,659
He plays music in
the operating room.

426
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,925
Oh, jeez, one of those.

427
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,560
And he says I need to focus
on our patients' emotional needs.

428
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,933
Well, that's a tough
assignment for you.

429
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,072
Hmm.

430
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:56,407
You ever wish you had, you know,

431
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,747
friends, co-workers
on the spectrum?

432
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,348
Not usually,

433
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,980
but maybe Dr. Han
wouldn't notice me as much

434
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,423
if I weren't the only
doctor with ASD.

435
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,362
There's this kid
in chemo, just...

436
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,991
Obsessed with having
cancer. It's all he talks about,

437
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,263
he wants to be friends
with everybody in the ward.

438
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,032
That's very smart of him.

439
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,199
Spiegel et al showed an
increase in overall survival

440
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,573
and quality of life measures
in breast cancer patients

441
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,442
who formed social bonds
with others battling the disease.

442
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,606
What should I do about Dr. Han?

443
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,611
I don't know. Um...
Just do your work...

444
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,823
Be a good surgeon,
be an excellent surgeon.

445
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,952
Over time, he'll forget
about the autism.

446
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,256
Why would that happen?

447
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,389
He'll see that you have the
skill, you have dedication.

448
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:50,334
I have autism, it's
part of who I am.

449
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,748
The judge?

450
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,012
Accepted our recommendation
and ruled in favor of surgery.

451
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,385
Thank you, Doctor.

452
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,684
Okay, Percy.

453
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,391
Momma loves you.

454
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,502
I love you, Percy.

455
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,668
Should we remove more bowel?

456
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,017
That would take us to the ilium.

457
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,010
She won't gain
enough weight to thrive.

458
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,911
Her abdominal muscles are tight
from developing around an empty cavity.

459
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,516
They're cinched around
her tummy like a corset.

460
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,781
What if we unbuttoned it?

461
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,052
Released the muscle and increased
the abdominal circumference.

462
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,764
- Those muscles are part of her...
- Not if we separate the layers.

463
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,122
Create a plane between
the skin and the muscle.

464
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,430
You good if Murphy
and I start on the heart?

465
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,241
Dr. Browne, you're
with me on the abdomen.

466
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,466
Clearing the field.

467
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,508
Han is on the call
schedule next weekend.

468
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,720
Maybe Carmen will switch
with me, so I can cover with him?

469
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,908
Or maybe you
shouldn't try so hard.

470
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,073
Retractor.

471
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,311
Some of us don't have
a cool former career,

472
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,910
or an easy-going,
mellow demeanor.

473
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,683
People are never gonna crowd my
corner because I'm just so likeable.

474
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,349
Or you could try
being nice to them.

475
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,224
- This is easier.
- There it is.

476
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,087
Does it look like cancer?

477
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,257
It's not labeled.

478
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,613
We're all gonna have to wait
for the pathologist's report.

479
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,732
Probe.

480
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,774
The artery's in the way.

481
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,245
We can't get at the tumor
without him bleeding out.

482
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,496
We're gonna have to
take it from the back.

483
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,012
- But the S1 nerve root...
- Is something he can live without.

484
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,289
Dissecting scissors.

485
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:31,688
Pledget anchor.

486
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,643
The plug is in position. You
ready to test the bowel repair?

487
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,050
Let's take her off
cardiac support.

488
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:56,213
Dr. Murphy, it was your
idea, you do the honors.

489
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,034
Abdominal pressure is normal.

490
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,504
Intestines are perfusing.

491
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,009
Pulmonary pressure's spiking.

492
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,220
Prostacyclin and nitric oxide,

493
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,321
we need to get her
lung pressure down.

494
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,813
Oxygen sats are dropping.

495
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,149
No response to
pulmonary vasodilators.

496
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,549
The heart's too strong,
it's overpowering her lungs.

497
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,712
She needs to go back
on cardiac support.

498
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,260
Persephone won't
starve to death,

499
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,829
but she will drown
in her own fluids.

500
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,012
- I'll talk to the parents.
- May I come?

501
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,291
Now that Persephone's
heart is pumping at full power,

502
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,892
her lungs are overwhelmed.

503
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,971
The humane thing to do is to
turn off the machines and let her go.

504
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,638
No, I can't...

505
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,111
I can't give up on her.

506
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:36,119
Because you've fought for her
every minute since she was born?

507
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,482
Before that, when you were taking
your medication for the depression,

508
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,254
you were fighting to keep going,

509
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,958
so you could bring
her into the world.

510
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,205
Then letting go of Percy
is not giving up on her.

511
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,848
It's listening to what
her body is telling us.

512
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,422
She's hit her limit.

513
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,510
Okay.

514
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,013
I want Persephone to look as
good as possible for the parents.

515
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,981
Let's turn off cardiac support.

516
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,155
Ventilator.

517
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,393
Let's take a minute.

518
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,135
Check valve.

519
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,350
Every time the heart contracted,

520
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,513
blood went into the opposite side of
the heart and raised lung pressure.

521
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,181
The hole reduced the pressure

522
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,350
when it got too high,
because it allowed backflow.

523
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,759
But our repair of the defect
blocked this backwards flow.

524
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,429
What if we made it so
she still had a heart defect,

525
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,194
but only when she needed it?

526
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,566
And it'd be like an unlatched
door in the wall of the heart.

527
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,738
When the pressure gets
too high on the right side,

528
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,332
the door swings open, releasing
the pressure on the lungs.

529
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,968
The rest of the
time, it stays shut.

530
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,414
It should reduce lung pressure
by a third, is that enough?

531
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,246
Depends on how high her
pulmonary vascular resistance is.

532
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,450
PVR is pulmonary artery
pressure, minus wedge pressure,

533
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,489
divided by cardiac
output, times 80.

534
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,326
The last time I saw my doctor,
he told me I had six months to live.

535
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,235
He also told me I should
marry an accountant

536
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,569
and move to North Dakota.

537
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,768
You don't say.

538
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,321
I asked if it would help
with my cancer, and he said,

539
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,611
"Nope, it would just make the
six months seem much longer."

540
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,511
What's the difference between
a neo-Nazi and cancer?

541
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,023
Cancer doesn't discriminate.

542
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,792
I knew a guy once,

543
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,899
his Zodiac sign was Cancer,
it was really ironic how he died.

544
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,797
- Uh... How's that?
- He was eaten by a giant crab.

545
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,240
Aaron, glioma.

546
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,145
Candice, leukemia.

547
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,943
Gin Rummy or Blackjack? How
fast do you wanna take my money?

548
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,352
- Blackjack.
- Cut 'em.

549
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,527
Did you get it all?

550
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,672
Yes, totally clear margins.

551
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,109
But the only way to achieve that

552
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,578
involved removing the nerve
that controls your left foot.

553
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,541
Rehab and an advanced
orthotic may help,

554
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,213
but you will walk with a limp.

555
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,052
Final pathology will let
us know if it was worth it.

556
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,461
I'll let you know
when it comes in.

557
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,896
It doesn't matter anymore.

558
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,433
It's not like you can
put the tumor back in.

559
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,057
Is she okay?

560
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:16,094
She still has a surgery or
two in her future, but, yes.

561
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,763
She's gonna be great.

562
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:23,997
Can I hold her?

563
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,306
I think that would be
very nice, for both of you.

564
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,254
Hi, angel.

565
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,387
My baby.

566
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,193
Come, hold her.

567
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,305
You were fighting for her, too.

568
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,172
She's beautiful.

569
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,557
Nice work.

570
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,488
Thank you.

571
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,930
She's beautiful.

572
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,993
Listen to her.

573
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:41,971
Thank you.

574
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,183
Minesh's biopsy results?

575
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,171
You don't wanna know if we
wasted our time almost killing him?

576
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,831
Can't put the tumor back.

577
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,752
Hello, Dr. Han. You
take the bus, too?

578
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,117
No, Shaun, I just
wanted to talk to you.

579
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:36,598
You really do have
remarkable diagnostic skills.

580
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,731
I have to admit, you're
an asset to this hospital.

581
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,135
Yes, I am.

582
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,778
I spoke to the residency
director of pathology.

583
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,746
And we both agree
you'll be a great fit there.

584
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,287
I'm a surgical resident.

585
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,883
Well, as a pathology resident

586
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:04,953
you'll touch cases and lives across
all of the medical departments.

587
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,232
It's an opportunity
for you to help patients

588
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,700
without having to
deal with patients.

589
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:16,065
Given your difficulties with
communication and social cues,

590
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,109
I think it will be
a much better fit.

591
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,010
No, thank you.

592
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:27,583
I have been working very
hard at my communication skills.

593
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,251
Hard work isn't enough.

594
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,917
You have to do the job.

595
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:39,653
I am a surgical resident.

596
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,799
You were.

597
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,995
And you're gonna do
great work in pathology.

598
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:58,947
<i>Oh, and when the storms
come Flooding through the hall</i>

599
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:05,423
<i>Rising to the landing
Tearing pictures from the walls</i>

600
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:11,987
<i>The currents pull us underneath
That bright tide ripped us out</i>

601
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:18,628
<i>Into a tangled coral reef
Where we will never drown</i>

602
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:24,574
<i>Now that we're at the end</i>
