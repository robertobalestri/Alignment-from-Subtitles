1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,602
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,770
<i>Dr. Murphy,</i>

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,865
you shouldn't be in contact
with patients, or their families.

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,941
Do you understand?

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,535
- Don't be stupid.
- What? There's no cameras in here.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,277
Dr. Lim. Dr. Melendez.

7
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,755
I do not want to
be a pathologist.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:27,522
Dr. Han, you need to make
me a surgical resident again.

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,170
Hey, what are you
doing up so early?

10
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,838
I'm not up early. I
never went to bed.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,606
Oh, my God, didn't
you get my text?

12
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,478
I told you I was spending
the night with Jake.

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,046
I don't want to
be a pathologist.

14
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,487
Oh.

15
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,115
It's that still.

16
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:04,360
Shaun, no one's life goes
exactly like they dreamed as a kid.

17
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,403
You're still a doctor,
still saving lives,

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,702
just in a lab instead
of an operating room.

19
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,845
Where are you going?

20
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,216
I'm going to walk to work.

21
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,982
The hospital is four miles away.

22
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:32,652
Studies have shown that
walking boosts creative inspiration.

23
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:33,785
Shaun, I just think...

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,228
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

25
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,631
Neither does Dr. Han.

26
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,503
I need to change his mind.

27
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,943
I don't know how.

28
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,550
- Mmm. We're gonna be late.
- So stop.

29
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,058
And don't be smiling at me
when you see me in the hall.

30
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,369
I smile at everyone.
I'm a friendly guy.

31
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,737
You'd be a horrible
poker player.

32
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,112
- What are you doing?
- Murphy's on the corner. Move it.

33
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,254
- That's not where his bus drops off.
- Do you think he saw us?

34
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,452
He's not looking over here.

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,526
Well, that doesn't
mean anything with him.

36
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,924
We gotta get out of
here before the light turns.

37
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,432
Let's go. Move it.

38
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,511
Through the generous support
of Saint Bonaventure Foundation,

39
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,986
we've been able to transport
Kenny and his mother

40
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,614
from their home in Mississippi.

41
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,254
And we'll be covering the cost
of surgery and post-op recovery.

42
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,757
And all I have to do
is buy one CD a month

43
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,958
for the next 100 years.

44
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,830
No repayment necessary.

45
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,674
We appreciate you allowing
us to share your case

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,209
as an educational
opportunity for our staff.

47
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:32,241
Well, you know what they
say. Those who can't, teach.

48
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,313
And as you can see, I
can't do much of anything.

49
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,845
Actually, y'all haven't
really seen anything yet.

50
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,155
How about we get
this party started?

51
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,886
The neurofibroma
started as a small bump

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,258
near the base of the spine.

53
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,369
In less than six months,

54
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,369
it encircled his abdomen
and grew to over 100 pounds.

55
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,571
The blood supply becoming
so intertwined with the patient's,

56
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,940
it was deemed inoperable.

57
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,790
But we've been able to come
up with an innovative surgical plan

58
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,248
that will allow us to slowly

59
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,911
peel the tumor off the
front and back of his torso

60
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,281
in one piece and give
Kenny his life back.

61
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,292
We didn't expect to see you.

62
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,635
This is just about logistics,
witness lists, scheduling.

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,539
The hospital's attorney could've
handled this on his own, Dr. Han.

64
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,241
I understand but I
wanted to be here.

65
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,108
Three reasons really.

66
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,091
If my doctors are gonna
be judged in this room,

67
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,574
I wanted to see the place, see
all of you, and see the mood.

68
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,583
Well, we try to
make it very casual.

69
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,088
Yeah, I know.

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,088
But have you ever been judged?

71
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,156
I have. It's scary.

72
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,729
Someone has gone to
the trouble of checking out

73
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,699
every aspect of your actions,
every decision you've made.

74
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,629
You don't know what they
know, what they're gonna ask,

75
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,165
what could be
misunderstood, misinterpreted.

76
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,307
Also, and this is
kind of embarrassing,

77
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,939
but our lawyer,
probably not the best.

78
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,710
I decided to save a few dollars on him,
so I could hire a private investigator,

79
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,543
check all of you out.

80
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,381
We're not the
ones on trial here.

81
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,053
You see?

82
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,357
You say you make it casual
and then you call it a trial.

83
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,475
Now, I'm sure she
won't find anything.

84
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,493
I mean, nothing
too crazy, right?

85
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,892
Maybe just something...
embarrassing.

86
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,168
Maybe a lapse of
judgment here or there.

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,134
I mean, like I was saying,

88
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,610
you parse every choice
anyone has made,

89
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,847
gonna be a few things they'd
rather not revisit. Am I right?

90
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,777
And the third reason?

91
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,319
Well, I thought maybe you'd
want to work out a compromise.

92
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,597
The surgery went well.

93
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,804
We were able to fully evacuate
the subdural hematoma

94
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,342
without any complications.

95
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,371
It's a good thing you didn't
hesitate to bring her in.

96
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,442
One advantage of being
an insecure, first-time mom

97
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,816
who panics every time
her child has a slight fever.

98
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,413
Did I just hear you admit
that you're insecure?

99
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,529
The girl who double-majored
in physics and chemistry

100
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,669
because the dean told her
they were the two toughest?

101
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,559
Mom guilt ruins
us all. You'll see.

102
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,528
Whenever you decide to give
up the motorcycle and settle down.

103
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,622
No way.

104
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,859
My kid's going to kindergarten
on the back of a Ducati.

105
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,448
I'm sorry. I need to go
check on another patient.

106
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,912
How long will she
need to stay here?

107
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,995
I'm still not sure what
caused the bleeding.

108
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,711
I didn't see any signs of an
aneurysm or AVM, so that's good.

109
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,773
I'll have a better idea

110
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,216
when I get the post-op test
results back from Pathology.

111
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,012
Thank you.

112
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,758
<i>This is why I love pathology.</i>

113
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,897
We don't just fix stuff. We figure
out how it got broken and why.

114
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,526
Good morning.

115
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,763
Just checking to make sure you got
my clot specimen and blood draws.

116
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,862
Just logged them in.

117
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,933
Great. And if there's any way
to expedite, I'd appreciate it.

118
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,104
The mom is a friend of
mine and stressed to the max.

119
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,772
- Pretty sure the bleed was caused...
- Stop.

120
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,978
Sorry. I meant, please, stop.

121
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,379
I'd rather not know what you
think. It causes confirmation bias.

122
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,549
Copy that.

123
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:47,092
Hey, um, did I see you on
Hanover Street this morning?

124
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,964
I don't know.

125
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,466
Were you on Hanover
Street this morning?

126
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:59,773
Yes. I walked to work.

127
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,609
Did you see anything
interesting on the walk?

128
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,055
Hmm...

129
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,592
Shaun?

130
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,299
We can't both expedite your results
and reminisce about our morning walks.

131
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,559
Sorry. Carry on.

132
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,903
You're totally freaking
out, aren't you?

133
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,533
No. I am not freaking out.

134
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,990
All my patients freak out
waiting for their final test results.

135
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,411
For 48 hours you don't
know if you've won the lottery

136
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,781
or if you're gonna be
dead in a few months.

137
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,988
Hell, I freak out, too. It's
the only time I feel helpless.

138
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,469
The treatment's over. There's
nothing left to do but wait.

139
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,450
I'm a little stressed.
That speech, not helpful.

140
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,096
My advice? Embrace it.

141
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,397
You're experiencing emotions

142
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,765
only a few people on
Earth will ever understand,

143
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,497
the kind Hemingway wrote about.

144
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,372
- I'm more of a Faulkner guy.
- You would be.

145
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,838
- You don't like Faulkner?
- No, I don't like Faulkner.

146
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,569
- Nobody really likes Faulkner.
- I like Faulkner.

147
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,013
Right.

148
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,350
Anyway, if there's
anything you need from me,

149
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,489
even if it's just to talk,
you have my direct number.

150
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,888
Do not hesitate to use it.

151
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,391
I appreciate that.

152
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:31,232
And I would like to
show my gratitude.

153
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,017
I know I haven't been the
easiest patient to deal with.

154
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,202
That's not necessary.

155
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,404
I mean, if you want, you can
make a donation to cancer research.

156
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,712
I already donate. I wanted to
thank you. Not society at large.

157
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,720
How about... Have you ever
tried Macallan's Sherry Oak 25?

158
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,717
I don't drink. And I just
said it's not necessary.

159
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,053
How about a weekend at Ojai?

160
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,855
- I hear the spa is amazing.
- No means no.

161
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,863
I'm not trying to molest
you. I just want to thank you.

162
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,626
And you have. And
you are very welcome.

163
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,176
Why do you have to
control every little thing?

164
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,328
I have pepper spray in my
purse. Don't make me use it.

165
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,380
Carly, I am gonna need 60 units

166
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,281
of type-B positive-packed
red blood cells held for OR.

167
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,582
Sixty? You operating on
a hemophiliac elephant?

168
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,317
Our patient has a
200-pound neurofibroma.

169
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,585
Cool.

170
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,336
There's more blood in
the tumor than the patient,

171
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,727
so we're gonna have to follow
massive transfusion protocol.

172
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:31,997
You...

173
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,799
You might need antifibrinolytic
agents to control the bleeding.

174
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,571
That's a good idea. Thanks.

175
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,774
I could do some research
on cell salvage techniques.

176
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,810
- Cancer is a risk, but if we...
- I'm sorry, Shaun.

177
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,779
Melendez has put
together a pretty big team,

178
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,280
so we have everything we need.

179
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,292
I talked to Murphy.
He definitely saw us.

180
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,367
What'd he say?

181
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,146
It's not what he said,
it's how he acted.

182
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,401
He was clearly
uncomfortable talking to me.

183
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,834
He's uncomfortable
talking to everyone.

184
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,519
We need to get
out in front of this.

185
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,068
Tell Andrews before
someone else does.

186
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,477
No. We need to figure out
exactly what Murphy saw.

187
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:24,348
How? We can't just ask him
if he saw us making... bread.

188
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,285
We're not gonna get
anywhere with indirect questions.

189
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,616
I'll talk to him.

190
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,748
You think you can read
him better than I can?

191
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,883
No, but if at first
you don't succeed...

192
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,283
Let the man try?

193
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,721
Dr. Han wants to see you two.

194
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,564
- Both of us?
- Yep.

195
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,033
Yep.

196
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,012
Have a seat.

197
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,977
Actually, we've been
meaning to talk you.

198
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,044
The issue is...

199
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,090
Dr. Han met with
the medical board.

200
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,558
We're not going to be
suspended or reprimanded.

201
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,563
The hospital will pay
fines on your behalf

202
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,224
and you'll need to complete a
few continuing education classes.

203
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,062
But overall, not bad.

204
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,894
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

205
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,367
Does this mean I'm back
on the surgical team?

206
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,839
No, it does not.

207
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,703
You convinced the
board that he's competent.

208
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,242
You're welcome.

209
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,590
We got a big problem
with our tiny patient.

210
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,136
I did a repeat assessment
of the pre-op CTs

211
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,537
and found a trace
subarachnoid bleed.

212
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,106
But there was no
bruise on her scalp.

213
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,199
I know.

214
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,642
The only way she could get this
injury is if someone shook her,

215
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,611
and they would have
to shake her hard.

216
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,478
Someone abused her.

217
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,764
No. I've known Laura
since high school.

218
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,766
She's the most composed,
even-tempered person I've ever met.

219
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,734
And she's totally
devoted to that baby.

220
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,164
- What about the father?
- She conceived via a donor.

221
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:29,069
A nanny, a relative, a boyfriend
who's been helping out?

222
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,306
She waited so long for this,
wanted to do everything herself.

223
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,545
Then it has to be her.

224
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,455
We need to call Child
Protective Services.

225
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,453
No. Not yet.

226
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,822
I'm gonna do an MRI to rule out

227
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,949
benign enlargement
of the extra-axial space.

228
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,988
- Before we ruin her life.
- Good idea.

229
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,523
Except for the part
about you doing the test.

230
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:52,798
She's your friend.

231
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,444
You think I'd try to help
someone cover up child abuse?

232
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,545
I don't know you well enough

233
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,850
to know what you would or
wouldn't do to protect a friend.

234
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,905
I could do the MRI. I'm
not the mother's friend.

235
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,913
But you are a pathologist.
Giving MRIs is not your job.

236
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,714
Page Farmer. Have him do it.

237
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,984
On it.

238
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,258
Murphy, we need to talk.

239
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,503
I don't have a girlfriend.

240
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,209
Okay...

241
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,075
Is that consistent with

242
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,174
what you've deduced
and seen regarding my life?

243
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,185
Yes.

244
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,389
Good.

245
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,986
Enjoy your apple.

246
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,498
<i>It's not fair.</i>

247
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,149
Shaun is being
punished for mistakes

248
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,370
that Han thinks he
might make in the future.

249
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,211
He's not punishing him.
He just saved his ass.

250
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,716
Okay, Kenny.

251
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,318
<i>The MRA's gonna help us map
the blood supply to the tumor.</i>

252
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,787
<i>If you could just lie still.
No talking until we're done.</i>

253
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,213
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

254
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,190
We should take a stand.

255
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,554
Meaning what? Stage a walkout?

256
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,955
<i>How much does one of
these bad boys cost anyway?</i>

257
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,857
<i>About three million, but it's
worthless unless you stop talking.</i>

258
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,397
Sorry. My bad.

259
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,715
Us getting fired is not gonna
do anything to help Shaun.

260
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,901
And I'm not even sure
we should be helping him.

261
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,204
Did you ever stop to think that
maybe Han knows what he's doing?

262
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,843
Shaun has made mistakes but he
has three more years of residency.

263
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,640
That is plenty of
time to improve.

264
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,483
Yes, you can build a winning
team through supportive training,

265
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,622
but you can also do it
by recruiting the best

266
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,384
and pushing them, relentlessly.

267
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,285
No feelings, no
charity, no loyalty.

268
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,024
Those who thrive,

269
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,142
and get better than they ever
thought they could, you keep.

270
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,260
And those who don't, you cut.

271
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,335
That's not good.

272
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,663
It works for Jeff Bezos
and Bill Belichick.

273
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,149
I'm not talking about
your leadership lecture.

274
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,664
I'm talking about this.

275
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,978
We need to page Melendez.

276
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,445
What are you talking
about? You know me.

277
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,712
How could you possibly
believe I could hurt my baby?

278
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:26,785
I don't.

279
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,788
Which is why I ordered
the additional tests.

280
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,654
But did you never leave
her with anyone else?

281
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,427
Even for just a few minutes so
that you could take a nap or a bath?

282
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,766
Taking care of a
newborn, it's exhausting.

283
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,629
No, it isn't.

284
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,763
After waiting for so long,

285
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,931
every single moment,
no matter how hard...

286
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,168
It's not exhausting, it's joy.

287
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,448
Laura, I know you love her,

288
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,779
but you're still human.

289
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,148
You must get tired sometimes.

290
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,986
I don't, really.

291
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,795
You don't understand because...
Because you haven't experienced it.

292
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,528
But when you love
someone so much...

293
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:19,137
The tests, they
have to be wrong.

294
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,840
We expected the tumor to
grow since the last scans,

295
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,175
but not to this extent.

296
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,740
Blood vessels that I thought
we'd be able to quickly cauterize

297
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,016
are now thicker than my thumb.

298
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,685
It's impossible to remove the tumor
without causing you to bleed to death.

299
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,692
No.

300
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,487
I don't care how risky it is.

301
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,027
I'd rather die in surgery
than continue to live with this

302
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,230
huge damn tick
sucking the life out of me.

303
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,939
Kenny, as long as your
heart remains healthy,

304
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,639
you basically will be, too.

305
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,376
We can do a better
job treating the pain.

306
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,576
I don't want to be treated.

307
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,513
I want to be cured.

308
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,683
I want my life back.

309
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,226
I always thought all I had
to do was get enough money

310
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,252
or find the right doctors.

311
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,588
But if you're telling
me there's no hope...

312
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,647
I Appreciate
everything y'all done,

313
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,906
or at least tried to do.

314
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,388
The injuries from shaking a baby

315
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,726
are much different than
from blunt force trauma.

316
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,823
It's awful, but
also interesting.

317
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,164
It's like you're a detective
in a murder mystery.

318
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,128
Only thank God,
the baby's not dead.

319
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,302
That's exactly what Carly said.

320
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,802
She likes solving
medical mysteries.

321
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,038
She's very smart and aggressive.

322
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,775
Well, how does she
treat you? Is she nice?

323
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,649
Yes, she's very nice.

324
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,384
She wants me to
stay in her department.

325
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,280
She thinks we make a good team.

326
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,852
So, it sounds like you have
a case you're interested in

327
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,293
and a co-worker you
like who's nice to you.

328
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,932
Maybe pathology won't
be that bad after all.

329
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,162
I have work to do.

330
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,410
Since it seems we're gonna be
working together for a while longer,

331
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,218
maybe it is time we
came out of the closet.

332
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,854
Maybe? Are you
saying you want to?

333
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,383
Do you want to?

334
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,382
Maybe.

335
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,757
You're afraid it would
make things awkward?

336
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,057
People seeing us as a couple.

337
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,696
Yes, obviously.

338
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,429
But at the moment,
I'm more afraid that

339
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,020
we wouldn't be having
this conversation

340
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,799
if Murphy hadn't
almost busted us.

341
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,464
Which makes me think we're
not ready to have this conversation.

342
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,872
It's understandable
if we aren't.

343
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,510
We've both been in relationships
we thought were gonna last.

344
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,852
Understandable,

345
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,920
but why should we even
care what people at work think?

346
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,893
So, should we talk to Andrews?

347
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,735
Maybe. What do you think?

348
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,038
Maybe.

349
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,210
Uh, Sawchuck?
Sorry for the wait.

350
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,774
Excuse me. Duck curry and
rice? Forty minutes? Really?

351
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,343
Sorry. The kitchen
fell a bit behind.

352
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,198
- It shouldn't be much longer.
- You're not just behind.

353
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,885
People who've come in after
me, they've gotten their food.

354
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,826
Gone home, eaten, they're
in their PJs watching a movie.

355
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,829
I'm so sorry. I'll
check right now.

356
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,422
Duck curry.

357
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,930
Here you go, sir.
Duck curry, brown rice.

358
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:09,901
White rice.

359
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,533
Um. Excuse me. Duck
curry with brown rice?

360
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,868
- Yes.
- Connelly?

361
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,567
That's me. Thank you.

362
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,509
- What are you guys doing back there?
- I'm so sorry, sir.

363
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,308
You know what? I'm tired of
sorry. I just... I want my food!

364
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,058
You know, sir, it should
just be another minute.

365
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,948
I don't want to wait any longer!

366
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,618
I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

367
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,569
I didn't... I didn't mean
to yell. I'm so sorry.

368
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,028
Carry on. Carry
on. Enjoy your...

369
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,659
She's always
trying to one-up us.

370
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,727
Morgan.

371
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,916
She's not staying late because
she wants to do research.

372
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,375
She's staying late so that
Han can see she's staying late.

373
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,436
It's just who she is.
Don't take it personal.

374
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,638
Mmm.

375
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,708
My dad's a taekwondo grand
master, coached me growing up.

376
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,412
He always used to say,
"Only you can beat you."

377
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,397
Well, my mom's a lounge
singer and she used to say,

378
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,049
"Upstage me and
I'll beat your ass."

379
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,568
You'd think if you're selling boba
you'd have straws wide enough

380
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,170
to get the balls
through the damn thing.

381
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,337
I can't believe
you drink that stuff.

382
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,626
It's like putting
gummy bears in a drink.

383
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,868
You give up? Want
a soda instead?

384
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,669
I see you.

385
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,710
Which is, I assume,
your primary objective.

386
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,148
I didn't even know
you were still here.

387
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,562
I've been reading the latest
journal articles on neurofibromas...

388
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:34,679
Go home.

389
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,952
There's nothing you
can do for Kenny Grimm.

390
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,890
And you're gonna have
other patients tomorrow.

391
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,686
I got an idea.

392
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:49,333
If we embolize the larger blood
vessels to the tumor before surgery,

393
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,235
we can use your body's
clotting factor to help clog them.

394
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,798
This should reduce
hemorrhaging during surgery

395
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,400
and allow us to excise the
tumor without you bleeding out.

396
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,111
We'll steer a catheter
through an artery in your thigh...

397
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
Yes.

398
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,513
Kenny, maybe you
should let them finish.

399
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,631
No, I shouldn't.

400
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,814
And yes, you should. Yes. Yes.
Yes. As soon as possible. Yes.

401
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,426
Thank you.

402
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,965
The tests came back. They
confirm the previous results.

403
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,529
Well, they're wrong.
There must be some other...

404
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,802
There has to be
another test. Please.

405
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,475
Ma'am, you're gonna
need to come with us.

406
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,842
- You need help.
- From you?

407
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,006
You're my friend and
you called the police?

408
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,825
Well, someone hurt your
baby. If it wasn't you...

409
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,286
No one hurt my baby. You're
wrong! How can you not believe me?

410
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,786
Just need to get a few more
branches off the aorta and we're done.

411
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,532
Well done, Dr. Browne.

412
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,706
- What's fluid status?
- CVP is 14 and rising.

413
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,041
Get diuretics on deck.
Forty milligrams, IV Lasix.

414
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,657
Careful. If his
pressure goes too low,

415
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,979
his kidneys won't perfuse.

416
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,429
I need you to keep his
CVP between eight and 12.

417
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,486
He can't tolerate much more of
this. We need to get him to an OR.

418
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,816
Embolizing his vessels

419
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,415
caused third spacing of
fluids to the body and lungs.

420
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,853
We saved the operation,

421
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,646
but now we only have
half the time to do it.

422
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,801
Hey. Any word?

423
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:29,926
No, not yet.

424
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,302
Isn't there someone from
radiology who can expedite?

425
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,532
Someone who owes you a favor?

426
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,511
Even if there was, I
would not waste it on you,

427
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,279
because you do not need it.

428
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,746
You're one of the most
willful patients I've ever had

429
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,811
and the finish line is in sight.

430
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,253
All you need to do is
just run through the tape.

431
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,791
Look, if it helps,

432
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,057
as soon as I'm done with this
patient, we can talk some more.

433
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,099
I can write you a script for
something to help with the anxiety.

434
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,794
But I don't think you
need it. You got this.

435
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,473
- More suction.
- Me, too. More sponges.

436
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,150
Retract.

437
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,523
That's it. What's his
estimated blood loss?

438
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,491
About eight and a half liters.

439
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,419
The entire human body

440
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:32,556
typically only has five
and a half liters of blood.

441
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,033
Yeah, I know.

442
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,434
Let's get 30 more
units on deck of PRBC.

443
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,238
Add cryo, fresh frozen
plasma and platelets to that.

444
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:57,221
We should have checked
for blood breakdown products.

445
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,300
If you don't mind, I'm
trying to pay attention to this.

446
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,385
I wasn't talking to you,
or about this patient.

447
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:10,627
We need to re-examine the
subdural blood clot specimens.

448
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,534
If there's hemosiderin
deposition

449
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,800
and chronic membranes,
including fibrous wall,

450
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,705
it could prove it was not abuse.

451
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,511
What else could it be? The tests
proved non-accidental trauma.

452
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,838
Yes, the tests were right.

453
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,113
Resected portion is secure.

454
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,321
IVs and central line?

455
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,552
- Secure.
- Secure.

456
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,686
Okay, everybody, get in
position. Let's flip this pancake.

457
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:41,390
On three. One, two, three.

458
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,633
Wait. His heart rate's
spiked. Lay him back down.

459
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,140
Softly. Softly.

460
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,043
We okay?

461
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,773
Yeah, just a blip.

462
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:58,778
Once more with feeling.
Ready? One, two, three.

463
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,421
- How we doing?
- Good. He's stable.

464
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,357
All right, swab the
posterior incision site.

465
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,121
Okay. Scalpel and
sponge on a stick.

466
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,694
- He's crashing.
- He's ventilating fine.

467
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,576
We've got no immediate
blood loss or hemorrhaging.

468
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,000
It looks like
distributive shock.

469
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,162
I need stat labs and
initiate shock resuscitation.

470
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,786
He's got a high white
count and what looks to be

471
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,245
a systemic pro-inflammatory
cytokine release.

472
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,823
Cutting off the blood
supply to the tumor

473
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,325
is causing
post-embolization syndrome.

474
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,493
I need intra-arterial lidocaine,

475
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,544
130 milligrams of methylprednisolone
and start antibiotics.

476
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,030
Should we be trying to
reverse the embolization?

477
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,420
Restore blood flow to the tumor?

478
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,833
Well, then we'd risk him
bleeding out even faster.

479
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,916
We need to abort.

480
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,903
Cut off what we've already
excised and leave the rest.

481
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,727
- No. We can't give up.
- We're not giving up.

482
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,264
We're stopping a futile
procedure to save the patient.

483
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,935
We need to get Murphy in
here. It's a blood flow problem.

484
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,700
Murphy has a special talent
for visualizing complex anatomy.

485
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,316
We don't have time. We
need to stop the PES now.

486
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,935
- Page Dr. Murphy.
- No, do not page Dr. Murphy.

487
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,288
I get it. You like him. But we
don't have time for an audition.

488
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,407
I'm trying to save my patient's life.
My patient, which means it's my call.

489
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,417
I am also trying to
save your patient's life.

490
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,180
So I'm urging you
to stop wasting time.

491
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,664
Now we've cut away almost
half. That's all we can do right now.

492
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,712
So let's remove it

493
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,849
and give him a chance to
live and fight another day.

494
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,929
The breakdown products show
the injury that caused the hematoma

495
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,023
happened at least
seven weeks ago.

496
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,860
When was she born?

497
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,197
A little over seven weeks ago.

498
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,807
The vacuum delivery must
have caused a subdural bleed

499
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,173
which re-bled two days ago.

500
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,440
The baby wasn't abused.

501
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,051
Shaun, we need you in the OR.

502
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,735
Any thoughts, Dr. Murphy?

503
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:03,098
You don't have enough time.

504
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,011
You can't fully map
the circulatory system

505
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,047
and remove the tumor
without killing the patient.

506
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,308
It's too complex.

507
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,183
Well, at least he was
brief and to the point.

508
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,716
Now, can we do what I...

509
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,347
But you don't have
to do it quickly.

510
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,959
We slow down, he bleeds out.

511
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:25,088
If you clamp the aorta, it could
lower the blood flow to the tumor

512
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,166
enough to slow the
release of the cytokines.

513
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,733
Clamping the aorta will kill
the intestines, kidneys and legs.

514
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,768
Not if we release the
clamp every 10 minutes.

515
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,200
Give it just enough blood
to stop the cytokines,

516
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,937
but not so much that
he bleeds to death.

517
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:47,652
Let's do it.

518
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,920
Thank you for the
consult, Dr. Murphy.

519
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,891
Reposition him to lateral.
Secure IV and central line.

520
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,220
Secure.

521
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,167
Ten-blade. Starting
mid-line laparotomy.

522
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,802
DeBakey.

523
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,775
Opening up the lesser
sac. Vessel loops.

524
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,112
Get a Rumel ready.

525
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,847
I need umbilical tape.

526
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,423
MRI exams show chronic
changes of surgery and radiation

527
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,334
but no sign of residual
tumor detected.

528
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,068
No signs. None.

529
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,200
Zero. Zippo. Zilch.

530
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,874
Wow.

531
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,911
We'll do another MRI in
six months just to be sure,

532
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,649
but you are in the clear.

533
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,490
This is exactly
what we hoped for.

534
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,985
<i>Kinehora.</i>

535
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,422
Knock on wood.

536
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:20,978
Thank you.

537
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,981
You son of a bitch. I told you.

538
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,209
You told me no.

539
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,744
It's too heavy for diamonds.

540
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,184
- Is it a magic eight-ball?
- Will you just open it?

541
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,361
I don't like baseball.

542
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,601
I do.

543
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,372
So you got me
something you like?

544
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,074
I caught that foul ball
down the third baseline

545
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,872
on my 13th birthday.

546
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,080
My dad was amazed
that I snagged it.

547
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:02,152
After the game, we
went outside the stadium.

548
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,716
And I was a shy kid,
but my father pushed me

549
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,589
to ask my favorite players
to sign it, and they all did.

550
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:13,489
Bert Campaneris, Rollie Fingers,
Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter.

551
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,230
Yeah, if it happened
today, it'd all be on video.

552
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,504
But all I have to remember
that awesome day

553
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,565
is that ball.

554
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,993
I wanted you to have
something that mattered to me.

555
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,515
Aaron, I can't.

556
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,424
Oh, yes, you can.

557
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,634
Bye.

558
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,330
Cancer changes people.

559
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,936
I've had patients tell
me it was a blessing.

560
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,337
That their lives
were better after.

561
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,839
They're idiots.

562
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,115
Maybe.

563
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,624
Would you have thought of such
a wonderful gift 11 months ago?

564
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,112
Care to do the honors?

565
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,364
Let's take it up.

566
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:39,870
I'm so sorry.

567
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,376
I should have trusted you.

568
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,615
Please talk to me, Laura.

569
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,281
Yell at me if you
want. I deserve it.

570
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,627
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

571
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,323
I should have done
more research,

572
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,558
looked harder for an
alternative diagnosis.

573
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,133
I mean, it's not your fault
you are the way you are.

574
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,235
You don't understand
the love a mother feels.

575
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,837
I understand that a lot of
mothers abuse their children.

576
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,181
You don't understand love.

577
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,978
Because you've never allowed
yourself to be vulnerable.

578
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:28,321
Even when you were married to
Kashal, you never really committed.

579
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,654
You always expect
the worst in people

580
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,492
because that's all
you see in yourself.

581
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,906
Okay.

582
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,145
I've never been in so much pain,

583
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,750
but felt so good.

584
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,787
We'll up your pain meds.

585
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,755
You're still gonna need some
skin and soft tissue grafts,

586
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,350
but the hard part's done.

587
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,186
Your prognosis is excellent.

588
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,492
Thank y'all so much.

589
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,695
What am I taking this thing
home in, a glass bottle?

590
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,861
Y'all got something that big?

591
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,797
He's just being a smart-ass.

592
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,203
Are you sure you
want to do this?

593
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,647
Shut up.

594
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,730
I saved the patient.

595
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,404
I deserve to be a surgeon.

596
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,307
Dr. Murphy...

597
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:55,140
Dr. Han, I want my old job back.

598
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,151
You're making a mistake.

599
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,186
- Am I, Shaun?
- Yes.

600
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:05,919
Because it seems like you're
doing really well in pathology.

601
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,257
You made a great
save on an earlier case

602
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,860
and a great save today.

603
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,925
You keep doing
well and over time,

604
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,167
we can build to you
having more responsibility.

605
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,543
No.

606
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,543
I'm a surgeon.

607
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:42,656
I am not leaving your
office until you reinstate me.

608
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,228
What are you doing, Shaun?

609
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,437
Do you think ordering me to do
something will change my mind?

610
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,301
Do you really think it's a
good idea to try and bully me?

611
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:02,104
I am a surgeon.

612
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,846
I am a surgeon.

613
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,386
Do you realize that you
are proving my point?

614
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,916
That you're acting immature?

615
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,220
Showing that you don't
know how to communicate

616
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,089
and you can't control
your emotions?

617
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,592
I am a surgeon.

618
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,823
But you do have a
talent that I value.

619
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,399
So, I'm gonna give you one last
chance to maintain your dignity

620
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:29,005
and leave my office, now.

621
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,738
Because if I have
to call security,

622
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,611
you understand that I'm
also gonna have to fire you.

623
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,613
I am a surgeon!

624
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,253
I am a surgeon!

625
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,431
I am... I am a surgeon!

626
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,832
I am a surgeon, Dr. Han!

627
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,367
I am a surgeon.
