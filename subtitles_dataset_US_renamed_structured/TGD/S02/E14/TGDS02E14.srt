1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,711
Shaun, did you undress me?

2
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,581
Except your underpants.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,721
- How long have you been here?
- All night.

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,193
- You should be at work.
- I'm taking the day off.

5
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,956
No, you should be at work.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,261
You're sick all the
time, not just after hours.

7
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,926
Shaun, you shouldn't
give up your life.

8
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,868
You have my number,
you check in with me.

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,838
I have 15 paid vacation days
and 10 sick days per year.

10
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,536
But I can only take sick days
when I'm sick, not when you are,

11
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,134
so this is a vacation.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,243
The plan is to align your eyes

13
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,250
using what's called
distraction osteogenesis.

14
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,345
We cut the bone and implant posts
on either side of your eye orbits.

15
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,051
Then, we slowly
expand that distance,

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,094
allowing for new bone
to grow in the gaps.

17
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,527
Will it hurt?

18
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:07,932
Mmm... For mere mortals, it
would, but with your pain tolerance?

19
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,094
It'll tickle.

20
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,226
You up for this?

21
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,897
So, I'll have
perfectly aligned eyes,

22
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,875
but still look like a
wad of chewing gum.

23
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,911
Molly...

24
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:21,073
You lost an awful lot of bone
and soft tissue in the accident,

25
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,083
and in terms of
facial reconstruction,

26
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,311
we've actually come a long
way in the past two years.

27
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,379
And after 12 surgeries, you get
your own personalized coffee mug.

28
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,518
I forgot about that. Okay,
when can we get prepped?

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,819
Is now too soon?

30
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,726
Car accident. Karin Tindle, 14.
She was sleeping in the back.

31
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,498
Trucker in the
oncoming lane fell asleep.

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,814
She wasn't wearing a seat belt.

33
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,206
Head trauma, non-responsive,
GCS of five with decorticate posturing.

34
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,419
Sounds like a
bleed in the brain.

35
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,379
And she has a 25-point difference
in blood pressures between her arms.

36
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,677
- Possible aortic dissection.
- Head and heart.

37
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,478
Page Dr. Melendez, have
him meet us in the OR.

38
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,383
- Have you contacted Karin's father?
- He passed away three years ago.

39
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,082
Let's go.

40
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,090
Why isn't she waking up?

41
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,285
We're gonna take
good care of her.

42
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,306
- CT confirmed an aortic dissection.
- She needs a thoracotomy.

43
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,574
Aorta hasn't ruptured yet. And
she has a pseudoaneurysm.

44
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,326
We need to get after
her head trauma first.

45
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,010
I don't see any major brain bleeds,
and we can monitor pressures.

46
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,152
In this case, the
heart trumps the head.

47
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,522
Okay.

48
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,957
I have two major symptoms,
nausea and boredom.

49
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,760
I didn't know boredom was
a symptom of chemotherapy.

50
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,327
It's a symptom of
sitting on my ass all day.

51
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:55,866
I used to run a 700-bed
hospital, with a staff of thousands.

52
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,743
Now all I have to think about
is how I keep my food down

53
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,315
and how many bowel
movements I've had all week.

54
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,611
Four.

55
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,853
And I don't have
to think about that.

56
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,025
You know what I need? My meds.

57
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:18,898
Will you do me a favor,
and run and pick these up?

58
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,134
When I come back,
we can do Mad Libs.

59
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,706
Unclamp.

60
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,514
- Graft is holding.
- That's one fire out. Drill.

61
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,729
Pupils are blown.

62
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,917
ICPs are spiking way up,
brain perfusion CPP is down.

63
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,424
She needs a hemicraniectomy.
Let's sit her up.

64
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,291
- It's marijuana.
- Yes, it is.

65
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,526
- It's marijuana.
- Medicinal marijuana. Hold on.

66
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,236
One for the boredom.
One for the nausea.

67
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,309
Can I try one?

68
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,077
I met someone who said cannabidiol
improved his ASD symptoms.

69
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,781
A person? You met a person once?

70
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,254
Shaun, have you heard
of the scientific method?

71
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,727
I'd like to perform a practical,
albeit anecdotal, experiment.

72
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,558
Since you're on vacation.

73
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,360
And we can keep an
eye out on each other...

74
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,966
One. One... Whoa! One. Take one.

75
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,980
Cruciate wide
incision of the dura.

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,480
- Brain edema.
- She's bradycardic.

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,116
Push another 50 grams of
mannitol and ventilate down her CO2.

78
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,471
- No corneal reflex.
- No overbreathing vent.

79
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,726
No brain stem reflexes.

80
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,789
She's brain-dead.

81
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,518
Fore!

82
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,184
You broke my house.
You gotta club down.

83
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,694
It's just 12 yards,
just a little dog-leg.

84
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,062
Here, watch this.

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,463
- It's in the cup.
- Nice shot, Glassy.

86
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,995
You're gonna call me Glassy?
All right, I'm gonna call you Smurf.

87
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,534
Smurf. This is very interesting.

88
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:47,045
I find that very
funny, but it's not.

89
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,515
- It's not. Am I high?
- I think you're pretty high, yeah.

90
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,587
Am I acting more normal?

91
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,156
No, you're acting high.

92
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,022
- Smurf. Smurf. Why is Smurf funny?
- I don't know.

93
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,430
You take the first
letter of the first name

94
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,796
and you attach it to the first
syllable of your last name.

95
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,962
See? S-Murph. Smurf.

96
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,868
We did it all the
time in high school.

97
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,033
So, your name was A-Glass?

98
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,602
Yeah, no, it didn't work for me.

99
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,338
Okay, serious now.
Where's the next hole?

100
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,043
Right there. Careful of
the hazard right behind it.

101
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,352
- Okay, Sam Snead.
- Dr. Glassman.

102
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,186
Let's see what you got.

103
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,363
How's Lea?

104
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,601
Lee-Ya.

105
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,612
Lee-Ya. There should
be a Y in her name.

106
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,244
Lee-Ya. Is she still into Jack?

107
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,050
No.

108
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,353
She is into Jake.

109
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,758
Who the hell is Jake?

110
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:45,595
Jake is the guy Lea is into.

111
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,929
Are you okay with that?

112
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,338
I don't think you're
okay with that.

113
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,276
I think that's why you're here.

114
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,405
I'm here to help
you through chemo.

115
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,742
When a guy is stoned,

116
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,842
he can tell another guy
anything that's in his heart.

117
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,117
You know, all the messy,
scary, embarrassing stuff

118
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,025
that you would otherwise
never, ever, ever tell anyone.

119
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,991
So, what do you think?

120
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,702
A dog pooped on your lawn.

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Oh...

122
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,522
You were right to insist that we
deal with the aorta before the brain.

123
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,491
I appreciate you saying that.

124
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,794
Don't let guilt make you
second-guess yourself.

125
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,232
Why would I have guilt?

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,930
You shouldn't. That's my point.

127
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,806
Good.

128
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,044
- I'm hungry. Are you hungry?
- I think I am.

129
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,498
When a man's hungry, you
know what a man wants...

130
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,889
There's an open can of
chickpeas in the fridge.

131
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,758
- Mallomars.
- What are... What is the Mallomar?

132
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:28,062
Pure chocolate, fluffy marshmallows,
on a crispy bed of graham goodness.

133
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,932
Get us an Uber.

134
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,747
The next few days are going to be
filled with many difficult decisions.

135
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,115
Decisions no parent
should ever have to make.

136
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:54,524
We've kept your daughter
on life support because we...

137
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,153
You...

138
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,465
want to ask about
organ donation.

139
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,598
Yes.

140
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,201
And you want her,
what? Her heart?

141
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:14,773
Unfortunately, her heart
was injured by the trauma,

142
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,783
as were several other organs.

143
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,446
We have a 16-year-old girl

144
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:27,823
who had a tragic accident
a couple of years ago

145
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,257
that destroyed her face.

146
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,596
And we were hoping
that you might...

147
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:40,532
You want to take my daughter's
face and put it on someone else?

148
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,943
This young girl's life
has been devastated,

149
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,241
and you have a chance...

150
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,406
No.

151
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,376
I'm sorry, Dr. Andrews.

152
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,617
No.

153
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,299
Okay, how about this one?

154
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,566
The ugly can be
beautiful, the pretty, never.

155
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,302
- Seems a little judge-y.
- Yeah, well, it was Oscar Wilde.

156
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,205
Fair enough.

157
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,977
So, I'm guessing you didn't
see the Quakes last night.

158
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,019
The San Jose Earthquakes?
Your home team?

159
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,715
Yeah, I know who the
Quakes are. I recorded it.

160
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,154
No, you didn't.

161
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,958
Don't worry. I watch enough
soccer for the both of us.

162
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,562
They won three
to two, by the way.

163
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,998
Beautiful goal in extra time.

164
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,900
They didn't have any either.

165
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,904
Well, that's all the major
chains. We're oh for four.

166
00:11:55,014 --> 00:12:01,511
Our next place is on Thornwood Drive,
just west of Santa Teresa Boulevard.

167
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,217
- That's in Alamitos.
- Yes.

168
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,226
There are still 28 stores in
the greater San Jose area

169
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,317
that we can try,

170
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,838
and I've devised a
route starting in the south,

171
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,924
working counterclockwise
around the city to best avoid traffic.

172
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,530
We'll buy you a box, I promise.

173
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:22,235
Okay. Guys, I like a big fare
as much as the next driver,

174
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,777
but racking up hundreds of
dollars on a munchie quest

175
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,903
is starting to
feel exploitative.

176
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,879
What do you say I
order ahead for pizza,

177
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,668
and then we just pick
it up on the way home?

178
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,583
- I don't want pizza.
- I don't want pizza.

179
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,745
- What take-out food do you like?
- I like pancakes.

180
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,517
I don't want pancakes.
I don't want to go home.

181
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,463
We're paying you to drive us.

182
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,599
You want these cookies?

183
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,871
What is the real reason?

184
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,467
- You'll laugh.
- What's the funny reason?

185
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,077
I had a crush on a girl.

186
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,307
Robin Demayne.

187
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,816
Senior year in high school.

188
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,885
Her favorite snack.

189
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,132
- Okay.
- Are we going to get Mallomars?

190
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,224
Nope.

191
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,967
You have been harboring feelings
for this girl for over 40 years.

192
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,703
That is a worthy quest.
How do you spell Demayne?

193
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,437
D-E...

194
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,580
You're the same sex,
race, approximate age,

195
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,418
share compatible blood
types and antigens,

196
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,857
and a whole bunch of other things
that make you the perfect match.

197
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,289
And we just received
permission from her next of kin.

198
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,168
Yeah.

199
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,692
Our donor's on life support
but her heart is compromised,

200
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,229
so we are very
much on the clock.

201
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,357
Cancel all elective
surgeries, all personal plans

202
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,060
and all hopes of sleep.

203
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,836
This is your home
for the next two days.

204
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,739
Let's give Molly a new face.

205
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,883
There is another Robin
Demayne living in San Mateo.

206
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,427
That's less than half
an hour from here.

207
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,860
Ooh! I found one in
Los Gatos. Even closer.

208
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,330
You realize how
stupid this is, right?

209
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,398
This is a quest. A
quest is never stupid.

210
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,869
A quest is by definition
almost always stupid.

211
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,907
Why would I want to see Robin
Demayne after all these years?

212
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,942
To tell her you love her?

213
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,943
I just want a cookie.

214
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,641
I wasn't in love with her.

215
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,773
I was a teenager.

216
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,250
I was infatuated.

217
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,257
And whenever you thought
about her, it made you happy.

218
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,225
And you thought
about her all the time.

219
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,731
And every time you saw her,
you felt a rush, light-headed.

220
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,933
Is that how you
know you're in love?

221
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,900
That's how it starts.

222
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,402
And when you're
not with that person,

223
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,569
you miss them so much,
you're willing to drive to 32 stores

224
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:49,173
to find a sensory reminder that
might bring back those memories.

225
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,795
<i>I'm all right today</i>

226
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:14,067
<i>You gonna find a way to
cross and you gonna get there</i>

227
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:21,343
<i>I'm gonna leave it
all out there to dry</i>

228
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,483
<i>I'm gonna leave it all out there</i>

229
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:31,655
<i>I'm gonna leave it
all out there to dry up</i>

230
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,488
<i>I'm gonna leave it all out there</i>

231
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,989
<i>Ah, but you worry me</i>

232
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,465
<i>You worry me</i>

233
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,833
<i>You worry me</i>

234
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,962
<i>And you worry me</i>

235
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,473
<i>And you worry me</i>

236
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,477
<i>And you worry me</i>

237
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,179
Ride home's on me.

238
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,751
Flake. Flake's a guy
from my high school.

239
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,189
He knew everyone, he
kept track of everyone,

240
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,488
and I guarantee you,
he never left Livermore.

241
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:12,328
We need to go to Livermore
and ask Flake about Robin.

242
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,497
We're going to Livermore.

243
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,768
Every lab and imaging
test that comes back

244
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,209
just reinforces the fact that this
really is a one-in-a-million match.

245
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,375
Nice.

246
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,215
Yeah, it is.

247
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,419
It's also very scary.

248
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,587
And natural to be
having second thoughts.

249
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,319
I just...

250
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,587
I don't know how to
accept a gift like this.

251
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,660
Someone else's face,

252
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,030
someone else's identity.

253
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
But the face is just
a mask. It's what's...

254
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,105
Underneath that counts?

255
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,369
Really?

256
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,114
Those lame quotes we've been
mocking, you're gonna use them on me?

257
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,382
Yeah.

258
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:22,958
Molly, right now, your face
is the only thing anyone sees.

259
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,100
This operation will change that.

260
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,975
It will let the world
see, not your new face,

261
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,714
but what has always
been behind it.

262
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,959
Will it count towards
the coffee mug?

263
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,062
Flake lives at your
old high school?

264
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,228
He was the janitor back
then, he's the janitor now.

265
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:02,332
He'll probably be the janitor when
this planet crashes into the sun.

266
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,434
- Flake.
- Findlay Lake was his name.

267
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,816
- Hey, Flakey.
- Hey, yourself, Glaaron Assman.

268
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,821
Your name was Glaaron Assman!

269
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,418
His name was Glaaron Assman!

270
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,164
1973 State Championship.

271
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,528
He threw for 460 yards,

272
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,370
and if you squint hard enough,
you'll see who was named MVP.

273
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,620
You said you had
something to show us.

274
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,306
Oh... Yeah. Wait right here.

275
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,037
Shannon?

276
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,144
I keep thinking
she's just sleeping.

277
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,519
How can I say goodbye?

278
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,713
We call it the Walk of Honor.

279
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,412
To thank your daughter
for her sacrifice.

280
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,222
You remember a guy
named Bobby Juarez?

281
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,030
Tall kid but too
clumsy to play hoops?

282
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:54,499
He told me that Robin
married a dentist named Scaplin

283
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,939
and moved out of state.

284
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,976
You couldn't tell me
that when I called?

285
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,909
I wanted to see you.

286
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,610
I found her. Robin Scaplin
is in Portland, Oregon.

287
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:10,147
It's an 11-hour and
27-minute drive.

288
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,818
Fill up the tank, I guess.

289
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,358
We're going to Portland.

290
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,346
Ten blade.

291
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,090
Ten blade.

292
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,813
Proximal facial nerve
isolated and dissected.

293
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,884
Okay, let's start
the heavy lifting.

294
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:39,772
Clamping the left and right
common carotid arteries

295
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:44,340
and jugular veins. Cutting
the carotids and jugulars.

296
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,481
Let's do it.

297
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,025
It's a long way to go to
visit a married woman

298
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,593
you haven't seen since high
school, who may not even be home.

299
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,696
She's home. I
called at the last stop.

300
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,106
- What did she say?
- "Hello."

301
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:22,107
- What did you say?
- Nothing. He hung up.

302
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:26,584
When you sober up, you are gonna
want to turn around and go home.

303
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,348
Probably.

304
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,057
As rehearsed.

305
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,715
Veins, arteries, nerves, in that
order, from the chin up, yes?

306
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,127
Can I get the osteosynthetic
plates and screws, please?

307
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,102
Damn it. I tore part
of the donor's artery.

308
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,308
- I need more interrupted sutures.
- Let's keep our focus, people.

309
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,509
Dr. Browne, Molly's parents would
like to see you on your next break.

310
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:33,984
Take it now.

311
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,647
You too.

312
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,184
Dr. Park.

313
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,886
I had a huge crush
on Robin Demayne.

314
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:21,492
Thoroughly unrequited crush
that slowly turned into a grudge.

315
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,497
Last day of school, and kids were
passing around their yearbooks,

316
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:32,307
and I signed in hers something
that was born out of anger

317
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,744
and resentment and pettiness.

318
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,180
It was designed to be
somewhat humorous,

319
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,914
but it was really
just mostly hurtful.

320
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:45,889
Later that day, at
the award ceremony,

321
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:50,893
I was skimming through my
yearbook, and saw what she wrote me.

322
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:57,829
"I have only two regrets.
My haircut in junior year,

323
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,762
"and that you never
asked me out."

324
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:08,209
And just then, I looked out
in the crowd and saw her.

325
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,681
Her eyes were red, obviously
crying and obviously very hurt.

326
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,752
And at that exact moment,
I was awarded my trophy.

327
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:24,456
I looked for her after
but never saw her again.

328
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,463
Is that all the scary,
messy, embarrassing stuff

329
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,595
that guys never,
ever tell anyone?

330
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,573
Pretty much.

331
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,652
Dean and Lori, this is Shannon.

332
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,488
Thank you for meeting with us.

333
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,453
And for everything.

334
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,476
If you don't mind, we have
so many questions for you,

335
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,128
about your daughter.

336
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,170
We'd like to know

337
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,297
what she was like,
what she liked to do.

338
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,672
Molly wants to know too.

339
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,051
Her name was Karin.

340
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,451
And I killed her.

341
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,501
I'm supposed to tell
you to get back in.

342
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,732
- Don't let him get to you.
- It's not him, it's you.

343
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,564
Your advice that I shouldn't
be second-guessing myself

344
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,446
is making me think you must
be second-guessing yourself.

345
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,642
About what?

346
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,895
You're the one who insisted we
deal with the heart before the brain.

347
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,888
And you didn't
fight me. Why not?

348
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,013
- Because you were right.
- I was right.

349
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,001
But you have never thought
anyone other than yourself

350
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,859
was right in an OR since
you first stepped foot in one.

351
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,157
You backed off 'cause
we're sleeping together.

352
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,636
The car accident was my fault.

353
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,113
It was my idea
to leave so early.

354
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,611
It was my idea to let
her sleep in the back.

355
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,889
It was up to me to make sure
she was wearing her seat belt.

356
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,651
None of which would've mattered

357
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,321
if the truck driver
hadn't fallen asleep.

358
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,498
It's natural to feel guilt,
but you have to understand,

359
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,626
this wasn't your fault.

360
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,068
It doesn't work that
way, Dr. Browne.

361
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,770
It was my handgun
that hurt Molly.

362
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,872
And you can say that
it was a freak accident

363
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,041
or that Molly knew she
wasn't supposed to touch it,

364
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,349
or some other BS,
but it was my fault.

365
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:09,887
I had one job and that
was to protect my family.

366
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,559
I didn't do my job.

367
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,896
You can try to make sense
of it, try to find something,

368
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,462
some pleasure
somewhere, some meaning,

369
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,269
but there just isn't.

370
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,973
And then, your daughter

371
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,885
does this for us.

372
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,500
Hi, Robin.

373
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,637
Aaron?

374
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,826
He had a huge crush on you.

375
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,589
Yeah. Uh...

376
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,328
That's not why I'm here though.

377
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,538
I'm here to apologize,

378
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,367
for what I wrote
in your yearbook.

379
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,479
Yearbook?

380
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,039
Yeah. Uh...

381
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,547
I wrote something, um...

382
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:50,395
hurtful and untrue
and really stupid.

383
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,327
And then I read what
you wrote in mine.

384
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,534
What did I write?

385
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,402
She had a bad
haircut in junior year.

386
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,676
I certainly remember that.

387
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,943
Yeah, well, it was
a long time ago.

388
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:17,114
Anyway, I just... I
wanted to say I'm sorry.

389
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,518
Well, apology accepted.

390
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,519
Thank you.

391
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,267
Mallomars.

392
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,767
Robin's favorite snack.

393
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,780
Right side donor to recipient
vessels are anastomosed.

394
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,890
Ditto on the left.

395
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,224
Let's see how our plumbing
works. Unclamp them, please.

396
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,557
She's pinking up.

397
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,208
Moving on. Motor and
sensory neurorrhaphies.

398
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,487
How's our girl doing?

399
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,061
She's just waking up now.

400
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,968
Hi, Molly.

401
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,829
- How are you feeling?
- Terrible.

402
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,404
Then we're right on target.

403
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,307
You want to have a look?

404
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,942
No.

405
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,337
No rush.

406
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:31,321
It is going to look surreal.

407
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,881
Like you're looking
at a stranger.

408
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,722
But it won't always.

409
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,728
Because nobody laughs,
or holds their head,

410
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,964
or looks someone in the
eye exactly the way you do.

411
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,307
Okay.

412
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:50,334
I apologize for telling you
how to react to losing a patient.

413
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,735
Thank you.

414
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,608
When I accused you of
second-guessing yourself,

415
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,474
that's because I'm doing it too.

416
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,277
Our relationship has me
questioning everything I do,

417
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,112
and everything you do.

418
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,584
You're making this way more
complicated than it has to be...

419
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,246
It is complicated.

420
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,133
The fact that we're
seeing each other

421
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:15,218
changes the context
of all of our interactions.

422
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,728
I guess that's why
there are rules against it.

423
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,371
I think I can keep being
a jerk to you at work,

424
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,838
if that's what you want.

425
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,343
You think we should end it?

426
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,651
No.

427
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,356
See you tomorrow.

428
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,302
So, once you're feeling
a little less woozy,

429
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,707
we'll set you up with a
whole bunch of therapists.

430
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,837
Speech, occupational, physical.

431
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,441
Shannon.

432
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,281
Please come in.

433
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,316
I'm Karin's mom.

434
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,687
Hi.

435
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,329
I brought something for you.

436
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,633
She was beautiful.

437
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,645
Thank you.

438
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,842
And thank you for timing
that elevator ride so perfectly.

439
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,285
Can I ask you for a favor?

440
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,460
I'd like to say goodbye.

441
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,156
Yeah, we'll clean up tomorrow.

442
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,726
And buy a new vase.

443
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,460
Yeah, buying a new vase is easy.

444
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:14,503
Vacuuming up my
grandmother's ashes, not so easy.

445
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,376
Are you glad you apologized?

446
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,341
Yeah.

447
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,479
Do you still feel guilty?

448
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,118
Yeah.

449
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,880
Guilt must be a bad thing,

450
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,687
if it makes people feel badly
about something they can never fix.

451
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,795
Or maybe it's a deterrent, so
we do the right thing the next time.

452
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,899
You loved Robin but
could never be with her.

453
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,033
Do you wish you'd never met her?

454
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,612
Not for one second.

455
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:02,548
I'm not okay that
Lea is into Jake.

456
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,328
Good night, Smurf.

457
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,294
Night, Glassy.
