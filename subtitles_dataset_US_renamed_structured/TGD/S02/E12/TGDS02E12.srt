1
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,912
<i>You hit me once I hit you back</i>

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,349
<i>You gave a kick I gave a slap</i>

3
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,682
<i>You smashed a plate over my head</i>

4
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,919
<i>Then I set fire to our bed</i>

5
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,558
<i>Oh-oh-oh</i>

6
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,824
<i>My black eye casts no shadow</i>

7
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,923
<i>Your red eye sees nothing</i>

8
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,229
<i>Your slaps don't stick
Your kicks don't hit</i>

9
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,168
<i>So we remain the same</i>

10
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,364
<i>Love sticks, sweat drips</i>

11
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,439
<i>Break the lock if it don't fit</i>

12
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,737
<i>A kick in the teeth
is good for some</i>

13
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,006
<i>A kiss with a fist
is better than none</i>

14
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,477
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

15
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,814
<i>A kiss with a fist
is better than none</i>

16
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,081
<i>I broke your jaw once before</i>

17
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,159
<i>I spilled your
blood upon the floor</i>

18
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,625
<i>You broke my leg in retur...</i>

19
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,720
Holy crap! Shaun!

20
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:42,592
- You're a good dancer.
- No, I'm not, so don't be a lurker.

21
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,672
You've got to
give a girl warning

22
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,967
before she makes a
total fool out of herself.

23
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,566
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you even up?

24
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,102
You've just gone through hell.
You should be sleeping till noon,

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,084
then go out for a Bloody Mary brunch,
and a credit-crashing shopping spree.

26
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,778
Those are all unhealthy
ways to cope with stress.

27
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,255
Fine.

28
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,521
But whatever you choose to do
to decompress on your day off,

29
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,326
it can't start before 9:00.

30
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,297
And it absolutely cannot
involve you sitting around all day

31
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,595
reading medical journals.

32
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,594
You've got to get
out and do something.

33
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,570
I'm so sorry for pushing
you, but you know I am right.

34
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,107
Ugh...

35
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,503
<i>How can you investigate a
response that's not even over yet?</i>

36
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,168
We just began
the terminal clean.

37
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,713
The governor believes
an immediate DIS review

38
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,305
is essential to restore
public confidence.

39
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,546
The CDC confirmed the
virus originated in Malaysia,

40
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,712
and there was nothing
my staff could've done

41
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,154
to prevent the three
deaths or Dr. Lim's infection.

42
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,991
I'm going to need access
to every patient record

43
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,791
and all staff communication

44
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,457
from the moment the first
outbreak patient arrived.

45
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,194
Look at you,
already back at work.

46
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,565
It's either that or
watch the news.

47
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,665
I'd rather be back on
ECMO with a rusty cannula.

48
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,274
Anything you need?

49
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,606
- Thanks, but not necessary.
- You sure?

50
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,446
Magazines, a book,
maple bacon doughnut?

51
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,813
Neil, you don't have to
play "supportive friend"

52
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,408
just because we slept together.

53
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,445
I'm not playing, I'm being nice.

54
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,590
Which I've done for people I haven't
slept with many times in my life.

55
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:21,961
No doubt.

56
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,830
But until we did, you were
always more interested

57
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,763
in competing than supporting,

58
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,433
and that's how I prefer it.

59
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,138
Okay. I'm not sure
that's true, or fair.

60
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,908
I'm also exhausted,
unshowered and constipated,

61
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,278
so if you could shut the
door on your way out,

62
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,782
I'd really appreciate it.

63
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,879
Will do.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,030
<i>Wake up, Maggie</i>

65
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,831
<i>I think I got
something to say to you</i>

66
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:11,101
<i>It's late September and I
really should be back at school</i>

67
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,514
<i>I know I keep you amused...</i>

68
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,220
- Hello.
<i>- You up for mimosas?</i>

69
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,352
I was just about to
head out to Hollander's,

70
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,952
and thought you may wanna join.

71
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,296
You thought I might
wanna join you for mimosas?

72
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,767
Why not?

73
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,669
Because we don't
like each other?

74
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,831
We don't really know each other.

75
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,102
Hollander's has the absolute
best brunch in San Jose.

76
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,610
I'll drive, I'll buy.

77
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,477
Morgan, how about you just
cut to what it is you really want.

78
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,146
<i>What else are you gonna do?</i>

79
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,549
Sit around, play guitar
and sing into your phone?

80
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,214
- How did you know what I was doing?
<i>- I didn't.</i>

81
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,052
<i>But that's what your profile
on a certain dating app</i>

82
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,625
says you like to do on days off.

83
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,024
Are you stalking me?

84
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,822
<i>One mimosa and I'll tell you</i>

85
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,296
<i>the fake profile I use
for oppo research.</i>

86
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,856
The guy I use for
my pic is gorgeous.

87
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,559
You really wanna risk
swiping right on me?

88
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,998
- I'll drive myself.
<i>- It'll be fun. Meet you in an hour.</i>

89
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,908
Call me every night.

90
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,013
- I already said I would.
- Okay.

91
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,245
- Thanks for letting me stop by.
- No problem.

92
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,586
Okay.

93
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,257
Well... Bye.

94
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,558
Bye.

95
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,418
- Bye.
- Okay.

96
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,031
Bye.

97
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,036
Mia, wait.

98
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,200
Why don't you stay and fly
back with Kellan on Sunday?

99
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,301
I know it's crazy,

100
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,471
but it's been so long since
we've all been together.

101
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,843
Like old times.

102
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,147
I think that virus may
have affected your memory.

103
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,410
Come on, hang with us a bit.

104
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,889
Just take a break for a few
days. I'm sure you could use one.

105
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,426
It does sound nice, but I can't.

106
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,566
Okay.

107
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,465
Have a safe flight.

108
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,938
But I could take a
later flight out tonight.

109
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,114
Perfect.

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,319
- What are you doing?
- I am buttoning my shirt.

111
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:43,058
The procedure was a
success, the CSF leak was fixed.

112
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,792
What are you doing here? I
thought this was your day off.

113
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,198
Lea said I'm not allowed
to read medical journals,

114
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,261
and Dr. Blaize said you can't
be discharged for two days.

115
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,504
Ah, yes, And yet the US Constitution
says I can leave whenever I want.

116
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,601
I am sick and
tired of being sick.

117
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,647
I'm sick and tired of
being around sick people,

118
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:07,120
surgery, and radiation,
and blood draws, CTs, MRIs.

119
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,187
I've had it. I need a break.

120
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,851
If you delay the chemotherapy,
you will weaken its effectiveness...

121
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,519
- It'll be fine.
- You can't quit.

122
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,563
I'm not quitting, Shaun!

123
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,531
I'm just...

124
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,467
Oh, my God.

125
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,362
I appreciate your concern,
but you just have no idea.

126
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:30,209
It hasn't had time to heal.
If it leaks, it would be bad.

127
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,643
You could develop a
subdural hematoma...

128
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:37,343
And yet, if I stay one more minute
in this place, I will lose my mind.

129
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,169
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere I don't smell iodoform.

130
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,214
- I'm coming with you.
- You don't have to come with me.

131
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,729
I don't like that smell either.

132
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,842
But where are we going?

133
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,071
Are we friends?

134
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,570
- Yes.
- Why?

135
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,149
'Cause I helped you
through school, and get a job?

136
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,277
Or is it because neither one
of us have any other friends?

137
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,254
- You have lots of friends.
- Who?

138
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,088
And if I did, why did I have somebody
drive me around who I barely know,

139
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,162
and who I don't
really like very much?

140
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,859
And by the way, why doesn't she
have any other friends besides you?

141
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,063
She does. She goes out
with people all the time.

142
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,892
And yet she slept on
your floor for a month.

143
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,040
So, unless the people she
goes out with are homeless...

144
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,203
Hello, Lea.

145
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,213
<i>- You better not be studying.</i>
- I'm not.

146
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,778
<i>Good. You wanna come
have lunch with me?</i>

147
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,011
Lea wants us to
have lunch with her.

148
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,086
Wait, "us"?

149
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,827
- Who are you with?
<i>- Dr. Glassman.</i>

150
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,619
Fine. Glassy can come, too.

151
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,893
Glassy never said
he wanted to come.

152
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,222
<i>Tell him the food at
my office is amazing.</i>

153
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,563
Okay.

154
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,758
- She says that the food...
- I'm not hungry!

155
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,266
Go. You just go.

156
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,509
- I can't come.
<i>- Come on, Shaun, please.</i>

157
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,773
<i>I'm having a really crappy day
and you're, like, my only friend.</i>

158
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,343
You know what? I
changed my mind.

159
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,582
I would love to come and
have lunch with your friend Lea.

160
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,656
Yes!

161
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,589
Okay, I will text you
guys the address.

162
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,433
Diego Luis.

163
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,968
My pseudonym. I think
Latin names are sexy.

164
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,968
You might wanna pace yourself.
We don't even have the menu yet.

165
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,171
I'll be fine.

166
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,012
I'm really sorry about that EMT.

167
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,480
Tyler, right? I heard you
guys were kind of close.

168
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,618
Well, you heard wrong.
I barely even knew him.

169
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,691
Okay.

170
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,818
As long as I'm here,
if you wanna talk...

171
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:02,928
I don't.

172
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,158
I wanted a brunch
partner, not a shrink.

173
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,467
I'm not trying to be a shrink,

174
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,332
I'm trying to be a
decent human being.

175
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,706
Of course you are.
Saint Claire to the rescue.

176
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,139
What is your problem?

177
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,342
You literally blackmailed
me to be here,

178
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,451
and now you have the nerve

179
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,632
to act like I am the one...

180
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,313
I'm gonna take this outside.

181
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,016
If you wanna just get the
check, that's fine with me.

182
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,286
DR. Ho! MIA: Yeah!

183
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,841
Damn, I'm gonna have to wear
a helmet next time I pitch to you.

184
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,065
Yeah! DR. PARK: There you go!

185
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,832
You seeing anyone?

186
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,872
- Sorry, I don't mean to interrogate.
- It's all right.

187
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,048
And no, I'm not. What about you?

188
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,511
Yeah, but it's nothing serious.

189
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,412
- It's okay if it is.
- I'd tell you if it was.

190
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,388
You don't have to tell me
anything. It's none of my business.

191
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,256
Could you imagine us
ever getting back together?

192
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,591
Yeah, sure.

193
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,362
The same way I could imagine

194
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,697
what it's like to walk
across hot coals,

195
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,500
or to be waterboarded, or
attacked by a great white.

196
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,005
All right, I get it. Very funny.

197
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,712
Dr. Andrews, can I help you?

198
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,615
Just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

199
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,091
Yes, we do. Thank you.

200
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,623
Any update? Anything
I should know?

201
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,131
It's best if we wait until
the investigation is complete

202
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,757
before discussing any findings.

203
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,364
You already have findings?

204
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,595
- None that I am prepared to discuss.
- Okay.

205
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,803
Although I was a
bit surprised to learn

206
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,898
that you have a
part-time chief of surgery.

207
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,414
What are you saying? I
was here around the clock.

208
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,747
In your role as chief of surgery,
or as the hospital's president?

209
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,555
My dual role was a benefit.
It sped up decision-making,

210
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,785
and ensured that there
was no miscommunication

211
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,055
between administration
and the surgical staff.

212
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,292
Not to mention, this is
none of your business.

213
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,595
DPH has no oversight of
our management structure.

214
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,100
If it adversely
affects patient care.

215
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,298
Oh, it didn't.

216
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,471
And it never has.

217
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,445
You bureaucrats have no
idea how a hospital runs,

218
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,816
or what doctors and nurses
have to do on a daily basis

219
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,684
to provide optimum
care for patients.

220
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,787
And you can tell
that to the governor.

221
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,827
I have to go.

222
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:52,832
Mimosas, plural. That was the deal.
I've had one, you've had one quarter.

223
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,163
Well, my mom is getting evicted.

224
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,367
Fine. I'll come along.

225
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,103
I'm not lying. I have
to help her move.

226
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,869
- I could use the exercise.
- No.

227
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,536
- Two cars are better than one.
- Stop! What is going on?

228
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,176
You were right.

229
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,881
Tyler's death was upsetting.

230
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,325
I can carry a lot and
I'm great with moms.

231
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,865
Okay.

232
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,631
She doesn't think I can be both
president and chief of surgery.

233
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,705
Really?

234
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,501
You agree with her?

235
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,743
I never was a fan of your staying
on as chief after your promotion.

236
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,060
You really think anything
would've been different

237
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,884
if someone else was
chief during the outbreak?

238
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,014
You used to have more time
to manage scheduling issues.

239
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,718
And staffing shortage did
complicate our response.

240
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,353
Every hospital in this country
is facing a nursing shortage.

241
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,127
I'm not gonna reverse
my decision now.

242
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,825
I'd look like an
indecisive fool.

243
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,563
Or like someone who has
realized they've made a mistake,

244
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,071
and reconsidered.

245
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,603
Welcome.

246
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,105
Wow. How are you
not all 300 pounds?

247
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,208
We also have an amazing gym,
a basketball court and an ice rink.

248
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,346
- You have a very generous boss.
- And idiot investors.

249
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,051
The founder's from Minnesota.
He's obsessed with hockey,

250
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,958
so there's pickup at lunch
and a beer league after work.

251
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,620
- No flying glass elevators?
- Get anything you want.

252
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,191
There's also a pasta bar and
a deli, Spanish tapas next door,

253
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,033
and then we'll meet back
out in the atrium for our feast?

254
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,596
Any of your co-workers
gonna be joining us?

255
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,742
Why?

256
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,802
I don't know. I'm just
trying to be social.

257
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,474
You didn't wanna come,
then you did. What changed?

258
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,252
She always this suspicious?

259
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,583
Hmm.

260
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,188
I am in the mood
for Thai. Shaun?

261
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,919
- No, thank you.
- Sherlock?

262
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,791
- No.
- Okay, so I'll see you two in a few.

263
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,798
By the way, the lobster
rolls are amazing.

264
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,599
Thank you.

265
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:09,892
And, uh...

266
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,335
Since when do you eat bratwurst?

267
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,781
Oh, thought I'd
try something new.

268
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,577
- You a Bulls fan, Breeze?
- Bulls?

269
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,014
Oh, no. That's from when I
played South By Southwest

270
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,351
with Danny Attie's band.

271
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,189
That was Austin. The
Bulls are from Chicago.

272
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,368
Mom, who else is living here?

273
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,802
It's someone else's mug,
but he is not living here.

274
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,706
He just dropped you off after
a date and left his coffee mug

275
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,333
and bratwurst behind by mistake?

276
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,944
What do you guys care, okay?

277
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,242
I am not a child. It's
my damn apartment.

278
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,340
Yeah, and it was my money that
was supposed to be paying for it.

279
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,777
What was it this time?

280
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,214
You guys were gonna
start a new record label?

281
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,812
A restaurant? What?

282
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,352
I didn't rip you off,
and he didn't rip me off.

283
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,621
I was just a little late.

284
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,256
So, you're getting evicted

285
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,696
because your landlord's a
stickler for prompt payments?

286
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,959
It's the truth.

287
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,362
Mom, why the hell do you
have to get out of here so fast?

288
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,905
There is no way it's
because of a mean landlord.

289
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,403
Because he beat my ass,

290
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,241
and I'm terrified that
he's gonna do it again.

291
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,248
And I am not going to the cops.

292
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,157
I just wanna the hell get out of
this apartment and never come back.

293
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,228
That's it.

294
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,032
Putting's all about process.

295
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,775
Apparently not.

296
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,138
Front nine's for posers.
Back nine's for closers.

297
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,580
You just know I hate that movie

298
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,550
and you're trying to
get me off my game.

299
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,250
- But it's not gonna work.
- Nice.

300
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,929
So, what's she do, this
woman you're not serious about?

301
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,169
- Come on. You started it.
- And it was a mistake.

302
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,369
All right, what about work?

303
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,731
Kellan said one of the
other residents has autism.

304
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,771
Yeah. Dr. Murphy.

305
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,508
So, what's he like?

306
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,874
He's a bit immature, but nice.

307
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,616
Wow,

308
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,155
I feel like I totally
know him now.

309
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,357
Sorry, I just don't
wanna talk about work.

310
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,162
Or your personal life.

311
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,788
But I would like to
talk about something

312
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,993
other than your putting process.

313
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,632
What's going on in your life?

314
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,601
- How are you doing?
- Doing great. Everything's fine.

315
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,170
Come on, Mia, I'm just
trying to relax, have some fun.

316
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,079
This is exactly why we broke up.

317
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,652
That's not how I remember it.

318
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,691
I made a mistake, but we
were broken long before that.

319
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,695
Because I didn't like
to talk about work?

320
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,033
You decided to leave the
police force and become a doctor,

321
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,366
and the first I heard of it is when
you told me you got into med school.

322
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,602
Most people would think
that's a step up, be supportive.

323
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,801
How could I support
a man I never saw?

324
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,379
And when I did see
you, we didn't talk.

325
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,643
It's like everything in your
life can only be divulged

326
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,708
on a need-to-know basis.
And I never needed to know.

327
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,424
Found this in the trash. An
old pay stub for Carnell Hunter.

328
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,221
- I say we pay him a visit.
- And do what?

329
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,462
Give him a stern lecture that'll
teach him to respect women?

330
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,962
We need to make it
clear that abusing, stalking

331
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,093
or in any way bothering
your mom ever again

332
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,898
will be more trouble
than it's worth.

333
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,870
You're a bit out of
your element here.

334
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,237
We're not dealing with some
frat boy or creepy surgeon.

335
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,976
Guys my mom dates are psychos.

336
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,816
So you wanna do nothing?
Let him get away with it?

337
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,461
If she doesn't want
to involve the police,

338
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,796
there's nothing
we can do about it.

339
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,279
Let's just help her get out of
this mess and be done with it.

340
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,986
No. I'm not as
clueless as you think.

341
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,030
I had a stalker in med
school. The guy was scary.

342
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:35,228
Which is why now I never
go anywhere without this.

343
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,530
What the hell?

344
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,030
Don't worry, it's
legal. I have a CCW.

345
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,167
So, what are you gonna
do? Pop a cap in his ass?

346
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,436
No. We just need to
send him a message.

347
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,845
And studies have shown that men
are more likely to be visual learners.

348
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,351
Give me your key.

349
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,287
- Why?
- I wanna lock this.

350
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,260
We're leaving the car together.
How am I gonna I get it?

351
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,363
Key?

352
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,991
You're the one who insisted
the guy was so dangerous.

353
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,695
I'm sure he is, but you with a
gun is even more frightening.

354
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,906
Here. Go ahead.

355
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,577
How come you're Saint Claire
with everyone but your mom?

356
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,414
Stop calling me Saint Claire.
And you don't know my mom.

357
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,118
I know it's not her
fault she's bipolar.

358
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,426
- Feeling any better?
- Actually, I am.

359
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,968
Nothing like a good BM to
turn a frown upside-down.

360
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,664
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning,

361
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,975
about how competitive
I always am.

362
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,314
And the more I think
about it, the angrier I get.

363
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,745
All I was trying to say...

364
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,013
I have been nothing
but professional with you.

365
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,180
And for the record, you're the
one who invited me out for drinks.

366
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,554
You wanted to go
back to my apartment.

367
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,369
And now you're the one
who's acting differently

368
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,554
just because we had sex.

369
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,292
You need to project more.

370
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,161
Use your diaphragm if you really
want the entire hospital to hear you.

371
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,415
Definitely won't go out of my
way to be nice to you again.

372
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,308
He doesn't trust
me. I mean, why?

373
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,140
Is he that way with
everybody, or just me?

374
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,008
Can you help me convince him to
start his chemotherapy on schedule?

375
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,087
You want me to
convince a brain surgeon,

376
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,316
who doesn't like me, that I know
the best way to treat his tumor?

377
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,616
Yes.

378
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,696
Maybe just be supportive, Shaun.

379
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,832
- He just wants some time.
- No.

380
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:49,062
He doesn't have time.
You don't understand.

381
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,397
Actually, I do understand.

382
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,495
And I'm getting really tired of
people treating me like I don't.

383
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,838
- I know how you feel.
- Where's your food?

384
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,205
Too many options.
I got confused.

385
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,739
You find out why no
one wants to eat with me?

386
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,174
Still snooping.

387
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,044
Hmm.

388
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,026
Okay, we all need
to do something fun.

389
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,866
Either of you need a refill?

390
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,233
- No, thanks.
- I'm good.

391
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
Neither do I,

392
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,338
but I'm gonna get one anyways.

393
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,040
I'll be in the arcade
when you two

394
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,583
are done with whatever
you need to deal with.

395
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,884
Regretting your invite now?

396
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,587
No, it's just, um...

397
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,927
Maybe we should think about
trying to get back together.

398
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,230
Are you insane?

399
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,599
We can't even spend half a
day together without a fight.

400
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,730
Mia, I'm sorry. I
do respect you.

401
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,471
Which is exactly why I
need you back in my life,

402
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,074
to remind me who I can be.

403
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,579
Come on, Alex, you've just been
through a traumatic experience.

404
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,949
You're exhausted and lonely.

405
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
But...

406
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,563
I love you.

407
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,132
Just tell me what I
need to do and I'll do it.

408
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,834
Thank you.

409
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,970
I know how hard it
is for you to open up.

410
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,447
I love you, too.

411
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:54,190
But I think it's best if we just
keep moving forward with our lives.

412
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,183
- Carnell Hunter?
- Yeah?

413
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,654
We need to talk.

414
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,792
Yeah, well, I need to do my job.

415
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,560
So, unless you got a
badge, I ain't interested.

416
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,497
Time for a break.

417
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,045
Because we need
to tell you something,

418
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,935
and we wanna make
sure you're listening.

419
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,335
I'd get out of my
face if I were you.

420
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:45,640
- Or what? You gonna beat my ass?
- Who the hell are you?

421
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,540
Breeze Brown is my mom.

422
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,479
She's moving out of
the apartment today

423
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,346
and she never wants
to see you again.

424
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,216
What are you talking about?

425
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,053
You're a disgusting,
pathetically weak coward.

426
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,091
You know it, and every woman
you've ever been with knows it, too.

427
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,361
I don't know what
you're talking about,

428
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,659
but I would never lay
my hands on a woman.

429
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,193
Especially Breeze.

430
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,729
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

431
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,994
I love her.

432
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,368
You guys all memorize
the same speech, don't you?

433
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,235
Why do you think I
asked her to marry me?

434
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,342
What, she didn't tell you?

435
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,011
What did she tell you?

436
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:29,945
You had no right to butt in.

437
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,087
The poor guy was
almost in tears.

438
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,951
Which is exactly why I
couldn't tell him to his face.

439
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,655
He's just... He's so darn
sensitive about everything.

440
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,407
So you thought
disappearing into the night

441
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,797
would make it easier for him?

442
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,465
I know. You're
right. It's just...

443
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,467
I don't wanna marry him.

444
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:53,444
So tell him you're not ready.
You want to take things slower.

445
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,541
He's one of the sweetest
men I've ever met.

446
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,281
So why are you
trying to ghost him?

447
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,117
I don't know.

448
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,120
Mom.

449
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,673
Dr. Andrews?

450
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,572
- We have some findings.
- I'm excited to hear them.

451
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,756
And I just wanted to say, with
regard to the staffing issue...

452
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,578
I wouldn't worry
about that anymore.

453
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,280
Dr. Audrey Lim
nonconsensually dosed a man

454
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,550
who was not even
a patient with Haldol,

455
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,418
which is not only
unethical, it's a crime.

456
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,520
And Dr. Neil Melendez ignored a
written DNR, which is also a crime.

457
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,824
And I've just reviewed a video
showing Dr. Shaun Murphy

458
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,631
curled up on the ER
floor in the fetal position.

459
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,635
Dr. Murphy has autism,

460
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,009
which on extremely rare
occasions impacts his...

461
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,708
Ability to provide the
proper standard of care?

462
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,056
I'll be recommending all
three to the state medical board

463
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,347
for licence suspension.

464
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,053
Bumper cars? I'd
rather go ice-skating.

465
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,188
I don't want to do either.

466
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,042
All right, these aren't
bumper cars, smart-ass.

467
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,195
They're electric sprint-karts.
NASCAR drivers train in them.

468
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,831
We use them to test our device
prototypes, and they haul ass.

469
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,407
This is a very bad idea.

470
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,603
If the skull base
repair doesn't hold...

471
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,681
I could get a subdural hematoma.
Yes, we've established that.

472
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,358
I don't know what that means,

473
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,702
but I do know both of you
drove on the freeway to get here.

474
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,517
If it's safe, why do
we have to wear...

475
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,420
Enough negativity, both of you.

476
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,315
You didn't blow off Blaize just to
go out for a walk or a nice lunch.

477
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,859
It's time to crank up the
volume on this day off.

478
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,931
I don't want to drive a go-kart.

479
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,331
I don't believe you. I think
you do wanna drive a go-kart,

480
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,233
you just don't want
me to drive a go-kart.

481
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,327
You know what? I'm in.

482
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,708
Okay.

483
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,931
<i>I live my life in the city</i>

484
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,900
<i>There's no easy way out</i>

485
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:43,113
<i>The day's moving
just too fast for me</i>

486
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,543
<i>I need some time in the sunshine</i>

487
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,814
<i>I've got to slow it right down</i>

488
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,322
<i>The day's moving
just too fast for me</i>

489
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,431
<i>I live my life for
the stars that shine</i>

490
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,968
<i>People say it's
just a waste of time</i>

491
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,403
<i>Then they said I
should feed my head</i>

492
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,808
<i>That to me was just a day in bed</i>

493
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,279
<i>I'll take my car
and drive real far</i>

494
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,682
<i>They're not concerned
about the way we are</i>

495
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:23,288
<i>In my mind, my dreams are real</i>

496
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,392
<i>Now you're concerned
about the way I feel</i>

497
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,017
<i>Tonight</i>

498
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,653
<i>I'm a rock 'n' roll star</i>

499
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,130
<i>Tonight</i>

500
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,633
<i>I'm a rock 'n' roll star</i>

501
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,276
<i>You're not down with who I am</i>

502
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:48,643
<i>Look at you now You're
all in my hands tonight</i>

503
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,420
<i>Tonight</i>

504
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,723
<i>I'm a rock 'n' roll star</i>

505
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,356
<i>Tonight</i>

506
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,561
<i>I'm a rock 'n' roll star</i>

507
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,438
<i>Tonight</i>

508
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,407
<i>I'm a rock 'n' roll star</i>

509
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,715
<i>It's just rock 'n' roll</i>

510
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,686
<i>It's just rock 'n' roll</i>

511
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,201
That was awesome!

512
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,367
I still beat your ass, but you
improved your time every lap.

513
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,571
- Thank you.
- You did too, Shaun.

514
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,137
Whoo!

515
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,610
Are you okay?

516
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,886
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

517
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,217
You look a little
glassy-eyed, Glassy.

518
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,382
No, I think I just have
something in my eye.

519
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,952
Do you have any
dizziness, or a metallic taste?

520
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,758
I'm fine, Shaun. I'm
actually fine. I'm...

521
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,396
You know what? I'm
better than fine. I'm good.

522
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,534
He's good.

523
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,533
Yes!

524
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,447
Come on, Shaun.

525
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,040
<i>I was wrong.</i>

526
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:36,043
From the moment we met, my
defensiveness was unprofessional,

527
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,953
and my subsequent
behavior even worse.

528
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,957
I was not aware Dr. Lim
dosed a hospital visitor,

529
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,221
or that Dr. Melendez
violated a DNR.

530
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,023
But that's my fault.

531
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:49,258
Neither of them made any
attempt to hide their actions,

532
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,399
because they both are totally
committed to doing whatever it takes

533
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,667
to provide the utmost
care for their patients.

534
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:59,438
Practicing medicine requires
doctors to make judgments,

535
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,839
not just follow rules.

536
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:06,714
Two human beings, who
would otherwise be dead,

537
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:12,121
are alive because of rules
broken by Lim and Melendez.

538
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,558
They were doing their jobs.

539
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,561
They shouldn't be punished for
that, they should be applauded.

540
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,274
I'll be notifying the state
board of our findings.

541
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,043
It'll then be up to
those doctors to decide.

542
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,307
They'll leave us
bureaucrats out of it.

543
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:39,978
See you at the hearing.

544
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,628
- I screwed up.
- No.

545
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,305
You did the right
thing. We both did.

546
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,742
I wasn't talking about
this stupid investigation.

547
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:06,937
I was talking about us.

548
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,549
Ever since my divorce,
I can't help but think...

549
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,586
No matter how real
this feels, it's not.

550
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,890
I have feelings for you.

551
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:34,131
I have for a long
time, and it scares me.

552
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:39,771
But I don't want the night we
spent together to be our last.

553
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,775
I feel the same way.

554
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,387
But I'm not sure
it's a good idea.

555
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,125
Especially now, since we're
both gonna be under a microscope.

556
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,086
Yeah, that is true.

557
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,628
Of course, if, for
the time being,

558
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,067
we just made sure that Andrews
and everyone else doesn't know...

559
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,271
Interesting idea.

560
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,587
- Good night, Neil.
- Good night, Audrey.

561
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,157
Thank you.

562
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,939
I'm glad you were
here. It helped.

563
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,641
No problem.

564
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,738
And also, um...

565
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,340
You're not clueless. I am.

566
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,041
You carry a gun,

567
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,286
and you practically dared
that guy to take a swing at you.

568
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,188
I volunteered at a battered
women's shelter in med school,

569
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,727
and I am not an expert,

570
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,525
and I am definitely
not trying to be a shrink,

571
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,159
but if you ever need
someone to talk to,

572
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,463
about anything...

573
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,468
Thank you.

574
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,809
It was a good day.

575
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,516
I need to return the favor,
have you meet my mom.

576
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,689
It's a date.

577
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,199
I decided not to
postpone the chemo.

578
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:47,969
That's a good idea.

579
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,299
In fact, I'm gonna speed it up.

580
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,869
I'm gonna go for a much
more aggressive regimen.

581
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:55,970
But Dr. Blaize said...

582
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,744
Dr. Blaize will have to
agree, or I'll get another doctor.

583
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,150
I wanna get this over with. I
wanna have more days like today.

584
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,382
- And you should do the same.
- I don't have cancer.

585
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,585
Exactly. You have no excuse.

586
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,328
Lea's okay, huh? She gets you?

587
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,939
Yes. I get her, too.
She's a good friend.

588
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,906
You think she'll ever
be more than that?

589
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,241
She only wants to be my
friend. She made that very clear.

590
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,044
Hmm.

591
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,189
You're a good man, you
know? Deserve to be happy.

592
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,431
Well, thanks again for staying.

593
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,943
It was nice.

594
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,779
It was.

595
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,074
Well, bye.

596
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,936
- You forget something?
- No.

597
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,505
Maybe you're right.

598
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,180
We could try to slowly and
cautiously test the waters.

599
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,754
I would love that.

600
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,156
Maybe in a couple of weeks I
could come back for a weekend?

601
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,024
- On my own?
- Definitely.

602
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,532
I'll call you.

603
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,153
Shaun?

604
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,139
I thought you were gonna
hang with Glassy tonight.

605
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:28,031
I did, but he got tired.

606
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,197
Is there any more
beer? I'd like to try one.

607
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,669
Yeah, there's some
more in the fridge.

608
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,173
How many beers have you drunk?

609
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,902
Just this one. Why?

610
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,976
Oh, no. Um...

611
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,743
That's Jake's.

612
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,583
Jake, meet my totally
cool roomie, Shaun Murphy.

613
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,719
- Shaun, meet Jake.
- Hello.

614
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,765
It's nice to meet you. Lea's
told me a lot about you.

615
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,360
He's such a sweetheart.

616
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,097
Well, we gotta run.

617
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,229
Jake's taking me to
Death Cab for Cutie.

618
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,499
Take it easy, Shaun.

619
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,080
And don't wait up. We're
probably gonna be out late.

620
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:28,216
<i>We've seen the holy,
the lonely, the sinners and</i>

621
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:33,464
<i>Been to the promise,
the garden, the wasteland</i>

622
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,858
<i>Oh, the truth of it all</i>

623
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:41,505
<i>We rise and we fall We hold on</i>

624
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,207
<i>We hold on</i>

625
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,335
<i>When we fight When we lie</i>

626
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,914
<i>When the weakness shows</i>

627
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,640
<i>When we laugh When we cry</i>

628
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,447
<i>When it's all exposed</i>

629
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,452

00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,616

<i>Hold on</i>

637
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,471
<i>Oh, love, we hold on together</i>

638
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:21,436
<i>We scream like sisters
and brothers Drew hard lines</i>

639
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:27,184
<i>We love like star crossed,

00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,648
