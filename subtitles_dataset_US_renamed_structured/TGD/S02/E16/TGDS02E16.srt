1
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,600
Today is not Saturday. Why
did you make me pancakes?

2
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,903
They are fresh-start pancakes,

3
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,502
like the first day of
school every year,

4
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,706
when you get to wear
a brand-new outfit.

5
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,882
Well, not everyone
wore a new outfit.

6
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,784
But the rule in
this house is that

7
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:57,120
when you start a new life
event, you get pancakes.

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:03,228
I don't want a fresh start.
I want to stay in surgery.

9
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,731
I know, and I am really proud
of you for handling it all so...

10
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,450
Doctors, please give
me one more minute.

11
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,487
We have an associate
pastor at the church,

12
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,682
but Clarence likes
to write the sermons.

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,815
Sorry.

14
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,917
Please. Although
this is important, too.

15
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,862
The surgery
consists of two steps.

16
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,398
First, we fuse the
spine to stabilize it,

17
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,694
and then we remove the tumor.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,960
Now, because the cancer has
spread to your lymph nodes,

19
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,642
you'll still have to
follow up with chemo.

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,036
Clarence, are you in pain?

21
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,805
Quite a bit,
actually. But I'm fine.

22
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,221
Well, since what's
causing your pain

23
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,009
is the tumor pushing
against your spine,

24
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,016
spinal fusion will ease
pressure on your nerves

25
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,389
and should eliminate your pain.

26
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:00,715
Please, I... I need this pain.

27
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,623
Can't you just do the second
part and remove the tumor?

28
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,020
If we don't fuse the spine,

29
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,585
it'll make removing the
tumor a lot more difficult.

30
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,324
More difficult, but
it can be done?

31
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,263
It can, but I
recommend against it.

32
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,460
Especially since
there's no reason not to.

33
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:26,476
I did something unforgivable.

34
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,111
This pain is my punishment.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,991
Can I ask what you
did that was so bad?

36
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,527
I killed someone.

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,467
My sister and I were coming
home from climbing Mount Whitney.

38
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,094
We're doing the State 50 Climbs.

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,763
The numbness started
during the climb?

40
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,704
First my hands,
and then my feet.

41
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,442
- Do you have a headache?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,207
High altitude causes headaches.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,680
Dehydration compounds it.

44
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,240
From now on, just climb
slower and drink more.

45
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,913
Tell them about the other thing.

46
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,853
Before leaving for the mountain,

47
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:53,924
I had this weird
sensation, like dread.

48
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,199
I couldn't shake it.

49
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,497
Well, when people describe
a sense of impending doom,

50
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,667
it's usually anxiety.

51
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,870
No, it was like a premonition.

52
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,506
That I was going to die.

53
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,210
I'm sure it was...

54
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,119
Dr. Park will run a brain scan,
and we'll do some lab work.

55
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,096
Shaun.

56
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,100
Hello, Dr. Lever.

57
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,509
"Carly" is fine.
Welcome to pathology.

58
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,677
It is going to be great
working with you.

59
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,019
What do you think?

60
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,596
I know it's a lot to take in.

61
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,360
It's kind of like your first
time at Disneyland, right?

62
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,692
I've never been to Disneyland.

63
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,534
Let me give you a tour.

64
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:44,337
Cytopathology, forensics,
genomics, microbiology.

65
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,505
We get to identify organisms,

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,776
interpret cell morphology,
sequence genes.

67
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,655
Is that a D300e pathogen
antibacterial bioprinter?

68
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,520
It's new.

69
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,788
You're working on
antibiotic resistance

70
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,729
in emerging microorganisms?

71
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,891
It's "we" now,
Shaun. Yes, we are.

72
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,833
Do you wanna play with it?

73
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,697
Very much.

74
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,244
Go ahead. It's kind
of your job now.

75
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,850
We're the detectives,
surgeons are just the beat cops.

76
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,459
Our best bet is to try to
separate the tumor from his cord,

77
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,089
and then resect it.

78
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,758
Okay, this is insane.

79
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,268
You know how he killed a person?

80
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,100
He was counseling a
parishioner who committed suicide.

81
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,433
That must've been traumatic.

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,041
Traumatic, yes. Murder, no.

83
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,237
Hey, I know it's stupid,
but he has autonomy.

84
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,075
I didn't say "stupid."
I said "insane."

85
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,481
You wanna override his
wishes because he's religious?

86
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,144
Something like 90% of
Americans believe in God.

87
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,155
I'm one of them. Are
we all mentally impaired?

88
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,267
Should you ignore us all if
you don't like our choices?

89
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,658
Only those getting divine
messages from their tumors.

90
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,750
He's not crazy.

91
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,386
Okay, you're right,
he is just stupid.

92
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,191
But don't we have a
duty to educate him?

93
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,960
You're gonna talk
him out of his religion?

94
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,126
No.

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,830
You told him the surgery
was more dangerous this way.

96
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,601
I don't think he appreciated
how much more dangerous.

97
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,633
Good idea.

98
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,143
He thinks he'll go to hell if
he dies before he's forgiven.

99
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,909
Make sure he knows it
can happen on the table.

100
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,819
An MRI for anxiety?

101
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,922
It does fly in the face of reducing
unnecessary medical tests.

102
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,698
When I was a resident, I had
a patient come through the ER.

103
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,360
Female, 35 years old.

104
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:53,237
Slight cough, slightly
hypothyroid, normal vitals.

105
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,835
I labeled her a whiner because
she kept insisting, "I'm gonna die."

106
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,741
I sent her home.

107
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,072
And she died?

108
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,438
No.

109
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,883
She kept coming back,
over and over again.

110
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,785
We do this test, we prove
there's nothing wrong with her,

111
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,484
we send her home reassured.

112
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,858
Damn.

113
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,901
The MRI showed a
high-grade meningioma,

114
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,308
an advanced tumor that grows in
the tissue layers that cover the brain.

115
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,582
Its features are consistent
with it being malignant.

116
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:45,218
These tumors tend to be aggressive
and impossible to fully resect.

117
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,862
Um, so, what can you do?

118
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,355
Palliative care, symptom
control with medications.

119
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,315
You're risking spinal
damage, paralysis, death.

120
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,011
If that's what God
chooses, then that is His will.

121
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,526
If you have cancer because
He wants you to have cancer,

122
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,720
why are you here,
getting treatment?

123
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,123
I'm here because I
believe in science.

124
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,865
I am who I am because
I believe in God.

125
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,730
So, do you think all people
who are sick are being punished?

126
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,606
I mean, we have an 8-year-old
down the hall with bone cancer.

127
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,210
You wanna go tell
her God hates her?

128
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,183
I'm sure that girl is not
suffering as a punishment.

129
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:50,680
She's suffering so others may
have a chance to show her mercy,

130
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,953
to show her compassion,
so she can inspire.

131
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,608
I don't know His plan, but I know
it's not as simple as you would...

132
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,131
No. No, it's not simple.

133
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,860
Except for your pain.

134
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,406
His name was Michael.

135
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,782
His wife found his body.

136
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,022
You had no idea.

137
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,753
I knew he was depressed.

138
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,658
But you thought he
was getting better.

139
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:35,799
I didn't take his call
because I was having a drink.

140
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,875
It'd been a long day
dealing with the renovations,

141
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,138
and I was having a damn drink.

142
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,089
Hey, Shaun. Hey, Carly.

143
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,490
I started Sadie Barnes
on anti-seizure medication.

144
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,051
Need you to run a
peak phenytoin level.

145
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,391
The couriers must be happy

146
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,092
that the surgeons are doing
their own specimen deliveries.

147
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,063
How you doing down here?

148
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,107
Carly says pathologists
are the detectives,

149
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,974
surgeons are just the beat cops.

150
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,176
Shaun, are you happy here?

151
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,453
When did you give the
patient her loading dose?

152
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,683
One hour ago.

153
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,417
Shaun, if you're
happy, that's great.

154
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,192
But if you're not, you have
to tell Han how you feel.

155
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,425
You need to show him you care
and that you believe in yourself.

156
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,832
Do you need this done stat?

157
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,640
No, she's asymptomatic.
It's just for seizure prevention.

158
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,771
Good.

159
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,941
Carly says that in pathology, you
can take a break whenever you want.

160
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,781
I want to take a break
now. I'm going for a walk.

161
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,927
He shouldn't be in pathology.
He's a good surgical resident.

162
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,360
You're right.

163
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,488
Then you'll move him back?

164
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,740
No. You're wrong
about that part.

165
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,909
He should be in pathology, but
he was a good surgical resident.

166
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,992
Then why...

167
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,697
Because he'll never
be a good surgeon.

168
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,181
How do you think
he'll do in three years

169
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,969
when no one's looking
over his shoulder?

170
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,975
When he's looking over
someone else's shoulder?

171
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,638
Supervising new residents,
leading grand rounds,

172
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,705
advocating for
vulnerable patients...

173
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,250
Do you see him doing any
of that without a safety net?

174
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,848
We can help him get there.

175
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,447
Just because he
wants to be a surgeon,

176
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,934
just because you want
him to be a surgeon,

177
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,484
doesn't mean he gets to
have that dream come true.

178
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,627
Has it occurred to you that maybe
we know Shaun better than you do?

179
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,427
Has it occurred to you that
that might be your problem,

180
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,003
that your view of him might be
distorted because you like him?

181
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,066
Has it occurred to you that
maybe he's better off in pathology?

182
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,236
That maybe he'll even like it?

183
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,739
Do you care?

184
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,874
I thought you might.

185
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,048
We need better ventral exposure.

186
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,044
Drill off more of the
pedicle and vertebral body.

187
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,495
Ligate the exiting nerve root.

188
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,543
We'll take it with the
tumor for a wider margin.

189
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,970
I can't see it.

190
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,232
Tumor's causing the spinal
cord to be bowed up to us.

191
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,811
We need more exposure to
get around and in front of it.

192
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,111
The vertebrae is too
fragmented and displaced.

193
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,150
We can't get a complete
resection without stabilization.

194
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,980
He's tanking.

195
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,731
Probably spinal shock
from the tension on the cord.

196
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,779
We need to abort.

197
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,530
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

198
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,790
You fixed me.

199
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,728
Nope. Nope.

200
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,862
What happened to my pain?

201
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,961
Stop.

202
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,870
We didn't fix you.

203
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,107
There was a complication.
We injected anesthetic.

204
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,308
It'll wear off.

205
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,145
We had to stop the surgery
before we could remove the tumor.

206
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,642
You went into shock.

207
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,188
We lost your heart
rate and blood pressure.

208
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,455
We warned it would be a
trickier surgery without the fusion.

209
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,686
Nothing has changed.

210
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,754
The anesthetic will wear off, the
pain will come back, but worse.

211
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,890
When can you try again?

212
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,027
"Try again"? We failed.

213
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,732
There is no reason to
think we will succeed...

214
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,604
But you know what the
issues are. You learned.

215
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,174
Why haven't you?

216
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,010
Do you think God
wants you to die?

217
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,825
Please.

218
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,356
Try again.

219
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,765
Cyanide poisoning.

220
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,868
The cause of death
on the Atlin case.

221
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,711
You know how I found
it? I smelled it. Almonds.

222
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:24,890
Dr. Park's patient, I
flagged her eosinophil count.

223
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,892
It doesn't match up
with the diagnosis

224
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,258
of advanced meningioma
listed on the requisition.

225
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,964
Great. Nice work.

226
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,027
I'm going to talk
to Dr. Lim about it.

227
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,295
Whoa, there, Shaun. Hold
up. You don't need to do that.

228
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,499
The attendings are on
the lookout for the flags,

229
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,573
they'll run with it.

230
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,699
I want to run with it.

231
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,954
You've been on the receiving
end, you know how it works.

232
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:50,074
How it works is I see
something abnormal,

233
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,779
and then I discuss it with the
team, and we plan how we'll fix it.

234
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,115
We run with it.

235
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,720
Shaun, once a test is done,
we move on to the next one.

236
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,797
I'd like to take a walk.

237
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,931
Are you going to walk to Dr. Lim
and discuss this case, Shaun?

238
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,710
That's not what we do here.

239
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:26,310
We investigate, report,
and then we move on.

240
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,888
Are you gonna be able
to do that? Move on?

241
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:38,597
I don't know, but
I will try very hard.

242
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,492
Next time.

243
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,708
Dr. Browne. Is this
about a patient?

244
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,884
No.

245
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,612
Come in.

246
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,652
I've heard a lot about you.

247
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,592
I'm aware you stood
up to a supervisor,

248
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,129
is that what's happening now?

249
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,133
I put together a list of cases

250
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:21,038
which Dr. Murphy
contributed to, uniquely.

251
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,201
You're a loyal friend.

252
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,172
I've specified the ideas he had,

253
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,340
ideas that no one else
around here could have...

254
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,713
Do you think I hate him?

255
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,642
No.

256
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:43,496
But I think you might be biased
against him because of his condition.

257
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,192
So, he doesn't have communication
issues, I'm wrong about that?

258
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,424
No, but he...

259
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,029
If he had the flu, I would tell him
to stay home until he got better.

260
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,469
He has autism.

261
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,641
I could tell him to stay
home until he gets better.

262
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:01,272
Instead, I found a place for
him to help us to save lives.

263
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,445
And you should know, I have
rather mixed feelings about loyalty.

264
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,843
All righty. There you go.

265
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,440
Hello.

266
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,253
Aaron. It's good to see you.

267
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah. Feeling is mutual.

268
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,923
Can I have one of those?

269
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,790
The chocolate chip muffin?

270
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,895
Yes, please.

271
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,421
Special occasion?

272
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,160
- Yes.
- Yeah?

273
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,931
As of today, I'm no longer
injecting toxins into my body,

274
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,836
except, of course,
with chocolate chips.

275
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:05,040
You're done with chemo? Wow,
that's amazing. Congratulations.

276
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,670
Thank you.

277
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,578
I was thinking of
going out tonight

278
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,710
and celebrating what may be
very good news, if you're free?

279
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,844
My treat?

280
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,988
I'm sorry, Aaron. I have
another commitment.

281
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,723
Tomorrow then?

282
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,419
Yeah, this week is really crazy.

283
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,654
You know what?

284
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,958
I'm not doing chemo
every night next week,

285
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,727
so I am free every
single night. So...

286
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,164
Aaron, I'm seeing someone.

287
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,030
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,339
Nothing to be sorry about.

289
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,874
It was good to see you.

290
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,489
Keep an extra-close eye on
blood pressure and heart rate.

291
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,529
I have extra fluid, vasopressors
and inotropes ready.

292
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,704
Why no God?

293
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,686
You follow in the tradition
that you're handed.

294
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,179
My family wasn't religious.
We never went to church.

295
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,773
I was there every Sunday,
8:00 a.m. for Catholic mass.

296
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,561
My parents eventually got tired of
all the rules and turned Lutheran.

297
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,745
They found that dull
and went back Catholic.

298
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,283
That's my tradition.

299
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,288
Well, what do you think
it'll be like when you die?

300
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,997
Probably like it was
before I was born,

301
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,692
a whole lot of nothing.

302
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,660
We're there.

303
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,429
Where we were when
everything went wrong last time.

304
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,186
We need to remove
the tumor without putting

305
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,268
any pressure on his cord at all,
or he'll be back in spinal shock.

306
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,375
And we need more tumor
release from the vertebral body.

307
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,677
Extend your osteotomies
proximal and distal.

308
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,883
Good.

309
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,953
I think I've got a free plane.

310
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,661
Retract it from the
cord a little more.

311
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,390
I got it.

312
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,537
Now, when you remove it,
careful not to morselize it.

313
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,905
Can you hold that up?

314
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,239
Dr. Reznick, give
me a measurement.

315
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,250
Max length is 4.5.

316
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,441
Get a pre-op scan up.

317
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,556
That says the tumor's
eight centimeters.

318
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,859
How does a tumor shrink
from eight centimeters to 4.5

319
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,555
without radiation in two weeks?

320
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,354
It doesn't.

321
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,171
Why the page, Shaun?
And why are you in radiology?

322
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,798
We rely on flags.

323
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,673
You have to count on the
ordering physician seeing it

324
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,508
while you move on
to something else.

325
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,579
Okay. And?

326
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,307
I don't agree with
Sadie Barnes' diagnosis,

327
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,680
and I think her tumor
should be biopsied.

328
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,585
- Shaun...
- Dr. Han wanted me away from patients.

329
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,416
Patients are not allowed
in the viewing room,

330
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,119
so I'm not doing anything wrong.

331
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,558
Two radiologists said

332
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,293
it was a malignant
meningioma in the insular region

333
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,834
and encasing the MCA vessels.

334
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,435
That's exactly where it is.

335
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,337
And her clinical picture matches
perfectly, arm and leg numbness.

336
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:25,305
The tumor attachment to
the dura is slightly anomalous,

337
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,779
and the insular region
is slightly atypical, too.

338
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,081
What differential diagnosis
are you proposing?

339
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:40,550
I need to speak to the patient.
Should I ask Dr. Han for permission?

340
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,026
Shaun,

341
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,427
I will bring your concern about
the scan to the head of radiology.

342
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,865
But approaching
Dr. Han, don't do that.

343
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,801
I already talked to him
about your reassignment.

344
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,649
I don't know if it'll make
any difference, but...

345
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,198
If I were Claire,

346
00:22:56,275 --> 00:23:00,872
would you let me approach Dr. Han
about something that concerned me?

347
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,718
Yes. I probably would.

348
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Hmm.

349
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:15,554
Is that because Claire doesn't make
mistakes when she's communicating?

350
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:17,821
Yes.

351
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,659
Then, do you think Dr. Han
made the right decision

352
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,567
by sending me to pathology?

353
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,263
No.

354
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,516
The lymph nodes
have shrunk, too.

355
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,716
This is the PET scan
from two weeks ago,

356
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,554
enlarged and cancerous.

357
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,221
Today... They've all regressed.

358
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,371
Spontaneous regression
has been reported

359
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,873
in melanomas,
renal cell carcinomas,

360
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,467
neuroblastomas and some
types of blood cancers.

361
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,305
In a sarcoma
that's metastasized?

362
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,978
No, but if it happened
in those others, why not?

363
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,583
Because none of them make sense.

364
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,647
When I read about
disappearing cancer,

365
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,539
I always think some
doctor missed something,

366
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,613
forgot something,
screwed up something.

367
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,890
The theory is that the
body somehow triggers

368
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,487
an immune response
against the cancer.

369
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,123
Something somehow lights a fuse.

370
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,463
The theory says the
fuse is lit by an infection.

371
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,299
His lab work proves
he hasn't had one.

372
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,095
At this point, the most
credible explanation is...

373
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,766
Are you going to
use the "M" word?

374
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,672
You seriously can't say it?

375
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:42,774
Only when referencing
the 1980 US hockey team.

376
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,006
Keep testing.

377
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,383
Anything you can think of,
molecular markers, T cells, PD-L1.

378
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,721
We'll need permission
from the patient,

379
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,185
which raises another issue.

380
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,155
What are we gonna
do next, medically?

381
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,892
He was supposed to
start chemo next week.

382
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,338
No, it'll wipe out
his immune system,

383
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,242
which may be what's
actually killing his cancer.

384
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,475
If we don't know what's
making him better,

385
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,468
we don't know what
to stop, what to start.

386
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:09,636
So, we do nothing?
Just trust God to fix him?

387
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,042
We trust whatever is currently
fixing him to keep fixing him.

388
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,974
If he took a Tylenol
yesterday at 8:00,

389
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,538
he takes a Tylenol
today at 8:00.

390
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,480
Monitor him, closely,
scans constantly.

391
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,100
Hello, Dr. Glassman.

392
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,876
Hi. Thank you for coming.

393
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,017
He has been doing
this for two hours.

394
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,850
Shaun? What are you up to?

395
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:03,357
Alphabetizing our canned goods
and checking all the expiration dates.

396
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,758
Well, somebody's gotta do it.

397
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,225
Is something wrong?

398
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,356
No.

399
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,896
- Okay.
- Okay,

400
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,535
I think Dr. Lim's patient's
diagnosis is wrong,

401
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,980
but I can't prove it
without information,

402
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,676
and I'm not allowed
to talk to patients.

403
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,109
Shaun.

404
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,050
I want to run with things.

405
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,161
I want to fix people.

406
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,097
Can you help me become
a surgical resident again?

407
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,128
No. I can't, Shaun.
I'm not president...

408
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,264
Yes.

409
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,774
I'm not the president of the
hospital anymore, Shaun.

410
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,246
And even if I
was, it's irrelevant.

411
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,080
You have to stand
up for yourself.

412
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,910
And you know what?

413
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,387
If you can't, then the new head
of surgery, the chief, he's right.

414
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:08,385
Now, I can go tell him he's
wrong, won't do any good,

415
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,928
or you can go show him.

416
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,338
I'm doing research
concerning Sadie Barnes.

417
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,964
She's asleep.

418
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,911
Perfect, I'm not allowed
to speak with her.

419
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,345
I'm looking for
her sister, Jess.

420
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,749
I haven't seen her, sorry.

421
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,741
What are you doing?

422
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,825
Can you explain why, instead of
remaining in pathology as directed,

423
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:27,133
you were in a patient's room
going through her purse?

424
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,472
I didn't speak to
her. She was asleep.

425
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,513
Dr. Murphy,

426
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,914
any reticence I had about removing
you from surgery just vanished.

427
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,653
You shouldn't be in
contact with patients,

428
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,814
or their families, or
anything they own.

429
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,585
Do you understand, or am I
gonna be forced to fire you?

430
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,232
Sadie's social media says that
she finances her climbing travel

431
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,735
by working as a
freelance food critic.

432
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,706
She reviewed a
Japanese restaurant

433
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,037
that used to have a restaurant
grading-system score of A,

434
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,508
but then it dropped to a C,

435
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,740
which corresponds to very
bad food-safety practices.

436
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,282
Bad sushi can lead to
worms, but it usually doesn't

437
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,080
because stomach acid almost
always kills fish parasites,

438
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,313
but not if someone is
taking an acid blocker,

439
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,980
which 60 million Americans are.

440
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,081
I saw a bottle in her purse.

441
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,293
Sadie could have sparganosis

442
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,027
with an encapsulated worm
that is mimicking a meningioma.

443
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,629
That's a good idea.

444
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,610
Excellent. I'll
tell the patient.

445
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,803
I will tell the patient.

446
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,458
I'll tell her we're doing a biopsy
to confirm the initial diagnosis.

447
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,882
But we're...

448
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,886
It will tell us if the initial
diagnosis is correct.

449
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,688
Your theory is a real long shot.

450
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,451
It would be irresponsible
to get her hopes up.

451
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,089
The surgery went well.

452
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,133
We were able to extract the
entire tumor without complication.

453
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,335
Thank you.

454
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,270
When can we start chemo?

455
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,673
There are a few follow-up
tests we wanna run first.

456
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,371
And we wanna
retake your history,

457
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,438
make sure we have a proper list of
all medications you've been taking.

458
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,642
You wanna take his
history after the surgery?

459
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,914
What's going on? What
are not you telling us?

460
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,012
What went wrong?

461
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,156
Nothing.

462
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:29,593
The fact is, the surgery
went better than we'd hoped.

463
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,990
Your cancer seems to
be going away on its own.

464
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,400
We'll run our tests.

465
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,805
We're confident that there
is a medical explanation.

466
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,642
Oh, Clarence.

467
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,718
Hi.

468
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,817
Hi, Aaron.

469
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,995
What I...

470
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:11,161
What I told you earlier, that
I'm seeing someone... I'm not.

471
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,934
I mean, I had one date,
but it wasn't, you know...

472
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,030
Okay.

473
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:23,107
We're just... We're
not a good match.

474
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,877
That's what I
wanted to tell you.

475
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,358
That's not true, you know.

476
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,825
You know that's not true.

477
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,887
You like me a lot, and I
like you even more than that.

478
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,363
So, what is this?

479
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,365
You know, I'd really
rather not get into it.

480
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,493
You came to my house.

481
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,662
To tell you what I told
you, which I just told you.

482
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,881
Okay. You came
here to be honest,

483
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,601
and you're only gonna
be honest halfway?

484
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,935
- You're not timid.
- No.

485
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,973
Okay, then what?

486
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,350
Last time I was here,
we were headed upstairs.

487
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,575
Yes, we were.

488
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,512
You fell.

489
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,212
Yes, I did.

490
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,123
I tried to help you, and
you pushed me away.

491
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,417
I was embarrassed.

492
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,190
You were sick. You needed help.

493
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,165
And I'm not sick anymore, maybe.

494
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,669
And I wanna go and
celebrate with you,

495
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,136
specifically with you.

496
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,603
'Cause we have fun.

497
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,572
You make me laugh,
you make me feel good.

498
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:27,776
I like being with you.

499
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,205
That sounds horrible.

500
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,308
But bad things are
gonna happen, Aaron.

501
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,013
It can't just be about
having fun together.

502
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,418
One of us is gonna get sick,

503
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,582
one of us is gonna
need to be taken care of.

504
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:42,856
Wait, wait, wait. I just wanna go
out and have a nice dinner with you,

505
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:46,092
not to run away to Reno,
find a priest in an Elvis suit.

506
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,835
What are we gonna do, Aaron?

507
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,736
Just drive to a hill with a
view and neck till prom?

508
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,173
And then I'm gonna come
home and hope you call?

509
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,776
You know, I just
came to apologize.

510
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,479
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,614
And I'm really glad...

512
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,962
I'm glad you're
finished with chemo.

513
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,394
And...

514
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,900
You're gonna... You're
gonna beat this thing.

515
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,821
Your immunoglobulins are normal.

516
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,652
Everything is normal.

517
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,195
We can't find a
scientific explanation.

518
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,963
Our prayers. It's a miracle.

519
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,139
Miracle or not, it seems
we're on the same page now.

520
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,975
There is no reason not
to do the spinal fusion

521
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,275
to eliminate your pain.

522
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,208
Do more tests.

523
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,010
Clarence.

524
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,281
There are no more tests.

525
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,915
There must be. There
must be an explanation.

526
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,426
Redo your tests. Find new tests.

527
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:30,298
"Let all bitterness
and wrath and anger

528
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,429
"and clamor and slander
be put away from you."

529
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,340
Ephesians 4:31.

530
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,740
I didn't take you
for a believer.

531
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,406
I'm not anymore.

532
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,343
I'm not sure you are, either.

533
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:57,053
God speaks directly to Noah,
Moses, Job and Solomon.

534
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:01,389
And now, apparently, he has singled
out Pastor Clarence of San Jose

535
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,126
to join the ranks
of the prophets.

536
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:08,106
I'm sorry, but unless
there is a burning bush,

537
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,802
it is narcissistic to think that God
has made you his personal project.

538
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,506
God speaks to every one of us.

539
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,049
You just have to listen.

540
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,115
You are not listening.

541
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,388
People get cancer all the time.

542
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,425
Often that results in pain.
Those things are not unique.

543
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,826
What is unique is having an
aggressive metastatic cancer

544
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,889
start to disappear without
any rational explanation.

545
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,893
The issue isn't God.

546
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,904
You have to forgive yourself.

547
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,135
What I did...

548
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:51,113
Cannot be undone,
but your pain can.

549
00:35:58,757 --> 00:35:59,816
Clarence.

550
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,831
Your pain...

551
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,367
Your pain does no one any good.

552
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,269
Okay.

553
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,047
Osteotome and mallet.

554
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,895
You lied when you said you never
went to church. What happened?

555
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,465
I didn't wanna have this
conversation is what happened.

556
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,676
I'm not judging.

557
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,177
My brother took a
year off school to travel

558
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,999
and came back a non-believer.

559
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,094
So, ask him.

560
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,514
Was it freeing, or
did you feel empty?

561
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,583
Hand me the first
polyaxial pedicle screw.

562
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,386
It was like losing a loved one.

563
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,738
Moment of truth.

564
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,046
Follow me.

565
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,440
Our initial diagnosis was wrong.

566
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,311
You don't have a meningioma,
you have a worm in your brain.

567
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,789
And while that sounds fairly
gross, it is completely curable.

568
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,994
So, the sense of
doom, it was wrong?

569
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,893
It saved your life.

570
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,129
As did Dr. Murphy.

571
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:29,572
This is the pathologist who noticed
an abnormality in one of your tests.

572
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,008
That led us to this discovery.

573
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,780
Can I give you a
hug, too, Dr. Murphy?

574
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,742
No.

575
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,214
You and your sister
will be free to conquer

576
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,226
whichever of the remaining
50 peaks you choose

577
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,262
as soon as my team
surgically removes the worm.

578
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,495
- Thank you.
- Of course.

579
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,074
There are not a lot of doctors
who would've made the leap

580
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,974
that you made today, Shaun.

581
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,372
Good work.

582
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,781
Yes, it was excellent work.

583
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,785
Most people would
say, "Thank you,"

584
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,881
but technically, that's
not an incorrect response.

585
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:20,624
Hmm.

586
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,284
Have a good evening.
You've earned it.

587
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,130
I don't want to go on walks.

588
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:40,373
I don't want to move on from
cases after the tests are done.

589
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,943
I do not want to
be a pathologist.

590
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:55,049
Dr. Han, you need to make
me a surgical resident again.

591
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,900
I appreciate you
telling me that.

592
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,067
I was wondering whether you
had it in you to advocate for yourself.

593
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,535
But the truth is, Shaun,

594
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,673
what you did today,
it proved I'm right.

595
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,209
Your skills are tremendous.

596
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,687
Your weaknesses,
equally significant.

597
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,317
You could be a
great pathologist.

598
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,828
Just think of all the
Sadies out there,

599
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,921
waiting for you to save them.

600
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,921
Dr. Browne. Dr. Reznick.

601
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,158
The surgery went well.
Your spine is stable.

602
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,831
I'm scared.

603
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,934
There may still be some
residual pain as you heal, but...

604
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,235
No, I...

605
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:23,678
I keep wondering,
what if I disobeyed God?

606
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,649
You have to have faith.

607
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,950
But you lost yours.

608
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,326
I didn't have a miracle to
help me through the dark times.

609
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,342
<i>Hmm, hmm</i>

610
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,477
<i>Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

611
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:00,382
<i>In the muddy water we're falling</i>

612
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,546
<i>Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

613
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:08,057
<i>In the muddy
water we're crawling</i>

614
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,221
<i>Hold me down</i>

615
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:15,161
<i>Hold me now</i>

616
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,860
<i>Sold me out</i>

617
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,973
<i>In the muddy
waters we're falling</i>
