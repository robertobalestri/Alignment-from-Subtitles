1
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,780
Shaun...

2
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,447
You need to give me
your driver's license.

3
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,449
No, I don't.

4
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,528
Do you remember the
memory test I gave you?

5
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,618
Vividly.

6
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,699
Yes. It demonstrated
you have a deficit.

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,031
A deficit. You shouldn't be
driving. Dr. Blaize agreed.

8
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,205
Shaun, that test was
supposed to be between us.

9
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,400
That's why I didn't want
to do it at the hospital.

10
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,643
Yes. Your doctor
needs to be informed

11
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,111
of the results of all
your medical tests.

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,114
Even tests that
are done at home.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,117
Shaun, I've been driving
for like half a century.

14
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,810
I'm an excellent driver, okay?

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,116
I don't need to give
you my driver's license.

16
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,885
Okay. Then I'll have
to notify the DMV.

17
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,884
Dr. Glassman?

18
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,230
You're not gonna
notify the DMV, Shaun.

19
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,624
Yes, I will notify the DMV.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,934
Shaun, you will
not notify the DMV.

21
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:14,600
Dr. Glassman, if you don't
give me your driver's license,

22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,645
I will notify the DMV.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,645
Dr. Glassman?

24
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,198
George Reynolds, 28, sudden
onset of arm and leg weakness,

25
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,208
right facial droop
and trouble speaking.

26
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,642
CT confirmed a middle
cerebral artery embolism.

27
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,837
I booked us into
interventional radiology.

28
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,927
When did you first notice
your symptoms, George?

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,014
About four and a half hours
ago. Wait, what's wrong with me?

30
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,233
You may be having a stroke.

31
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,383
You're on monthly
injections of Lupron?

32
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,838
- For three months.
- That may have caused this.

33
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,486
Do you have prostate cancer?

34
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:12,829
No. I was diagnosed with,
uh, atypical hyperplasia.

35
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,844
That shouldn't have any effect
on what we're gonna do now.

36
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,828
We're gonna take care of
you, George. Don't worry.

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,167
This is local anesthetic.
You'll feel a pinch.

38
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,006
Are you a real doctor?

39
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,882
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

40
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,515
People ever call you "Murph"?

41
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,052
No. I'm going to
make a small incision,

42
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,054
so, we can insert the
tube and reinflate your lung.

43
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,886
What do they call you, Billy?

44
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:47,691
Crater-head, Volcano, Three-Eyes...
Those are just the creative ones.

45
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,168
Hold tight. Here comes the tube.

46
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,608
You guys really know
what you're doing.

47
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,512
Yes, we do.

48
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,884
We'll order an
MRI for your lungs.

49
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,924
Then we will fix your
fractured eye orbit.

50
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,583
That will require surgery.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,929
What do you say we
fix your forehead, too?

52
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,256
- You could do that?
- I think so.

53
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,089
I don't think so.

54
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,930
It's a preexisting condition
and it's not medically necessary.

55
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,098
It shouldn't be approved.

56
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,787
The MCA clot is
obstructing all distal flow.

57
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,986
Anti-androgens aren't
indicated for hyperplasia.

58
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,663
He said atypical.

59
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,667
You think he's lying?

60
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,896
Maybe, he's
gender transitioning.

61
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,941
Aside from cancer, there
aren't many other indications.

62
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,476
Let's focus on what we do know.

63
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,906
Feeding the catheter.
Suctioning the thrombus.

64
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,674
And he's recanalizing.
Slowly retract.

65
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,687
Whatever his reasons are
for taking anti-androgens,

66
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,121
hopefully there are options.

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,421
He either drops them, or he's
gonna keep having strokes.

68
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,526
The forehead repair would
be expensive and cosmetic.

69
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,157
It's not about prettying him up.

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,793
It could give him a new life,
friends, maybe a few less beatings.

71
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,101
Stopping the beatings
is the guard's job.

72
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,695
You really don't have
any empathy for Billy?

73
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,974
Empathy is a bad reason
to fight for someone.

74
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,878
If empathy makes me only want

75
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,181
to help patients who are
from Wyoming or have ASD,

76
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,951
then that's very unfair to all my
neurotypical patients from Idaho.

77
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,864
I need to take those drugs.

78
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,394
They caused your stroke.

79
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,802
We don't think you
have hyperplasia.

80
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,463
If you tell us the real reason,

81
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,261
I'm sure there are
other safer treatments...

82
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,366
No, there aren't!

83
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,540
If you're transitioning,
there are alternatives...

84
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,413
I told you why I
was taking the meds.

85
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,486
George, we are your doctors.

86
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,991
We need to know the truth.
We're not gonna tell anyone.

87
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,026
I'm not transitioning.

88
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,733
And I don't have hyperplasia.

89
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:47,173
I have problems
with my sex drive.

90
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:53,414
I know it sounds stupid. Like,
why can't I just control myself, but...

91
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,186
It's all I think about.
It's all I can think about.

92
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:08,693
I can't work, I can't
socialize, I can't have a life.

93
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,467
And those meds
are the only thing

94
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,441
that makes it even
remotely tolerable.

95
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,868
They'll kill you.

96
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,956
The residents have a betting
pool on who you're going to appoint

97
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,386
as your replacement
as Chief of Surgery.

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,491
The decision needs to be made
with decorum and expediency.

99
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,307
I haven't quite gotten
around to analyzing...

100
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,209
You've had little face
time with your attendings

101
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,998
since you became president.
You need to correct that.

102
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,633
I've scheduled your
announcement. You've got two days.

103
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,612
Where is he?

104
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,817
He's gone, signed
out AMA. I tried...

105
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,326
- How long ago?
- Five minutes.

106
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,093
Why are we in a hurry?

107
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,931
I was researching
alternative meds for him.

108
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,834
Realized Lupron
didn't make any sense.

109
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,930
Prescribing anti-androgens
for sexual urges

110
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,751
is like hitting a
mosquito with a mallet.

111
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,937
Unless they're deviant urges.

112
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,208
We might have just
released a child molester.

113
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,266
Should we call the police?

114
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,283
We can't. We have
no evidence of a crime.

115
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,343
Lim's at three-to-two.

116
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,165
Melendez is just
behind at two-to-one.

117
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,565
Cooperberg's seven-to-one,

118
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,640
and if Dartling or anybody
else comes in, you can retire.

119
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,518
Andrews might bail on
Melendez when he finds out

120
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,566
our patient bolted.

121
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:01,072
Which is why Melendez
is now four-to-one.

122
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,741
Pari-mutuel betting
is very exciting.

123
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,415
Do you need empathy
to be a good doctor?

124
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:13,055
No. I think it can interfere
with effective decision-making.

125
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,852
She's just saying that to
avoid hurting your feelings,

126
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,400
thus making her fake point for real.
Her empathy made her lie to you.

127
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,162
I think you just agreed with me
and insulted me at the same time.

128
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,062
I think empathy's
very important.

129
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,571
Telling the cold hard
truth even when it hurts,

130
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,594
sometimes is the most
empathetic thing we can do.

131
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,769
Which is what I'm doing
for Shaun right now.

132
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,005
You're welcome.

133
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,880
I have autism, which means I
have a deficiency of mirror neurons,

134
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,888
which inhibits me from emotionally
trading places with people,

135
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,356
which makes
empathy very difficult.

136
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,393
Does that mean I
can't be a good doctor?

137
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,765
No, it doesn't.

138
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,528
We all have our strengths
and weaknesses, Shaun.

139
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,199
One of Claire's is making
sure everyone feels validated.

140
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,242
The creep is back.

141
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,212
Is George having another stroke?

142
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,754
No. Severe lacerations
to the scrotum.

143
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,816
- Did you give him anything for pain?
- Morphine, four milligrams.

144
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,418
And I notified the cops. I
think it was a hate crime.

145
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,925
Yeah, I don't think so.

146
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,566
All right, on my
count. One, two, three.

147
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,079
- We'll take it from here.
- I'll pack him and prep him.

148
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,112
You did this to
yourself, didn't you?

149
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,117
I think I know what kind of
urges you've been having.

150
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,761
I'm not a monster. I
never touched anyone...

151
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,268
Any child.

152
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,110
My sister and I were
always best friends,

153
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,974
but then she had children.

154
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,712
If I can't keep taking the
drugs... I had to do this.

155
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,382
Home surgery tends to not
have the results you're hoping for.

156
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,689
You did a lot of damage, but
your testicles are unscathed.

157
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,557
Please, finish the job.

158
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,536
- I say we do it. He's a pedophile.
- No, he's not.

159
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,868
He just told us he was.

160
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,706
He has never acted on his urges,

161
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,576
and he's asking us to do
something to ensure he never does.

162
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,171
He is a decent person trying...

163
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,375
I'm confused. What do
you wanna do with him?

164
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,712
Treat him like a
patient with a diagnosis.

165
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,312
Put him on antidepressants,
refer him to a urologist,

166
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,482
give him a psych eval.

167
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,489
Let the experts determine if
he should have a castration.

168
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,188
Psych eval? Antidepressants?

169
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,423
When we refer people for counseling,
how often do they get cured?

170
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,430
I am looking to help
him manage this...

171
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,911
And if they don't get
cured, what happens?

172
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,871
They get more depressed,
can't cope, quit jobs,

173
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,031
maybe kill themselves.

174
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,541
All bad, but not
rape-a-child bad.

175
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,542
So, what are you going to do?

176
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,551
We can't ethically remove
healthy organs for crime prevention.

177
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,250
We don't amputate a kleptomaniac's
hands to prevent them from stealing.

178
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,621
Hands have many purposes. The
balls of a pedophile have but one.

179
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,623
Set up his referrals
and patch him up.

180
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,950
How long you been at Foothills?

181
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,243
Nine months.
Time flies in juvie.

182
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,548
Any visitors?

183
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,419
I don't have a granny
bringing me cookies,

184
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,646
if that's what you mean.

185
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,922
This is why empathy is bad.

186
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,960
You're talking to our
patient because you like him,

187
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,553
which is causing him to move,
which is affecting our imagery.

188
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,630
He's scared.

189
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,929
I'm talking to him to calm him
down, which is improving our imagery.

190
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,493
The fact that I like
him is beside the point.

191
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:18,799
You grow up in San Jose?

192
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,807
East Paly, but I got out
of there as soon as I could.

193
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,933
I was 15.

194
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,642
Your parents still there?

195
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:30,742
Mom's gone... Dear
old Dad is terrible.

196
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,276
- Siblings?
- A little brother. He's gone, too.

197
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,752
Crappy dad. Lost his brother...
I mean, you really don't have...

198
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,319
He's not scared.

199
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,627
He's short of breath because
his diaphragm is lacerated.

200
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,166
His stomach has
passed through that tear,

201
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,363
and is now in his chest.

202
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,838
Billy needs emergency
surgery on his diaphragm.

203
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,021
The defect reaches all
the way from the center,

204
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,207
to the anterior costal margin.

205
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,714
So, what do we need to do?

206
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,342
Divide the inferior pulmonary
ligament to bring the lung upwards.

207
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,181
Uh-huh. Mesh.

208
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,182
Whoever kicked him was
wearing some serious footwear.

209
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,437
And they'll be waiting for
him when he goes back,

210
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,485
unless we help him.

211
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,890
Dr. Park wants
to fix his forehead.

212
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,526
The Constitution guarantees prisoners
get the same care as everyone else.

213
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,801
Most non-prisoners can't
afford cosmetic surgery.

214
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,309
He would be getting better
care than everyone else.

215
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,709
The kid is smart and personable
and puts up a great front,

216
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,007
but he's scared to death.

217
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,648
And he got 36 months for selling weed,
a crime that doesn't even exist anymore.

218
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,528
You think his life would
be anything like this

219
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,632
if he didn't grow up with a
massive dent in his head?

220
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,648
Sorry. I'm not convinced.

221
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,828
Is that because you don't
have any empathy for Billy?

222
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,830
No. It's because I agree with you.
It's expensive, risky, and unnecessary.

223
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:59,668
But empathy can be an
invaluable motivator, Dr. Murphy,

224
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,402
that truly connects the
physician with their patient.

225
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,678
Is he still up there?

226
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,250
Yes, he is.

227
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,057
We can't do the
castration, George.

228
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,096
Not without the proper
psychiatric clearance.

229
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,759
- That will take forever.
- Just a few months.

230
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,392
A few months is forever.

231
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,266
Binge-watch your favorite
shows, catch up on your reading.

232
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,136
You attracted to
men, Dr. Reznick?

233
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,369
Yes. Adult men.

234
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,109
And if that were reprehensible,
do you think you could stop?

235
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:49,612
You have no idea what it's
like to live with these thoughts.

236
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,251
I hate them, and I hate
myself for having them,

237
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,958
but I can't stop them, and
I'm afraid of what I could do.

238
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,464
We will start the
process immediately.

239
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,934
In the meantime, we'll transfuse
you, get you on antibiotics.

240
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,477
No. I'm refusing treatment.

241
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:20,410
No transfusion, no antibiotics,
no repair. Let them rot.

242
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,288
We have something in common.

243
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,789
Neither of us has
a driver's license.

244
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,703
How do you feel about not
having a driver's license?

245
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,770
I'm pissed, Shaun.

246
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,535
- You feel pissed.
- Yes, I feel pissed.

247
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,976
I feel very pissed because
something important

248
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,480
was taken away from
me, and by a friend.

249
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,946
You feel very pissed
because something important

250
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,553
was taken away from
you, and by a friend.

251
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,954
And parroting everything
I say isn't helping.

252
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,221
I'm finding commonality,
Dr. Glassman.

253
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,660
I'm inquiring about
your emotional state,

254
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,995
and actively listening by
restating your responses.

255
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,833
External corroboration
enhances our sense of self-worth.

256
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,338
Okay. The day after I
got my driver's license,

257
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,809
you want to know what I did?

258
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,074
I went out and bought a
1963 Galaxie, midnight blue.

259
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,880
1,255 bucks. Every penny I
earned for the past three years

260
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,180
working in a gas station.

261
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,915
How do you think
that made me feel?

262
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,148
You liked it?

263
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,657
No, Shaun, I loved it.
You want to know why?

264
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,061
Because a car to a 16-year-old
kid means independence,

265
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,726
which means he can go wherever
he wants, whenever he wants.

266
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,499
And that doesn't
change with age, Shaun.

267
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,440
In fact, it means even more.

268
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,373
When you took my license,
that's what you took from me.

269
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,443
I don't expect you to understand,
so, you don't have to pretend.

270
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,727
Hey, is Andrews stalking you?

271
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,858
Yeah.

272
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,534
It's annoying. We need to stand
together and tell him to back off.

273
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,372
I'm not telling the
president he's annoying.

274
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,967
He's infringing on our autonomy
and inhibiting the free flow of ideas,

275
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,945
both of which affect our ability
to deliver the best patient care.

276
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:33,480
That sounds slightly
better. Okay, I'm in.

277
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,456
- Are you?
- No, of course not.

278
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,604
The last thing I'm gonna
do right now is confront him.

279
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,823
I'm the front-runner.

280
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,897
Not according to
Vegas. I'm three-to-two.

281
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,395
Guess they don't know that you
have double my mortality rate.

282
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,904
I'm a trauma surgeon. You're
comparing apples to asshats.

283
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,069
I resent being called an apple.

284
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,245
The diaphragm
repair went very well,

285
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,649
and we've scheduled
your orbital fracture repair.

286
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,071
And we'll get you some stronger
pain meds for the recovery.

287
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,285
When are you gonna fix my
forehead, make me all John Legend?

288
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,657
I tried, Billy. I'm sorry.

289
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,262
Wasn't really getting
my hopes up, anyway.

290
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,702
My dad taught me that. He'd say,

291
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,273
"You know what, Billy?" and
he'd just punch me in the face.

292
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,747
At least, I think that was the
lesson he was trying to impart.

293
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,369
That's what happened
to your forehead?

294
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,711
He was a big A's fan.

295
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,618
Watched every game
with a bat in his hand.

296
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:46,682
August 14th, 2008, they
lost in the twelfth inning...

297
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,141
Infection's setting in,

298
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,959
but his testicles still show
good flow on the Doppler.

299
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,007
Pain meds?

300
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,029
He won't take them. He
thinks they'll knock him out,

301
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,488
and we'll step in
and repair them.

302
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,717
I hate this.

303
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,848
Me, too.

304
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:32,001
I'm going to be a good driver.

305
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,940
I got every answer correct
on the written test, except one,

306
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,375
but that was because it
was improperly worded.

307
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,107
I told the DMV they
need to rewrite it,

308
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,115
and they said they'd
take it under advisement.

309
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,584
Great. Let's go.

310
00:19:55,728 --> 00:20:01,360
Okay, let's close our eyes, and
take some nice deep breaths.

311
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,531
And how about a
little guided imagery

312
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,203
to evoke positive
visualizations?

313
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,881
Okay.

314
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,812
Let's picture the parking
lot, the cars around us,

315
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:25,255
the yellow steel thingy at
the entrance of the parking lot

316
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,316
that could really
do a lot of damage...

317
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,426
A bollard.

318
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:35,231
The speed bump that is
15 feet from the corner,

319
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,637
with the stop sign
that someone put

320
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,175
a "Hate" sticker on,
so, it says "Stop Hate,"

321
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:46,075
which is right in front of the
Jiff-E Mart, which says it's open

322
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,671
"8:00 till late, 24/7,"
which can't be true...

323
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,978
That's great, Shaun. Super
amount of visualization.

324
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,646
And now, that we're feeling
comfortable about our surroundings,

325
00:20:55,755 --> 00:21:01,092
we can put the car into drive,
ease our foot off the brake.

326
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,260
Very nice. We can open
our eyes now, Shaun.

327
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,763
What we're doing is cruel.

328
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,102
I am open to all
options, Dr. Browne.

329
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,104
I'm gonna have to ask
you to give us some privacy.

330
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,215
Really? You want to throw
the president of the hospital

331
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,977
out of a medical discussion?

332
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,713
You're infringing on my autonomy
and inhibiting the free flow of ideas,

333
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,885
both of which affect my ability
to deliver the best patient care.

334
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,733
Dr. Melendez.

335
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:56,182
There are many drivers not
following the rules of the road.

336
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,917
They fail to signal,
check their blind spots...

337
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:07,022
Display a red flag when the load extends
more than four feet past the tail lamp.

338
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,485
You're right, Shaun.
It's a mad world,

339
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,202
but there's nothing
you can do about them.

340
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,663
You just gotta focus on you.

341
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,599
- Yes, let's focus on me.
- Yes.

342
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,897
Let's take the next right.

343
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,168
You can drive in the bike lane when
you're this close to the turn, Shaun.

344
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,611
No, I can't.

345
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,737
It's a broken line.

346
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,079
That was the improperly
worded question.

347
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,684
Whether it's broken or solid,
you can't enter the bike lane

348
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,191
this distance from the
intersection. I told them that...

349
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,755
Okay, Shaun, you
don't have to go so slow.

350
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,597
She's in the lane. She's not
supposed to be in the lane.

351
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,782
It's a violation
carrying a fine.

352
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,071
Okay, Shaun, don't worry
about what she's doing.

353
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,308
No.

354
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,087
Shaun, you have to
pull into the bike lane.

355
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,471
Don't worry about
what she's doing.

356
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,814
You can't just stop.
Shaun, you can't just stop.

357
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,085
Shaun.

358
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,217
George is screaming in agony,

359
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,429
and we are doing nothing except
hiding behind ethical red tape.

360
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,723
Ethical red tape is there
to protect people like him

361
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,891
from making permanent,
regrettable mistakes.

362
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,429
I'm glad we're not using
it to cover our asses

363
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,582
the day before the new
Chief of Surgery is announced.

364
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,138
Let me sign off on
the documentation.

365
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:36,312
I'll note his scrotum is
already beyond repair,

366
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,748
and surgical castration
is our only option.

367
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,785
I vote yes.

368
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,687
No. I'm not gonna let
anyone falsify medical records.

369
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,348
Not for pain, not
for a pedophile.

370
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,960
Once his testes are
actually beyond repair,

371
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,826
we will castrate him.

372
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,341
So, we're just gonna
leave him there screaming,

373
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,095
keeping his entire unit awake?

374
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,436
Move him.

375
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,545
I'd like a clean dissection
through the periosteal plane,

376
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,116
so, I can slip the MEDPOR
mesh over the fracture.

377
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,213
And why do I prefer MEDPOR mesh?

378
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,488
It allows fibrovascular ingrowth
and integration of the patient's tissue.

379
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,493
Prisoner surgeries are approved
for psychological reasons all the time.

380
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,999
Tattoo removal, gender
reassignments, including breast implants.

381
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,511
Hell, if he had a crappy smile,
we could justify dental work

382
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,367
as needed for
proper mastication.

383
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:35,070
You send a few kids to juvie?

384
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,008
More than a few.

385
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:43,380
You feel guilty. Think that's
maybe clouding your judgment?

386
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,506
Maybe.

387
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,854
You're afraid of ruffling Andrews'
feathers this close to decision day.

388
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,551
Think that's maybe
clouding yours?

389
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,221
We could give Billy
a breast implant.

390
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:03,568
We could insert it over his split
thickness frontal bone defect.

391
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,729
It would only require a
tiny incision at his eyebrow.

392
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,271
Now, you're in favor of this?

393
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,706
I was against it because it was too
expensive, and unnecessary and risky,

394
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,772
but if we do it now, it won't
require any additional surgery,

395
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,578
and it'd be very economical.

396
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,515
He did give us verbal consent
when he was first admitted.

397
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,258
Keep him under.

398
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,124
Get what we need, Dr. Murphy.

399
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,900
Ready or not...

400
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,273
Tell Melendez to
meet us in the OR.

401
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,944
Showing signs of ischemia.

402
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,922
We have a strong
medical case for removing.

403
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,493
Dr. Lim, you a castration fan?

404
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,459
Right now I am. Andrews
told me he's backing off.

405
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,921
Great.

406
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,809
Because you presented him
with a very good argument,

407
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,064
my argument, which
you regurgitated to him

408
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,263
right after you said you
wouldn't back me up.

409
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,465
- Call that leadership?
- Yes, I do.

410
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,565
You presented me with
a very good argument,

411
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,122
but you didn't have the guts to
take it to Andrews on your own.

412
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,507
One more reason I don't
want to work under you.

413
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,259
You don't want this promotion, so
that you can improve the hospital.

414
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,560
You want it for
the pretty title.

415
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,950
You're an adrenaline junkie.

416
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,099
You won't last two weeks
liaising with board members.

417
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,919
There's a long and dusty trail

418
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,755
littered with people who
have underestimated me.

419
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,089
We're ready to go.

420
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,998
Curved tissue scissors, please.

421
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,603
His systolic is 68,
and look at this.

422
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,202
He's septic.

423
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,640
He's going into DIC.

424
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,705
Rerun his labs. Have
platelets, plasma and cryo ready.

425
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,608
If he starts
bleeding, he'll die.

426
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,855
I reduced the volume
from 80 cc to 35.

427
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,965
Have the odds changed
in the last 24 hours?

428
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,402
- A little.
- Where am I at?

429
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,641
Six-to-one.

430
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,970
Put 100 on me.

431
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,150
He's becoming
severely bradycardic.

432
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,049
The pressure on his orbit
caused a retrobulbar hematoma.

433
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,615
We don't relieve it now, he'll
arrest. Forceps and scissors.

434
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,318
I just lost his pulse.
Pushing atropine.

435
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,520
Set up a temporary
transcutaneous pacemaker.

436
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,673
If we inject the orbital
muscle with local anesthetic,

437
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,841
we might be able
to fatigue the reflex.

438
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,889
Do it.

439
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,260
Starting CPR.

440
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,834
I hope that's a look of resolve.

441
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,945
Melendez stood up to
me in front of his residents.

442
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,779
I did the same thing to
O'Connell when I was his age.

443
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:07,909
What about Lim?

444
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:12,290
She has the kind of focus
it took me years to develop.

445
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:15,725
And Cooperberg, he reminds
me of me when I was...

446
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,457
Marcus, you were good,

447
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,726
but no one's gonna be as
good as you think you were.

448
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,396
One of your weaknesses
was decision-making.

449
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,800
I trust you've gotten past that
since I made you president.

450
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,891
Continuing compressions

451
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,077
until I have capture
on the pacemaker.

452
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,450
Pacing pads are in position.

453
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,818
Stopping CPR.

454
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,223
Injecting lidocaine.

455
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,955
I have set the rate to 80.

456
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,789
Increase the ventricular
by two milliamps.

457
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,467
Increase by two more.

458
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:17,783
Blood pressure is
responding. 102 over 68.

459
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,826
Keep those pacer settings, and
let's get back to the main event.

460
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,757
Both his PT and PTT
are coming back down.

461
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,531
His systolic is stable at 110,
and no ectopy on the monitor.

462
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:35,365
His DIC score is back
under four. He's stabilized.

463
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,967
Ball's in your court.

464
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,538
Dr. Melendez?

465
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,450
Effects of low testosterone on
cardiovascular function and sepsis?

466
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,685
Possible acute vascular
response, circulatory collapse.

467
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,123
And what about on DIC?

468
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,024
Increased risk of
clots and stroke.

469
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,167
George's body can't tolerate
any loss of testosterone right now.

470
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:06,899
If we want to save his life,
we have to save his testicles.

471
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,341
Sutures.

472
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,176
I know how to get you to drive.

473
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,881
I can't drive.

474
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,350
Driving is just like surgery.

475
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,526
Say you're driving
down the street,

476
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:31,324
and suddenly, somebody steps
off the sidewalk right in front of you.

477
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,557
Things like that must happen when
you're deep inside someone's belly.

478
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,734
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It's an analogy, Shaun.

479
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,534
I need you to work with
me just a little bit. Gimme.

480
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,234
Okay.

481
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:56,351
It would be something
unexpected, out of our control,

482
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,358
from an aberrant
source, and very bad.

483
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,884
It would be analogous
to an arterial bleed.

484
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,789
How about if a truck
stalls out, crippling traffic?

485
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,970
A thrombus impeding
blood flow, so we divert.

486
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,071
A thrombus, exactly.

487
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,870
What if you're
just cruising along,

488
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:20,106
and a car comes out of
nowhere and goes racing by?

489
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,712
A tachyarrhythmia.

490
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,806
Yes, Shaun, you got this!

491
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,145
- Yes.
- So, let's get you driving that hooptie.

492
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,285
I've got this, Albert.

493
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,470
We did the surgery.

494
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,475
Your circulatory and clotting
systems were shutting down.

495
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,636
But removing your testicles

496
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,271
would have put you at
greater risk by reducing your...

497
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,839
You would have died.

498
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:06,288
I've set you up with a
psychiatrist and a urologist.

499
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:10,819
They'll screen you, get you cleared,
and then we can do this the right way.

500
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:17,694
George, we can get this done.
You just cannot try this again.

501
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,603
I get it. I do it your way,
or it just doesn't happen.

502
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,464
It's just another
intersection, Shaun,

503
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,723
just like the last one,
and just like the next one.

504
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,567
The last intersection
isn't where everyone

505
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,036
honked at me and made me freeze.

506
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:57,040
That was a different
day, with different drivers,

507
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,203
and a different Shaun behind
the wheel, because today,

508
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,215
this Shaun has a plan for
this intersection, which is...

509
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,010
I am going to dissect it.

510
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,315
Damn right you are.

511
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,414
And today, you're gonna turn
right, which you will do by...

512
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,651
Determining laterality,

513
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,560
and waiting until I can
legally enter the bike lane.

514
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,276
Somebody just made a turn.

515
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,551
Shaun!

516
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,617
Everybody okay?

517
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,226
You were wrong.

518
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,699
You were wrong,
Lea. I can't drive.

519
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,802
- Shaun, I thought I had it figured out.
- I can't drive.

520
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,766
Surgery is mechanical.
Mechanics are predictable.

521
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,102
Driving is subject
to human foibles,

522
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,374
which means there
are limitless possibilities.

523
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,885
- You're right. My metaphor sucked.
- It sucked very much.

524
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:19,949
Because becoming a surgeon is
about way more than operating.

525
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,953
You had to learn about
interacting with teachers,

526
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,930
co-workers, patients, bosses.

527
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,993
Cooperating with them,
communicating with them...

528
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,799
I am very bad at communicating.

529
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,669
Shaun, you became a surgeon,

530
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:41,013
one of the hardest
things that anyone can do.

531
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,775
And you proved that just
because something is hard,

532
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,316
doesn't mean you can't do it.

533
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,608
And look what you just did.

534
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,448
I just hit a trash can.

535
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:54,456
Exactly. A trash can instead of
an oncoming car or a pedestrian.

536
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,960
You did great, Shaun.

537
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:07,030
That soccer ball was a
dropped Metzenbaum.

538
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,499
I know, right?

539
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,677
When I accidentally drop
an instrument in the OR,

540
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,017
I react quickly to
minimize damage.

541
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,786
- Yes. I dropped a Metzenbaum.
- Yes.

542
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,827
I can drive this hooptie.

543
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,873
Window's about to close.

544
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,736
Ten will get you 20 on Melendez.

545
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,142
Ten will get you 1,000
if you want to bet on me.

546
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,543
Hey, everybody.

547
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,182
I can't be prouder
of all of you.

548
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,821
We have grown into a
preeminent surgical department,

549
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,751
which has been recognized

550
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,918
with the official designation of
Surgical Center of Excellence.

551
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:09,523
It's now more important than ever
that we maintain our high standards,

552
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,832
and so, while there are
many worthy candidates,

553
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,769
I have decided

554
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,576
to retain the title
myself. Thank you.

555
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,213
Thank you.

556
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,844
- Hey.
- Yes!

557
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,376
You did it. You really did it.

558
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:59,323
It was his idea.

559
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,619
Murph, you...

560
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,385
We inserted a small breast
implant to fill in the depression

561
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,327
and create a more
aesthetically pleasing contour.

562
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,394
- Breast implant?
- Yes.

563
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,727
You saved my life.

564
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,641
It was a mistake.

565
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,976
It caused an oculocardiac
reflex, and you almost died.

566
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,510
It was a mistake.

567
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,527
George?

568
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,663
George?

569
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,500
Why didn't his
monitor alarm go off?

570
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,016
He was stable. I disconnected
it, so he could use the restroom.

571
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,941
- I didn't...
- Morgan, he's gone!

572
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
George!

573
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,826
I was never gonna
confront Andrews.

574
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,228
I was playing you.

575
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,766
But damn if you didn't
actually make it work.

576
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,734
It didn't work for anybody.

577
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,169
He played us both. He
set us against each other.

578
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,675
I think you were right,

579
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,205
even if you were just bluffing.

580
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,246
We need to stand together.

581
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,183
Where was that
wisdom two days ago?

582
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,022
Still in the bottle.

583
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,045
Hey, how'd you come
up with that idea?

584
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,971
You mentioned breast
implants and I thought...

585
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,096
Of his forehead.

586
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,574
We were operating on his
eye. His forehead was covered.

587
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,043
Why were you thinking of it?

588
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,272
You care about him.

589
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,413
You were worried about his
problem. You empathized with him.

590
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,887
- My idea almost killed him.
- No, it didn't.

591
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,226
I found these in Billy's drawer.
Three days of pain meds.

592
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,058
He was cheeking
them to build up a stash.

593
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,401
He wasn't exaggerating.

594
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,902
You saved his life, Shaun.

595
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:46,842
This isn't the way this
should have ended.

596
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,284
But I'm not so sure the
world is a worse place

597
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,048
than it was a
couple of hours ago.

598
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,809
You almost look
comfortable behind the wheel.

599
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:13,237
This seat has excellent lumbar
support, but I am still very nervous.

600
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,477
- I can drive a car.
- I can see that.

601
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,484
Lea taught me using
a very bad analogy.

602
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,315
Nothing works
like a bad analogy.

603
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,359
He's getting pretty good.

604
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,553
Won't be long before
he gets his operator's.

605
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,325
Your next radiation
appointment is in 45 minutes.

606
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,343
Ow.

607
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,715
Thank you.

608
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,574
<i>I'd go the whole wide world</i>

609
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:14,964
<i>I'd go the whole wide world...</i>

610
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,261
Whoo!

611
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,097
<i>Just to find her</i>

612
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,034
<i>I'd go the whole wide world</i>

613
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,902
<i>I'd go the whole wide world</i>

614
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,101
<i>To find out where
they hide her...</i>
