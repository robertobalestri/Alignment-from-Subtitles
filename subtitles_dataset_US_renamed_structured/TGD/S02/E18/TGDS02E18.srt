1
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,575
Why are you sad?

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,043
I'm not sad.

3
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,175
Is there another reason to get
drunk at 10:00 in the morning?

4
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,547
Shut up.

5
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,995
It's fun to drink with
someone who is fun.

6
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,895
Lea is fun. You're not fun.

7
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,735
Shut up.

8
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,642
No.

9
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:57,816
If I have something
to say, I will say it.

10
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,060
Well, if I have someone to
shut up, then I'll shut them up.

11
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,360
If I have something to...

12
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,098
Okay, I do not
like to be touched.

13
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,837
Just shut up.

14
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,047
I am a surgeon...

15
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,074
You've had sex with each other?

16
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,445
Yes.

17
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,420
And you're planning
on doing so again?

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,652
- Yes.
- Good news.

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,018
Because neither of you

20
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,289
are in a subservient
position to the other...

21
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,264
Well, sometimes.

22
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,297
You work together and
you're sleeping together.

23
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,032
You don't see any
way that can go wrong?

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,334
Nothing for your
employer to worry about?

25
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,170
I'm going to interview
each of you separately

26
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,112
to ensure that the
relationship is consensual.

27
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,144
Zack Cordell, 31,
loss of consciousness,

28
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,730
laceration with a closed head
injury, possible brain contusion.

29
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:34,778
GCS score?

30
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,347
Nine. Dr. Murphy thinks it
might be an epidural hematoma.

31
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,481
Dr. Murphy?

32
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,494
Yeah, he's with...
Where'd he go?

33
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,125
Shaun?

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,658
Come in. Tell us what
you saw, what you did.

35
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,101
I can't.

36
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,335
I'm not a doctor here.

37
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,367
You're still a doctor, Shaun.

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,015
We need to know what happened.

39
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,246
I found him like that.

40
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,627
I want a stat head CT. Get
me a CBC and a tox screen.

41
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,329
It might be an
epidural hematoma.

42
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,491
We heard.

43
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,865
- Let's get a bolt ICP monitor ready.
- I'm on it.

44
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,767
Dr. Lim, how was your meeting?

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,339
I confirmed the lack of
inducement or pressure.

46
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,034
I assume you did likewise?

47
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,901
We are approved.

48
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,678
For what?

49
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,650
<i>At last</i>

50
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,684
<i>My love has come along</i>

51
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:56,163
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

52
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,638
<i>And life...</i>

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,585
I farted, I peed, I pooped.

54
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,784
Everything's working as
well as I can possibly hope.

55
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,795
We just need to know there are
no post-surgical complications.

56
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,823
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

57
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,126
I'm not married.

58
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,135
Well, gays can get married.

59
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,104
They have children. You
need to have children.

60
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,549
I'll tell you what's
more interesting

61
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,303
than a non-married
woman not wearing a ring.

62
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,106
Dr. Park here wears a wedding
ring even though he's not married.

63
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,915
I'm divorced, but
we're trying to reconcile.

64
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,819
Well, good for you. Kids?

65
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,823
A son. BP looks good.

66
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,792
How often do you see
them? Dinners, I hope.

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,227
I mean, dinners
are really important.

68
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,320
They live in Phoenix.

69
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,832
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

70
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,496
JP drain site looks good
with no bilious output.

71
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,111
Do you have any other symptoms?

72
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,506
I've got a bit of a stomach ache

73
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,976
because of those
nasty veggie slushies

74
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,105
Dr. Mitzger has me on.

75
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,911
Does this look inflamed?

76
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,175
I don't think she's ready to go.

77
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,810
What? Why not?

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,684
We need to order an
abdominal ultrasound.

79
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,314
Make sure you don't have a
deep post-surgical abscess.

80
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,092
Hopefully, just one
more day with us, Ida.

81
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,758
I am concerned about how
you dealt with Dr. Murphy.

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,326
Have you known
anyone else with ASD?

83
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,404
Not well. Have you?

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,332
When you give people
responsibility they can't handle,

85
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,469
the results can be devastating.

86
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,844
Well, every time Dr. Murphy's
been given responsibility,

87
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:48,948
he's risen to the...

88
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,813
He's never been
given responsibility.

89
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,884
He's been given things to do,

90
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,251
but always with
someone right behind him.

91
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,048
I'm the first one to
really challenge him.

92
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,720
And he failed.

93
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,056
Are you okay?

94
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,501
Yes.

95
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,879
When something bad
happens, we have to remember

96
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,682
we're not defined
by any one thing.

97
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,783
You're not just a doctor, Shaun.

98
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,860
You're a good
friend, a good person.

99
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,726
There are so many
things you can do.

100
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,301
What do you want?

101
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,876
I want to be a surgeon.

102
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,280
What else?

103
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,649
What else do you want?

104
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,520
I want what everybody wants.

105
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,085
I want...

106
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,693
I want my life to matter.

107
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,927
I wanna have fun. I...

108
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,666
I wanna fall in love.

109
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,475
I think I'd be a good father.

110
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,124
I think you will be, too.

111
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,932
But I don't know
how to fall in love.

112
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,140
- Good morning, Claire.
- Good morning.

113
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,373
Here are some chocolates.

114
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,017
They're not really chocolates.

115
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:20,026
Here is a stapler which
represents flowers.

116
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,100
Thank you. These
flowers are beautiful.

117
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,969
You have nice hair.

118
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,877
Thank you, Shaun.
I like your shirt.

119
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,705
It's old.

120
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,822
I was wondering
if you would like

121
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,118
to...

122
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,362
Say the words.

123
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,499
There could be other people
there. That would be distracting,

124
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,447
there could be noises
that would be distracting.

125
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,528
She could misunderstand
my question.

126
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,318
- You can't let that...
- She could say no.

127
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,849
Shaun, come here.

128
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,756
She will.

129
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,827
You don't know.

130
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,854
Someone will.

131
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,293
Shaun, you're
gonna fall in love,

132
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,903
and you're gonna
have your heart broken.

133
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,505
And you're gonna
fall in love again.

134
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,700
And you're gonna
lose your job again.

135
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,937
- No.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,276
This is life, you know that.

137
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,283
You've been hurt,
and you've survived.

138
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,820
You've gotten stronger, better.

139
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,088
Not better.

140
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,126
It's not better.

141
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,632
Zack's tests are ready.

142
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,768
Large iced, extra shot?

143
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:15,440
Oh, no, no extra shot for me.
Today, I'm already kind of up.

144
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,645
Having a good day?

145
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,879
Uh... Yeah, a real doozy.

146
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,787
As of today, I'm
officially cancer-free.

147
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,882
- That's fantastic.
- Thank you.

148
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,951
I'm so happy for you.

149
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:32,866
You just got
yourself a free coffee.

150
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,198
Thank you. I got
you something, too.

151
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,330
A Model J.

152
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,933
Just like the one that
we never got to see

153
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,036
at that car show
we never made it to.

154
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,948
Wow.

155
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,951
Put up the hood,
check out the engine.

156
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,509
Oh, okay.

157
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,886
You're right, we're
too old to just have fun.

158
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,429
I wanna commit.

159
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,129
"Commit"?

160
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,033
I meant commit
to a relationship,

161
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,127
not to, like, pledging our

162
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,133
never-ending love before God.

163
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,301
In sickness and in health,
that's what you wanted.

164
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,811
I have just been through
the seven levels of hell.

165
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,747
I am ready to
embrace life, to be bold.

166
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,619
This is definitely bold.

167
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,685
It's also... It's also stupid.

168
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,702
I made it a part of
our wedding vows.

169
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,209
Marty and I pledged

170
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,338
we would never be apart for
more than five days at a time.

171
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,909
And we never were, until
he died two years ago.

172
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,720
I made my daughter
put it in her vows.

173
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,916
Junie lives in Napa.

174
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,024
Three children,
two boys and a girl.

175
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,161
You're still young.

176
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,858
You should give your
son a brother and sister.

177
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,963
Everything looks great.

178
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,560
I think we can send you home.

179
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,539
Good. Junie's driving in
with her youngest. Oh...

180
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,376
I can't feel my fingers.

181
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,875
Other than the
contusions, no hematoma.

182
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,378
I wish you were back in path.

183
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,391
I don't wish I was back in path.

184
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:45,089
CBC is normal, tox
screen is basically clear.

185
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,633
No drugs, trace
amounts of alcohol.

186
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,466
Maybe he tripped
and hit his head.

187
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,736
No. His gait was erratic,
and so was his behavior,

188
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,800
both highly suggestive
of intoxication.

189
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,742
I thought you found
him unconscious.

190
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,146
What happened?

191
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,557
Did he do something to
you? Say something to you?

192
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:20,493
Shaun, you never lie. Why
would you lie about this?

193
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,238
If Zack wasn't intoxicated,
then he has a neurological issue.

194
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,642
You need to run an
EEG and a CT angiogram.

195
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,770
I have to go.

196
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
It could be Guillain-Barré,
maybe peripheral neuropathy.

197
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,320
I think we should perform an
EMG and a nerve conduction study.

198
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,361
- And what do you wanna do?
- Send her home.

199
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,153
I think she's making it up.

200
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,995
Her symptoms are very mild,
very typical post-op reactions,

201
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,544
except the one that
suddenly appeared

202
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,833
as soon as we told
her she could go home.

203
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,305
She's just lonely,
looking for attention.

204
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,932
She can be lonely and sick.

205
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,034
According to the
MRI, she's just lonely.

206
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,338
It's no fun releasing a patient,

207
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,541
only to find them in the
morgue 24 hours later.

208
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,140
Re-check her history,

209
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,686
run whatever tests you need,
rule out everything you can.

210
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,813
Thank you. And congratulations.

211
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,357
You and Dr. Lim. It's
an excellent match.

212
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,615
I have a sample
I'd like you to test.

213
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,253
Shaun, you don't work here
anymore. How do you have a patient?

214
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,351
It's Claire's patient.

215
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,468
There's no patient name on it.

216
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,971
What are this
patient's symptoms?

217
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,481
He's coughing blood.

218
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,121
I'll expedite the test.

219
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,230
We'll get the data analyzed by a
neurologist as soon as possible.

220
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,536
And when it comes back okay,

221
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,607
we could have you discharged
by the end of the day.

222
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,507
You said, "when."

223
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,481
You think I'm making this
up? Wasting your time?

224
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,450
- No, I don't...
- Yes. I do.

225
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,151
- You're right.
- You're faking?

226
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,595
No. Not entirely.

227
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,200
I can feel my fingers,
but they're tingling.

228
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,329
Because you're 87, Ida. These
are just symptoms of old age.

229
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,303
Junie had leukemia.

230
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,944
Months of chemo, and she
just got sicker and weaker.

231
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,583
Three days before
her ninth birthday,

232
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:34,320
two oncologists said there
was nothing more they could do.

233
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,865
Told us that she would never
make it through the night.

234
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,832
They said it was pointless.

235
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,169
"Oh, and it's so cruel..."

236
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,180
But it wasn't their
little girl who was dying.

237
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,546
The next morning...

238
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,722
Junie was still alive.

239
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,663
And the morning after that,
she opened her eyes, and...

240
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,635
All the people said,
"Oh, it's a miracle!"

241
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,640
But it wasn't a miracle.

242
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,307
Junie is alive with
three beautiful children

243
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,183
only because I refused to let
those doctors tell me what to do.

244
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,756
And now that I'm old,

245
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,392
they give me even less credit.

246
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,569
We'll let you know
the test results.

247
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,613
WBC and PT are elevated,
and hemoglobins are a little low.

248
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,422
It could be pneumonia, DIC...

249
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,516
It's trauma-induced,
so more likely...

250
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,617
Trauma?

251
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,733
Then coagulopathy is
possible, making bleeding worse.

252
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:32,971
You need to get the patient on
phytonadione as soon as possible.

253
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,913
I'm writing a script.

254
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,389
You'll tell your patient
how important this is, right?

255
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,234
Good news, Ida.

256
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,070
Normal electrical
activity at rest,

257
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,167
normal action potentials
with contraction.

258
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,838
Thank you. I'm sorry I
wasted your time here.

259
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,524
You don't have to
listen to your doctors,

260
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,108
but you do have to
be honest with them.

261
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,986
Park, bile.

262
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,300
They're treating you
for rhabdomyolysis.

263
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,199
That makes sense.

264
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,277
- Why are you here?
- I am a doctor.

265
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,881
Why are you sad?

266
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,716
I'm sad and angry and...

267
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,218
Confused, and I don't know.

268
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,363
I wasn't supposed
to be at the bar.

269
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:07,634
I was supposed to
be at a job interview.

270
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:14,209
Dr. Glassman got me a job
interview, but I don't want a new job.

271
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,250
And people tell me
that I have to move on,

272
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,284
but why can't I just be sad?

273
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,412
And angry and...

274
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,741
It's not rhabdo.

275
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,747
You need immediate treatment.

276
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,009
What?

277
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,209
Wait, for what?

278
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,687
For what? For what?

279
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,922
Trampoline...

280
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:01,893
Hey.

281
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,224
Dr. Murphy?

282
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,931
I need help in here!

283
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,737
Left hemothorax and
grade-two splenic laceration

284
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,301
resulting from a rib fracture.

285
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,004
Inserted a chest tube

286
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,480
to reduce the blood
pooling in the pleural cavity.

287
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,647
Any idea what caused the trauma?

288
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,783
Zack Cordell beat him up.

289
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,415
The patient he brought
in? Shaun told you?

290
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,981
Not explicitly, but...

291
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,528
He was acting strange
from the minute they came in.

292
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,626
Well, Shaun acting
strange isn't strange.

293
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,300
Excuse me.

294
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,845
Dr. Murphy saved
another person today.

295
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:58,082
Encountering an emergency
is not a job qualification.

296
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,196
And how can you trust a doctor
who doesn't have the sense

297
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,553
to tell someone he was
injured before passing out?

298
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,591
It's no longer a
request, Jackson.

299
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,257
Am I only allowed to do my
job when you agree with me?

300
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,627
You knew someone on the
spectrum. What happened to them?

301
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,525
They died.

302
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,129
But if either of us
are making decisions

303
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,435
based on our personal experiences,
we're making the wrong decisions.

304
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,372
You paid a lot of
money for my judgment.

305
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,867
Too much, I'm starting to think.

306
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,445
Well, that was the point.

307
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,980
I didn't need the money, I
needed the commitment.

308
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,810
You went out on a limb for me.

309
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,888
You fire me now, you look
like a fool in front of the board.

310
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,963
It's not the clips. Ida needs
to be opened up again.

311
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:50,993
That's too bad.

312
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,617
But there's one
other test I'd like to try.

313
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:00,413
I'm starting to feel
some pain in my left side.

314
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:04,176
It's important for a doctor
to use all their senses.

315
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,187
Tastes like a bit of kale,
seven delicious vegetables.

316
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,097
Good news is you don't have a
potentially fatal bile duct issue.

317
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:26,366
Bad news is we know you've
been dumping your veggie slushie

318
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,737
into your drain to make
us think you were sick.

319
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,710
You'll be discharged
this afternoon.

320
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,595
- You asked to see me?
- Yeah, for the last two hours.

321
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,603
I'm sorry, I've been
dealing with Dr. Murphy.

322
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,231
Seems someone beat
him up, quite severely.

323
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,585
Yeah, that shouldn't
have happened.

324
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,204
But before he passed out, he said
he knew what was wrong with me.

325
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,789
Well, we all know
what's wrong with you.

326
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,645
You're an ass with a
head trauma and rhabdo.

327
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,909
No, he said you're wrong.

328
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,749
He kind of spaced
out, all distracted,

329
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,584
and then he said that I don't
have that, and that I need treatment.

330
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,088
Distracted, how?

331
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,258
Like, he was looking around,

332
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,456
trying to find something
in the air, I don't know.

333
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,361
And then it looked
like he found it.

334
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,934
What exactly did he say?

335
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,830
"Trampoline"? And?

336
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,939
That's it.

337
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:36,774
You know Shaun,

338
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,653
it could be a reference to
something he read somewhere.

339
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,307
It could be a metaphor.
Could be the guy misheard.

340
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,746
It could be delirium.

341
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,944
Shaun had a systolic
pressure of 70.

342
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:50,217
He may have been hallucinating.
He may have just been wrong.

343
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,470
He's hypotensive.
O2 sats are dropping.

344
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,894
- He's crashing.
- Bag him.

345
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,129
Bolus five units of
vasopressin and start a drip.

346
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,740
"Trampoline" from the Spanish word
<i>"trampolino,"</i> meaning springboard,

347
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,941
from the Italian root
<i>"trampoli,"</i> meaning stilts.

348
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,349
Maybe Shaun was talking about

349
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,683
an excessive growth
disorder like acromegaly.

350
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,665
But instead of just saying
the name of the disorder,

351
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,799
he used the English translation

352
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,190
of the Spanish
derivative of the Italian?

353
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,296
Maybe we should
just wake him up.

354
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,161
His respiratory
status is too fragile.

355
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,202
We have a very sick patient.
If Shaun can save his life...

356
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,894
We have two very sick patients.

357
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,301
And if there's a 1% chance

358
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,170
that waking Shaun will risk
his life, I say we don't do it.

359
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,741
We shouldn't need Shaun.

360
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,439
We can figure
this out ourselves.

361
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,572
What do we know?

362
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,551
Low BP, nausea and dizziness,
erratic gait and behavior.

363
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,018
Adrenal insufficiency could
explain his gait and BP.

364
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,493
We'd be seeing
hyperpigmentation. Botulism?

365
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,156
There'd be descending paralysis.
If anything, he has ascending.

366
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,694
Lyme disease?

367
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,095
Explains fatigue and dizziness,

368
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,833
and, if advanced,
impaired muscle movement.

369
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,001
And an arrhythmia
could be lowering his BP.

370
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:23,443
But none of this
sounds like "trampoline."

371
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,921
Let's get him started on
100 milligrams of doxycycline.

372
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,275
- Do you need...
- Shh!

373
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,077
Sorry. Sorry.

374
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,414
You were on duty when
Dr. Murphy passed out, right?

375
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,618
I was first one in.

376
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,285
Is this where he was standing?

377
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,122
I think he was
closer to the patient.

378
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,829
Hmm...

379
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,265
What about the blinds?
Were they like that?

380
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,235
Please, I need to know
what Shaun's experience was

381
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,606
when he was standing here.

382
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,023
Also, could I get a step stool?

383
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,288
- Sure.
- Thanks.

384
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,197
Why can't you get
him his job back?

385
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,773
I mean, you were the president
for, like, a hundred years.

386
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,500
I'm gonna fight for him,
but I'm only one vote.

387
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,873
We all get smacked around.
We gotta learn to take the hits.

388
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,043
Lick our wounds and move on.

389
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,019
He likes you, you know.

390
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,061
Yeah, I like him, too.

391
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,527
He likes you more.

392
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,725
When he gets rejected,

393
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,269
I'm glad it's coming from
somebody who cares about him.

394
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,126
We need an OR stat!

395
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:06,703
Hey, Shaun.

396
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,232
It's me, Auntie Em.

397
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,011
What are you doing in my room?

398
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,014
No, Shaun, we're
in the hospital.

399
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,315
You were pretty bad
earlier, but now you're...

400
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,947
Zack. Zack has
the wrong diagnosis.

401
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,500
- No, no, no. Shaun, I know.
- No, no...

402
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,724
It's fine. It's actually fine.

403
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,590
He'll die unless he's
treated immediately.

404
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,458
- No, he needs...
- "Trampoline."

405
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:37,869
Zack had an aortic arch aneurysm
with signs of impending rupture,

406
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,098
the evidence of which was
a pulsatile mass in his neck.

407
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,438
That and his erratic
gait and behavior

408
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,943
are explained by the fact
that he had tertiary syphilis,

409
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,604
also known as...

410
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,675
Treponema.

411
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,114
Zack misheard you.

412
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,311
But we were able to repair the
aneurysm, and he is stable now.

413
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,181
Okay.

414
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:00,891
Okay.

415
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,693
All right.

416
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,628
Lie down, Dorothy, and
get some rest, all right?

417
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,069
We finally got her history.

418
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,769
Those doctors who said Junie
wouldn't survive the night...

419
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,074
They were right.

420
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,774
Three days before her
ninth birthday, Junie died.

421
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,848
Ida never had any grandchildren.

422
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,474
What about her husband?

423
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,347
He did pass away two years ago,

424
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,219
but he and Ida separated
after their daughter's death.

425
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,459
It doesn't change
anything medically.

426
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,046
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:14,424
You know what $300,000
can get you in Tempe?

428
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,603
How are you doing?

429
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,047
I have an O2 sat of 97%

430
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,986
and urine output of 200 CCs
an hour, so I'm doing well.

431
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,185
I just got off the phone with
Dr. Turner at San Jose General.

432
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,564
You missed a job interview.

433
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,930
I like being a surgeon here.

434
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,566
But you're not anymore.

435
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,342
And we can't change that.

436
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,312
Shaun, both of us...

437
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,488
We need to face reality.

438
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,536
My brother Steve said

439
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:28,004
that whenever people
want you to do something

440
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:31,532
they think is wrong,
they say it's "reality."

441
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,787
Yesterday, Dr. Shaun Murphy
did something that was different.

442
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,589
And it wasn't because
he showed mercy

443
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,892
to someone who had been
cruel and violent to him,

444
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,591
although that's extraordinary.

445
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,065
What was different
is that yesterday,

446
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,298
Dr. Shaun Murphy made
Dr. Claire Browne a better doctor.

447
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,969
Why? Because Dr. Claire
Browne looked at a problem

448
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,241
through Dr. Murphy's
eyes, and she saved a life.

449
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,544
And that's extraordinary.

450
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,917
Dr. Han,

451
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,220
Dr. Murphy may not
communicate like you do,

452
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,918
he may not
communicate like I do.

453
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,087
But make no mistake,
he does communicate.

454
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,524
And he inspires.

455
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,767
Well, welcome back to
the board, Dr. Glassman.

456
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:36,898
I've heard of your insights and
passion, and I'm grateful to witness it.

457
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,040
Thank you.

458
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,877
But I didn't fire Dr. Murphy
because he doesn't inspire.

459
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:48,284
I fired him because he was
irrational, unprofessional.

460
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,050
He couldn't calm down.
He couldn't control himself.

461
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,451
I stand by that decision.

462
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,225
And if Dr. Glassman insists
on putting this to a vote,

463
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,893
the issue isn't whether
Dr. Murphy should be working here.

464
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,804
The issue is whether I should.

465
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,404
Whether I control my staff.

466
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,277
Because I can't
work here if I don't.

467
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,585
Okay.

468
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,757
I don't think there's anything
else on the agenda, so...

469
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,156
Steve was right.

470
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,826
And Dr. Glassman is right.

471
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,091
You're gonna propose his motion?

472
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,967
Dr. Andrews, I don't think
you have the votes to carry it.

473
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:44,305
I agree. But I don't
need the votes.

474
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,842
Just as you have the power

475
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,439
to fire someone under
your supervision, so do I.

476
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,509
You're gonna fire me
to save Dr. Murphy?

477
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,484
He's not ready to move on.

478
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,124
Neither am I.

479
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,069
Did you hear about Han?

480
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,337
Can't imagine Andrews
will survive the fallout.

481
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,243
They're gonna need
a new chief of surgery.

482
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,641
What if either of us
is offered the job?

483
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,512
One of us bossing the other around?
I don't think that would fly with HR.

484
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,456
Someone would have to
resign or we'd have to break up.

485
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,021
Or we could turn it down.

486
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,299
I think things are great.

487
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,235
And they've been great
for, what, four weeks now?

488
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,833
Just over a month.

489
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,537
It'd be crazy to pass on a chance
at being a department head.

490
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,548
Are you that crazy?

491
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,915
No. Are you?

492
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,546
No.

493
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,395
Good. I talked to
Andrews' assistant.

494
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,696
Aoki should be calling you
with the offer any minute.

495
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,040
You'd better answer.

496
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:37,983
Hello.

497
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,216
Miss Aoki, it's good
to hear from you.

498
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,273
Hi, Shaun.

499
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,545
I got my job back.

500
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,579
That's great.

501
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,089
I have a question for you.

502
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,584
Yes. I don't mean yes.

503
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,128
I also don't mean no.
Just, what is the question?

504
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,174
Do I look nice?

505
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:36,146
Yes, Shaun, you look very nice.

506
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,538
I know myself.

507
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,340
I know what I want,
and I know what I love.

508
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,310
You don't love me.
You barely know me.

509
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,815
I think I do. I
think I know you.

510
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,112
And sure, we can go
out on another date,

511
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,531
and then another date after
that, and more dates after that.

512
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,115
But life is short
and getting shorter,

513
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:25,220
and I wanna spend whatever
time I have left with you.

514
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,195
When we're together,

515
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:32,135
it feels like we're speeding
down the PCH in a Duesenberg,

516
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,538
12 cylinders with 400
CCs and turbo boosts,

517
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,305
and a picnic basket in
the back with baguettes

518
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,609
and Gruyère and prosciutto
and Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

519
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,977
And you're sitting next to me,

520
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,415
wind in your hair
and you're laughing.

521
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,214
That laugh.

522
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,321
And the sun and the ocean.

523
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,726
And it just feels like
we can go. Forever.

524
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,397
Debbie Wexler,

525
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,373
will you marry me?

526
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,312
Yes.

527
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,820
You have nice hair.

528
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,089
I know, fabulous. I was just...

529
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,561
Here are flowers and chocolates.

530
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,765
Real ones.

531
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,765
I was wondering if

532
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:22,507
you would like to...

533
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,752
Eat dinner?

534
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,454
Are you asking me out?

535
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,928
Yes.

536
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,957
On a date?

537
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,531
Yes.

538
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,968
I would love to.
