00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,513
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,598
Coming back to California,
and moving in with you,

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,370
it's been harder
than I anticipated.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,570
Hershey meant
everything to me, Shaun.

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,304
I took the biggest chance
of my life going back there.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,235
And then it just went away.

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,182
Deep brain stimulation
was used to treat anorexia.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,050
You want to use brain surgery
for a psychiatric disorder?

9
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,322
DBS isn't FDA-approved
for anorexia treatment here.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,656
It's not a real option.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,852
My wife's decided against
the valve repair surgery.

12
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,088
At least, until she's tried
the deep brain stimulation.

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,131
You won't be a part of the
surgery. Or any of my surgeries.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,260
You went around me,
directly to the patient.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,507
<i>You're booting me
off your service?</i>

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,085
- Oh, he's very affectionate.
- Ooh.

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,215
Yes.

18
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,833
Cats are smart and independent.

19
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:16,176
I don't think my first pet should
be something I'm allergic to.

20
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,511
Oh.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,079
Mmm.

22
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,852
Did you know constrictors
don't crush their prey?

23
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,619
They induce arterial
circulatory collapse.

24
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,899
He looks like a Hubert.

25
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:45,838
The pH should be maintained
within a range of 7.1 to 7.3.

26
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,774
And we're supposed to add

27
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,472
three drops of Klor-out
to neutralize the tap water.

28
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,080
Don't worry, Hubert. Daddy just
shows his love in a different way.

29
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,254
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,955
No. You don't
come by for a month,

31
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,641
and then you think this store-bought
pie is gonna make it all right?

32
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,099
It's from the farmers' market.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,268
Fine, hand it over.
And bring it in.

35
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,829
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
How is she?

37
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,415
Why didn't you tell me things were
getting so bad? I would have come.

38
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,482
You're busy.

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,219
I will always make
time for you, Kay.

40
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,977
Good, 'cause you're not leaving

41
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,579
until the three of us
finish a bottle of Merlot.

42
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,150
Did you call that oncologist doing
the new ovarian cancer PARP-I trial?

43
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,328
The intake doctor said I don't
have the right tumor markers.

44
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,628
- Then you need to go back to your...
- My...

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,103
My team put me on
hospice last week.

46
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,538
- Do you want a dose of morphine?
- No, I got it.

47
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,407
Just give it a minute to pass.

48
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,971
Her doctors keep upping the
dosage, but it's not helping anymore.

49
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,108
Nothing is.

50
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,651
Oh.

51
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,536
Hey. Um...

52
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,509
Um, my college
roommate was diagnosed

53
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,013
with stage IV ovarian
cancer a year ago.

54
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,283
She's had six
cycles of carbo-taxol

55
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,013
without cytoreductive surgery
due to widespread disease.

56
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,746
They stopped chemo when
she stopped responding.

57
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,850
She has a month at most.

58
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,793
Wow. I'm so sorry
to hear that, Claire.

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,059
As am I. And I assume you're
not here just seeking sympathy?

60
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,191
I've reviewed her scans,
and she can't be cured,

61
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,548
but this metastatic lesion
extending through her diaphragm

62
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,367
is causing most of her pain.

63
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:04,138
Her surgeon has ruled out
removing it due to vascular complexity.

64
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,737
But I think laparoscopic
debulking is possible.

65
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,941
Difficult, but possible.

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,949
I know you're upset with
me, but she, she's my friend,

67
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:21,085
and she's in pain.
I need your help.

68
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,128
I'll take a look at her today.

69
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,731
Thank you.

70
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,130
We need a surgeon over here.

71
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,746
He fell down the stairs
at a construction site

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,214
- while holding a nail-gun.
- Portable head X-ray STAT.

73
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,238
Any other injuries?

74
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,865
Nah, just yank it off,
and slap a Band-Aid.

75
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,307
- Any weakness?
- No.

76
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:41,040
All right. On my
count. One, two, three.

77
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,011
Let's get you that Band-Aid.

78
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,947
I could have done that for free
at home with a pair of vice-grips.

79
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,348
You don't pay for our equipment.

80
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,453
You pay for me to tell
you that he got lucky.

81
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,851
It's superficial.

82
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,115
His pressure's dropping.

83
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,955
- Are you feeling faint?
- A little banged up...

84
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,854
All right, something else is
going on. Let's log roll him.

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,518
What's wrong with my brother?

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,367
- I see a puncture wound in his flank.
- There's a nail in his abdomen, too.

87
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,098
Let's get him up to the OR.

88
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,309
How bad is the pain?

89
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,279
Maybe a six.

90
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,721
She's lying. She, uh, hides it well,
but she's in terrible pain all the time.

91
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,033
But Claire said you're
not out of options

92
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,821
until Dr. Melendez says you are.

93
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,657
So, am I?

94
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,730
I think we can make
things a little easier for you.

95
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,032
- How soon?
- Dr. Park and I will do it today.

96
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,202
What about Claire? I
came here because of her.

97
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,472
Dr. Park is excellent.
You're in very capable hands.

98
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,716
When my doctors gave up
on me, Claire found a way.

99
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,413
I trust her. I won't do
the surgery without her.

100
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,517
Dr. Park and Dr. Browne
will prep you for surgery.

101
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,791
- Well, try that again.
- Show me.

102
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,386
- Swing... Straight, yeah.
- Almost.

103
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,297
- Then pull back up. That's good.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,287
The nail completely
ruptured the kidney.

105
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,107
Renal hilum's blown,
too. Four-O on a driver.

106
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,716
This isn't working.
Clamp the renal vessels.

107
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,188
He's gonna have
to live without it.

108
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,253
Expose the other kidney, make
sure it's got that new-car smell.

109
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,996
The adrenal gland is low-lying.

110
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,330
You won't find the
left kidney there.

111
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,881
You expect her to
find it on the right?

112
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,171
No. The most likely reason
for the gland to be lower

113
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,540
is unilateral renal agenesis.

114
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,151
He was born with one kidney.

115
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,502
Is that the vena cava?

116
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,231
There's so much tumor in there,

117
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,999
it's hard to tell
what anything is.

118
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:30,305
We need to free this segment
without nicking that vein, or...

119
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,413
Park, pull on that
fragment very carefully.

120
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,515
Got it.

121
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,609
Right, Claire, I
need you to tilt...

122
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,153
Exactly.

123
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,617
The tumor's invaded
the vessel wall.

124
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,401
I think you got it.

125
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,172
Why isn't there tumor tissue
penetrating her diaphragm?

126
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,581
Hmm.

127
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,250
The CT scan showed...

128
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,344
The segment we removed was
displacing the diaphragm upward,

129
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,261
giving it the appearance
of chest infiltration.

130
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,953
If the cancer's just
in her abdomen,

131
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,824
she could be a candidate
for HIPEC treatment.

132
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,357
Treatment? Not pain relief?

133
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,801
We may be able to give
her a little more time.

134
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,338
It's called HIPEC surgery. I'd
remove as much tumor as possible,

135
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,006
and then we'd
infuse your abdomen

136
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,176
with a chemotherapy
solution for 90 minutes.

137
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,087
It could give you
another six months.

138
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,587
It comes with a big risk.

139
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,827
This is a major operation,
and your body's frail.

140
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,226
You could die on the table.

141
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:06,467
Uh, I... I want more time, but
her pain is finally manageable.

142
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,474
I'm afraid to press
our luck anymore.

143
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,740
The thought of gambling away
your last few weeks terrifies me, too,

144
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,217
but this wasn't luck.

145
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,313
Dr. Melendez has proved that despite
all of the challenges of your cancer,

146
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,554
he can safely navigate
inside your abdomen.

147
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,287
I think it's worth putting
your trust in him again.

148
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,605
Okay.

149
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:47,136
We'll start with a complete PET-CT
scan, so, we can plan our approach.

150
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,147
He has extensive
vein thrombosis.

151
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,459
There's a clear segment we
can use for an AV dialysis graft.

152
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:05,795
It's short, but we can
attach it to the brachial artery.

153
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,060
Oh.

154
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,906
Hello, Lea. I'm
sorry, but I can't talk...

155
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,909
<i>There's a problem with Hubert.</i>

156
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,510
Oh, okay.

157
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,813
Yeah, the pH is exactly 7.2,
temp's 73, everything is perfect.

158
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,011
<i>- Perfect?</i>
- He looks bored.

159
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,555
Bored?

160
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:33,218
He can't be bored. He's a fish.

161
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,462
He's just floating
there with nothing to do.

162
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,156
<i>I thought you
were working today.</i>

163
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,494
I was, from home.

164
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,001
Now, I'm procrastinating
with Hubert.

165
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,195
<i>You should work.</i>

166
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,898
Okay. Can you pick up
one of those little castles?

167
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,572
Mmm.

168
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,075
Okay.

169
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,011
I'm not sure who's being
domesticated. You, or the fish.

170
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,743
Uh, yes, I'm still here.

171
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,081
Call us if anything changes.

172
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,215
Due to his tissue type, UNOS
doesn't expect to locate a match in time.

173
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,918
We'll need to
find a living donor.

174
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,062
You did a great job today.

175
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh!

176
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,901
You want some pirate booty
and a juice box with that?

177
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,971
You keep me waiting for hours on end.
Now, at least, I have something to do.

178
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,135
- Cancer's keeping you waiting.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,214
We're ready for you.

180
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,749
- Here you go.
- Well, you can keep that.

181
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,283
Oh. Thank you.

182
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,085
Bye.

183
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,919
- His story is not gonna end well, is it?
- Mmm.

184
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,427
You know, the yo-yo has been around
for 1,400 years since ancient China.

185
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,528
Watch this.

186
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,733
You're not my only patient.

187
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,966
Yeah. Remembering
and executing these tricks

188
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,064
will help with my
sequential memory,

189
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,472
and protect my brain
against your radiation.

190
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,273
With this new targeted therapy, I
can better focus on just knocking

191
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,975
the things out of your
head that I want to.

192
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,313
Of course, I'm also
making a little wish list

193
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,218
about other things I
might want to get rid of.

194
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm worried. Whether it's
tomorrow or a few months from now,

195
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,500
Dash is gonna lose me.

196
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,736
And he'll be devastated. He's
an amazing, loving husband.

197
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,634
I want you to go out with him.

198
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,541
What?

199
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,344
You two get along, you
even have chemistry.

200
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,944
We're friends.

201
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,851
If Dash is gonna
move on with his life,

202
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,083
he needs something to live
for. I think that could be you.

203
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,959
<i>We need to begin now.</i>

204
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,659
Okay.

205
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,336
Don't say a word.

206
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,876
It's none of my business.

207
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,508
- Dash seems like a nice guy...
- Shut up.

208
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,078
- You're a perfect match.
- Great.

209
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,817
We just need you to
sign the consent forms.

210
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,157
Donation carries several risks,

211
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,788
including blood
clots, infection,

212
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,459
hemorrhage, lung
collapse, and possibly death.

213
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,532
There are also lifelong risks
such as high blood pressure,

214
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:35,267
which can cause a heart attack,
and protein-losing nephropathy,

215
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,935
which can impair
your remaining kidney,

216
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,775
leading to the need
for a transplant yourself.

217
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:46,047
- It's a big ask.
- Yes, it is.

218
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,952
I'm happy to sign the
forms, on one condition.

219
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,154
I'm not selling the business.

220
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,134
I told you 10 times,
we're not taking that offer.

221
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,363
Either sell, or buy me
out at the same price.

222
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,066
- You know I can't afford that.
- I can't afford anything.

223
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,437
Look, Dad left you in charge,
but all of my money is tied up in it.

224
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,512
I got investment opportunities, I
got things that I'm excited about.

225
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,379
Dad left me in charge
because when things got tough,

226
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,214
you took off to college
while we rebuilt.

227
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,583
Now, you want to cash in?

228
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,383
We'll both cash in.

229
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,754
The deal I negotiated
is way over-market.

230
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:28,192
I don't care how good
the deal is. I like what I do.

231
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,221
And I like my kidney. Seems
we both need to make a sacrifice.

232
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,967
I'm not selling.

233
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,910
Kayla's back in her room.

234
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,143
We finished her staging,

235
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,084
and everything supports
our operative plan.

236
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,088
Do you have any questions
about her upcoming surgery?

237
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,622
Uh...

238
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,931
Did Kay bring up
anything about, uh...

239
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,099
Us?

240
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:15,164
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I told her not to do that.

241
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,073
I mean, it's, uh...
It's nuts, you know.

242
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,736
Well, that's a little insulting.

243
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,738
Uh...

244
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,147
I'm kidding. It's insane.

245
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,313
Uh...

246
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,721
Just, you know, we'll just
forget she mentioned it, okay?

247
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,825
Will she?

248
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,591
I mean, we both said
no. What's she gonna do?

249
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,624
You've been married to her eight
years, and you still ask that question?

250
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,497
Well, we, uh, do
have one other choice.

251
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,533
You guys have a
chapel here, right?

252
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,538
- He's exploiting the situation.
- Yes. He's entitled to.

253
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,683
You don't think an organ
donation should be an altruistic act?

254
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,310
Can it be?

255
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,688
A majority of donors do it to make
their own lives more worthwhile,

256
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,284
and almost a quarter do it to
relieve guilt over a past mistake.

257
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:13,192
Redemption... Meaning...
Sure. But not money.

258
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,860
So, you never take an opportunity to
get ahead at someone else's expense?

259
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm competing, not
trafficking organs.

260
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,700
I need Armando's kidney.

261
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,368
And I need it without getting
dragged into their family drama.

262
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,910
Which is why I have residents.

263
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,842
So, you two find a
way to make it happen.

264
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,911
This central line will allow us

265
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,544
to monitor your heart
during tomorrow's surgery.

266
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,979
Have you considered my proposal?

267
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,622
I have been more
focused on your surgery

268
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,628
than seducing your husband.

269
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,096
- Typical.
- Ah.

270
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,064
You got me. I'm not dating

271
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,432
my cancer-riddled friend's husband
because I have commitment issues.

272
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,735
You've been sprinting away from
men as long as I've known you.

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,208
Yeah, I will find the time
when I have the time.

274
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,271
It will never be the right
time. You're afraid to get hurt.

275
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,612
I know how short life is.

276
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,246
I don't want you to miss
out on the best part of it.

277
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,584
All done.

278
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,693
What do I owe you for
the therapy session?

279
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,888
- Date my husband.
- Do you know how stupid that sounds?

280
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,455
I want someone to take
care of the man that I love.

281
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,558
- Does that sound stupid?
- Yes, very. But...

282
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,829
Please, please, would
you just drop this?

283
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,402
I will drop this if... One date.

284
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,104
One dinner. That's all.

285
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,150
But a real one, not a latte in
the cafe. I want a real date.

286
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,049
Appetizers, main course, wine.

287
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,453
- I'm on call.
- No wine. But candles.

288
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,650
I want candles.

289
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,227
One date. I will never
mention any of this again.

290
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,961
It's a federal crime to barter a
human organ for anything of value.

291
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,660
I'm not selling
Santiago anything.

292
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,397
You're receiving
money from a third party

293
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,837
in exchange for your kidney.

294
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,467
He's receiving money from
a third party for his business.

295
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,804
So is his brother.

296
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,640
He should love
him enough to not...

297
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,123
I love him enough
to give him a kidney.

298
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,458
He should love me
enough to accept

299
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,474
an offer that would
improve my life, too.

300
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,678
I mean, it's a much lower
ask than a vital organ.

301
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,346
You're not allowed
to ask for anything.

302
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,498
Are you saying
that if he agrees,

303
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,766
you're not gonna
perform the surgery?

304
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,281
- He doesn't agree.
- He will.

305
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,636
Everything in life
is transactional.

306
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,380
And in this case, I've
got all the leverage.

307
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,057
The leverage?

308
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,059
It's what you have
that they need.

309
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,828
It's how you shift
a deal in your favor.

310
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,301
You guys have no leverage,
and no cards to play.

311
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,233
Yes, we do.

312
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,101
I don't believe you're
willing to let your brother die.

313
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,535
A good negotiator doesn't bluff.

314
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,011
If you cave on a threat,
you lose all credibility.

315
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,379
And Santiago knows
I'm a good negotiator.

316
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,852
So, he won't die, precisely
because I'm willing to let him.

317
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:55,293
- I'll talk to your brother.
- Okay.

318
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,245
Um...

319
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,682
How long do we have to stay?

320
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,981
She said dinner, so, I
assume till we're done eating.

321
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,255
Okay.

322
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,591
- Dessert?
- Do you want any?

323
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,219
- Not really.
- I think we're good.

324
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,888
- Okay.
- Okay.

325
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,775
Hmm?

326
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,841
Look at that old clock.

327
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,050
It's the same as the one that
they had at Meline's, off campus.

328
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,211
Oh, yeah.

329
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,204
Hey, remember that time we
went there on that double date?

330
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,194
You set me up with
your English TA.

331
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,287
Yeah. Kay said
it was a bad idea.

332
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,798
I just remember him
droning on about...

333
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,425
Dryden's influence on
eighteenth century literature.

334
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,913
If you hadn't stepped
in, I think I might have

335
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,872
stabbed him with my salad fork.

336
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,270
Ah, Kay always knew better.

337
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:20,470
Yeah. She fixed me up three
times. And then she gave up.

338
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,579
Until now.

339
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,755
You should sell the business.

340
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,766
Excuse me?

341
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,264
You would live.

342
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,399
And you could take the
proceeds and start a new business,

343
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,267
without your
brother as a partner.

344
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,108
It's a good deal.

345
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,050
Benitez Builders is
my father's legacy.

346
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,351
He built it from nothing.

347
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,684
He was committed,
hardworking, honorable.

348
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,781
He expected the same
thing from both of us.

349
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,663
My dad was difficult to please.

350
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,468
I work hard to be someone
that my father could be proud of.

351
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,469
And I'm the one he trusted
with the controlling share.

352
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,336
I'd rather die
than let him down.

353
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,381
- Is that bothering you?
- Yeah. A little bit.

354
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,714
Oh.

355
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,314
The graft is failing.

356
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,888
Oh!

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,799
What's happening?

358
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,872
Infusing heparin.
He's hypercoagulable.

359
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,503
The tunnel catheter is
gonna clot off just like the graft.

360
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,013
That gives him
even less leverage.

361
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:06,075
It should convince Santiago
to accept his brother's offer.

362
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,585
Santiago? Why him?

363
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,019
I'm negotiating.

364
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,521
With the wrong brother.

365
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,759
The catheter's
already obstructing.

366
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,854
Whatever we're doing, it needs to
happen in the next couple of days.

367
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,626
We'll do a live donor drive.

368
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,903
Okay. One in 100,000
chance of success,

369
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,805
but better than
planning his funeral.

370
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,389
I think the odds
are better than that.

371
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,710
We don't need to find a match.

372
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,943
We just need the parade of selfless
family members to embarrass Armando

373
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,711
into doing the right thing.

374
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:46,321
- Evening, roomie.
- Evening, roomie.

375
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,132
- Hubert is dead.
- Yeah.

376
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,439
Hmm.

377
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:02,707
That's odd.

378
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,974
I'm not sure if I overfed him,

379
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,876
or if it was when I changed
the water to clean his pebbles,

380
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,439
but yeah, definitely dead.

381
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,122
We can get another fish.

382
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,248
We don't need to.

383
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,817
There are many fish in the sea.

384
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,920
I said, no.

385
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:28,263
- You wanted a pet.
- I got one.

386
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:32,396
- Very briefly. I'll go tomorrow and...
- No.

387
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,289
Are you crying?

388
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,362
Are you sad?

389
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,027
I'm sad.

390
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:06,696
And I'm angry, and
frustrated and upset.

391
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,442
We should get another fish.

392
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,311
The fish isn't the problem.

393
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:19,341
I am. I'm pathetic.

394
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,650
I went home to Hershey because
I wasn't fulfilled with my life.

395
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:29,593
I thought I could help my
bull-headed brother save the shop,

396
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:34,065
and be a part of something I
was really passionate about.

397
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,829
And instead, we ended
up tanking it together,

398
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,461
along with our relationship.

399
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,733
I came back here to
get my life back on track.

400
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,867
How am I supposed to do that if I
can't even keep a damn fish alive?

401
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,206
I'll make it through this.

402
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,591
It is okay to be afraid.

403
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,768
How was your dinner with Dash?

404
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,638
Forget about that. How are you?

405
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,711
If I don't make it, you have to
give this thing with Dash a real shot.

406
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,943
Kayla, please, stop.

407
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,645
Promise me. You have to.

408
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,654
No. You can't put that on me.

409
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,652
That's right. Claire never
turns her back on a friend,

410
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,820
as long as it doesn't
put her heart at risk.

411
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,960
That is not fair.
What you're asking...

412
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,866
I'm asking you to trust my
judgment about the two of you.

413
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,570
No. You're trying to pressure
me into something that I don't want.

414
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,800
Like you always do.

415
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,309
You need pushing because you've
never known what's best for you.

416
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:28,808
So...

417
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:32,579
So, is that why
you dragged me out

418
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,315
to pledge week to be rejected
by every sorority on campus?

419
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,858
Or... Or went behind my back and
invited my mother to graduation?

420
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,359
At least you tried. You
put something at risk.

421
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:47,399
No. Give me a break. This
was never about me, none of it.

422
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,759
You always have
to have it your way.

423
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,204
You are a neurotic control
freak who thinks she has the right

424
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,502
to dictate how everyone
else should live their lives.

425
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,482
- It's time.
- I'm ready.

426
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,685
Kayla...

427
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:35,874
I'm sure you recognize Rafael,
your second cousin from Oxnard.

428
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,712
He drove up as soon as he heard.

429
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,550
Either we get lucky here
and you look like an ass,

430
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,933
or we don't, and you look
like an ass with a dead brother.

431
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,388
Mmm.

432
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,689
He won't give his life for
a contracting company.

433
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,425
He's not dying for the company.

434
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:00,597
He's dying for your father.

435
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,469
What makes you think that?

436
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:08,304
He would rather die
than let your father down.

437
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,617
He thinks that that's
what Dad would want?

438
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,050
Santi did everything
the old man asked of him.

439
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,635
Worked twice as hard, did everything
twice as well as Dad ever could,

440
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:24,118
but nothing was ever
good enough for our father.

441
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,131
And no matter what we did, he
was always right there to point out

442
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,530
where we had gone wrong.

443
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,967
You know what he told
me on his deathbed?

444
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,907
Said that he wasn't proud of
Santi for following in his footsteps,

445
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,138
that he was disappointed
that he settled.

446
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,951
You should tell
your brother that.

447
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,613
It's a good card to play.

448
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,220
<i>He was wrong.</i>

449
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,298
You are the most loyal, hardworking
and principled guy I've ever known.

450
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,665
And you deserved Dad's respect.

451
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,907
You greedy, lying snake.

452
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,476
You will say anything
to get what you want.

453
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,298
Even trying to ruin the
memories I have of Dad.

454
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,315
Your memories of Dad? He
was horrible. You know that.

455
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,016
Get the hell out.

456
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,053
- Santi, I'm not trying to...
- Get out!

457
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,751
Give me the consent forms.

458
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:19,376
My father told me he
wished I hadn't been born.

459
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:23,571
I wasn't worth the trouble.

460
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:30,249
But I knew I was
worth the trouble,

461
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,923
because my brother
always looked out for me,

462
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,463
even when it
made his life harder.

463
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,881
Five-O prolene. Position
the kidney in the pelvis.

464
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,888
Dr. Murphy.

465
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,458
Your stat cultures came back
positive for <i>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis.</i>

466
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:44,662
Thank you.

467
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,967
It's not for this patient.

468
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,437
- Do you need to deal with it?
- It's too late.

469
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,255
You have a security problem.

470
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,788
I will get my badge and my gun.

471
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,898
Somebody stole my
wallet out of the locker.

472
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,197
- Are you sure you left it there?
- Yes, I'm sure.

473
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,847
You were worried
about it getting stolen,

474
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,975
so, you gave this to me
before your session today.

475
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,319
Mine. Sorry.

476
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,752
Stupid. Don't read
anything into this.

477
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,202
- Uh, how is she?
- We removed a lot of the tumor,

478
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,885
and she's having the
chemotherapy bath now.

479
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,901
- Mmm-hmm.
- So far, she's doing well.

480
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,104
Oh. Okay.

481
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,209
- Kayla would want you to eat.
- Yeah.

482
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,614
- Yeah.
- Of course, she would.

483
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,437
She'd forget to eat, herself.

484
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,085
I really hate all...
All this waiting.

485
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,091
Hey, just sit. Breathe.

486
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,594
You know, Kayla's
dealt with so much.

487
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:11,542
Prodding, and nausea,
fatigue, so much pain...

488
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,310
I just wish she would let
me do something for her

489
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,383
to make things easier.

490
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,389
I want to protect my wife.

491
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,518
Instead, I'm just
sitting here, waiting,

492
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,096
waiting for her to die.

493
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,455
Dash, I'm sorry. They
need me back in the OR.

494
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,479
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

495
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,453
Push another 60 of Lasix.

496
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:05,257
- MAP is 26.
- She's in cardiopulmonary collapse.

497
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,214
Second chest tube in.

498
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,831
SATS are still dropping on 100%.

499
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,546
It has to be heart failure. We
need to crash her on ECMO.

500
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,686
Her cardiac index was fine.

501
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,270
It must be a toxic inflammatory
reaction to the chemo.

502
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,349
She's intolerant.
Stop the chemo.

503
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,720
What if the fluid build-up isn't
a reaction to the chemo bath?

504
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,224
What if it is the chemo bath?

505
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,224
Her... Her mediastinum
is widening.

506
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,021
If her diaphragm perforated,

507
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,567
fluid could be leaking into her
chest, compressing her heart.

508
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,779
The tumor we removed yesterday
was clinging to her diaphragm.

509
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,671
If we close the hole, she
can finish her treatment.

510
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,834
Let's reopen her incision.

511
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,393
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

512
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,060
His kidney numbers
are starting to improve.

513
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,569
Take me back to my room, Doc.

514
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,497
Mandy.

515
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,572
Thanks for the kidney.

516
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,542
You're welcome. Just don't
come looking for another one

517
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,585
without a big
check in your hand.

518
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,251
Jerk.

519
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,898
That's good.

520
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,601
Hey! You're just in time for
some, uh, celebratory ice chips.

521
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,909
- Kay, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

522
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,979
You weren't entirely wrong.

523
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,384
I can be a little manipulative.

524
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,156
No. No, I was wrong.

525
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,591
You don't try to
control everything

526
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,066
because you think you know
better than everyone else.

527
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,035
You do it because
you're a caring friend.

528
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,439
You focus all your energy,

529
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,911
trying to protect us from
pain and suffering, and...

530
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,880
And that lets you not
think about your own.

531
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,788
But you have to.

532
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,797
You are dying, Kayla.

533
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,030
I know.

534
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:07,035
You're dying,
and it is not fair.

535
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,074
And it is painful and scary.

536
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,953
- It feels like you're all alone...
- Please stop.

537
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,283
But you're not.

538
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,658
Dash is here.

539
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,200
And so am I.

540
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,091
Thank you for
everything you did.

541
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,364
Of course.

542
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:05,535
I, um... I meant
what I said to Kayla.

543
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,698
You really are the most gifted
surgeon I have ever worked with.

544
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,513
You did well today.

545
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,780
Thanks.

546
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,875
I'll report back to
Dr. Lim in the morning,

547
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,215
if that's what you want.

548
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,292
That's probably for the best.

549
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,069
Shaun, I don't
need another fish.

550
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,301
- I don't want another fish.
- I do.

551
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,133
Our goldfish died.

552
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,711
You need to provide
a replacement.

553
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:48,938
Store policy,

554
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,947
once a fish leaves this store, all
responsibility for its well-being...

555
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:56,450
Hubert had
<i>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis.</i>

556
00:40:57,322 --> 00:41:01,089
A common goldfish parasite,
picked up in pet stores.

557
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:09,396
You have no leverage,
and no cards to play.

558
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,177
Pick a fish.

559
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,949
You didn't kill Hubert.

560
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:38,326
He was defective.
We'll try again.

561
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,797
Thank you, Shaun.

562
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,904
Caring for a fish won't
sort out my problems.

563
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,942
Although, that
one's pretty cute.

564
00:41:56,381 --> 00:42:00,842
Platies are very hardy
fish. They are difficult to kill.
