00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,764
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,169
I'm covering the ER today.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,606
Gonna be a madhouse.

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,432
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,105
This Emergency Room and
everyone in it is now under quarantine.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,308
A serious respiratory virus
has infected three patients.

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,940
Take me to the hospital.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,328
We are going to
your appointment,

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,821
and making sure your think
melon remains tumor-free.

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,684
I no longer have
an immune system...

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,922
My donor is on his way, right?

12
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,984
Why are you answering
our donor's phone?

13
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,925
Because he's here in quarantine.

14
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,795
My wife's in there. I
need to get in there.

15
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,012
If something happens to me,

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,365
our son needs someone
to take care of him.

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,937
- Put your mask back on.
- Why?

18
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,132
Because I'm infected.

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,199
On the bright side, I think
I'm growing on Morgan.

20
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:44,968
Dr. Reznick...

21
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:47,847
Morgan...

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,760
He doesn't need to die.

23
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,946
- He signed a DNR.
- He shouldn't have.

24
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,163
We're gonna get
his donor's marrow.

25
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,985
You need surgery, now.

26
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,149
There's no operating room.

27
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,022
We will have to improvise.

28
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,788
Use your finger
to plug the hole.

29
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,855
Now, what? Dr. Lim?

30
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,027
It's back.

31
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,304
Help my son! Help my son!

32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,984
<i>Three-eleven bus.</i>

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,096
<i>$2.35.</i>

34
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>Left on Blossom Hill...</i>

35
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,419
Kellan!

36
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,881
Right on Cottle Street.

37
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,452
Dr. Murphy?

38
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,961
Left on Santa Teresa...

39
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,959
I think there's something
wrong with him.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,259
We'll get you a mask.

41
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,578
Can we get this
pregnant woman a mask?

42
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,366
Kellan, can you
hear me? Breathe!

43
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,461
It's empty.

44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,368
Kellan!

45
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,769
Right on...

46
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,913
Dr. Reznick needs you.

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,585
He's not answering.
Dr. Murphy...

48
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,299
Don't yell, it'll
only make it worse.

49
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,047
Okay. What should I do?

50
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,926
Tell him about the surgery.
Give him every detail you can.

51
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,005
Santa Pete has a torn IMA.

52
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,903
He's hemorrhaging
into his belly.

53
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,944
His BP is at 87 over
54 and dropping.

54
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,576
A saphenous vein graft.

55
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:15,187
We can repair the IMA with a graft
from the saphenous vein. We just...

56
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,924
I don't need a diagnosis, I
need an extra set of hands.

57
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,594
Get me a 2-0 silk, vascular
clamps, and an 11 blade.

58
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,194
Clear.

59
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,299
Charge 200 joules. Clear.

60
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,045
We just saved his life
and violated his rights.

61
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,776
We should lose our licenses.

62
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,877
You won't.

63
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,699
You were following the
instructions given by an attending.

64
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,782
No, I wasn't.

65
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,323
Let's get him stabilized,

66
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,704
so I can go to
Andrews and talk to him

67
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,128
about getting him some marrow
so this wasn't a waste of time.

68
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,845
Put your lips
together and breathe

69
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,531
like you're blowing
out a candle.

70
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,697
I can't.

71
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,734
Kellan. Deep
breaths. Deep breaths.

72
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,723
You're a doctor, right?
Any update on the virus?

73
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,870
- Do I have it?
- No.

74
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,880
No rash, no fever.
This is your asthma.

75
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,416
- When can we go home?
- Your lungs are hyperinflated.

76
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,180
They better send in more doctors,
because that weirdo melted down.

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,915
Everybody, shut
up. Shut the hell up!

78
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,317
We have multiple people
in serious condition,

79
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,259
including a senior
doctor and my son.

80
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,881
Your questions are
gonna have to wait.

81
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,495
I need a nebulizer.

82
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,643
It's in isolation with
the infected patients.

83
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,226
I'll order one in from pharmacy.

84
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,860
No time.

85
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,514
- Making your own nebulizer?
- Something like that.

86
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,130
- You broke in?
- No.

87
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,133
Dad, I saw the Taser.

88
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,467
I didn't use it.
Just threatened to.

89
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,762
That was dumb.

90
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,732
Long deep breaths.

91
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,526
<i>You got her on maximal oxygen?</i>

92
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,542
Yeah, her vitals have
recovered slightly.

93
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,447
<i>The CDC is sending a PCR test</i>

94
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,955
<i>based off the virus in
the Malaysian outbreak.</i>

95
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,233
So, what's their
treatment protocol?

96
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,623
Antiviral, steroids,

97
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,285
inhale nitric oxide and
anti-etanercept antibodies.

98
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,065
<i>That's what we did for the
two plane patients and Tyler.</i>

99
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,135
We got to Dr. Lim sooner.
That should make a difference.

100
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,269
<i>How's Dr. Murphy?</i>

101
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,402
He's fine.

102
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,246
I saw his breakdown
on the security feed.

103
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,676
<i>Better. He's closing
on Santa Pete.</i>

104
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,532
Do you have a strategy
for dealing with it?

105
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,748
<i>Dr. Park and I can...</i>

106
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,299
Park's in there?
When did that happen?

107
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,157
<i>Just a few minutes ago.
He came in to help his son.</i>

108
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,825
<i>Perfect.</i>

109
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,503
You're still here?

110
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,865
What did they say?

111
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,442
Very kind of you.

112
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,702
No wonder you and
Shaun get along so well.

113
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,775
What did they say? Did the
new tests show anything new?

114
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,542
They need time to
process the CT images.

115
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,342
Send them off to Dr. Blaize.

116
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,227
So you might've been wrong
about your cancer coming back?

117
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,847
No.

118
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,182
No?

119
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,728
How can you know you're not wrong
if you don't know you're not wrong?

120
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,159
This is how they do it.

121
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,129
First they tell you it
might be something,

122
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:45,070
and then they order new
tests to test the previous tests,

123
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,904
only to inform you that it was
what they suspected all along.

124
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,342
Very effective way
of breaking bad news.

125
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,538
Okay.

126
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,245
And if your tumor really is
back, what does that mean?

127
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,144
It means that I had surgery

128
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,315
and let them pump radiation
into my brain for nothing.

129
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,224
It means that my memory loss
is because my brain is dying.

130
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:11,094
It means that I probably
have a year, maybe 14 months.

131
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,556
Enough meaning for you?

132
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,831
What are we gonna tell Shaun?

133
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,366
Nothing.

134
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,570
Saint Bonaventure's opened
up a room for family and friends.

135
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,041
You wanna come?

136
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,551
We expand the quarantine.

137
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,350
We move our marrow
donor and our patient...

138
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,913
If the donor has the virus,

139
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,515
his marrow will transmit to your
immunocompromised patient.

140
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,592
He'll be dead in hours.

141
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,424
As he will be
without the transplant.

142
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,464
We create a sterile
pathway from the ER

143
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,726
into this procedure room
using polyethylene sheeting.

144
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,959
No, you won't.

145
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,361
The only people
taking any risks here

146
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,014
are my people, the
patient and the donor.

147
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,769
And this hospital and everyone
in it if you screw anything up.

148
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,638
But my larger objection
is, it won't work.

149
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,144
That procedure room
isn't negative pressure.

150
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,613
Which leaves the virus free to
escape to the main vent system.

151
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,155
I'll figure something else.

152
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,120
Janitor's closets.

153
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,763
They're negative pressure because
of the cleanser-sterilizing agents.

154
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,635
Don't want those odors and
toxins to disperse to patient areas.

155
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,566
Here.

156
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,676
That closet doesn't have
room for two patients.

157
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,016
We could do the extraction
there, but not the transplant.

158
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,513
We could use this linen
room in the basement,

159
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,517
which is also negative pressure,

160
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:43,279
and connect to the janitor's
closet through this laundry chute.

161
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,921
Once the bone
marrow's extracted,

162
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,154
it could travel through the
laundry chute into the linen room,

163
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,925
where you could
do the transplant.

164
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,259
<i>Dr. Murphy?</i>

165
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,136
Update me on patient status.

166
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,646
Santa Pete's vitals are stable.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,979
No sign of post-op infection.

168
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,981
Toby is in Bay 3
receiving an IV drip.

169
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,516
Ester's ST...

170
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,823
I think you're overloading him.

171
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,436
No, when he's
dealing with medicine,

172
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,328
he's not distracted
by everything else.

173
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,456
It helps. Keep going, Shaun.

174
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,001
Ester's ST depressions
have improved.

175
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,146
That should help, too.

176
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,182
Ester's ST depressions have
improved and Viola's water broke.

177
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,850
What? When?

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,485
It appears quite recently.

179
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,775
Given you're only 36
weeks gestationally

180
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,577
and there is no
sign of infection,

181
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,017
the baby should be able to
stay in utero for at least 24 hours.

182
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,282
If the quarantine
is done before...

183
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,514
You're not gonna fall
apart again, are you?

184
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,357
I don't think so, Viola.

185
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,395
The buzzing is gone and
there is much less yelling.

186
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,625
Except you.

187
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,132
It was the buzzing
and the yelling?

188
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,770
Not the fact that we're
trapped with three people

189
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,618
who have died from a
highly infectious disease?

190
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,634
That's not something
to worry about.

191
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,313
I either have the
virus, or I don't.

192
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,206
And based on past national
quarantine mortality rates,

193
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,083
we have a very good
statistical chance of surviving.

194
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,759
But I didn't know that I
would fall apart the first time,

195
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,591
so I may be wrong.

196
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,965
Here you go.

197
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,299
You always talk like that?

198
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,062
Like what?

199
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,464
Just say whatever you're
thinking when you're thinking it.

200
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,343
Yes, it's good to be honest.

201
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,311
Wish my dad was like that.

202
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,974
Dr. Park is very honest. He
always shares his opinions.

203
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,449
Opinions, and then
there's feelings.

204
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,692
Your dad doesn't tell
you that he loves you?

205
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,253
What?

206
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:41,333
Well, he's just not
really there for us.

207
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:50,440
He did just risk his life and his career
to break into a quarantine to help you.

208
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,668
It's true.

209
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,207
But most kids want their dad there
even when it's not life-and-death.

210
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,402
Sorry for your loss.

211
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,405
Status?

212
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,642
O2 sat is 92.

213
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:35,712
Respiratory rate is down to
16. Your lungs sound clear.

214
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:40,352
Keep pulmonary edema to a minimum
with conservative fluid management.

215
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,185
Use Furosemide so
my CVPs aren't drained.

216
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,887
Absolutely.

217
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,366
I love this place.

218
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,271
I always said I'd be
doing this till the day I died.

219
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,540
Ta-da.

220
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,518
We started your treatment early.

221
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,548
You'll be back to repairing late-night,
drunken head injuries in no time.

222
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,224
I forgot to call my
mom on her birthday.

223
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,429
I forgot to do a lot of stuff.

224
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,303
Tyler was sweet.

225
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,703
He was a good guy.

226
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,243
Best to put him out of sight.

227
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,072
It's not a healthy
reminder for either of us.

228
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,134
Tyler's mask had a tear in it.

229
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,907
It's possible the virus is
droplet-based, not airborne.

230
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,147
Blood or saliva
could've made its way

231
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,009
through his mask from
the airline passengers.

232
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:16,314
Unfortunately, until we know
for sure, we're still on lockdown.

233
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,322
But I'll let the CDC know.

234
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,322
Do you have a minute?

235
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,455
Is it urgent?

236
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,001
Not really.

237
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,630
Kel...

238
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,268
What's up?

239
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,279
Why'd you move away?

240
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,993
I'm a resident. You go
where the job takes you...

241
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,610
They don't need
doctors in Phoenix?

242
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,713
This was an excellent
opportunity for me.

243
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,416
And it's less than
a two-hour flight...

244
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,653
You had my baseball
schedule for months.

245
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,462
And you came for one game,

246
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,828
and you were on your
computer the entire time.

247
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,000
I had exams the next day.

248
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,798
So, why'd you bother coming?

249
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,486
Good. Slowly. Good.

250
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,191
As delicious as
these ice-chips are,

251
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,386
I think I'm ready
for some solid food.

252
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,688
Did they send in any cookies?

253
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,888
Dr. Murphy was very
clear. No food until you fart.

254
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,530
Just imagine they're
straight from the North Pole.

255
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,500
Bob, are you ready?

256
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,573
Of course.

257
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,671
I'm doing a bone
marrow extraction,

258
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,235
and I need an extra set of
hands to handle some bloody stuff.

259
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,674
Separating bone and
fat from stem cells.

260
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,582
Who here isn't freaked out by
what I just said and can help?

261
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,913
Ester's a doctor.

262
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,785
- You're a doctor? Why haven't you...
- Veterinarian, retired.

263
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,357
Blood is blood. Follow us.

264
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:07,959
Fetal heart rate is still
between 130 and 140 BPM.

265
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,695
Contractions, 17 minutes apart.

266
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,101
What's happening? Is it my baby?

267
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,537
Viola's BP is 180 over 100.

268
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,906
She may have preeclampsia
and an oncoming seizure.

269
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,467
We need to induce labor.

270
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,211
No! He's not being born in here.
We are waiting for quarantine to end.

271
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,081
Your placenta isn't
getting enough blood flow.

272
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,243
We need to get him out.

273
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,214
This is going to be your
first baby. And mine.

274
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,788
Start bronchodilators.
Dr. Lim, can you hear me?

275
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,564
O2 sats are still dropping.

276
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,842
Push paralytics.
Starting intubation.

277
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,001
<i>I'm getting resistance bagging.</i>

278
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,312
<i>I gave her hyoscine.</i>

279
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,450
Hello? What's going
on? What's going on?

280
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,826
<i>Lim's O2 sats are crashing.</i>

281
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,006
<i>Her lungs aren't inflating.</i>

282
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,926
<i>They're filled with
fluid and secretions.</i>

283
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,131
- Pick up the phone.
- I got my hands full.

284
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,465
<i>Villanueva, pick up the phone.</i>

285
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,632
Okay, show me what's going on.

286
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:21,305
She's in full respiratory failure,
she needs more pulmonary support.

287
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,809
<i>Get her on BiPAP. That
might buy us some time.</i>

288
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,640
Or we take her lungs
out of the equation.

289
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,940
We put her on ECMO.

290
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,643
Oxygenate her blood outside her
body. Her lungs will have time to heal.

291
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,309
We can't do ECMO in the ER.

292
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,329
<i>We aren't supposed to do
abdominal surgery in the ER either.</i>

293
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,015
<i>Please, walk me through it.</i>

294
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,025
Prep an area over
her femoral vein.

295
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,562
That's very loud.

296
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,732
- Any crowning, Dr. Murphy?
- No.

297
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:55,069
She's dilated at six centimeters
and I don't feel the head.

298
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,985
It's been seven hours since her
water broke. The baby's stuck.

299
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,501
Use Leopold's maneuvers to
identify the location of the baby.

300
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,480
The fetus is transverse.

301
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,888
He's lying roughly 30
degrees to the left side.

302
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,323
We can't deliver the baby.

303
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,587
What? Why not?

304
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,804
We need to turn the baby.

305
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,508
We need to do an
external cephalic version.

306
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,159
Or a C-section. I have
assisted on several.

307
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,202
In operating rooms with
an experienced attending.

308
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,865
We are not doing a C-section
here. Tilt her bed. I'll grab the gel.

309
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,333
Okay.

310
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,545
So, when...

311
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,521
What? When what?

312
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,521
I get not telling him
when he's in quarantine,

313
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,119
he's got enough
on his plate, but...

314
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,229
Never.

315
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,761
You told him when you
were first diagnosed.

316
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,726
Yes, and that was a mistake.

317
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,266
He forced you to take
tests that saved your life.

318
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,909
Well, no, as it
turns out, it didn't.

319
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,205
And he became so obsessed and
distracted that he nearly killed a patient.

320
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,743
He's your friend.

321
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,146
I'm his mentor. It's not
his job to take care of me.

322
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,832
Make sure you turn the needle, so
you're getting marrow from all sides.

323
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,815
Aspirate slower. If you
pull fast, it's more painful.

324
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,078
Hang in there, Bob.

325
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,682
I deserve a little pain.

326
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,089
You're his dad.
You're saving his life.

327
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,957
I took off before my son
even knew who I was.

328
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:05,162
Traveled in crappy vans
to stay in crappy hotels

329
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,331
and play crappy music.

330
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,334
All so I could earn
enough to get high.

331
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,169
You're here now.

332
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,309
By the time I got up
the nerve to face them...

333
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,310
My ex was dying.

334
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,784
God willing, I did it in
time to save my son.

335
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,532
Dr. Melendez, Chris'
vitals are bottoming out.

336
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,534
His secretions and
lung sounds are worse.

337
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,146
I don't know how much
longer we can wait.

338
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,610
<i>Administer Levophed
and prep him for transplant.</i>

339
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,867
Dr. Park, Chris is
in hypotensive crisis.

340
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,000
Go faster.

341
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,204
Fast as I can.

342
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,342
You ready, Dr. Murphy?

343
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,816
Yes, I can feel the head.

344
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,649
We need to rotate
in the same direction.

345
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,314
Deep breaths, Viola.

346
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,412
Yeah. Okay.

347
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,191
Hold on, I can't do this!

348
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,922
Squeeze my arm hard as you can!

349
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,993
The fetus is moving.

350
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,262
The head is facing the cervix.
One more push. We just need...

351
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,530
Stop!

352
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,908
Placental abruption.
She's hemorrhaging.

353
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,445
Baby's heart-rate
is decelerating.

354
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,582
I need two large-bore IV
lines. And start two units PRBC.

355
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:29,178
And please page an OB-GYN
to supervise my first solo surgery.

356
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,076
This is terrible. This is
not how it's supposed to...

357
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,611
This is excellent.

358
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,148
Dr. Garcia will be supervising
me for the C-section.

359
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,582
She's the director of
obstetrics and gynecology here.

360
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,089
I'm sure she's much more
qualified than your personal OB-GYN.

361
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,623
Relax, you're gonna be fine.

362
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,747
What's the status?

363
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,825
Nerve block is in.

364
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,588
And I gave her a
liter bolus of saline.

365
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,152
Throw some ChloraPrep down,

366
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,822
and make a five-centimeter
Pfannenstiel incision.

367
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,798
Ten blade.

368
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,212
<i>Chris is prepped. I'm
starting central line now.</i>

369
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,308
<i>How's he doing?</i>

370
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,484
Pressure is 90 over
50. O2 sats are 85.

371
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,851
Heart rate is at 110.

372
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,618
Ready when you are.

373
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,690
One more and we're good to go.

374
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,318
I'm on my way.

375
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,886
I'm scrubbing in.

376
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,757
Call me the second
you're ready for the drop.

377
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,794
Abdomen is open. Retraction.

378
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:28,697
Suction.

379
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,872
Baby's BPM is 110 and dropping.

380
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,242
What's happening?

381
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,077
Dr. Murphy, do you
see the uterine wall?

382
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,085
Blood pressure is dropping.

383
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,785
Dr. Murphy, the uterine wall.

384
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,581
Dr. Murphy?

385
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,386
You need to make a gradual
shallow incision and cut through it.

386
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,569
You do not wanna nick the baby.

387
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,824
- What's happening?
- BPM is 95.

388
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,023
Dr. Murphy, please! Please!

389
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,375
Dr. Murphy, should
we turn up her oxygen?

390
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,577
- Dr. Murphy, you need to make the cut.
- Dr. Murphy. Dr. Murphy.

391
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,763
- Okay! Dr. Murphy!
- Dr. Murphy...

392
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,338
Is the baby okay?

393
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,704
No! Quiet!

394
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,573
Everyone, quiet! I
need to concentrate!

395
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,855
I can see the head.

396
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,056
- Is my baby okay?
- He's not breathing.

397
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,890
We need to start CPR now.

398
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,402
Get a pediatric Ambu bag,

399
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,438
and start two-finger
chest compressions.

400
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,574
There's something wrong with Viola.
She's hypotensive and tachycardiac.

401
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,707
She's bleeding out.

402
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,427
You should tell him.

403
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,298
Look at that.

404
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,604
Another reason why you
two are so good together.

405
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,907
Neither one of you are
willing to drop a thing.

406
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,670
He deserves to know.

407
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,138
"Deserves"?

408
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,012
Is that how things
work in your world?

409
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,676
People get what they deserve?

410
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,754
Shaun deserves to be toyed with?

411
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,150
- Who's toying with him?
- You.

412
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,115
I'm his friend.

413
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,118
You whisk him away on a road
trip, kiss him, and then leave town.

414
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,463
Now you pop back into
his life, move in with him.

415
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,194
Shaun's not some
hamster you get to play with,

416
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,771
and then not think twice about
it when you forget to feed him.

417
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,465
You're gonna hurt him
again, you know that.

418
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,600
I know that.

419
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,641
I'm gonna let this slide
because you're dying.

420
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,815
I'm gonna take this outside.

421
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,031
Bubble wrap.

422
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,627
Need to make sure it doesn't
break on the trip or the landing.

423
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,637
Dr. Melendez, we're ready.

424
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,869
Copy. Deposit the marrow now.

425
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,523
<i>The marrow is intact.
We're good to go.</i>

426
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,672
My chest. It really hurts.

427
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,371
- He's going into cardiac arrest.
- What can I do?

428
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:50,668
His IV's blown.

429
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,769
The tip broke off.

430
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,176
It must be in his heart.

431
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:57,915
Come on.

432
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,542
Dr. Murphy, the rules of
medical priority are clear.

433
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,951
Focus on saving the mother.

434
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,690
Dr. Murphy, you
need to stop, now.

435
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,948
Dr. Murphy?

436
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,623
Dr. Murphy?

437
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,632
We can save them both.

438
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,394
Get me a liter of
saline, a plastic bag,

439
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,733
some surgical tape
and Kerlix gauze, please.

440
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:22,905
Who knows CPR?

441
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,239
Who knows CPR?

442
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,545
- In health, they made...
- Come with me.

443
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,440
Two fingers right here
in the middle of his chest.

444
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,711
Press down twice per second.

445
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,548
Every 15 seconds, stop
and squeeze the bag.

446
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,213
Twice...

447
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,408
Please don't press too
hard or you'll crush his heart.

448
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,649
Okay.

449
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,651
You're making a Bakri tamponade
balloon for Viola's bleed?

450
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,769
- Yes.
- What is that supposed to do?

451
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,973
It will control the bleeding by
applying pressure from the inside.

452
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,925
- How's the baby?
- I don't know if this is working.

453
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,126
- I just...
- Don't stop.

454
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,413
Are you ready, Dr. Murphy?

455
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:09,284
Feed the end of the pack
slowly through her cervix.

456
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,756
Once you reach the fundus
of the uterus, start inflation.

457
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,754
Clear.

458
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,922
That's the fourth one.

459
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,397
- I have to crack his chest.
- Here?

460
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,672
Get me rib-spreaders and a
ten blade from the crash cart.

461
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,370
Marrow's in.

462
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:39,380
Heart-rate's 84. BP is 100
over 60. Vitals look good.

463
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,020
I'm sorry about before.

464
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,801
Are you gonna tell Shaun
you got some good news?

465
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,013
What makes you
think it's good news?

466
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,006
Because you apologized.

467
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,741
The cancer's not back.

468
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,070
That's great.

469
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,514
It's not great. It's
okay, it's not great.

470
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,846
I have meningitis from
the CSF leak in my head.

471
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,185
I have to have surgery
pretty much immediately.

472
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,059
And no, I am not telling Shaun.

473
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,219
You're right about one
thing. You're not his friend.

474
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,907
Because friends tell
each other everything?

475
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,524
And you're a lousy mentor.

476
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,259
Friends are there
for each other.

477
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,128
And mentors teach,
they don't hide the truth.

478
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,334
I'm just looking out for him.

479
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,552
He's not like you, he's
not like everybody else...

480
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,576
No, he's not.

481
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:42,842
But he's also not some helpless
child who constantly needs protection.

482
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,783
He's an adult. A very
smart, caring adult.

483
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,288
And you could really use
someone like that right now.

484
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,629
It's not working.
She's still bleeding.

485
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,930
Keep injecting saline.

486
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,476
Vitals are 80 over
60. Heart-rate's 110.

487
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,811
Stop CPR.

488
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,045
I need to see if he
can breathe on his own.

489
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,884
Is everything okay?

490
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,125
No. His lungs are filled
with fluid. He's drowning.

491
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,254
Get the pediatric
laryngoscope, stat.

492
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:40,436
- Dr. Andrews, she's still...
- It's not Andrews. Can I see her?

493
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,300
MAP is holding steady at 65,

494
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,504
<i>but she was dipping into
serious hypoxia for a short bit.</i>

495
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,072
Can I see her?

496
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,488
<i>Good work taking care of her.</i>

497
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,626
Thank you.

498
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,447
The baby has meconium
aspiration. Suction catheter.

499
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:24,982
Is that bad?

500
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,527
Fecal matter has
settled in his lungs.

501
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,551
It's blocking his airway.

502
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:28,881
Did I do something wrong?

503
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,478
You most likely
dislodged some of it.

504
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,315
Without that he would
have suffocated by now.

505
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,848
Clearing his airway.

506
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,622
It's the most important
moment of my life,

507
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,830
and I'm not there with Viola.

508
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,663
This is the way it used to be
done, the men waiting outside.

509
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,867
And now we know better.

510
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,907
Now we know what matters.

511
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,879
Do you think your grandfather
loved your father any less...

512
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,008
Shut up!

513
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,411
Ignore him, he's just a grouch.

514
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:03,521
Shh!

515
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,494
Is that...

516
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,196
I think you've got
yourself a new alarm clock.

517
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,510
Congratulations!

518
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,536
Congratulations!

519
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:27,869
I'm a dad!

520
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,946
Yeah.

521
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,096
He is okay.

522
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,703
A Christmas miracle.

523
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,403
Thank you.

524
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,982
It's Lim.

525
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,819
Could I get some water?

526
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,664
ECMO... That was a ballsy move.

527
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,249
Ester Blum?

528
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,187
Pete Bailey?

529
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,988
Your PCR and serology came
back negative for the virus.

530
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,461
You're officially cleared.

531
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,828
We're going home.

532
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,490
Only Ester can go home.

533
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,592
You're going to post-op
recovery for another day.

534
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,862
I'll keep you company.

535
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,538
There's someone I wanna
see up there anyway.

536
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,108
On Dasher, on Dancer,
on Prancer and Vixen.

537
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:19,655
You are stable.

538
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,357
No sign of marrow rejection.

539
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,891
We will be monitoring you
over the next few weeks,

540
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:29,161
but remission is a
very real possibility.

541
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,701
I don't know how
to thank you enough.

542
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,338
I guess I should thank
my dad, too. Is he here?

543
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,808
There was a complication
during extraction.

544
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:44,877
Bob's heart stopped.

545
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:49,052
We did everything we
could to revive him, but...

546
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,515
He died.

547
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,983
What?

548
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,094
We are so sorry for your loss.

549
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,934
Are you Chris Santos?

550
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,570
My name is Ester.

551
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,936
I was with your
father when he...

552
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,581
He mentioned that
he had a lot of regrets.

553
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,913
But it meant a lot to him
that he could help you.

554
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,376
I heard you were a big
help during that delivery.

555
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,636
They needed extra hands.

556
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,824
You asked me why I
let you and your mom go,

557
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,258
why I didn't fight harder.

558
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,604
It's because I wasn't
a good person.

559
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,508
I wasn't a good father.

560
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,947
My dad had this mantra.

561
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,785
"Be like stone, never cry."

562
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,353
If I got emotional, or upset,

563
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:40,865
he'd repeat it, "Be
like stone, never cry."

564
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,104
It made me stronger, which
wasn't always a good thing.

565
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,805
Spent my life
living behind a wall.

566
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,772
Which meant your mom got
to live with that wall as well.

567
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,778
And...

568
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:04,551
When we split up,
I felt like a failure.

569
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,288
Moving away helped
me hide from that.

570
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,201
My father's voice
is still in my head.

571
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,907
But I'm working on
getting it to be quiet.

572
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,870
I love you, Kellan.

573
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,049
I always will.

574
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,332
Kellan!

575
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,167
Mom.

576
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,305
Are you okay?

577
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,647
I'm fine. I... I helped
deliver a baby.

578
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,476
Oh!

579
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,320
He was amazing.

580
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,427
It's good to see you, Mia.

581
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,859
How was it in there?

582
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,464
The guy I worked
on didn't make it.

583
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,194
Merry Christmas.

584
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,799
I don't think I'll
forget this one.

585
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,638
Me neither.

586
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,472
The idea of you not being
around wasn't okay with me.

587
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,043
Who would I drink bourbon with?

588
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,559
I think my bourbon days are
behind me for a little while.

589
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,519
I'll wait.

590
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,203
Shaun!

591
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,395
Hi.

592
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,509
You must be exhausted.

593
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,339
And hungry.

594
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:50,280
All the sandwiches they
gave us had pickles in them.

595
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,781
Oh, that's no good.

596
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,515
How about we go to that
24-hour breakfast place

597
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,848
and get some pancakes?

598
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,423
I would like that very much.

599
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,089
- Hello, Dr. Glassman.
- Hello.

600
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,627
- I delivered a baby.
- Yes, we heard.

601
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,391
I'm sorry I couldn't drive
you to your appointment.

602
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,523
How did it go?

603
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,966
I have meningitis.

604
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:20,438
I have to have surgery later today
to fix the CSF leak in my head.

605
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,711
I thought you should know.

606
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,546
That's good.

607
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,090
Meningitis is definitely
not as bad as cancer.

608
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:37,460
It also explains
your memory-loss.

609
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:39,758
Now you can get
your license back.

610
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:44,630
Shaun, would you mind
if Glassy gave you a hug?

611
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,838
I think that would be very nice.

612
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,781
I'm very proud of you.

613
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:05,746
<i>Have yourself a
merry little Christmas</i>

614
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,193
<i>Let your heart be light</i>

615
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:20,667
<i>From now on our
troubles will be out of sight</i>
