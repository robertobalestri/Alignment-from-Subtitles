1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,668
Murphy, single vehicle
car crash incoming.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,282
Two victims, husband
and wife. You want in?

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,318
Yes, I would like
that very much.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,420
Motor vehicle accident.
The other victim's behind us.

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,322
Forty-one year old female,
lacerations to her face,

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,656
contusions on her
chest and abdomen.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,445
She was behind the wheel
when she lost consciousness.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,884
She has three centimeters
full-thickness scalp lac

9
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,215
extending to her hairline.

10
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,524
Heart rate's normal.

11
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,839
Possible internal bleeding.
What are we doing, Dr. Browne?

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,040
- Fast ultrasound.
- Get on it.

13
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,556
Forty-five year old male.
Superficial abrasions to the neck.

14
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,693
Appears that he's
dislocated his hip.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,164
The affected limb is in position
of flexion and internally rotated.

16
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,971
We need to relocate the hip.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,067
Do a Captain Morgan.

18
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,746
How are we doing?

19
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,344
There is a lot of free fluid
in the recto-uterine space

20
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,887
and Morison's pouch
from internal bleeding.

21
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,319
Let's get her into OR One.

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,415
When you're done,
join us, Dr. Murphy.

23
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,525
Okay.

24
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,487
Where are they taking my wife?

25
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,159
She has internal bleeding, so
they are taking her to surgery.

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,067
Today is our
10-year anniversary.

27
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,695
Tell them not to let her die.
That woman is my everything.

28
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,772
She's all I have.

29
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,722
We use a small tool
called a laparoscope,

30
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,044
kind of like a metal straw.

31
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,912
We go in through
here, here and here.

32
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,950
Everything gets tucked
back inside and we're done.

33
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,817
It only leaves a
few small scars.

34
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,601
How long have
you had a stiff neck?

35
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,218
Uh, couple days.

36
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,421
Been feeling tired
or have back pain?

37
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,088
Little bit of both, I guess.

38
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,966
Going to test your reflexes.

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,641
Left patella reflex is
minimally responsive.

40
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,907
What's that mean?

41
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,358
We might have to
postpone the surgery.

42
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,427
We're gonna run some
tests. If everything checks out,

43
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,080
and we figure out why you have
pain and fatigue, we'll operate.

44
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:05,825
Come here, buddy.

45
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,727
Spleen and liver
are fully packed.

46
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,130
Where's all this blood
coming from? Suction.

47
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,766
- How's the hubby?
- His hip has been relocated.

48
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,400
He asked me to tell
you not to let her die.

49
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,000
She's his everything.

50
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,273
Duly noted. Retract the stomach.

51
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,143
I can't find the bleed.

52
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,215
Hold on. The left
fallopian tube is swollen.

53
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,017
And there's a large
defect in it. It's ruptured.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,638
Our labs came back negative,

55
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,531
but Finn's fatigue and left leg weakness
suggests a viral or bacterial infection.

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,294
Well, he hasn't had a fever.

57
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,131
Other than the stiff
neck, he's been fine.

58
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,795
Are his vaccines up to date?

59
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,067
Your pediatrician
didn't send us anything.

60
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,641
He's never been vaccinated.

61
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,046
But my niece came down with
long-term intestinal problems

62
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,414
after getting a shot.

63
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,545
We did a lot of research.

64
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,486
Things have only
gotten scarier since.

65
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,983
Not really.

66
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,324
Weakness and fever
might mean polio.

67
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,660
- If you guys traveled outside the US...
- We don't travel.

68
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,064
And we reduce his
exposure to infectious disease

69
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,344
by putting him
in a public school

70
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,064
where he's surrounded
by vaccinated kids.

71
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,399
That's herd immunity.

72
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,049
By surrounding him
with vaccinated kids,

73
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,905
you're tacitly admitting
that vaccines work.

74
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,486
We're not saying they don't
work. It's just not worth the risk.

75
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,446
They save millions of lives.
You're endangering your...

76
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,140
I get it.

77
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,684
I've worked with other families
who feel the same way as you.

78
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,344
It comes down to
personal choice.

79
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,048
Dr. Park, may I consult
with you outside?

80
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,254
Excuse us.

81
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,392
They're gonna
be here for a while.

82
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,337
If I gain their trust, I can work to
change their views from the inside.

83
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,259
They're part of a movement
with social media support

84
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,395
and bogus research
to feed their beliefs.

85
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,932
You want to help?
Send them away.

86
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,873
"Do no harm."

87
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,071
I'm not sending them
home with a sick kid.

88
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,607
One of my best friends refused
to vaccinate her 1-year-old boy.

89
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,419
I told her she was crazy.

90
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,548
Three pediatricians
refused to take her on.

91
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,285
She was rejected so often

92
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,190
that she was finally
considering vaccinations.

93
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,964
And then some idiot
decided to do no harm,

94
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,764
that it was better that Carol's
kid had a doctor than a vaccine.

95
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,376
A year later, the kid
contracted whooping cough.

96
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,049
A month after that, she
was planning his funeral.

97
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,090
I'm sorry for your friend.

98
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,987
But we don't have a choice.
He's already a patient.

99
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,691
Let's test him for polio.

100
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,453
Your wife is gonna be fine.

101
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,912
She had a ruptured
fallopian tube.

102
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,277
Mr. Williams, unfortunately,
we couldn't save the pregnancy.

103
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,344
The fertilized egg
implanted outside the uterus.

104
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,082
Pregnancy?

105
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,818
It was fairly early.

106
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,725
She may not have told you,
may not have even known herself.

107
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,955
That can't be.

108
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,363
I had a vasectomy 10 years
ago, right before we got married.

109
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,615
I need to see my wife.

110
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,819
Mr. Williams,
that's not possible.

111
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,856
She's, uh... She's
sleeping. She needs to rest.

112
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,357
There is no way she was
pregnant. You guys made a mistake.

113
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,451
- No.
- We didn't make a mistake.

114
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,499
She's not like that.

115
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,296
If she gets the wrong
change for coffee,

116
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,337
she's driving back 20
minutes to make it right.

117
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,894
And the sex...

118
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,538
We haven't been this
active since our honeymoon.

119
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,843
Maybe the vasectomy failed.

120
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:23,581
I'm sorry, but a vasectomy
doesn't just fail after 10 years.

121
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,879
It is more likely she got pregnant
from someone who is not you.

122
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,357
Dr. Claire Browne is being
courted by other residency programs.

123
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,596
Heard it from the president
of Kaiser, San Jose.

124
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,639
He was surprised to hear
that she was leaving. So was I.

125
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,904
Just 'cause she's taking meetings
doesn't mean she's leaving.

126
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,378
When I was a resident, if
someone was willing to buy me food,

127
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,312
I would meet with
them almost anywhere.

128
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,382
She's approaching them. I don't
like being blindsided, Marcus.

129
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,114
Well, this is news to me.

130
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,656
But I also didn't know I had to
report human resources issues

131
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,521
to the vice president
of the foundation.

132
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,491
Why isn't she happy?

133
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,925
She went over Melendez's
head. Now he's freezing her out.

134
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,401
And I have no interest in
getting in the middle of that.

135
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,370
You're the president.
It's your call.

136
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,134
But I wonder how it would
look if Saint Bonaventure

137
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,440
lost two of its surgical residents
with diverse backgrounds

138
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,706
in less than a year.

139
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,012
<i>Is it polio?</i>

140
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,620
We're still waiting
on the results.

141
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,454
Yeah, I was talking to my colleague,
and I realized I owe you an apology.

142
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,926
I lied to you.

143
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,534
I had this good
friend I grew up with.

144
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,473
She had a one-year-old boy
she didn't want to vaccinate.

145
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,002
She couldn't find
a pediatrician.

146
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,711
Do you guys use alternative
medicine? Homeopathic? Herbs?

147
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,976
Homeopathic.

148
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,279
That's what Carol,
my friend, did, too.

149
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,519
Unfortunately, I...

150
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:15,084
I guess they didn't work. The boy
came down with whooping cough.

151
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,862
The coughing got worse.

152
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,366
And one night, the boy
just stopped breathing.

153
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,237
I know you know this stuff.

154
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,071
You know how dangerous
these diseases are.

155
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,711
But it's different for me.

156
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,511
It's different when you
see a friend go through this.

157
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,354
Please reconsider.

158
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,088
Dr. Reznick.

159
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,336
Do you have the test results?

160
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,306
Finn is negative for polio.

161
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,638
But given the leg weakness and
how the spine controls movement,

162
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,042
we'd like to do an MRI.

163
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:13,417
Thank you for your advice,
and we are sorry for your friend.

164
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,519
But our opinion hasn't changed.

165
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,700
Any fatigue? Skin problems?

166
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,536
No and no.

167
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,836
Difficulty swallowing?

168
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,310
No. And no dry mouth.
No soreness of the jaw.

169
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,380
No lymphedema. No seizures.

170
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,007
- Do you want to sit here and do my job?
- I could.

171
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,884
Radiation is going
fine. Just a little nausea.

172
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,748
Is that why you forgot
where you left your wallet?

173
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,453
Oh, stop! People forget
where they put their wallets.

174
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
People do that.

175
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:59,531
It was just a little memory
lapse. A slip, nothing more.

176
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,803
Have you had any other
memory slips recently?

177
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,502
Not that I remember.

178
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,565
No!

179
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,778
You're lying.

180
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:18,377
And you know that I know you are
lying. What do you think is gained by that?

181
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,317
I think I avoid you
blowing out of proportion

182
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,322
the fact that I forgot where I
parked my car the other day.

183
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,951
Once. And again,
not unique to radiation.

184
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,529
I want to do a
mini-mental status exam.

185
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,961
Not gonna happen.

186
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,994
Would you let your
patients treat you this way?

187
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,124
- Yeah.
- No.

188
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,225
- Yeah.
- No.

189
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,513
Well, then, again,
you're not me.

190
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:41,474
Thank God. If this is memory loss,
it would impact your coordination.

191
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,134
Also, your ability to
juggle multiple tasks.

192
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,522
You would need more in-home
care, and your driving would have to...

193
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,105
I'm not gonna give up my car

194
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,208
because I might have
misplaced my remote.

195
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,009
And I didn't misplace my remote.

196
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,179
I know where it is.
It's on the coffee table

197
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,258
next to the <i>National Geographic</i>
from June of last year,

198
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:03,092
page 74, two-thirds of the way
through an article on medicine in Hawaii...

199
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,792
Haiti. Medicine in Haiti.

200
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,792
If anything changes,
don't forget to tell me.

201
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,127
- Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

202
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,137
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

203
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,596
You stole my story.

204
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,038
It's a good story.

205
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,168
Stories don't change minds.

206
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,008
Stories are the only
things that change minds.

207
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,241
We're compelled by
fear more than reason.

208
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,351
What these people
fear is doing something

209
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,750
that will hurt their child.

210
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,344
So they do nothing,
thinking that inoculates them.

211
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,481
They won't change.

212
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,891
Care to wager on that?

213
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,895
I'll take your money.

214
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,226
Not money, liquor.

215
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,267
I like me some whiskey.
Saint Elison 23-year bourbon.

216
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,826
Fine. You will owe me a
2002 Chateau Montpouillan.

217
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,463
The blue bottle, not the black.

218
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,444
Wow.

219
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,644
Never seen that before.

220
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,879
Our boy has two spinal cords.

221
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,553
It's called diastematomyelia.

222
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,826
It's a congenital disorder in which
part of the spinal cord is split in two.

223
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,126
Congenital?

224
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,065
So, he's had it since birth?

225
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,764
Why didn't anyone see it?

226
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,473
It's rare. And with
no obvious symptoms,

227
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,508
doctors generally
have no reason to look.

228
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,904
The problem is,
when Finn hit puberty,

229
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,912
the split spinal cords
rapidly stretched.

230
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,244
The two strands got
tethered to his spinal canal

231
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,908
which led to the
weakness in his leg.

232
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,714
As he grows, he's put
at risk for paraplegia.

233
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,451
Now, we can go
in and untangle it.

234
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,491
But any time you're
dealing with the spinal cord,

235
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,026
- things can get complicated.
- What are the dangers?

236
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,628
He could become quadriplegic.

237
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,740
But the fact that he's presenting
with weakness right now

238
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,495
makes me think that
this is progressing rapidly.

239
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,330
I don't think we
have a choice here.

240
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,005
Okay.

241
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,874
It's not possible.

242
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,171
- Did you step out on me?
- That's absurd.

243
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,773
You're my everything. What
could I get from anyone else?

244
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,648
You could get pregnant.

245
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,778
I didn't have an affair.

246
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,982
Maybe one of Todd's
swimmers got through.

247
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,188
I heard it happens. It
must have happened.

248
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,464
It's unlikely, but I
suppose not impossible.

249
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,530
We can test Todd's sperm count.

250
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,012
Uh, Dr. Park?

251
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,952
I had a long talk
with my husband.

252
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,219
We want to vaccinate Finn.

253
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,553
That's great, Bethany.
Your son will thank you.

254
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,026
We want you to do
it, as soon as possible.

255
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,224
Uh, unless you can't
because of the surgery.

256
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,164
Oh, it shouldn't be a problem.

257
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,994
We can start with the
first round right away.

258
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,521
How much is a bottle of
Saint Elison 23-year bourbon?

259
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,225
Five hundred a bottle.

260
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,196
- $500?
- $500.

261
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,597
Park...

262
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,234
Mind if I join you?

263
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,662
Of course.

264
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,406
I know you haven't been pleased

265
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,036
with the way things have
progressed with Dr. Melendez.

266
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,242
You pushed me to
be more assertive.

267
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,120
And I'm not going to apologize
for doing what I thought,

268
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,283
and still believe, was right.

269
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,427
Enjoy your meal.

270
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,355
Saint Bonaventure will soon be
a surgical center of excellence.

271
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,544
We'll be able to select every
unique and amazing surgery

272
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,763
to come through San Jose.

273
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,532
It could open you up to a
whole new range of experiences.

274
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,125
- I'd hate for you to miss out.
- I would hate to miss out, too.

275
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,711
But when Melendez
cut me from his service,

276
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,643
he cut my education in half.

277
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,973
He will take you back.

278
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:52,911
If I grovel.

279
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,821
- I have no doubt...
- You haven't spoken to him, have you?

280
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,151
Why come to me first?

281
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,627
What, you figure I'm the
path of least resistance?

282
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:10,131
I came to you first
because you're a resident.

283
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,238
Even though you are valued,

284
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,639
you're still earning your
place at this hospital.

285
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,043
If you care about your job,
you will speak to Melendez.

286
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,320
I have nothing to say.

287
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,430
Ow!

288
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,364
Yeah. But chicken
pox feels even worse.

289
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,269
That's it.

290
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,225
- I need to pee.
- Wait, you should let me help you...

291
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,696
Don't get up. Stay
where you are.

292
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,689
I need a lift team and have
them bring a backboard!

293
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,375
I can't feel my
leg. The left one.

294
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,011
- How about that?
- No.

295
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,053
- Can you wiggle your toes?
- I'm trying.

296
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,348
Page Dr. Melendez.
We need an OR now!

297
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,354
Hello.

298
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,562
Where's Todd?

299
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,571
He's in the cafeteria. He's
waiting for his sperm count results.

300
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,905
I do love him.

301
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,874
You look very
young for a doctor.

302
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,854
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean to... Wait.

303
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,095
I was just thanking
you for saving my life.

304
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,311
Todd's sperm count is zero.

305
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,245
Do I have to tell him that
his wife kissed me on the lips?

306
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,691
She was thanking
me for saving her life.

307
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,058
I helped save her life,
too. Where's my kiss?

308
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,495
This isn't funny. That kiss
could be considered assault.

309
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,564
Oh, come on.

310
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,709
If the genders were reversed,

311
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,613
we'd be having a serious
conversation right now.

312
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,965
What about it, Murphy?
You wanna file a report?

313
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Hmm...

314
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,808
I'll have to think about that.

315
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,472
Until then, tell Todd
about the test results.

316
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,410
You can keep the
kiss to yourself.

317
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,121
Dr. Park, nice
drilling off the laminae.

318
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,721
Dr. Reznick, carefully
open the dura in the midline

319
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,129
overlying the cords.

320
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,926
We need to separate the
cords from the midline dural sacs.

321
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,635
- A - $500 bottle of whiskey?

322
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,972
You should have checked
before we agreed to...

323
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,118
He's losing

324
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,453
his motor and sensory
evoked potentials.

325
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,641
Stop. We need to figure
out a way to dissect the cleft

326
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,739
free from the
split, and remove it

327
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,575
without putting pressure
on the spinal cords.

328
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,984
Suggestions?

329
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,279
We should use the laser to
cut any tethering adhesions

330
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,449
- before removing the septum.
- Very good.

331
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,004
Excuse me. I have
your test results.

332
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:33,872
Okay.

333
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,674
Were you gonna leave me, too?

334
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,643
Not that I really
care at this point...

335
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,978
What are you talking about?
The doctors screwed up.

336
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,312
We didn't.

337
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,148
- Then the lab must have screwed up.
- The bank?

338
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,688
The bank, too? It's all
just a big conspiracy?

339
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,689
Our medical insurance was canceled,
so I started making some calls.

340
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,792
We have $400 left in savings.

341
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,631
Checking's empty. The
retirement account's drained...

342
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,501
I don't know, it
must be identity theft.

343
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,983
- Dawn, stop lying to me...
- I lost my debit card a few months ago.

344
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,374
Look me in the eyes and
tell me you didn't cheat.

345
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,872
That you didn't take the money.

346
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,751
Oh, my God.

347
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,825
I'm so, so sorry.

348
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,664
How? Why?

349
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,696
I tried to stop, but I
just couldn't help myself.

350
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,217
Todd... Toddy!

351
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,113
Why did you marry Todd?

352
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,782
Because I love him.

353
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:37,386
He's the best thing
to come into my life.

354
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,266
He's...

355
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,235
I couldn't imagine
living without him.

356
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,146
Why did you kiss me?

357
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,256
I don't know.

358
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,693
It was a mistake.

359
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,299
I know why you kissed me.

360
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,871
I'm not excusing her actions,

361
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:31,217
but the deep brain stimulation
surgery was a bold move.

362
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,862
Would you have gotten to where
you are without a few bold moves?

363
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,479
I never broke protocol.

364
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,022
I looked for opportunities
and I took advantage of them.

365
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,317
And now you have
another opportunity,

366
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,493
an opportunity to show
leadership through forgiveness.

367
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,559
And more importantly, an
opportunity to show leadership

368
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,328
through not looking like an ass.

369
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,336
Come on, Neil. This is
like David and Goliath,

370
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,242
except David
forgot his slingshot,

371
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,642
and Goliath is beating
the crap out of her.

372
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,086
Unless this is resolved,

373
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,099
you'll make it harder for me
to make you Chief of Surgery.

374
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,854
Hell, it'll make it harder
for me to go to bat for you

375
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,485
when even bigger issues come up.

376
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,307
I decided not to press legal charges
against our patient for kissing me.

377
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,505
She has a legal defense.

378
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,744
Her actions were caused
by a medical condition.

379
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,409
Just now, she had an involuntary
muscle movement in her hand.

380
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,183
A spasm? That's all?

381
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:48,887
Yes. That means the kissing and cheating
were caused by a neurological problem.

382
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,289
Possibly a tumor.

383
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,528
It's also medically possible
that she's just a jerk that has a tic.

384
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,967
Yes, but Todd is the best
thing to come into her life.

385
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,710
Okay. Go test your theory.

386
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:06,937
Thank you.

387
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,617
Can you feel this?

388
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,354
- Yeah.
- Good.

389
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,825
Now we have to do a very
complicated scientific test.

390
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,094
Can you wiggle your toes?

391
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,626
Good job.

392
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,814
Finn, your temperature's
rising. How are you feeling?

393
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,435
I've got the chills.

394
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,668
Is this from the surgery?
Or is it something else?

395
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,014
Your heart rate's jumping, too.

396
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,785
- His pressure's dropping fast.
- What's... What's wrong?

397
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,410
Sorry, Shaun. I'm
with Lim on this one.

398
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,747
We are not going
to find anything.

399
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:54,793
She was happy with Todd. Todd
says they had a good sex life.

400
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,328
But cheating is
about more than sex.

401
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,523
Maybe her emotional
needs weren't being met.

402
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,998
Maybe she was going
through a personal crisis.

403
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,702
I left home with Steve
when I wasn't happy.

404
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,698
Why doesn't she leave?

405
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,867
Money, fear, shame.

406
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,821
There are plenty of reasons
why she'd rather stay.

407
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,405
She said kissing
me was a mistake.

408
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,313
She had no reason
to lie to me, Claire.

409
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,662
Shaun, I know you want to
believe there's another explanation,

410
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,052
but sometimes people,

411
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,385
even the people you
love and trust, betray you.

412
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,196
Look. No tumors.
The brain is clean.

413
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,677
It's sad.

414
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:55,684
The world is sad
and very complicated.

415
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,586
I wish it wasn't.

416
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,067
The MRI scan shows there is
nothing wrong with your brain.

417
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,605
You are just a liar.

418
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,885
Everything was good.

419
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:40,625
These last few months with
Todd... It was like our honeymoon.

420
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,100
Then some client flirts with me.

421
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,240
Now, here I am.

422
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,953
Shaun.

423
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,764
I'd like you to draw
the face of a clock.

424
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:13,965
Please.

425
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,482
You do have a tumor.

426
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,662
There's definitely something.

427
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,061
I think we were just
looking in the wrong place.

428
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,509
- Hey, Shaun.
- Hello.

429
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,040
Can I buy you lunch?

430
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,945
No, I'm not hungry,
and it's not my lunchtime,

431
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,713
and I have to get ready for
an important MRI. Goodbye.

432
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:11,188
Wait, wait, wait. Can I...
Can I talk to you for a second?

433
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,172
I had a little
incident yesterday.

434
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:33,771
I may be experiencing some
memory loss due to the radiation.

435
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,644
Yes, memory loss is very
common with radiation.

436
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,378
I can book you an MRI after
I'm finished with my patient.

437
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,817
No. No cognitive
tests. Not here.

438
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,249
There are plenty of other hospitals
in San Jose that can test you.

439
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,553
No hospitals,
Shaun, no hospitals.

440
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,694
I can administer these
tests by myself, okay?

441
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,527
I just... I just need your help.

442
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,578
Come to my apartment tonight.

443
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,308
We will find out if you're
losing your memory. Goodbye.

444
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,781
Finn has a staph
infection at the surgical site.

445
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,650
But we gave him oxygen and
fluids. He's stable and resting.

446
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,108
He will have to go back into
surgery to wash out the wound.

447
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,221
I want to assure you
this has nothing to do

448
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,560
with any side effects
due to Finn's vaccination.

449
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,061
- His what?
- His first round of vaccinations.

450
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,896
You vaccinated my son?

451
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,506
I asked Dr. Park to do it.

452
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,840
Without telling me?

453
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,911
I was scared.

454
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,283
If Finn got sick...

455
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,524
If he brought something
home to the baby...

456
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,788
We talked about
this. You promised.

457
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,595
Bethany?

458
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,805
The second MRI confirmed
the tumor is in your chest,

459
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,438
not in your brain,

460
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,983
but it produces a protein
that travels to the brain,

461
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,448
causing mental disorders.

462
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,453
Including loss of inhibitions.

463
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:30,189
The betrayal was medical, not
personal. Reason and intent matter.

464
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,729
You should hug her. Kiss her.

465
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:44,207
She's going to have surgery
which will be dangerous.

466
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:52,984
All that missing money, it didn't go
to hotels or... Or weekend getaways.

467
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,846
I've been donating it.

468
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,886
Animal shelters,
Feed the Children...

469
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,756
Every time I saw an
ad, I'd pull out my wallet.

470
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,462
I couldn't help it.

471
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,767
You couldn't say no to anything?

472
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,407
How many?

473
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,375
When we take the tumor out,

474
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,713
there is a very good chance her
inhibitions will return to normal.

475
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,179
How many affairs?

476
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:34,525
Four.

477
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,098
Did, um...

478
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,729
Did, um...

479
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,271
Did you enjoy it?

480
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,040
In the moment.

481
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,979
But the minute it was over...

482
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,800
Mom and Dad haven't visited
me together since yesterday.

483
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,472
Have they told you anything?

484
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,903
This has nothing to do with
you, if that's what you're thinking.

485
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,282
It's about the vaccination.

486
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,618
Dad didn't know?

487
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,927
So I'm not gonna get measles, but
my parents are gonna get divorced?

488
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,225
- I'm sure once they start talking...
- Are you gonna talk to them?

489
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,095
I'm sorry. This is between them.

490
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,470
The vax thing you wouldn't
let drop, but this doesn't matter?

491
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,606
My mom's pregnant and
my dad's not talking to her.

492
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,535
And it's your fault.

493
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,824
Dr. Browne, I've been
asked to speak to you.

494
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,340
You're an excellent doctor
and I respect your skills...

495
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,491
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,663
I should never have undermined
your authority the way I did.

497
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,464
I was wrong.

498
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,010
- I appreciate that.
- But I don't mean it.

499
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,512
You've been sent here
on an impossible mission.

500
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,882
Senior staff have basically
ordered you to take me back.

501
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:47,248
So if you don't take me
back, you're screwed.

502
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,193
If you do take me
back, you look weak.

503
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,416
I don't know what decision you've
made or what you were about to say,

504
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:58,400
but if I tell you I'm
sorry, it gives you cover.

505
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,737
So, this is me giving you cover.

506
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,047
I'll see you tomorrow.

507
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,841
We got the tumor
out. She's fine.

508
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,814
I'm glad you didn't leave.

509
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,884
I was afraid she would die.

510
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,053
But I don't think
I can forgive her.

511
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,195
I'm not sure "forgive"
is even the right word.

512
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,728
You've never been
attracted to other women?

513
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,564
Of course not.

514
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,799
You don't check
anyone out at the beach?

515
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,237
You see a girl on the
street in tight jeans?

516
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,540
I check them out.

517
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,080
I don't jump them.

518
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,976
I don't even want to jump them.

519
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:32,764
Your wife acted on every
single temptation she had,

520
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,628
every single ugly,
stupid temptation.

521
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,137
But she never left you.

522
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,407
The one thing you know
for sure, through all of that,

523
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:49,475
she was never even tempted
to walk away from you.

524
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,680
She never stopped loving you.

525
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,845
You know, I knew this couple.

526
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,718
They had a child.

527
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,323
They were happy
and building a life.

528
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:48,630
One day, the husband found out
that the wife hadn't been honest.

529
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,141
It broke their trust.

530
00:36:54,946 --> 00:37:01,580
And instead of working it out,
they let the deception fester.

531
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,052
Eventually, the husband
moved out, moved away,

532
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,595
barely sees his kid.

533
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,732
I don't need any
more of your parables.

534
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,367
You and your stories
are the reason I'm here.

535
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,005
You're here because
you choose to be here.

536
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,055
Was that even true? That story.

537
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,728
No.

538
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,170
It's done?

539
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,076
Yes, the tumor
has been resected.

540
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,017
Would you like to kiss me?

541
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,790
Maybe a little.

542
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,988
But I'm not going to.

543
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,122
That's a very good sign.

544
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,838
That's a very good sign.

545
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,063
Measles kill.
Broken homes don't.

546
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,999
Go to a bar. Let off some steam.

547
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,737
I'm going to the range.

548
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,443
- You have your own gun?
- I have three.

549
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,211
Can I come?

550
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,148
- Are you gonna talk?
- No.

551
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,755
You pay for your own ammo.

552
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,524
- Hi, Shaun.
- Hello.

553
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,833
No Lea?

554
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,898
She's out drinking with friends.
Other friends. I'm her friend.

555
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,910
But I didn't want to go. So
I'm watching Albert the fish.

556
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,879
Okay. I brought some tests.

557
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,982
- Where did I get my couch?
- What?

558
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,518
It's a memory test.

559
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:25,045
Hopkins verbal learning,
COWA, these are memory tests.

560
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,149
Some of the
questions are harder.

561
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,452
- We are going to do this right.
- Where did I get my couch?

562
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,859
Okay. Fine,

563
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,264
you got your couch from the
bus you lived in with your brother.

564
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,034
Who gave me my bookshelf?

565
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,136
The town librarian. Jennifer.

566
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,972
And my lamp?

567
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,637
Do you know?

568
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,737
A teacher. Shannon.

569
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:54,149
No, that's wrong. Her name was
Sheryl. What kind of teacher was she?

570
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,346
Sheryl, Shannon...
You never told me that.

571
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,389
- Yes, I did.
- I'm pretty sure you did not.

572
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,456
Oh.

573
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,257
What's my brother's name?

574
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:08,289
Oh, come on, Shaun. Really?

575
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,900
This is stupid. I
know your brother's...

576
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,109
Your brother's name is Sam.

577
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:35,993
It's Steve.

578
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,327
You're losing your memory.
