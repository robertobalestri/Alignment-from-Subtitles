1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,981
I want to be your friend again.

2
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,712
Why, Shaun? What happened?

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,948
People need friends.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,188
Well... Yeah, they do.

5
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,818
But you said you wanted me
to stop interfering, remember?

6
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:32,333
You wanted space. You wanted
to make your own mistakes.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,368
I need a friend more
than I need space.

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,809
You were a good
mentor, and a good friend.

9
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,846
Well, thank you, Shaun.

10
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,718
You don't know how much it
means to me to hear you say that.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,080
But I think...

12
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,923
I think you may
need a new mentor.

13
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,924
I'm dying.

14
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,144
Twelve to eighteen months.

15
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,547
And I'd appreciate it if you
didn't tell anyone, okay?

16
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,779
- I will in my own time.
- Okay. Have you had a full work-up?

17
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,817
Yes, of course.

18
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,120
It could be a secondary tumor

19
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,353
metastasized to your
brain from somewhere else.

20
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,722
It's the only tumor found.

21
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,788
It could be an inflammatory
or infectious process.

22
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,857
- It was a tumor, Shaun.
- You should get a second opinion.

23
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,062
Shaun, I've been a
neurosurgeon for 30 years.

24
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,867
I think that qualifies
as a second opinion.

25
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,805
You should get a second opinion.

26
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,471
- You have to know whether or not...
- All right, Shaun.

27
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,244
- I'll get a second opinion, okay?
- Okay.

28
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,944
Can I go to work now?

29
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,519
Okay, Doctor, what's
your diagnosis?

30
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,460
- I'm drunk.
- Not you, other doctor.

31
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,755
Well, given the
degree of the rotation,

32
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,063
and the fact that the
break is almost compound,

33
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,101
I'd say we're dealing with a
bimalleolar or trimalleolar fracture.

34
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,002
Very good. What else?

35
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,097
Um...

36
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,601
Color?

37
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,113
Blood flow's restricted.
His foot's dying.

38
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,714
Oh, no.

39
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,809
I'm gonna have to
reset it now. Hold his leg.

40
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,981
- No. No, no.
- No, it's okay.

41
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,589
This is just gonna take a second.
I need you to count to three. One...

42
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,251
One, two...

43
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,524
Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?

44
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,635
How long has his leg been like
this, and how exactly did it happen?

45
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,139
Well, he's been like
that since I found him.

46
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,108
He probably, like, tripped
over a curb or something,

47
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,644
because that's where he was.

48
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,543
Any reason you felt
the need to tell me twice

49
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,206
that you found him like this?

50
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,647
Dr. Park, the boy's going
to surgery. You're going with.

51
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,214
Don't go anywhere.

52
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,428
Shouldn't I be asleep for this?

53
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,663
Well, your blood alcohol
level complicates anesthesia,

54
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,798
and we think you have a concussion,
so, we wanna keep you responsive.

55
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,739
We did give you a
regional nerve block,

56
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,971
so, you shouldn't feel anything.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,878
Oh, cool.

58
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,794
Bend the LCP plate about two
degrees on the proximal end.

59
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,877
Contouring pliers.

60
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,793
BP's dropping.
Heart-rate's rising.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,762
Let's tube him. IV fluids
and phenylephrine, stat.

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,675
We need to abort until we get a
handle on what else is going on.

63
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,930
Give me full body CT, full
blood panels and an echo.

64
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,428
I think Jared and I may be
able to dig up an answer quicker.

65
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,766
Great. Get on it.

66
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,604
Come up with anything?

67
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,503
Neither did I.

68
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,477
I had a friend, a
neurosurgeon at SF Muni,

69
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,105
she looked at the scan, she
came to the same diagnosis.

70
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,812
Shaun, I have an
inoperable glioma, okay?

71
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,527
I think you should
go back to work, yes?

72
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,672
I need to go to work.

73
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,681
- Be reasonable.
- Beg your pardon?

74
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,376
Be reasonable.

75
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,996
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

76
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,044
It'll be clear.

77
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,201
- What the hell happened to Caden?
- I don't know. He twisted his ankle.

78
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,969
You lied to me before,
you're lying to me now,

79
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,154
you spoiled little coward.

80
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,392
Hey, hey. Be reasonable.

81
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,901
His friend's hurt, he's scared,
and you're freaking him out.

82
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,477
He's angry, but he's not wrong.

83
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,641
Caden's in bad shape,
and we don't know why.

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,548
We need to know what happened.

85
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,590
No, no, no. Don't worry
about him. Talk to me.

86
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,318
You tell me the truth.

87
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,728
You won't get in trouble,
you'll just help a friend.

88
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:38,991
All right.

89
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,033
We were pledging,

90
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:46,904
and there's this, wheel-of-torture
thing you gotta do for initiation.

91
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,941
- "Torture"?
- But it's mostly stupid stuff, dude.

92
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,209
It's like drink a cup of olive oil,
or eat a tablespoon of cinnamon.

93
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,949
- And what did Caden land on?
- Laundry.

94
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,278
He had to do laundry?

95
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,880
No, like, he had to eat
those laundry things.

96
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,082
As many as he
could in 30 seconds.

97
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,820
Detergent? Eat detergent?
And how many did he have?

98
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,592
I don't know, like,
six. Maybe seven?

99
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,062
He ate detergent.

100
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,160
Could've burned a hole
through his esophagus,

101
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,762
or his stomach and intestines.

102
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,912
- Catch that bleeder, please.
- Let's hope he doesn't breed.

103
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,379
What, he isn't an idiot?

104
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,547
We have healthy bowel attached
to healthy bowel. Let's close him up.

105
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,749
Dr. Melendez?

106
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,054
The trauma SOD is asking
for you in OR number two.

107
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,684
We've got an
emergency thoracotomy.

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,695
Who can give me the
remaining steps for closing?

109
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,074
Cut anchoring sutures, clear
laps and reposition the bowel.

110
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,938
Remove clamps from the
duodenal resection site,

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
keeping clear of
the underlying aorta.

112
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,469
Close the fascia using a
looped-O monofilament.

113
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,573
Close the dermal layer,
then re-approximate the skin.

114
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:59,468
Also, you need to ensure no omentum
is caught in the fascial suture line.

115
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,808
Close him up.
Murphy, you're lead.

116
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,119
Clearing laps.

117
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,622
I will hold the repaired
segment in place,

118
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,027
while you run the bowel for me.

119
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,438
Bowel is clear and
ready to be repositioned.

120
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,613
Shaun... Shaun, is
everything all right?

121
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,648
- I lost something.
- In the cavity?

122
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,324
No, but I know where it is now.

123
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,999
Shaun?

124
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,699
I left my scalpel
here earlier today.

125
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,072
You should get
diffusion tensor imaging.

126
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,307
A DTI?

127
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,814
Brain masses are difficult
to diagnose accurately.

128
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,015
You should get more imaging.

129
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,327
- People make mistakes.
- That's not gonna happen, Shaun.

130
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,229
My scalpel isn't here.

131
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,346
- What happened this time?
- He's got a bleed somewhere.

132
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,015
I want a capsule endoscopy to
check the entire length of the bowel

133
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,487
for bleeding and leaks. And get me
a coagulation and metabolic profile.

134
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,579
On it.

135
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,559
Dr. Glassman is dying.

136
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,097
What?

137
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,105
What do you mean?
He seemed fine.

138
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,299
They say he has a glioma.

139
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,138
That's a brain tumor.

140
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,640
And he won't do a DTI
scan to confirm the diagnosis.

141
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,835
Did he get a second opinion?

142
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,684
He has, but delayed or missed,

143
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:25,248
or incorrect diagnosis has an
occurrence rate of 10 to 20%.

144
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,657
Doctors make mistakes.

145
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,490
Shaun, I don't know
what you want me to do.

146
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,929
I want you to sit down.

147
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:38,331
That's what people say when they
want to tell you something important.

148
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,275
The part about him dying,
that wasn't the important part?

149
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,951
He won't listen to
me. He is stubborn.

150
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:00,153
- That, he is.
- Stubborn... He will listen to you.

151
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:05,857
Okay, you have known him longer,
you're his friend, he trusts you...

152
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,094
Shaun, I can't make
him do anything, either.

153
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,000
You're an attorney.

154
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:15,165
I'm not skilled at
lying, or manipulation.

155
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,938
So, you want me to what?

156
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,310
You want me to manipulate him?

157
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:26,146
You want me to use our
relationship and our history,

158
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,189
to trick him into doing this?

159
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,324
Yes, please.

160
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:43,035
I knew you wouldn't let him die.

161
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,904
Our patient has disseminated
intravascular coagulation.

162
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,168
Can anyone tell me
why that is very bad?

163
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,802
Blood clots form throughout the
blood vessels and rapidly deplete

164
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,575
the body's clotting factors,
thereby causing a systematic bleed.

165
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,410
It's also a catch-22.

166
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,247
If we treat the clotting, he might
end up with a terminal bleed.

167
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,564
And if we treat the bleeding,
he'll have a terminal clot.

168
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,783
So, how do we treat it?

169
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,847
We figure out the
cause. Treat the cause.

170
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,331
More damage from the detergent?

171
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,636
Margins were
clear. It's not that.

172
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,205
He could have a crush
injury from his ankle.

173
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,858
Or a bacterial infection he
picked up before or during surgery.

174
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,456
He might have been
set off by drug use.

175
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,899
Or, we did this to him.

176
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,899
And by we, I mean Shaun.

177
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,568
He spaced out in the OR when he
was closing. Kind of like he is now.

178
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,875
- I'm listening.
- Comforting. He wasn't focused.

179
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,325
He could've nicked a vessel,
which could have caused...

180
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,629
Okay, we're talking about Shaun.

181
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:36,015
Yeah, he's quiet, but he was
focused. He's always focused.

182
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,581
His stitches looked like they
came out of a sewing machine.

183
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,789
Okay, complications happen.

184
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,741
The kid was in pretty bad
shape when we got him.

185
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,891
Physician error is way down
on the list of likely causes.

186
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,195
Crush trauma being top.

187
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:52,364
Get him started on fresh frozen
plasma, and crystalloid fluids.

188
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,769
Yeah?

189
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,211
You got a second?

190
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:06,375
Well, that's an open question.
What can I do for you?

191
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,654
I got a patient with DIC.

192
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,883
One of the possible
causes is surgeon error.

193
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,389
- Your patient? Your error?
- Shaun's.

194
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,591
He got distracted during
surgery. Spaced out.

195
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:24,568
It's not like him. One place he
never misses a beat is the OR.

196
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,711
Is there anything going on
that I should know about?

197
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,844
- He got some bad news.
- About what?

198
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,778
It's a personal matter.

199
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,077
Shaun was distracted?

200
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,919
By a personal issue?
What, did Lea come back?

201
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,091
Does she have a new boyfriend?
Did his cable get cut off?

202
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,790
I have an inoperable glioma.

203
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,464
Eighteen months.

204
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,800
Aaron, I am so sorry.

205
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,372
Me, too.

206
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,111
Is there anything I can do?

207
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,615
I wish.

208
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,120
You should have told me.

209
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,691
Or at least, you
shouldn't have told him.

210
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,572
His coagulation factors are still
off. Crush trauma isn't the issue.

211
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,016
And his tox screen came
back clean. It's not drugs, either.

212
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,680
We don't know that. He's
had so many transfusions,

213
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,156
the blood in his veins isn't
the same blood he came in with.

214
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,835
The drugs could still be
in his organs, causing...

215
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,169
I get that you don't
wanna think that

216
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,371
this could be caused
by your friend...

217
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,024
The kid came directly from
a frat hazing, hammered.

218
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,895
What are the odds
he wasn't on drugs?

219
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,036
We should start IV midazolam and
sodium bicarbonate to counteract...

220
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,582
That's the treatment
for amphetamines.

221
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,866
If you're wrong, that could
cause a fatal arrhythmia.

222
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,266
I'll find out what
drugs he's on.

223
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,505
You're gonna find out by asking?

224
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,859
Blake was honest with me before.

225
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,395
It's a lot easier to be honest when
you're not confessing to a crime.

226
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,354
We don't have a lot
of choice in the matter.

227
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,918
That's not true.

228
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,962
- Thanks for doing this.
- Yeah, no worries.

229
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,223
Noticed it was cut
when I first saw you,

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,301
figured it should
get cleaned up.

231
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,201
Is it all right if I
draw some blood?

232
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,584
I just wanna make sure you
don't have any toxins or infections.

233
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,632
Sure.

234
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:51,444
So, the nurse said
that Caden has DIC.

235
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:53,878
Do you know what that is?

236
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,046
Mmm-mmm.

237
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,449
Well, in short, his body is clotting
and hemorrhaging at the same time.

238
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,632
If we can't figure out
what's causing it, he'll die.

239
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,598
If you could just hold
that there for me? All done.

240
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,235
Blake, buddy,
you're on something.

241
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,336
Your pupils are dilated and you're
sweating in a 68-degree room.

242
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,005
I can hand this
over to the cops,

243
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,447
or you can tell the truth
about what Caden's on.

244
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,178
Molly.

245
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,150
I would've told you
the truth if you'd asked.

246
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,692
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,131
You have time to talk?

248
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,330
- Shaun told you.
- He did, yeah.

249
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,597
I wish I would've
heard it from you.

250
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,436
Yeah, I'm sorry.

251
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,203
- We're friends.
- I get it.

252
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,287
- I wanna be there for you.
- What, are you mad at me?

253
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,941
Yes! I'm supposed
to be there for you.

254
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,143
To do what? To do what
exactly? Hold my hand?

255
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,685
Yes, if that's what's needed.

256
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,584
Okay, well, what I need
is to be left alone, okay?

257
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,591
Well, you told Shaun, so,
that was brilliant strategy.

258
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,958
Okay. Okay, I get it. Stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid. Okay?

259
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,554
Sometimes, when people are told
they are dying, they do stupid things.

260
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,625
Sometimes, people around
them do stupid things.

261
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,101
Shaun told you to come here

262
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,571
to try to convince me to
get more imaging, right?

263
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,214
Aaron, you can't stop fighting.

264
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:31,007
- Maddie wouldn't have wanted you...
- Don't, don't. Don't you dare.

265
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,920
Don't you dare.

266
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:40,683
What are you gonna say,
huh? That Maddie was a fighter?

267
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,032
Huh? That she never quit?

268
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,708
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,773
Thank you.

270
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,277
And you should get the DTI.

271
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,385
Not for you.

272
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,925
You've accepted your diagnosis,

273
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,220
Shaun hasn't.

274
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,859
He needs to.

275
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,236
Hey, Neil. I heard there was a
complication in one of your cases.

276
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,709
Caden Hauley?

277
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,711
"Heard"? Or you been
monitoring all of Murphy's cases?

278
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,976
I monitor all my
department's cases.

279
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,042
Eighteen-year-old with
DIC. Any idea what set it off?

280
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,415
Complications happen.

281
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,980
The kid was in pretty bad
shape when he got to us.

282
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,491
I'm also wondering why you
were in two surgeries at once.

283
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,563
You left three
first-years unattended?

284
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,024
You know we do
this all the time.

285
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,161
We couldn't function
efficiently if we didn't.

286
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,170
- Yeah. Hope Caden pulls through.
- Yeah.

287
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,781
You got a very
quick appointment.

288
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,784
I have connections, Shaun.

289
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,618
Why did you listen to
Jessica, but not me?

290
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,853
- Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too.
- Yes, but what did she tell you?

291
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,934
- I don't think this is a good time.
- When is a good time?

292
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,560
I have a lot to learn from you,

293
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,196
and if you're dying, less
than two years to learn.

294
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,210
Sorry to keep you waiting.

295
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,679
There were some
surprises on your images.

296
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,950
The previous
diagnosis was incorrect.

297
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,045
You have a glioblastoma
multiforme located in your pons.

298
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,690
I'm sure I don't
need to tell you this,

299
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:55,556
but it's the most aggressive
form of brain cancer.

300
00:19:55,695 --> 00:20:00,224
We estimate three,
maybe four months.

301
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,799
I can have my assistant
get it in touch with you,

302
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,630
to refer you to a therapist...

303
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,013
He still has low blood
pressure and thin blood,

304
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,146
which means the treatment
for the MDMA didn't work.

305
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,587
So, the Molly
wasn't the problem?

306
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,918
It certainly didn't help
him, but we now think...

307
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:30,019
Our best guess is Caden
has a bacterial infection.

308
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,088
Thanks.

309
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:39,170
DIC? What happened there?

310
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,274
We're not sure yet. He was
pretty sick when he came in.

311
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,777
I guess sometimes
complications just happen.

312
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,022
Interesting choice of words.

313
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,107
Eerily similar to what
Dr. Melendez said to me.

314
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,013
Yeah, he said it
during a differential.

315
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,212
I guess the phrasing
just stuck with me.

316
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,098
It's not like Melendez
to be that laissez-faire.

317
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,557
He usually likes to know
exactly why things happen.

318
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,320
One of the traits I
admire about him.

319
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,361
Yeah, well, we're
trying to figure it out.

320
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:06,388
But so far, cultures are negative,
Shaun's closing was textbook,

321
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,457
drug use doesn't
seem to be a problem.

322
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,301
I didn't realize Murphy did
the closing. Good for him.

323
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,293
Oh, my God. Shaun.

324
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,491
Yes, there are many
different explanations...

325
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,503
You asked me to get a second
opinion, I got a second opinion.

326
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,197
You asked me to get more
imaging, I got more imaging.

327
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,300
- Shaun, you have to accept...
- No, I don't accept.

328
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,411
I don't accept. I was right.

329
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,504
No, you were not
right. I'm dying, Shaun.

330
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,843
I said doctors make mistakes...

331
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:59,352
Yeah, they made a mistake. I have
even less time than we even thought!

332
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,582
Shaun was right.
Imaging is unreliable.

333
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,681
The imaging that
you asked me to get.

334
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,091
Imaging is subject
to interpretation.

335
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,256
Yes, studies have shown
that experts rely on...

336
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,233
On subjective measures based
on experience, rather than object...

337
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,862
- Shaun. No more.
- Rather than objective...

338
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,874
- No more. No more.
- Many theories consistent with...

339
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:25,400
You can't do a biopsy to confirm
because many tumors look alike.

340
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,777
Some are treatable, some are
curable, some are curable and...

341
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,749
Stop, will you? Stop,
please, will you?

342
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,752
Stop, stop, stop talking! Stop!

343
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,879
- Okay.
- Stop!

344
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,286
I am not hurting you.

345
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,592
Oh, my God, stop.

346
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,722
I'm helping.

347
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:51,635
No, you're not. You're not
helping. I don't need theories.

348
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,799
I don't need whiteboards.
I don't need doctors.

349
00:22:55,574 --> 00:23:00,979
I don't wanna think about the
tumor. I don't wanna think about dying.

350
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,843
You know what I want? You
know what I actually want?

351
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,508
I wanna go on a long drive
somewhere. I wanna eat pancakes.

352
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,656
- I wanna watch football!
- It's not football season.

353
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,558
Oh, my God. I know
it's not football season.

354
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:20,193
Do you mean you
want to have fun?

355
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,002
Yeah. I wanna have fun.

356
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,610
So, you can keep fighting.
Keep fighting if you want.

357
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,952
It's futile, and it's stupid.

358
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,851
Or you can come with me.

359
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,261
- How long has he been hypoxic?
- Came on suddenly five minutes ago.

360
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,811
He's on 100% high-flow oxygen,
and numbers aren't budging.

361
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,948
No, he's ventilating fine.

362
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,319
He must have thrombosed
his pulmonary artery.

363
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,203
We need to dissolve this
clot before his heart stops.

364
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,638
- Jared, prep for jugular access.
- On it.

365
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,622
Fifty milligrams TPA infusion,
now. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

366
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,734
Is this fun?

367
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,606
The Saturday after
Valentine's Day,

368
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,512
her favorite day of the year,
even more than her birthday.

369
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,641
The Chamber of Commerce
would decorate this place,

370
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:51,814
and put out a crappy
buffet meal, hire a DJ.

371
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:57,259
And I'd put on a tux, and she'd
put on a yellow Belle dress,

372
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:03,096
and she'd pin my bow-tie on me,

373
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,572
and I'd pin a little
yellow corsage on her,

374
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,976
and we'd come and
we'd eat, and we'd dance.

375
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,750
<i>Whenever I see your smiling face</i>

376
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,649
<i>I have to smile myself</i>

377
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,850
<i>Because I love you yes, I do</i>

378
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:29,460
- I love you, sweetie.
- I love you more.

379
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,825
You think so, huh?
Well, I'll tell you what.

380
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:37,128
You can take how much you
love me, which I know is quite a lot,

381
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:41,137
and then you can double
it, and then you can add 10,

382
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,731
and that's how much I love you.

383
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,409
I love you more.

384
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,181
<i>Oh, how much longer</i>

385
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,487
<i>I thought I was in love
a couple of times before</i>

386
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,045
<i>With the girl next door</i>

387
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,489
And I remember thinking,

388
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:07,826
"This is the moment that I
know will be in my mind when I...

389
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,561
"When I...

390
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,160
"When I close my eyes to die."

391
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:21,513
Only, I thought that she'd be
sitting there right next to me,

392
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,172
and I'd hear her
say it one more time.

393
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,281
I lost my toy scalpel.

394
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,257
The one that Steve gave me.

395
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,133
Yeah, I figured
that was the one.

396
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,536
I've been looking
for a whole day.

397
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,038
I think it may be gone forever.

398
00:26:55,814 --> 00:27:00,184
Maybe I'll come here
when you're dead.

399
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,652
Okay.

400
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,751
Are your memories of your
daughter enough for you?

401
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,961
Not even close.

402
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,837
Do you need me to
listen to you anymore?

403
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,107
- No, Shaun, you should go.
- Okay.

404
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,091
Not all the cultures are back.

405
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,184
But since he's not
responding to any antibiotics,

406
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,855
- we can rule out bacterial.
- It was never a great fit.

407
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,476
It's a better fit
than surgical error.

408
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,862
What if it is bacterial,
but resistant to all...

409
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:48,957
Then he's dead.

410
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,469
What about a paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria?

411
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,371
A PNH? The incidence
is literally one in a million.

412
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,817
What's the odds of
Murphy screwing up?

413
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,070
I'd put them about that.

414
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,112
No, it's not PNH. Caden
had normal flow cytometry.

415
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,377
Exotic snake venom can trigger
consumptive coagulopathies.

416
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,945
So can pre-eclampsia,

417
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,057
but he's not pregnant and
he wasn't charming snakes.

418
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:15,154
Murphy, any thoughts here? It
is kind of your ass on the line.

419
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,150
I know why Caden has DIC.

420
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:44,153
I squeezed the artery
between two clamps.

421
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:48,522
I must have ruptured the aortic
wall, causing a pseudo-aneurysm.

422
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,322
It was my mistake.

423
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,564
And, also,

424
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,935
I have to make a bowel movement.

425
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,442
He's lying. He's gonna puke.

426
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,108
He's going to Glassman.

427
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:18,851
I told Dr. Melendez I had
to make a bowel movement.

428
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,893
I think he believed me.

429
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,863
- Color me proud.
- I have the answer.

430
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,399
Shaun, I hope you're
referring to your patient,

431
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,845
but due to the fact that you're here
pretending to be in the bathroom,

432
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,031
- I kind of doubt that.
- It's your answer.

433
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:37,941
We already... We already
have my answer, Shaun.

434
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,911
We can't do a biopsy on you
because of the arteries in the way,

435
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,711
like the arteries in
Caden's abdomen,

436
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,752
but we can't move the
arteries in your brain.

437
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,050
Why did we go to the carousel?

438
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,215
Because you were sad.

439
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,725
What didn't I wanna do?

440
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,423
Do you not know the
answers to these questions?

441
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,021
I do know the answers, Shaun.

442
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,259
I don't think you know the
answers to these questions.

443
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,325
You're not hearing
me. I'm dying.

444
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,132
There's still hope.

445
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:10,298
Shaun, look at me.
Look at me, please.

446
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,347
There is no hope for me.

447
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,281
I mean, hope. What is hope?

448
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,378
You hope the
49ers find a defense.

449
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,356
You hope the number
four bus comes on time.

450
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,791
Doesn't mean they
magically learn how to tackle.

451
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,955
Doesn't mean the bus
driver suddenly drives faster.

452
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:35,625
Hope is irrelevant for me.

453
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,863
Hope is painful.

454
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,063
I don't wanna spend

455
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,133
what's left of my life chasing
my tail around in a circle.

456
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,111
You understand?

457
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,347
Okay.

458
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:00,654
Okay.

459
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:19,338
Your tumor is located
at the base of your skull.

460
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,039
An open cranial biopsy
would tell us what's wrong,

461
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,749
but there are blood
vessels in the way.

462
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:31,051
The biopsy would cause
an aneurysm or a bleed.

463
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,648
But if we go through
your nasal cribriform plate,

464
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,430
we can cross the tentorium
on the contralateral side

465
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,432
and avoid all
those blood vessels.

466
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,698
We can do a biopsy
through your nose.

467
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,946
You can't die, too.

468
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,019
I have to throw up.

469
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,359
So, how do we do
this? Do we file a report?

470
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,164
- Talk to Andrews personally?
- You wanna report Shaun?

471
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,003
- I don't want to, I think we have to.
- No, you want to.

472
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,473
And we'd certainly have to

473
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,841
if our sole agenda would
be to take down Shaun,

474
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,622
and to give you one less
person to compete against.

475
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,741
And certainly we'd absolutely
have to cover up and bury

476
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:34,776
a possible fatal medical error if our
sole agenda was to protect a friend?

477
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,822
And protocol would seem to
favor the bitch over the friend.

478
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,050
Thanks?

479
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,917
I threw up.

480
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,260
Look, we have a duty to report
errors, so, they won't happen again.

481
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,825
The process saves lives.

482
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,565
And exactly what errors are
you trying to avoid a repeat of?

483
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,217
Are you worried about the next
time an autistic surgeon operates on a

484
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,121
drugged-up frat kid after finding out
his mentor's dying of brain cancer?

485
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,645
Dr. Melendez told us,
Shaun. We're really sorry.

486
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,945
It's okay.

487
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,690
It's okay. I think
he's going to be okay.

488
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,693
The protocol exists, so that
we don't ask questions like that.

489
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,990
That seems like a bad idea.

490
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,193
You trust your judgment. Do
you trust Morgan's judgment?

491
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,644
Do you trust the judgment of
all the doctors in this building?

492
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,728
If you can make
judgment calls, so can they.

493
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,363
That's why we need these rules.

494
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:31,604
So, the protocol is fine for everyone
in this building, except for Shaun.

495
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,646
They'd reprimand any one
of us, but they will fire him.

496
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,674
Okay.

497
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,275
We report it, we
get the investigation,

498
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,550
make sure nothing like
this ever happens again,

499
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:44,815
but we tell them I did it.

500
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:51,357
- They'd fire you, too.
- It's not a terrible idea.

501
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,773
Jared's out the door either way.

502
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,629
Okay, can we get
back to the medicine?

503
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,065
Caden is still alive,

504
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,865
and if we can keep it that way,
there won't be an M&M review.

505
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,548
Which means no one
will be asking questions,

506
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,007
and no one will have to give
answers. It all goes away.

507
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,568
If Caden dies,

508
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,842
we tell the truth, and we face
the consequences together.

509
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,346
No.

510
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,375
No.

511
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:17,216
I thought I'd found
my toy scalpel.

512
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,554
We need you to come
back to the group, Murphy.

513
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,563
Get me imaging on
that pseudo-aneurysm.

514
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,338
Hey. What's up?

515
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,349
Do you still feel the same way about
Dr. Murphy as when he got here?

516
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:51,118
Dr. Glassman gave
us certain assurances.

517
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,891
"If Shaun proves anything
less than excellent...

518
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,396
"If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,

519
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,490
"he will be immediately released,
and I will resign my position

520
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,034
"as president of the hospital."

521
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,927
And you wrote it down?

522
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,696
I made sure it
was in the minutes.

523
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,305
Shaun has exceeded
my expectations.

524
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,308
Mine as well. And?

525
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,579
And my feelings about
Dr. Glassman have not changed.

526
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,443
Thank you.

527
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,201
- We need to cut him open.
- We cut him open, and he dies.

528
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,990
He'll bleed out before we can
even get the artery exposed.

529
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,256
If we don't cut
him open, he dies.

530
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,267
- Don't cut him open.
- Murphy, if we don't...

531
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:43,240
We should insert an endovascular
graft through his leg instead.

532
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,801
Fix it from the inside out.

533
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,669
I've done that for large
abdominal aorta dilations,

534
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,046
but this is a lengthy,
dissecting pseudo-aneurysm.

535
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,175
It's safer.

536
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,049
The aorta wall is compromised,
it could rupture completely.

537
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,919
Caden could die as soon as we
deflate the balloon inside the graft.

538
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,720
- But doing nothing will kill him.
- Not definitely.

539
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,455
I mean, there's still a chance
Caden will simply come out of this

540
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,888
without any
surgical intervention.

541
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,432
- 5%, 10% maybe.
- Not nothing.

542
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,534
We're doubling down on Shaun
after we know he caused this problem.

543
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,162
How's that gonna look at an M&M?

544
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,031
I trust Shaun's idea.

545
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,641
He makes mistake no
one else would make,

546
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,646
but he also makes saves none
of us would have ever thought of.

547
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,049
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

548
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,927
I still don't think you
should be working here,

549
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,511
I don't think the
trade-off is worth it.

550
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,715
Let's prep him for surgery.

551
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,464
Pull the guide wire, Reznick.

552
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,429
I'm passing in the graft.

553
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,640
You're right over the
pseudo-aneurysm now.

554
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:08,087
Inflating the balloon
to deploy the graft.

555
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,892
- Deflating.
- Can I do it?

556
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,935
- It's delicate.
- No, it's not.

557
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:29,579
But it will either
work, or it won't work.

558
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:35,051
If my idea is wrong, he'll die as
soon as we complete this next step.

559
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,918
You shouldn't have
to live with that.

560
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:47,728
Everything that happens in
this room is my responsibility.

561
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,262
We'll do it together.

562
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,606
Deflating.

563
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,335
Nobody's going home.

564
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,812
I am proud of this team, and
what we accomplished today.

565
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,248
Drinks are on me
at Harry Hope's.

566
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,286
We're celebrating?

567
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,689
Today was a disaster
and we got lucky.

568
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,796
You're right.

569
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,857
But when you get lucky,
you celebrate. Let's go.

570
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,095
Hup.

571
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,213
At some point in your career,
you're going to kill someone.

572
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,219
And I hope for your sake,

573
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,122
there is a doctor out there who
still believes in you when you do.

574
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,634
It was there all along.

575
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,508
I have to go drinking, but I
wanted you to know that...

576
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,645
Is that from an IV?

577
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,251
- You did the biopsy.
- I did.

578
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,050
I have a low-grade glioma.

579
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,953
Not a GBM? I told you...

580
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,590
It's cancer, Shaun.
It's still cancer.

581
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,793
I have to undergo brain surgery,

582
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,229
which is really scary because
I'm not the one performing it.

583
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,270
Five days a week for
six weeks of radiation,

584
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,506
- 10 more weeks of chemotherapy.
- And then?

585
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:21,043
And then, with a little luck,

586
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,181
you and I can go to the
Super Bowl next season.

587
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,727
You're going to live.

588
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,201
There's hope.

589
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,138
Now, go. Go have some
fun with your friends.

590
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,411
Yes. First, I have to tell
Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.

591
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,782
Shaun, you can't.

592
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,652
Protocol is clear, and
reporting saves lives.

593
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,159
And I hear Caden is
on the road to recovery,

594
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,157
so, your mistake couldn't
have been too bad.

595
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,861
No, I made a mistake.

596
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,162
Shaun, I understand that,
but Dr. Andrews will use this.

597
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,001
And do you remember
the commitment

598
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,004
that Dr. Glassman made
when you were hired?

599
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,502
I promised you'd be
excellent. Right, Shaun?

600
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,834
And you have been excellent.

601
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:22,611
You can't give
Dr. Andrews this excuse.

602
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:27,582
I was not excellent.
This time, I was bad.

603
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:33,180
And surgeons have to
be excellent every time.

604
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,920
- Right, Shaun?
- You agree with him?

605
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,292
I'm not gonna ask him
to lie to save my job.

606
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,495
Don't do this.

607
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:49,805
It's up to Shaun. I
trust your judgment.

608
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,445
- I'm not doing this to hurt you.
- I know.

609
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,819
- We are friends.
- Yes, we are.

610
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:09,394
- I love you.
- I know. I love you, too.

611
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,190
I love you more.
