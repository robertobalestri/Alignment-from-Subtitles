1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,947
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,415
Is there something
you're not telling me?

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,671
In meetings together, don't
ever call my ideas ridiculous.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,868
Come on, I'm being serious.

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,138
So am I.

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,839
Merrill's son asked
for personal advice.

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,778
- And he picked you.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,012
A surgeon needs to communicate.
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,849
Can he do that under
stress? Can he do that knowing

10
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,048
that a human life literally
hangs in the balance?

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,387
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,661
You're welcome.
It's a special blend.

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,223
I roast the beans myself.

14
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,369
Smells like leather.

15
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,229
Then none for you, Murphy.

16
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,033
I don't drink coffee.

17
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,040
It is dead in here.

18
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,054
That's why they call
it the graveyard shift.

19
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,173
Oh, well, I call it paradise.
You my Trauma virgins?

20
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,310
Doctors Murphy, Kalu,
Browne, meet Dr. Audrey Lim,

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,877
your attending for the evening.

22
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,354
- Coffee?
- He roasts the beans himself.

23
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,754
Ah. Kiss-ass.

24
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:06,558
ER. How long? Got it.

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,757
Listen up, everybody,

26
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,030
we got a mass cas
coming in. It's a bus crash,

27
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,937
two dozen passengers. Transfer
all patients waiting for beds

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,908
up to the nursing units. Have
maintenance bring down cots.

29
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,854
We're gonna convert the
waiting room into triage.

30
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,676
No one goes home
till we're all clear.

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,091
Page everyone on-call. I don't
care what department they are,

32
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,744
tonight, everybody's
Trauma. Glove up and line up.

33
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,884
EMTs will have triaged on-site,

34
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,562
so the patients are
gonna come in tagged.

35
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,390
Love these blank faces
right before Armageddon.

36
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,711
Trauma color
coding, who knows it?

37
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,761
Green, walking wounded.
Yellow, observation.

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,202
Red, needs immediate attention.

39
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,865
And black, go
straight to the morgue.

40
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,066
All right. Red tags,
front of the line. Red tags,

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,149
front of the line.

42
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,284
Wedding bus blew a tire and
flipped. Twenty-six-year-old female,

43
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,125
second and third degrees burns
to her neck, chest and left arm.

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,254
Kalu, you're up.

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,324
Trauma Six.

46
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,234
Guy was ejected 30
feet from the vehicle.

47
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,567
Multiple chest contusions.

48
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,082
Acute respiratory
distress on the scene.

49
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,226
Sluggish pupillary response.

50
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,784
- How long have you been doing CPR?
- Twelve minutes.

51
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,119
- Have you shocked him?
- Three times.

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,907
We gotta crack him.
Dr. Browne, I got this.

53
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,658
You take the next
one. All right, Bay Five.

54
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,630
We secured the foreign object
and staunched the bleeding,

55
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,418
but didn't wanna
touch it otherwise.

56
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,323
- Good thing, it nicked her carotid.
- What is it?

57
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,505
Right now, it's
a little Dutch boy

58
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,729
keeping her from bleeding out.

59
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,460
Pulse ox is
dropping. She's at 87.

60
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,924
O2 stats down 83.

61
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,815
Forget about the neck, Claire.
Treat her like any other patient.

62
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,034
What are the first steps?

63
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,632
Airway, breathing, circulation.

64
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,768
Good. Grab a kit.

65
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,867
Yeah.

66
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,298
I need help here.
Somebody, help.

67
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,393
Murphy, go!

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,037
Let's go! Trauma Three.

69
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,198
I can't stop the bleeding.

70
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,496
- He's bleeding out.
- Do something.

71
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,768
I need a urinary catheter,
fourteen-gauge needle,

72
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,606
arterial guide wire,
occlusion balloon,

73
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,839
and 20 CCs of saline. Stat.

74
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,636
- What's he doing?
- I have no idea.

75
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,197
We don't have one, so
I'm making a REBOA.

76
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,899
A what?

77
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,435
A REBOA.

78
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,437
Is that even a word?

79
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,985
A REBOA will occlude the
damaged artery and stop the bleeding.

80
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,496
Release the pressure.

81
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,145
BP's stabilizing, 90 over 60.

82
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,914
Nice work, Dr. Murphy.

83
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,680
I made a REBOA.

84
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,791
Oxygen's dropping to 89.

85
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,294
Right, light. Open wide for me.

86
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,196
Throat's swollen from
smoke inhalation. Crike kit.

87
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,096
Do you see soot in
her mouth or nose?

88
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,190
No.

89
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,887
She doesn't need a crike,
she needs an escharotomy.

90
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,040
Sats are going back
up. 92 and rising.

91
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,675
With circumferential neck burns,

92
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,448
the shrinking charred
skin is acting like a noose.

93
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,513
Escharotomy relieves
the constriction.

94
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,677
Are you getting
enough air now, ma'am?

95
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,654
Yes. Thank you.

96
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,390
Now get her out of this Petri
dish and into an isolation ward

97
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,794
in the burn unit ASAP.

98
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,889
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,633
Your heart's a bit muffled.

100
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,464
Am I having a heart attack?

101
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,406
No, but it's not completely
good news. Cardiac tamponade.

102
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,839
He needs a pericardiocentesis.

103
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,309
Yes, I'm aware of that.

104
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,009
Eighteen-gauge and
50-CC syringe, please.

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,958
We need a fast
ultrasound in here.

106
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,041
They're both in use.

107
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,495
You don't have imaging,
you could puncture his heart.

108
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,489
Is the xiphoid in the same
place as it was 20 years ago?

109
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,275
- A REBOA.
- Ballsy. Could've gone really wrong.

110
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,211
Yes, well, it didn't.

111
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,439
It was a cowboy move,

112
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,519
something you would
never even dream of trying.

113
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,697
How many times is Shaun
gonna have to prove himself

114
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,019
before you give him a shot?

115
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,735
What happened in the ER? Swan
girl came in and you hesitated.

116
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,239
I wasn't hesitating, I was
thinking of a game plan.

117
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,368
Murphy was thinking of a game
plan. You got overwhelmed.

118
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,101
I wasn't.

119
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,873
First trauma, it happens.

120
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,940
You have to think clearly,
quickly, methodically.

121
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,449
You need to think a
little more like Shaun.

122
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,553
A little more, not identically.

123
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:59,143
How are you doing? Sorry.
Sorry, that's a stupid question.

124
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,682
You're maxed out on morphine.
I will hold off until it reloads.

125
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,757
How bad is it?

126
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,857
We're making good progress.

127
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,327
I'll have to debride
any deroof blisters,

128
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,832
prevent a secondary
nosocomial...

129
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,335
I need a mirror. It's
the least you can do

130
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,428
since you can't even
look me in the eye.

131
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,345
Oh, my God.

132
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,634
Do you know how many
hideous $300 bridesmaids' dresses

133
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,866
I've had to buy in
the last two years?

134
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,308
I decided that
when I got married,

135
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,509
my bridesmaids are gonna
wear black cocktail dresses.

136
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,573
So they can use
them again, you know?

137
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:20,049
But now... Now,
I'm Freddy Krueger.

138
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,157
Who's gonna wanna marry this?

139
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,694
I'm gonna find a nurse,
have her adjust your...

140
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,829
Your morphine drip.

141
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,170
Okay.

142
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,913
You've hit your face.
Your jaw got stuck. It hurts.

143
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,008
This shot I gave you is gonna
knock you out so that I can fix that.

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,275
Hang tight.

145
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,718
Crash patients' status check?

146
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,880
Twenty-three people total.

147
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,786
One fatality on-site,
lost one in the ER.

148
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,017
Examined all the red tags.

149
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,903
Got 13 yellow and green
still in the waiting room.

150
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,054
I'll take whoever's up next.

151
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,257
Marco Magallanes, severed
femoral artery, crushed femur.

152
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,266
I did the REBOA and then
installed a temporary shunt.

153
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,866
Here are his CT and MRI results.

154
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,439
Find someone else,
whoever's up next.

155
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,914
Finally.

156
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,724
Excuse me, are
you Marco's family?

157
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:39,239
Yes. We just found out that my
cousin didn't survive the accident.

158
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,831
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

159
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,734
It's a bit much.

160
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm so sorry. I'm Dr. Melendez,
and this is Dr. Murphy.

161
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,975
I'm Ricardo, Marco's father.

162
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,316
And this is his mother
Lorena, and this is Sonia.

163
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,681
They were getting
married tonight.

164
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,281
How's my son?

165
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,118
Marco's femur was
completely shattered

166
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,321
and his lower leg isn't
getting enough blood.

167
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,125
Can you save his leg?

168
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,200
Marco's suffered too much
bone fragmentation. We can't fix it.

169
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,028
Our only choice is to amputate.

170
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,714
Bay Five needs a
grade-three hyphema.

171
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,292
Head CT and page ophthalmology?

172
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,383
You read my mind.

173
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,458
Been a while. How you
holding up, pulling an all-nighter?

174
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,776
I'll manage. But if you can find
me a caffeine IV, it'd be helpful.

175
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,063
Please move!

176
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,015
Tough night. - Yeah.

177
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,474
- Thanks for coming.
- It's part of the job.

178
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,476
So, when's the big day?

179
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,569
Oh, we haven't set it yet.

180
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,509
Where's it gonna be?

181
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,084
We'll figure it out. Maybe
a beach somewhere?

182
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,999
We should talk about this later.

183
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,381
What? I like beaches. You
have a more romantic idea?

184
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,323
My family likes churches.

185
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,009
We should talk about this later.

186
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,361
Dr. Lim, I think one of your
yellows is about to turn red.

187
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,738
I've got my wedding all
planned out. I've got the dress,

188
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,708
and I've got the flowers.
All I need is a groom.

189
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,876
You available, Dr. Murphy?

190
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,673
No.

191
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,110
You don't want some love?

192
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,111
No. No, I don't.
I don't want love.

193
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,723
Dr. Glassman, neuro
consult, Bay Three.

194
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,118
Thank you.

195
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,062
Hey. I was here first. Shaun.

196
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,794
Shaun!

197
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,437
My patient's scans
are very important.

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
Well, my patient's
important, too.

199
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,943
I need to see my
patient's scans.

200
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,406
- Is your patient pre-op or post-op?
- Pre-op.

201
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,977
Okay. I'll give you the computer,
but you need to apologize first.

202
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,713
Okay, I'm sorry. Turn it on.

203
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,122
Why was Marco's family crying
when Dr. Melendez told them

204
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,960
his leg would need
to be amputated?

205
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:25,094
Well, their son's leg is
about to be cut off. It's sad.

206
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,732
Crying is normal.

207
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,902
But when your options are amputation
or death, amputation is good news.

208
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,776
People need time to
adjust to big changes.

209
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,182
Marco's family didn't even get
a chance to pray for a miracle.

210
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:51,692
It's not possible. The
bone damage is too severe.

211
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,527
A rod implantation won't work.
There's nothing to anchor into.

212
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,200
And the shunt won't last long
enough to do reconstruction.

213
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,871
There are no other options.

214
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,010
What if we could
replace the entire femur?

215
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,212
We're making him a new femur.

216
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,717
With a 3D printer?

217
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,935
3D-printed bones have
only successfully been done

218
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,018
with a mandible.

219
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,153
- We know.
- It's a fairly small bone.

220
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,288
We know.

221
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,208
The femur has to support
the weight of the entire body.

222
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,497
This one will be
titanium. It can work.

223
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:32,903
It's an interesting idea.
But I need to think on it.

224
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,735
Right now, we've still got
seven yellow tags waiting.

225
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,175
What do you have to think
about? It's a good idea.

226
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,564
It's a brilliant idea. The kid
has brilliant ideas. That...

227
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,980
No, it was my idea. I'm aware
of the risks. Infection, clotting,

228
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,679
- hardware failure.
- Death. It wasn't your idea.

229
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,222
It was my idea! And
the risks are significant,

230
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,484
but isn't that their
call? Don't we have to...

231
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,718
Maybe he said something,

232
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,370
and then you said
something, and together...

233
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,056
My idea. Completely my idea.

234
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,893
The brilliant idea is
100% my brilliant idea.

235
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,432
Why is that a problem for you?

236
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,760
Maybe because I've
known you for six months.

237
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,264
Every day, we learn new things.
Today you learned I'm brilliant.

238
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,167
The idea was brilliant.

239
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,236
And it was mine. And if anyone
can do this brilliant surgery, it's you.

240
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,377
Flattery. Also brilliant.

241
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,252
Sleeping on the job?

242
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:33,265
I just needed some fresh air.
Feels like I'm suffocating in there.

243
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,567
She's in pain, spilling her guts
out, and every time I open my mouth,

244
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,970
I sound like an idiot.

245
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,441
Dr. Kalu, unable to talk
to women. There's a first.

246
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,104
If you're not gonna be
helpful, Claire, just leave.

247
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,442
You don't need to
talk. Just listen to her.

248
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,412
You get to come out
here, clear your head.

249
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,891
She's trapped in there, alone
with her thoughts, her fears.

250
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,439
You don't think she
wants to get out?

251
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,731
You are her escape.

252
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,733
You wanna put a fake
femur into Marco's leg?

253
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,332
It's not fake, it's real.

254
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,069
It's not a real bone, we're
making it out of titanium.

255
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,169
It's still real.

256
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,113
That's incredible. And Marco
will be able to walk, run, climb?

257
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,310
And swim.

258
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,354
Hopefully. That's the intention.

259
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,121
Well, have you done
this surgery before?

260
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,818
- I haven't...
- We'll be the first.

261
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,858
Nobody has ever
attempted this surgery

262
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,693
with a bone as
large as the femur.

263
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,290
I believe it's a viable
option, but there are risks.

264
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,030
Risks? Could Marco die?

265
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,195
In my estimation,

266
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,815
there's a 10% chance
he won't make it.

267
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,274
Then, no. I'm not losing my son.

268
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,308
Wait, if there's a chance
we can save Marco's leg,

269
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,041
we should at least discuss this
some more. That's what he'd want.

270
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,673
He'd want to live.
He'd wanna have a life.

271
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,546
I know him. He'd want
to take the chance.

272
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,953
I will never forgive
myself if Marco died

273
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,685
because I made a
reckless decision.

274
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,856
Whose decision is this?

275
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,293
Does he have a healthcare proxy?

276
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,892
I don't know what that is.

277
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:15,127
When the accident happened,
were you on the way to your wedding,

278
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,670
- or on the way back?
- We were headed to the wedding.

279
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,739
Marco's parents are the
next of kin. They decide.

280
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,909
Please, amputate our son's leg.

281
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,148
Murphy.

282
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,529
Why is the primary
closure on the stump so vital

283
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,727
in amputation surgery?

284
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,033
For proper prosthetic fitting.
Why are you marrying Jessica?

285
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,339
Why does anyone get married?

286
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,570
I don't know.

287
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,675
I love her.

288
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,451
I don't understand why having someone
to love is so important to everyone.

289
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,685
You have to stand down.
You can't amputate Marco's leg.

290
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,781
Why not?

291
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,225
I filed an emergency
injunction to stop the surgery.

292
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,091
You were in a car accident,
your neck was punctured.

293
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,531
The repair surgery went well.
You're gonna have to stay put

294
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,100
for a week before we can release
you. You're very lucky to be alive.

295
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,651
My wife, Jenna
Hensel. Is she okay?

296
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:43,946
Can I see her?

297
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,223
She's not listed.
That's a good thing.

298
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,324
She's probably still
in the waiting room.

299
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,158
I'll find her and bring her up.

300
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,167
She'll be relieved
to know you're okay.

301
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,230
Okay.

302
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,752
What the hell am I supposed to
do with an unconscious patient

303
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,096
whose leg is a
ticking time-bomb?

304
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,388
Judge Singh is en route.

305
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,177
She wants to hear from both
parties and the doctors on the case.

306
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,579
I have to testify?

307
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,807
Hopefully not.

308
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,476
I thought you would be happy.

309
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,163
You thought you
could save the leg,

310
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,565
and I didn't want
that not happening

311
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,467
because the parents are
afraid to make a tough call.

312
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,789
It's their call to make.

313
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,023
And if the accident happened an
hour later, it would be the wife's.

314
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,660
And she wants the fake leg.

315
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,959
It's not fake.

316
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,827
I thought you didn't believe in
just blindly following protocol.

317
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,631
He's their son. Nobody's
gonna love him more than them.

318
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,800
Seriously? All parents love all
children more than anybody else?

319
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,435
People get divorced all the time.
How often do they give up their kids?

320
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,381
So if this was us, you'd want
your parents to decide over me.

321
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,212
- I didn't say that.
- You kind of did.

322
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,015
I was saying there
needs to be rules.

323
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,319
There needs to
be bright red lines

324
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,325
telling us who gets
to make these calls.

325
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,886
It's the parents' call.

326
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,626
Not anymore. Now it's a judge's.

327
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,043
How much time does Marco
have left on the temporary shunt?

328
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,697
Three hours, and
then his leg will die.

329
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,864
- Okay.
- Mmm.

330
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,814
Doctor Torture returns.

331
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,650
Thought I'd scared
you off for good.

332
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,346
Pick a movie.

333
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,492
You deserve to get out of
this room for a little while, too.

334
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,859
You think <i>Groundhog Day's</i>
gonna make a difference?

335
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,899
"I'm torturing you, but, hey,
you get to watch a funny movie."

336
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,528
That is sort of what I
was going for, yeah.

337
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,067
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,914
I wish there was
something else I could do.

339
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,881
How do you know there isn't?

340
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,852
This is protocol. This
is what they teach...

341
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,114
I lucked out.

342
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,448
I got the world's greatest
expert on burn victims?

343
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,955
You know everything
that can be done?

344
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,196
He loves to rock-climb,
scuba-dive, bungee-jump.

345
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:13,433
This is insane. His leg is literally
dying while we sit here reminiscing.

346
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,304
Please, we're trying to figure
out what your son would want.

347
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,309
- He'd want to live.
- I want that, too.

348
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,403
But if there is a way that
we can save Marco's leg,

349
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,074
he'd want me to do it.

350
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,044
<i>Mija,</i> do you know
what he wanted?

351
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,142
Most of all?

352
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,446
He wanted to marry you.

353
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,086
He wanted to spend his life
with you, have children with you.

354
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,598
Now, he can do all
that, he can be happy,

355
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,893
with a prosthetic leg.

356
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,792
He's young, he's strong.

357
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,802
<i>Mija,</i> he can get through this.

358
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,302
When we met...

359
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,438
I don't care about your stories.

360
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,779
I don't care that you
met rock-climbing,

361
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,788
or kayaking, or
whatever. I just want...

362
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,619
We met in rehab.

363
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,625
Hey, are either of
you Jenna Hensel?

364
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,831
I haven't seen Jenna since
we took pictures at the hotel.

365
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,534
But she got on the bus?

366
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,833
Yeah, she was
sitting with Noomi.

367
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,516
I think she's still out there.
Hey, guys, we've gotta go back.

368
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,212
- Where?
- To the crash site. Now.

369
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,717
He never wanted you to know.

370
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,522
He's an addict.

371
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,563
He replaced one
addiction for another one,

372
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,156
a healthier one. But he needs...

373
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,293
What?

374
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,369
He needs to wakeboard or
he'll drink himself to death?

375
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,031
This is ridiculous.

376
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,303
No, it's not. We
talked about it a lot.

377
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,402
It's pretty much
all you do in rehab.

378
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,345
Marco has clarity for
the first time in his life.

379
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:06,043
He knows what makes him
happy. He knows his weaknesses.

380
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:12,518
He's not as strong as you
think. And that's okay, but...

381
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,027
Marco cheated on you.

382
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,397
It was about a month ago.

383
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,833
He was overwhelmed with
the wedding and the planning.

384
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,028
He ran into an ex-girlfriend.
It only happened once.

385
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:34,411
You're lying. You're upset that
he had secrets from you, so...

386
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,038
No, she's not lying.

387
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,588
<i>Mija,</i> he was so upset.
He does love you.

388
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,850
Okay, maybe we're
digressing here a little bit

389
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,688
and we really don't
have the time...

390
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,022
It matters.

391
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,426
She doesn't know him like...

392
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:57,431
Maybe none of us do,
but we are his parents.

393
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,798
And you're not his wife. Yet.

394
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,217
Okay, get the cops,
check everywhere.

395
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,953
Other side of the
road, bushes, trees.

396
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,203
If she was ejected from the bus,

397
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,923
she could be 40, 50
feet in any direction.

398
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,261
Jenna!

399
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,936
I found her. I need some help.

400
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,643
She's got a brain bleed! We
need to get her out of here, now!

401
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,950
Dr. Andrews. I think
Celez may be eligible

402
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,583
for experimental burn treatment.

403
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,353
- Sell it to me.
- I've been doing some digging.

404
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,489
San Diego Community Hospital's
burn unit has been following

405
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,625
a Brazilian hospital's protocol
to wrap burns in tilapia skins.

406
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,694
Now... Now, I know fish
skins sound a bit crazy, but...

407
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,372
But I was thinking we
could do the same thing here.

408
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,776
Dr. Kalu, I applaud
your thinking, but...

409
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:15,178
Tilapia skins contain more collagen
proteins, both types one and three,

410
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,374
than even human skin,
which aids in tissue repair,

411
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,960
- negating the need for grafts.
- Dr. Kalu...

412
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,962
It can accelerate healing,
reduce risk of infection,

413
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,012
and cut down on a
patient's physical pain.

414
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,755
Are you finished, or would
you like to cut me off again?

415
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,560
Okay. Let's follow this through,
shall we? You have to come up

416
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,324
with a proposal for the experimental
treatment, get it approved

417
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,799
by our institutional review
board, get your hands

418
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,400
on medical-grade
tilapia skins, and then...

419
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,543
Well, I thought you could
help expedite the process.

420
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,621
You think I could bring it down
from three months to two hours?

421
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:50,208
You finish the debridement?
Okay. I'll take over from here.

422
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:55,514
Hey. Keep thinking outside
the box. Initiative is good.

423
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,561
I'm in. Bag her. Did
you get me the drill?

424
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,107
Fire truck had one.
What's going on?

425
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,228
Her pupils are blown. She
has a subdural hematoma

426
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,033
causing increased
intracranial pressure.

427
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,184
If I don't alleviate it now,
there's no way she makes it

428
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,403
to the hospital alive.

429
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,863
Unconscious female. Flail chest.
I had to do a burr hole in-field.

430
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,930
Her sats are in the low 70s.

431
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,580
She's good to go to the OR.

432
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,779
Subdural hematoma?

433
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:04,065
Yeah. She had decerebrate
posturing, a blown left pupil.

434
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,733
When I passed the
drill bit through her skull,

435
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,158
- a whole lot of blood pooled out.
- Good call.

436
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,300
San Diego Community Hospital
called. They're sending the tilapia skins.

437
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,304
They're medevacing 'em in.
Should be here within the hour.

438
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,768
Celez, you meet the criteria
for an experimental treatment

439
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,404
that I think will prevent you
from having to undergo skin grafts.

440
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,974
Hold up. How did
this even happen?

441
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,781
Well, I found out San Diego's trial
allows for multi-site collaborations,

442
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,513
so there's no need for us to get
our own IRB. They give us the skins,

443
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,851
we provide the patient data.

444
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,149
Fish skins?

445
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,191
The tilapia skins have
been cleaned and sterilized,

446
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,821
they're perfectly safe.

447
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,130
You'll do it?

448
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:55,432
I'll do it.

449
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,137
Well done, Dr. Kalu. Well done.

450
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,440
So help you God?

451
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:07,709
Yes. Dr. Melendez
can tell you...

452
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,483
He has. But the fake
femur is yours, though, right?

453
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,958
- How confident are you in its design?
- It's not fake.

454
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,153
Shaun, she needs to know...

455
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,789
I know what she needs to know.
She needs to know will it work,

456
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,192
she needs to know
how long it will last.

457
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,392
Yes.

458
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,727
Okay.

459
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,340
He's his doctor?

460
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,381
He is a surgical
resident. He's very gifted...

461
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,312
Is he going to
answer my questions?

462
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,878
Shaun, I really
need you to focus.

463
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,224
- Marco is running out of time.
- Just let him answer!

464
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,191
We already know the
answer. They don't know.

465
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,888
If this thing's never
been done before...

466
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,054
Be quiet!

467
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,606
His toes are changing color.

468
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,740
He's clotting. That's bad.
Page Dr. Melendez, stat.

469
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,265
Murphy, what've we got?

470
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,384
The shunt is clotting. It's
restricting blood flow. It's failing.

471
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,361
We need a decision now. Are we
cutting off the leg or replacing the bone?

472
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,920
There's no doubt in my mind
that Marco's parents and fiancée

473
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,023
all love Marco, but
it's become clear that...

474
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,932
Now. I need a decision now.

475
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,639
His parents know him as their
child. Sonia knows him as a man.

476
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,200
Replace the femur.

477
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,271
Let's go.

478
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,779
Thank you! Thank you.

479
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,222
- And there's the bleed. See it?
- Yes, sir.

480
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,729
You ever clipped an
intracranial artery before?

481
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,754
No, sir.

482
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,325
Go for it.

483
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,739
Just like every first time.

484
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,345
You're a little excited,
a little nauseous.

485
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,145
Hopefully, nobody gets hurt.

486
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,041
Is it good to go?

487
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,163
It's very good.

488
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,430
Forceps.

489
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,668
Are you ready?

490
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,605
Yes.

491
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:24,850
Be careful the clip blades don't
catch any perforated arteries.

492
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,848
I don't see any
vessels in the way.

493
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,586
Then what are you waiting for?

494
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,084
Very nice.

495
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,252
Thank you.

496
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,999
Everything's dry. Say
goodbye. Close the roof.

497
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,173
Need to get blood back into
his leg in the next minute or so,

498
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,742
or I'm gonna have
to amputate after all.

499
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,346
Insulin's hanging. Loaded
him with calcium. Best I can do.

500
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,849
Let's release the clamps.

501
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,947
Check for capillary refill.

502
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,892
Blood flow is restored.

503
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,796
EKG is normal.

504
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,942
Okay, Kim, I wanna hear words

505
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,875
like "variability" and "delta."

506
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,207
Give them to me.

507
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,974
I'm waiting patiently.

508
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,083
I'm not getting anything.

509
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,312
Show me.

510
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,488
Check the leads?

511
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,833
Still nothing.

512
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,636
Maybe there'll be
some neuroplasticity.

513
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,806
Her brain, it
could rewire itself.

514
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,739
No.

515
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,645
Zero brain activity. I don't
know why, but she's gone.

516
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,496
What?

517
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,508
Your neurosurgery
patient that died tonight.

518
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,009
There's something
you should know.

519
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,436
What?

520
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,033
Okay, Marco, I want you
to try to move your toes.

521
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,057
I can't.

522
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,299
- Is he okay?
- We're not sure if the bone...

523
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,736
But he's not gonna die.

524
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,898
He's not gonna get an
infection, his body's not...

525
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,684
We're monitoring
him very closely.

526
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,628
- The biggest threat is behind him...
- He moved.

527
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,402
He moved.

528
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,547
It worked.

529
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,000
You have a long recovery ahead,

530
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,185
months of physical therapy.

531
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,159
But for now, all you
have to do is rest.

532
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,251
Thank you.

533
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,523
Thank you for saving my life,

534
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,422
for saving my leg.

535
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

536
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,338
Are you ready to
finish what we started?

537
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:40,837
Get well first.

538
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,413
There's plenty of
time for a wedding.

539
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,788
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

540
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,932
You look good.
Tough, like Aquaman.

541
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,110
I look like sushi.

542
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,777
Everybody loves sushi.

543
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:17,880
It's only for six months.

544
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,384
Your new skin should have
completely grown in by then.

545
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,818
You should have minor scarring.

546
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,314
Thank you.

547
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,325
I misjudged you.

548
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,724
You judged me just right.

549
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,638
She's still sleeping?

550
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,743
- You haven't told her yet?
- No.

551
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,916
Can I have a moment, please?

552
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,146
Of course.

553
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,920
How soon after you found Jenna

554
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,657
at the crash site
did you intubate her?

555
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,121
Almost immediately.

556
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,263
I did a sternal rub, she
had decerebrate posturing,

557
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,804
her left pupil was blown.

558
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,871
I knew she had a subdural hematoma,
so I intubated and did the burr hole.

559
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,634
She also had a flail chest.

560
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,552
Did you check her breathing
after you intubated her?

561
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,639
Yes.

562
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,815
At least I think I did.

563
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,923
Dr. Lim told me that,

564
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,892
when Jenna came into the ER,
she wasn't ventilating properly.

565
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:41,524
You inserted the tube too deep
into her right main stem bronchus

566
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,696
of her injured lung.

567
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,828
We had no way of knowing

568
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,864
how long she was hypoxic
before we gave her the EEG.

569
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,689
I drilled the perfect burr hole

570
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,084
into her skull on the side of a
road in the middle of the night,

571
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,791
and I screw up her intubation?

572
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,718
Yes.

573
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,764
It was tough conditions
for anyone, resident or not.

574
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,061
Any one of us could have
made the same mistake.

575
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,981
I had a woman come
into the ER once.

576
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,548
A mother, 51 years old.

577
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,657
Francine Parker.
She had two boys.

578
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:48,431
She had a cough, a
bad one, but a cough.

579
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,835
I checked her out, gave her
some antibiotics, sent her home.

580
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,805
Six hours later, she
was rolled into the ER.

581
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,301
She had had a heart
attack and I missed it. And...

582
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:01,836
She died.

583
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:10,350
Not one day goes by
when I don't think about her.

584
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,819
She was your first?

585
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,293
My fourth, actually.

586
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,698
You're not gonna forget this.

587
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,303
You never forget.

588
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:30,005
But I don't know, maybe we're
better off for it the next time around.

589
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,836
You gotta find a
way to keep going.

590
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,539
Yeah.

591
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,678
Go home, get some rest.

592
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,686
- I haven't even told her yet.
- You're not going to.

593
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,059
You made a mistake.
You're too close to this.

594
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,322
I'm not gonna allow
you to talk to the family,

595
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:55,197
to anyone else outside
this hospital about this.

596
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,299
Do we understand each other?

597
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:00,995
Yes, sir.

598
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,046
<i>I don't have all
the words to say</i>

599
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,351
<i>I'm still healing
from my mistakes</i>

600
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,822
<i>I'll take the weight if
it makes you stronger</i>

601
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:30,258
<i>I don't want to leave
you in this place</i>

602
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,518
I called San Diego Community
Hospital to thank them

603
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,874
for including us in their study.

604
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,673
They said they
were happy to do it,

605
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,043
and they asked that I pass
along their thanks to you

606
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,575
for your very generous
donation to their burn unit.

607
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,795
I know you come from a wealthy
family, I don't begrudge that,

608
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,927
but you can't open your wallet
every time a patient's in need.

609
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,236
The lines can get
real blurry, real fast.

610
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,199
Yes, sir.

611
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:36,830
<i>Who am I to try and save you</i>

612
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,233
<i>I ain't gonna hide
You have to fight...</i>

613
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,570
What's this?

614
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,002
My healthcare proxy.

615
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,234
Jess, nothing's gonna happen.

616
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,308
Really? That's good to know.

617
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,080
<i>I won't let you down
I won't let you down</i>

618
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,018
<i>No, no, no</i>

619
00:40:57,322 --> 00:41:00,520
<i>I won't let you down
I won't let you down</i>

620
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,787
<i>No, no, no</i>

621
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,829
Well, that was quite a night.

622
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,770
Been a doctor for a long while.

623
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,039
I don't remember a
night quite like that one.

624
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,977
Why did Nurse Ferrara
ask if I wanted love?

625
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,445
'Cause she's a nosy...

626
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,016
Shaun, you really
don't want love?

627
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,025
I loved Steve and my rabbit.

628
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,384
Not anymore.

629
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,686
You don't love them anymore?

630
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,561
No, I don't. They're dead.

631
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,533
You can't love
someone if they're dead.

632
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,870
Well, I've lost people I love.

633
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,504
I miss them. It hurts.
But I still love them.

634
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,041
I don't want love.

635
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,517
Okay.

636
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,423
You want breakfast?

637
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,526
Can I have four
pancakes instead of three?

638
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,760
You can have five.

639
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,365
I only want four.

640
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,228
Okay.

641
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,531
Okay.
