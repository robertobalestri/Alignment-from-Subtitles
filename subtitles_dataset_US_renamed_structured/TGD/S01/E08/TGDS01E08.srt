1
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:34,426
<i>If ever there's a reason to be swept
up in the season of the fallen leaves</i>

2
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,369
<i>And if the days grew shorter
And the darkness drew its order</i>

3
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,569
<i>From the autumn gray</i>

4
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:52,382
<i>I'd rather sit this out and
sleep the day away instead</i>

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,251
<i>My weary eyes a
bit too slow indeed</i>

6
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,220
<i>I'd rather sit this out...</i>

7
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:06,764
<i>To worry about the
emptiness that comes</i>

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,239
<i>If ever there's a reason to
be swept up in the season</i>

9
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,184
<i>Of the fallen leaves</i>

10
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,024
<i>And if the days grew shorter
And the darkness drew its order</i>

11
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,685
<i>From the autumn gray</i>

12
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>I'd rather sit this out and
sleep the day away instead</i>

13
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,597
<i>My weary eyes a
bit too slow indeed</i>

14
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,878
You won't believe the
crap Armen pulled last night.

15
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,647
He cut the power to my
apartment. That's right.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,524
No lights, no Wi-Fi, nothing.

17
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,383
For 15 minutes.

18
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,989
And if I'd have
been on a ventilator,

19
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,862
I could've suffocated
in that time.

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,328
Right? You're a doctor.

21
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,234
You're not on a ventilator.

22
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,532
Thank God for
that. But I could be.

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,964
I mean, it was dark.
I could've tripped.

24
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,200
I should sue him.

25
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,912
Sorry, were you gonna
eat this? I stress eat.

26
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,906
Okay, listen, I
go to talk to him

27
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,385
and he claims that I was
playing my music too loud again.

28
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,919
I wear earplugs when
your music irritates me.

29
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,317
I miss the dripping.

30
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,971
You're missing the
point here, Shaun.

31
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,227
Okay, you knock, you ask.
You don't cut someone's power.

32
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,658
You'd knock, right?

33
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,194
Of course, you would knock.
Any normal person would.

34
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,531
I mean, am I crazy, or
is he a total sociopath?

35
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:53,998
You should get headphones.

36
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,565
Headphones?

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,654
They would
eliminate the sound...

38
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,012
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it. Thank you.

39
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,684
Thank you for being
so objective about this.

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,845
In fact, why don't you go help
Armen write my eviction notice?

41
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,735
Yeah, and I'll never drive
down that street again.

42
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,071
It was a pretty bad memory.

43
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,386
Yeah? But that sounds quite fun,

44
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,530
I mean...

45
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,611
It's kind of hot
for a hike, isn't it?

46
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,447
We're hiking. We're
gonna sweat. It happens.

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,363
All right, don't do nothing
stupid. Open the register.

48
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,822
Put everything in a
bag. Come on, right now.

49
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,201
Hey. Don't move. Give me
your wallets, phones, everything.

50
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,665
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

51
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,456
I said get out your wallet!

52
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,820
Do it now!

53
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,497
Wallet, now!

54
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,394
Is he okay?

55
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,350
We don't know. This was
routed through Basecamp.

56
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,650
They said Shaun was there, but
they didn't say if he was hurt or not.

57
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,194
Well, EMS has two
critical inbounding.

58
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,155
Their hands are a little
full to chat right now.

59
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,313
20-year-old female, single
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

60
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,907
Hypotensive and tachy.
Two liters of saline en route.

61
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,077
Her name's Avery.

62
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,815
We'll take good care of
her. Jared, you're with me.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,362
Blunt-force neck injury. Oxygen
sats just dropped below 80.

64
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,525
Trachea's crushed.

65
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,331
I inserted a laryngeal mask,
but the airway is not secured.

66
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,269
Are you okay? You weren't hurt?

67
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,807
His oropharyngeal anatomy
is distorted from the contusion.

68
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,519
Subcutaneous emphysema.
He's barely moving air.

69
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,876
Let's take him to a bay.
And get me an OR. Now.

70
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,523
I need four units O-negative.
Type and cross her.

71
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,267
She has decreased
breath sounds on the left.

72
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,283
Let's get a chest X-ray on her.

73
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,293
What the hell is he doing here?

74
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,049
It's his fault.

75
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,356
This is all his fault.

76
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,550
Yeah. Clerk says the guy
entered, shouted orders,

77
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,587
and apparently, your
doctor didn't comply.

78
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,165
Girl gets shot
and the store clerk

79
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,733
clocks the gunman with
a bat. That's all we know.

80
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,867
All right. What do you need?

81
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,655
I need forensics on
the gunman and the girl.

82
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,566
All right, we'll let you
know what we find out.

83
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,675
Hey, the police are gonna wanna
talk to you. After that, you can go home.

84
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,567
I should be helping.
My shift is just starting.

85
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,680
You were at the shooting. I
don't have time to hold your hand.

86
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,434
I don't like my hand being held.

87
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,265
Small-caliber bullets.

88
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,273
They ricochet inside. They can cause
multiple and unpredictable injuries.

89
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,846
BP's 90 over 50.

90
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,424
And what do we
need to do about it?

91
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,249
Chest and abdominal X-rays, and
a focused assessment sonogram.

92
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,406
Could use your help
over here, Dr. Melendez.

93
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,615
Are you okay?

94
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,952
Yes, I'm fine.

95
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,557
- You're with me. Get a gown on him.
- Okay.

96
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,871
Entrance wound is down here.

97
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,673
The bullet fractured
the pelvis on the way in.

98
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,708
All right, let's look for an exit
wound. We're gonna roll her on three.

99
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,223
One, two, three...

100
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,028
Right, got it. Between
the second and third rib.

101
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,180
She's hemorrhaging here, too.

102
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,684
Murphy, get us the ultrasound
so we can find out what's inside.

103
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,808
Focused assessment with
sonography and trauma.

104
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,790
No chest contusions or
secondary injuries evident.

105
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,054
Oxygen sats 70.

106
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,927
I can't squeeze the
camera past this collapse.

107
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,640
OR Three's prepped
and ready, but that's it.

108
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,408
We've got a full house
right now up in surgery.

109
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,492
- Next show time's 15 minutes out.
- I could use it.

110
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,045
I gotta get this
bleeding under control.

111
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,269
What's the status on your guy?

112
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,303
Take her up. Take the gunshot.

113
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,103
Hold on. This airway's so damaged,
I can't even do a tracheotomy.

114
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,144
He's got five minutes
until anoxic brain death.

115
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,364
Mine's got pressure. I'll
see what I can do here.

116
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,475
You're scrubbing in with me.

117
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,639
Go ahead and feed the tube
under the collapsed trachea.

118
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,125
Starting high-flow O-2.

119
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,026
And we're good.

120
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,605
Now that our patient
is actually breathing,

121
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,198
we can realign and
repair. Four-O on a driver.

122
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,008
Scissors, sponge stick.

123
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,125
It's a slippery thing letting
your feelings about a patient

124
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,811
influence your medical judgment.

125
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,610
I didn't.

126
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,814
I get the instinct. She's a
victim, he's a shooter. A racist.

127
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,819
Often, we don't even
know we're doing it.

128
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,372
I would never let my personal
feelings impact a patient's care.

129
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,620
She was bleeding out.

130
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,840
And this guy just drew his first
good breath 30 seconds ago.

131
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,025
They were both critical.

132
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,964
He was dying. You
were wrong. Own it.

133
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
You know as well as I do that
that was not an easy call to make.

134
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,495
- Do I?
- Yes.

135
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,125
Clear the field, Dr. Browne.

136
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,313
Not my operative field,
the surgical field. Scrub out.

137
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,476
Excuse me?

138
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,049
You're done. Step out of my OR.

139
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,834
Gail, can you please relieve
Dr. Browne of her instruments

140
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,850
and page Dr. Cleland
to assist me?

141
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,894
Now, isn't this more pleasant?

142
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,154
Aside from the spleen, what
else are we dealing with?

143
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,080
The bullet ruptured her transverse
colon at the splenic flexure.

144
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,746
Put it on our to-do list.

145
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,944
Why does her boyfriend
think it's your fault?

146
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,553
It punctured her diaphragm here
and entered the posterior chest.

147
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,207
She's bleeding again.
Clamp the hilum.

148
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,775
I already did. It's
too damaged to hold.

149
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,858
Gauze.

150
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,962
Hold this right
there. Don't let go.

151
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,146
No, this isn't gonna work.

152
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,386
It's gonna be like sewing
ground beef back into a steak.

153
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,521
All right, new plan. She's gonna
have to live without her spleen.

154
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,604
Metzen and pick-up.

155
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,443
I need a ligating suture around the
splenic artery while I make the cut.

156
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,453
Can you do that for me before this
young lady bleeds out on us, Murphy?

157
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,611
Yes.

158
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,383
Okay, let's move
on to the bowel perf.

159
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,222
Shaun. Thank
God you're all right.

160
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,903
I just heard what happened.

161
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,320
Shaun? Are you all right?

162
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,296
Yes. I wasn't injured.

163
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,030
What happened this morning?

164
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,065
Lea ate my apple.

165
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,071
No, Shaun, at the store this
morning. What happened at the store?

166
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,835
Wallet, now!

167
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,677
- I can't.
- Why the hell not?

168
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,711
You said keep my hands
where you could see them.

169
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,156
My wallet is in my pocket.
You can't see my hands if...

170
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,383
Are you trying to be a hero?

171
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,220
I'm a surgical resident.

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,402
Hey. Hey. Shut the hell up.

173
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,021
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- This isn't a game, man. I'm serious.

174
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,241
Put your damn phone and
wallet on the ground. Right now!

175
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,757
Hey, do you see this, man?
I am not playing around.

176
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,166
Just put your phone and
wallet on the damn ground.

177
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,380
Come on, man.
Just do what he says.

178
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,428
Please listen to him.

179
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,440
Shut up! Just shut up
and get on your knees.

180
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,101
Put your hands and
knees on the ground.

181
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,077
- Yes.
- Get your wallet out right now. Hey!

182
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,255
I will shoot your crazy ass,

183
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,338
- I swear to God.
- Okay.

184
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,091
- Are you listening to me? I'll do it!
- Yes.

185
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,209
Hey! You hear me? Hey!

186
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,140
Oh, my God.

187
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,902
Okay, you need to take
the rest of the day off.

188
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,639
Dr. Melendez said
that, too. Why?

189
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,476
Why? Because you just
experienced a traumatic event...

190
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,551
- It's not my fault.
- I know that.

191
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,654
Avery has multiple injuries.
Dr. Melendez wants me to monitor her.

192
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,754
Dr. Lim.

193
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,212
I was out of line. I shouldn't
have argued with you...

194
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,568
Primary closure went well.

195
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,502
We'll extubate him in a few hours to
prevent any further internal damage.

196
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,798
Oh, that's good.

197
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,003
It is. And you're gonna
make sure he stays that way.

198
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,943
You'll be baby-sitting
him tonight in the ICU.

199
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,643
I'm... I'm not on call.

200
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,910
Great, then you're available.

201
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,231
It should be a quiet night.

202
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,886
Just want to keep
an eye on those vitals.

203
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,454
You never know
with trachea tears.

204
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,082
Can't one of the
ICU nurses do that?

205
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,253
Yep, but they didn't lip
off in my operating room.

206
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,260
And he'd better be
breathing in the morning.

207
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,838
Excuse me, but why is
Shaun on the victim's case?

208
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,135
I assessed him and he
seemed perfectly capable.

209
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,768
You assessed him?
What does that mean?

210
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,279
You asked him how he was
feeling? Are you psychic?

211
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,044
Do you have an advanced
degree in psychology?

212
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,277
You don't know what's
going on in his head.

213
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,814
When I'm in surgery,

214
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,200
my focus is on the person
whose guts are open in front of me

215
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,544
rather than the soul of the
person standing across from me.

216
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,958
And it seems that Shaun doesn't
let anything impact his work.

217
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,707
So along with his
photographic memory,

218
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,723
I'm putting cold-hearted
in the plus column.

219
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,742
Dr. Murphy, do you
understand why you're here?

220
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,341
Yes. Dr. Glassman
said I had to talk to you.

221
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,574
After any doctor goes
through a potentially traumatic...

222
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,708
You have to determine

223
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,049
if I am a medico-legal
liability to the hospital.

224
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,749
Yes. And, more importantly,

225
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,891
it's an opportunity to provide
you with emotional support.

226
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,255
How are you feeling?

227
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,696
You don't have apples.

228
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,372
I'll try to have some
fruit next time we meet.

229
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,167
Good.

230
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,773
Do you regret anything
about this morning?

231
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,343
Why?

232
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,016
After bad things happen,

233
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,918
it's perfectly normal
to replay the events,

234
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,546
wishing you'd done
things differently.

235
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,854
It already happened. I
can't do things differently.

236
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,554
Is talking about
this upsetting you?

237
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,367
What are you thinking
about right now?

238
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,973
Systemic inflammatory
response syndrome.

239
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,256
Surgery went well.

240
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,977
After a serious trauma like
this, the body can develop

241
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,484
a self-destructive
inflammatory reaction.

242
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,120
Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart.

243
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,321
Any, or all of them,
can start to shut down.

244
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,451
We'll be giving her
anti-inflammatories

245
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,759
and monitoring her closely,
but the next 24 hours are critical.

246
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,957
Okay. Thanks. Just
get her through this.

247
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,089
Whatever you gotta do.

248
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,227
Yeah, well, I need consent forms
from your girlfriend's next of kin.

249
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,938
If you could please get her family
in here as quickly as possible.

250
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,267
I can't.

251
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,513
I don't even know her last name.

252
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,410
It was our first date,
we met on a dating app.

253
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,682
We were going hiking, so she
wasn't carrying a purse or ID.

254
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,957
Well, then you really
don't need to be here.

255
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,057
Someone out there
cares about her.

256
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,863
If she dies, I want them to
know someone was with her.

257
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,967
I'll have social work
try to locate her family.

258
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,371
Stay as long as you want.

259
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,492
It looks clean,
dry, and healthy.

260
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,718
My neck is killing me.

261
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,194
How long have you been using?

262
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,333
What's that got to
do with anything?

263
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,733
Well, you've likely built up
a tolerance to pain meds.

264
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,181
And now that you really need
them, they aren't there for you.

265
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,503
That's why I need fentanyl,

266
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,651
a hundred micrograms. Are
you gonna help me or not?

267
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,699
That wouldn't be helping.

268
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,996
The worst thing I could do
for you is feed your habit.

269
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,209
What?

270
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,545
You saw my tattoo.

271
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,575
Yeah.

272
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,385
And now you're punishing me.

273
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,666
- You want this to hurt.
- I am treating you professionally...

274
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,534
If you're treating me professionally,
I wouldn't be in so much pain.

275
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,503
- I'm sorry, but I won't...
- Just give me the damn drugs!

276
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,551
Come on!

277
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:57,213
Melendez thinks that he's okay
being on Avery's case. I don't.

278
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,675
Dr. Melendez may be right.

279
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,051
That case seems to be
Shaun's primary focus right now.

280
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,750
Maybe his condition is a
blessing in this situation.

281
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,881
"Maybe"?

282
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,358
Or obsessing over Avery's health

283
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,346
could be his only outlet
for a guilty conscience.

284
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,064
Watching her suffer could just
be worsening those feelings.

285
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,566
So either it's a huge problem,
or it's not a problem at all.

286
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,229
This is your
professional opinion?

287
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,805
Shaun has a very unique mind
and an incredibly introverted nature.

288
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,741
Well, thank you for that.

289
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,546
I'm sorry, but without a
lot more time with him,

290
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,776
that's the best I can offer.

291
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,259
What did Lim expect me to do?

292
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,454
Stand there and smile while

293
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,394
she called my medical
judgment into question?

294
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,099
Your patient nearly died
waiting on that OR, right?

295
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,794
It was bad. What do
you want me to do?

296
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,392
- Tell her to back off.
- No.

297
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,137
- He's a complete and utter...
- Not one of the nice racists?

298
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,764
- I shouldn't have to be...
- Claire...

299
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,588
Here's what you have to do.

300
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,005
Shut up and do exactly
what Dr. Lim tells you to do.

301
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,170
But, it...

302
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,408
Yes, sir.

303
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,294
Maybe we could take turns.

304
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,026
You keep an eye on my
patient, I keep an eye on yours.

305
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,292
No.

306
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,937
Her creatinine is 1.6.

307
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,307
A mild bump in renal numbers
isn't surprising after all her trauma.

308
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,107
This morning must
have been crazy.

309
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,174
Are you okay?

310
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,684
This morning, my neighbor
Lea came over and ate my apple.

311
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,221
That's too bad.

312
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,827
Yes, it was my last one.

313
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,825
She was upset with
Armen, our landlord.

314
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,665
She plays her music very
loud. I gave her some advice.

315
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,705
It seemed to anger her because
she left without saying goodbye.

316
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,074
And you think you
did something wrong?

317
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,004
No, it was good advice.

318
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,144
Shaun, sometimes a
woman wants advice,

319
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,207
and sometimes she
just wants support.

320
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,588
How can I tell which
one Lea wants?

321
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,018
Err on the side of support.

322
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,060
- That's not helpful.
- Yes, it is.

323
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,095
Dr. Browne, you're
being summoned.

324
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,059
All right.

325
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,898
About time.

326
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,170
All your struggling,
you've pulled out your IV.

327
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,606
Aren't nurses usually
supposed to do this kind of crap?

328
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,385
They let you go to med school,

329
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,540
but they don't trust you
with any real responsibility.

330
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,201
There must be a competent doctor
tucked around here somewhere

331
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,217
who can tell someone I
need more than aspirin.

332
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,625
- "Competent"?
- Yeah. You know what I mean.

333
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,969
Imhotep was the father of
modern medicine. An Egyptian.

334
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,903
Yeah? Good for your people.

335
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,852
I'm willing to bet there's
even been a couple of others

336
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,469
over the last 3,000 years.

337
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,774
But guess what? On average,

338
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,308
you look at most great
technological advancements,

339
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,147
you'll find a proud Northern
European holding the patent.

340
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,788
That's what you were
trying to do this morning?

341
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,623
Get the patent on stealing 30 bucks
from the corner store for a drug fix?

342
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,001
You don't like drug
addicts, do you?

343
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,078
There's a lot of
people I don't like.

344
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:41,301
Thieves, racists, violent
punks. But I'll treat 'em.

345
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,302
Was your momma a drug addict?

346
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,803
Wow.

347
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,010
That's the beauty of clichés,
is they're true so often.

348
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,752
You don't know
anything about me.

349
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,649
I didn't go to college.

350
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,688
I didn't have no affirmative
action to get me in, but you did.

351
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,787
All because some bleeding-heart
liberal in the dean's office

352
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,496
teared up reading your essay
about your crack-whore momma.

353
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:07,998
What the hell?

354
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,002
I guess we're all violent punks.

355
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,984
All you had to do was
give him your wallet.

356
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,075
Her urine output is low.

357
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,881
Whoa! Whoa! What are you
doing? Get away from her!

358
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,893
Hey, hey! You can't be in
here shoving my doctors around.

359
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,476
Me? He's the...

360
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,544
Oh, my God.

361
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,591
She needs dialysis. Her
kidneys are failing fast.

362
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,823
This is the first stage
of total organ failure.

363
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,831
We removed two liters of
excess fluid with dialysis,

364
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,067
but she's getting worse.

365
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,061
Fluid's building
up in her chest.

366
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,701
She's in pulmonary failure, too.

367
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,576
Draining the fluid
in her pleural space

368
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,171
would reduce airway resistance.

369
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,876
Yeah. Let's prep her
for a thoracentesis.

370
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,284
We're gonna have to work fast.

371
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,381
I'll prep the evac drain.

372
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,365
I'm gonna need you to put
that needle right between...

373
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,085
Sixth and seventh rib.

374
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,099
- Wait. You're gonna let him do it?
- Shut up.

375
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,413
Right, careful. Don't put
the needle in too deep.

376
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,157
- We don't wanna give her...
- Pneumothorax.

377
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,569
Right, you're in.

378
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,747
Now let me see
what I can pull out...

379
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,774
And, hopefully,
she settles down.

380
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,796
CO-2's down and O-2's climbing.

381
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,100
We can manage her
kidneys and her lungs,

382
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,652
but the last stop in multiple
organ failure would be her heart.

383
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,067
Watch her ventilation
pressures like a hawk.

384
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,811
Push cardio-protective meds,
and page me if anything changes.

385
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,737
Think you're being her hero?

386
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,823
Fact is, you hardly know her.
And you don't know him at all.

387
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,249
Go home.

388
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,600
Yep?

389
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:05,475
Okay, I am done. He is a
foul-mouthed, spiteful bully.

390
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,369
No problem. I'll
have the concierge

391
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,380
find a patient more
suited to your liking.

392
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,781
He doesn't need a doctor doting
over him. He doesn't want me.

393
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,177
I don't care.

394
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,987
Look... I am sorry I
disagreed with you, okay?

395
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,495
But I don't deserve to be
scolded like a schoolgirl

396
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,190
because your ego can't
handle being challenged a little.

397
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,989
That is some apology.

398
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,614
Look, I had a legitimate...

399
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,012
You really don't see
the problem here?

400
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,868
What? With challenging you?

401
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:38,577
Right now, you are confronting
me in front of two nurses.

402
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,970
Would you do that to Melendez?

403
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,475
Or would you wait five minutes?

404
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,887
I have dealt with men undermining
my authority my entire career.

405
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,084
We shouldn't do it
to one another, too.

406
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,251
Now go take care of him, like
you would any other patient.

407
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,430
Hey, hey, hey.

408
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,065
Food services, they
double-check every order.

409
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,905
- What are you looking for?
- An apple.

410
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,755
- An apple? Who's getting an apple?
- I am.

411
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:14,906
- No.
- Shaun,

412
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,173
forget the apple, please.

413
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,915
I'm sorry, can I have a minute?

414
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,741
Shaun?

415
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,377
Okay.

416
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,961
Shaun, there's no need
to get defensive, okay?

417
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,860
- Do you wanna sit down?
- No, thank you.

418
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,303
I want you to tell me again
exactly what happened this morning.

419
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,564
I told you exactly what
happened this morning.

420
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,405
Yes, but people have told you
that it's your fault, haven't they?

421
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,707
My actions and the shooting
were associative incidents.

422
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,910
It is not a causal relationship.

423
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,780
I paced and she got shot, but
pacing doesn't cause shootings.

424
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,444
Otherwise, every time someone
paced a shooting would soon follow.

425
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,717
Okay, that's a very good point.

426
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:04,958
When someone has a gun and
it's a dangerous situation, right?

427
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,056
You don't wanna upset the situation,
you don't wanna make it worse.

428
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,236
You think this is my fault, too?

429
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,669
No. No. It was the shoot...

430
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,573
It was the shooter's fault,

431
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,636
but your actions may
have contributed to it.

432
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,274
Okay, Shaun, wait a
second. Wait a second.

433
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,910
I know your behavior is not
completely in your control,

434
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:30,149
but I also know it's not
completely out of your control. Is it?

435
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,024
So, yes, maybe it is
a little bit your fault.

436
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,296
And definitely mine.

437
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,864
You weren't even there.

438
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,202
That's right, I wasn't there.

439
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,809
Can we sit down,
please? Just for a second.

440
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,182
Shaun, I convinced myself
that everything was fine,

441
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,381
because in here it is.

442
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,514
It's great.

443
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,718
But you need help.

444
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,120
Shaun?

445
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,558
You need guidance.

446
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,001
Much more than I can give you.

447
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,236
I'm supposed to
be with my patient.

448
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,470
I'm supposed to be
watching her like a hawk.

449
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,897
It's my fault.

450
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,901
I didn't like her.

451
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,266
When I first saw her
this morning, she just...

452
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,840
It didn't look...

453
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,575
I don't know, I...

454
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:14,058
I mean, I wanted to blow
her off, so I said I forgot water.

455
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,461
And I figured we'd
go to the store,

456
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,273
and then I'd pretend
that I forgot my wallet.

457
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,890
I knew she didn't
have her purse, so...

458
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,132
You can't go hiking
without water, right?

459
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,537
I mean, no harm, no foul.

460
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,868
She was there because of me.

461
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,548
She's here because of me.

462
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,044
It's not a causal relationship.

463
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,555
Wait, excuse me?

464
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,959
It's not a causal relationship.
Lying and shootings.

465
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,744
Lying doesn't cause shootings,
otherwise, every time someone lied...

466
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,336
Her pulse pressure is narrow.

467
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,735
Wait, what does that mean?

468
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:00,929
She's dying.

469
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,634
Page Melendez. Stat.

470
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,948
Your respiratory rate is up.

471
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,144
- Are you having trouble breathing?
- Yeah, it's tight.

472
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,029
Find Dr. Lim.

473
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,833
Narrow pulse pressure
indicates a reduced cardiac output.

474
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,535
The inflammation
is affecting her heart.

475
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,265
She's in end-stage
organ failure.

476
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,218
Yes, we can insert an
intra-aortic balloon pump.

477
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,584
That may reduce some of
the workload on her heart,

478
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,839
but it's failing
fast. Really fast.

479
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,776
It only needs to work overnight.

480
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,790
The inflammatory reaction
will improve after that.

481
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,014
What if it's failing so fast
because it's not her heart?

482
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,219
Her hemoglobin's dropped from
14 to 12 between her last two draws.

483
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,132
What if the real problem is
she's bleeding somewhere?

484
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,819
Given what she's been through, a
two-point drop could mean nothing.

485
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:54,951
Or it could mean a bleed,

486
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,804
which would account for
the narrow pulse pressure.

487
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,023
Her heart could be fine.

488
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,579
If you're right, that means
we'd have to open her back up.

489
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,511
I don't know if her body
could handle another operation.

490
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,559
No, it can't.

491
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,639
Treating heart failure
with an aortic pump

492
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,071
is also a simple procedure.

493
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,470
So we're going to diagnose based
on which procedure is simpler?

494
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,511
If I'm right, there could be no
more blood to pump. She'll be dead.

495
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,207
She's crashing.

496
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,180
We should prepare
the cath lab for a pump.

497
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,585
We should prepare the OR.

498
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,255
Let's get her into an OR. Now.

499
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,534
Hemoglobin's dropped to eight.

500
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,767
She is bleeding out.

501
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,253
Yes, she is. But where?

502
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,888
Gotta find where the
bleeder's coming from

503
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,380
and clip it before she dies.

504
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,907
I got nothing.

505
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,328
It must be hidden underneath the
retro peritoneum or mediastinum.

506
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,997
That's a lot of real estate to cut
open and just go blindly looking.

507
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,115
We should start with the
abdomen. She was shot there.

508
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,701
The bullet passed
through the posterior thorax.

509
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,421
BP's 40 over palp.
She's dying, Neil.

510
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,338
Whatever you're gonna
do, you need to do it now.

511
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,722
We need to look everywhere.
Give me a knife and sternal saw,

512
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,562
I'm gonna open her
up from chest to pelvis.

513
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,547
Prep the sternum and
abdomen with betadine.

514
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,504
We're gonna need a sponge
stick to control the bleeding.

515
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,740
Stop!

516
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,883
Open her between the second
and third rib on the left side.

517
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,969
The bullet nicked the left
supreme intercostal artery.

518
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,052
The wall has blown.

519
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,605
How do you know?

520
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,291
I followed the injuries.

521
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,767
Pelvis to bowel to
spleen to diaphragm.

522
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,133
Next target has to be left
supreme intercostal artery.

523
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,785
All right. Prep the
left intercostal space.

524
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,243
I can't breathe. Why
aren't you helping me?

525
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,148
Dr. Lim will be along
in just two minutes.

526
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,652
You're a damn
doctor. Do your job.

527
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:04,747
Can't breathe.

528
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,459
I need to open up the
left neck compartment.

529
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,765
It'll relieve the
pressure. Procedure tray.

530
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,048
Have you done this before?

531
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,675
Nope. Scalpel.

532
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,386
It's too swollen, I can't
see the Adam's apple.

533
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,723
Okay, cut along the soft divot

534
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,354
between the carotid
sheath and the trachea.

535
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,558
Soft divot. Got it.

536
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,037
Update me.

537
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,643
What did you do?

538
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,696
He had a cervical hematoma,
I had to relieve the pressure.

539
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,744
Here?

540
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,054
Oxygen sats are going up.

541
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,907
It's rare, but post-op swelling
can happen with tracheal tears.

542
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,366
That's why we watch them
so closely the first 24 hours.

543
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,995
You mind if we finish this
off in the operating room?

544
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,876
I don't see anything, Shaun.
No blood and no arterial tear.

545
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,675
You're too high. It's
near the bifurcation.

546
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,771
Can I get some light in?

547
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,354
I got something. Blood's pooling

548
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,413
right under the
bifurcation. Clamp, now.

549
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,941
She wasn't in heart failure.

550
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,122
That means her heart is still strong
enough to get her through the night.

551
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,110
I was wrong.

552
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,543
Yeah, and you
just made up for it.

553
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,381
You were right, Jared.

554
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,988
Good work.

555
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:53,515
You know what? You were
right, my mother had problems.

556
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,926
So I couldn't
afford to sit around

557
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,761
expecting everything
to be handed to me,

558
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,595
or whatever else it is
that's holding you back.

559
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,196
And yeah, I got some breaks.
But I worked my ass off.

560
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,798
Two jobs, two room-mates,
every step of the way.

561
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:11,371
And that is what got me to the
place where I could save your life.

562
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,770
Your daughter's not
out of the woods yet,

563
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,025
but I do expect her condition
to improve day by day.

564
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,130
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

565
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,293
You're welcome.

566
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,050
Hey. Avery.

567
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,209
Sorry we weren't here for you.

568
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,583
How are you feeling?

569
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,419
I probably won't be
hiking any time soon.

570
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:05,822
Hey.

571
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,894
Are you sneaking out
before I can thank you?

572
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,166
Please, you don't
need to thank me.

573
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,440
Yeah, I do.

574
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,167
And apologize.

575
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,244
I was wrong about you.

576
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,286
I thought you were
trying to ditch me.

577
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,758
I was hoping you
were trying to ditch me.

578
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,761
I'm sorry.

579
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,300
When you're feeling better,

580
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,306
I'd like a second
chance at a first date.

581
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,918
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,068
You were right. I
publicly disrespected you.

583
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,770
And so I thought it only
right to publicly respect you.

584
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,974
I am grateful for the
chance to learn from you.

585
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,584
I know you needed this victory.

586
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,684
Glad you saved a life today.

587
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,579
Just wish it wasn't a Nazi.

588
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,147
Lane number two.

589
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,124
Maddie always took that lane.

590
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:19,154
She'd tuck in behind me and
draft until the last 200 meters.

591
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,194
It's a dirty little trick.

592
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,499
- And it worked.
- Every time.

593
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,038
Thirteen years ago today.

594
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,405
Yeah.

595
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,375
I miss her, too.

596
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,647
Gave her space.

597
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,651
Right? I gave her space.

598
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,192
And she just drifted
farther and farther away.

599
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,527
Everything I did, I did wrong.

600
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,096
You did your best.

601
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:04,368
I was practically living
at your house back then.

602
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,843
And, I mean, if I hadn't...

603
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,670
You were both...

604
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,084
Teenagers. You were idiots.

605
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,578
You got lucky, she didn't.

606
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,289
If I was there more,

607
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,233
if I stayed on her...

608
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,198
You're there for him.

609
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,791
<i>Here's your extended
forecast for the week.</i>

610
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,751
<i>Starting off with a little bit of
cloud cover in San Francisco...</i>

611
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,417
<i>expect dry conditions for
the next seven days here in...</i>

612
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,054
I, uh, saw your light.

613
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,329
I'm sorry.

614
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:11,170
Claire told me to apologize because
you didn't want me to tell the truth.

615
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,571
You only wanted me
to support your position,

616
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,144
even though it's wrong.

617
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,249
Well, I don't accept.

618
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,348
I may have overreacted
this morning.

619
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,516
A little.

620
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,417
And you were honest.

621
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,120
Brutally honest,

622
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,096
but you shouldn't have to
wear earplugs in your own home.

623
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,866
And don't start lying to
me to make me feel good.

624
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,301
You're the only
honest guy I know.

625
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,499
So...

626
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,514
Have a good night, Shaun Murphy,

627
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,879
and I will try not
to keep you up.

628
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:10,566
<i>I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are</i>

629
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,570
<i>In case you don't know</i>

630
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:19,906
<i>I'll be the wind, the
rain and the sunset</i>

631
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:25,477
<i>The light on your door
to show that you're home</i>

632
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,185
<i>'Cause when you think
the night has seen...</i>

633
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,551
I made a mistake today.

634
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,416
And someone got hurt.

635
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:43,999
<i>Let me stand to
show that you are blind</i>

636
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:48,103
<i>Please put down your hands</i>

637
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,511
<i>'Cause I see you</i>
