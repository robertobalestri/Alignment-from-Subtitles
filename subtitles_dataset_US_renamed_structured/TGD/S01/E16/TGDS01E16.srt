1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,835
My neighbor Kenny and
his girlfriend go all the time.

2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,969
The rides were actually fun,
Claire, even though they hurl you

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,674
through the air very quickly
without a proper three-point seat belt.

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,479
It was worth the $300 I spent.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,095
What kind of carnival
cost you that much money?

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,179
It was not just the carnival.

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,384
Kenny's girlfriend wanted to
go to see a movie afterwards.

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:28,395
But I just got the second edition of
Chaikof's <i>Atlas of Vascular Therapy,</i>

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,896
so decided not to go.

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,523
- And you paid for everyone?
- I had to. I lost the bet.

11
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,068
Rounds will have to wait.
We have a consult come up.

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,695
Hunter Denoble, 38. Came
into the ER this morning,

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,841
complaining of severe neck
pain. X-rays show anterolisthesis.

14
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,207
A herniated disc? 38, a
little young for that, isn't it?

15
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,837
Unless there's a
history of spinal trauma.

16
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,145
There is. Hunter fractured seven
vertebrae in his neck and back

17
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,014
in a motorcycle
accident 10 years ago.

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,643
He was one of my first patients.

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,211
Suffered complete paralysis
from the chest down.

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,927
A few months back, just gnawing
pain. Ibuprofen usually took the edge off.

21
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,052
Every day?

22
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,995
Ah, yeah, give or take.

23
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,557
It's not that bad.

24
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,329
Last night, things changed.
He couldn't move his neck at all.

25
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,930
And the pain medicine had no
effect. So he wanted to tough it out,

26
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,439
but I dragged him in here.

27
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,947
Yeah, sounds like you.

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,355
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,177
- And that?
- Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,340
I made partner at the firm.
I don't like to call in sick.

31
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,707
And let's face it,

32
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,776
I've spent enough nights in
hospital rooms for five lifetimes.

33
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,182
Can't argue with that.

34
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,785
Squeeze my hands?

35
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,189
You have any tingling or
weakness in your arms?

36
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,284
No.

37
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,990
The plain film showed what
looked like a herniated disc,

38
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,291
which would mean...

39
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,194
Artificial disc replacement,
day procedure.

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,796
He'd be out by the
morning at the latest.

41
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,171
You married him?

42
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,539
Yes. Three years ago,
in CancÃºn. It was lovely.

43
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,606
Even though he's
in a wheelchair?

44
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,452
- Shaun...
- No worries. I get this all the time.

45
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,448
Sure, she can never wear
heels, but think of the parking.

46
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,684
- Ah!
- What happened?

47
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,823
Pain shot right down
through my legs.

48
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,093
- Your legs?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,393
I haven't felt anything
below my chest in 10 years.

50
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,728
What the hell is going on?

51
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,714
<i>When I saw the break of day</i>

52
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,510
<i>I wished that I could fly away</i>

53
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,316
<i>Instead of kneeling in the sand</i>

54
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,421
<i>Catching teardrops in my hand</i>

55
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:49,596
<i>My heart is drenched in wine</i>

56
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:55,738
<i>But you'll be on my mind</i>

57
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>Forever...</i>

58
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,270
Mom?

59
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,406
Why, there's my girl!

60
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,588
I don't wanna see you.

61
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,216
I haven't seen you in years.

62
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,022
Don't run away from
me. Can we talk?

63
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,204
Since I don't wanna see you,

64
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,595
it follows that I don't
wanna hear from you either.

65
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,900
I just came in to get antibiotics.
My surgeon doesn't work on Fridays.

66
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,900
It feels fine.

67
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,865
Sorry, it's not fine.

68
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,175
This implant is
definitely infected.

69
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,710
Just that one, though, right?

70
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,972
Yes, at this point, your
butt-lift, tummy-tuck, lipo,

71
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,109
and breast augmentation
appear to be healthy.

72
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,922
I need to remove this one and clean
the area before the bacteria spreads.

73
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,218
Well, can you replace it?

74
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,652
Once the infection is resolved
and you have a few months to heal.

75
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,859
I don't wanna walk around with
half of a face for a few months.

76
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,971
Isn't there anything you
can do to save the implant?

77
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,662
I can't make any guarantees,

78
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,967
but if I can replace the implant
without risking reinfection, I will.

79
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,067
Okay, Doctor.

80
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,080
I didn't understand the lyrics,
but I liked your mom's voice.

81
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,256
Is she a professional singer?

82
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,123
She is a lot of things.

83
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,620
A great mom wasn't one of them.

84
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,122
How so?

85
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,300
A lot of people have issues
with their parents. Nothing new.

86
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,770
But, well, everyone's
story is different.

87
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,838
How so?

88
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,476
When I was in high school, I
babysat the kids in my neighborhood.

89
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,541
I wanted to buy a laptop for
school like a lot of my friends had,

90
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,180
so I saved up 1,000 bucks.

91
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,587
I came home one day,
and the money was gone,

92
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,991
and so was my mother.

93
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,021
And three days later,

94
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:04,236
she came back from Reno with a
designer dress and a guy named Ricky.

95
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,664
I never got the laptop.

96
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,848
My mom made
pancakes. They were good.

97
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,022
Mmm. What is that?

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,856
I've never seen
anything like that.

99
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,795
Maybe a spinal column tumor?

100
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,356
Hunter's initial
spinal cord injury

101
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,336
from the motorcycle accident
that caused his paralysis was at T1.

102
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,340
But that part looks almost
completely normal now.

103
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,075
Hunter's phantom pain

104
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,540
is real.

105
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,941
My former mentor, Sonya Kung,

106
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,351
is head of the surgical residency
program at Denver Memorial Hospital.

107
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,413
If you want a meeting,
I'll make a call.

108
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,850
Why?

109
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,791
You're gonna need
a job after this year.

110
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,440
Are you trying to screw with my
head, or are you actually being serious?

111
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,262
The opportunity is real.

112
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,903
I'm trying to be nice. I do
that when it doesn't hurt me.

113
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,764
And this definitely doesn't hurt you,
you getting rid of some competition.

114
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,367
True.

115
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,175
Although you're not
high on my list of threats.

116
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,477
This would be a much
bigger benefit for you.

117
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,039
Look, I fought to stay here.

118
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,979
I'm not going anywhere.

119
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,594
It's very rare, but,
after many years,

120
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,063
with a bruised cord like
yours that isn't severed,

121
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,789
it can start to function again.

122
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,862
So this mass is
causing Hunter's pain?

123
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:43,995
Yes.

124
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,904
If the cord is healthy, why
aren't I feeling more than pain?

125
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,942
The mass is compressing
the healthy cord,

126
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,272
just letting the pain through.

127
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,075
We still have to do some more
advanced imaging to map the mass,

128
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,277
but I'm fairly confident that if
we removed it, that could change.

129
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,516
You may be able to walk again.

130
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,944
We were able to clean out the
infection and swap in a new implant.

131
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,266
I'm very pleased.

132
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,014
- You think it looks okay?
- I love it.

133
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,872
And you are going to
look great at the beach.

134
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,237
Wailea.

135
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,640
We went there on our
honeymoon. Thank you.

136
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,180
Ooh, well, he's taking you to
Hawaii. You should be hugging him.

137
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,878
I'm so relieved.

138
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,392
Satisfied customers.

139
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,985
This is why cosmetics
is the most fun speciality.

140
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,440
Now, we're gonna
monitor you closely.

141
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,064
There is a risk the infection could
have seeded to other implants.

142
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,427
Keep me posted.

143
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,662
Yes, Chief.

144
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,635
I'll take the early shift.

145
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,245
Once I'm on my feet, I'm
never sitting down again.

146
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,513
I'm gonna take Cora
dancing. She's a great dancer.

147
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:08,883
Oh, no. I push myself.
No offense. It's my rule.

148
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,518
Right.

149
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:18,021
If this works, after a considerable
amount of physical therapy,

150
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,794
you may be able to walk,

151
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,426
but that doesn't mean
you'll be a very good dancer.

152
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,937
After years of atrophy
from not moving your legs,

153
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,473
you will likely be very bad.

154
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,768
You know what the worst part is?

155
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,172
It isn't being in a chair. It's
that people see the chair first.

156
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,018
They don't see me. You
know what I'm talking about.

157
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,919
Why would I know what
you're talking about?

158
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,291
My brother-in-law is on the
spectrum. So is my assistant.

159
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,884
I make it a priority of hiring
people with disabilities.

160
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,987
Let me guess. When you
first started working here,

161
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,122
no one believed in you.

162
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,290
They didn't know me.

163
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,891
They didn't know that I was
going to make a good surgeon.

164
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,129
No.

165
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,799
You were different.

166
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,332
I guarantee you,

167
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,037
every other doctor started
with a basic level of respect.

168
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,940
It's implied. They're competent.

169
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,215
We waste our time and energy
trying to prove that we belong.

170
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,623
- I'm fine.
- She's just being thorough, honey.

171
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,562
You've been over
my body three times.

172
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,761
Early infections often mimic
blemishes. It pays to be thorough.

173
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,329
Is this sore?

174
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,172
Maybe a little.

175
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,039
- What's wrong?
- It could be nothing,

176
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,239
or it could be a carbuncle,
an early sign of infection.

177
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,475
Dr. Andrews needs
to have a look at this.

178
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,890
This varicocele is raising
testicular temperature

179
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,790
and causing your
sperm count to be low.

180
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,796
Surgically, I go in,
ligate the varicocele,

181
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,798
and recheck your
numbers in a few weeks.

182
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,733
It's done under a local,
so no anesthesia risks,

183
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,894
minimal blood loss.

184
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,268
There's a risk of low
testosterone and impotence,

185
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,432
but recovery time is
usually a week at most.

186
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,856
So I could have kids. I just
might not be able to make them?

187
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,473
As I said, it's low risk.

188
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,660
I only mention it because
I'm obligated to inform you.

189
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,449
Well, you're obligated to
inform me because it's a risk.

190
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,380
It's an unlikely complication,
but, yes, it happens.

191
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,486
It's outpatient. I do it
right here in the office.

192
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,858
What I see here is a
chance to fix a problem.

193
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,965
And I see a chance
to create a new one.

194
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,971
I'm sorry. I have to
go. I have a patient.

195
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,476
Look, I see a lot of
men with this issue.

196
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,107
Sure, they come in
because they want kids,

197
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,545
but I think what they really
want is to reaffirm themselves,

198
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,242
and that's a good thing.

199
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,542
Thank you.

200
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,156
It's a spinal
arachnoid meningioma.

201
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,854
Have you seen
one of these before?

202
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,658
Much smaller. They
usually don't get this big

203
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,859
because the pain and weakness
brings the patient into the ER fast.

204
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,467
But in this case, no pain,
no ER visit until it got this big.

205
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,214
And it's wrapped around
the spinal cord tightly

206
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,297
and fused with the dura.

207
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,693
Can we get a fibre-optic laser
and take it out in segments?

208
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,373
No, I don't think so.

209
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,012
It's stopped growing
and settled in this position.

210
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,845
But I do think that we can dissect
along the subarachnoid plane

211
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,549
down to the largest segment
at T2 and remove it in one piece.

212
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,887
That's an extension of the mass.

213
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,754
Mmm, no, it's the
medullary pyramids.

214
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,260
No, it's an extension
of the mass.

215
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,591
The pyramids are more
central, and the color is wrong.

216
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,699
Murphy's right.

217
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,197
The extension's tightly
adhered to the brainstem.

218
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,778
- Who caught it?
- Jared did.

219
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,627
Nice work. Most first-year
residents would have missed this.

220
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,149
It's very small on the surface,

221
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,979
but I can feel the
fluctuance under the skin.

222
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,447
What do we need to do to fix it?

223
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,660
We need to remove
all of the implants,

224
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,060
and some of the healthy
underlying tissue as well.

225
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,725
Unfortunately, it will cause
significant permanent scarring.

226
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,237
No, no, no, you can't do that.
I'll look worse than I did before.

227
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,637
I don't get it. You removed the
bad part from her face, and it's fixed.

228
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,374
It looks good.
No more infection.

229
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,953
Let's just do the same
with the rest of them.

230
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,172
It's not that simple.

231
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,079
When we removed the
infection from Emma's cheek,

232
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,582
it was under the pretense
it was a localized issue.

233
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,376
If we just take out the
infection from the new area,

234
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,614
it could jump again.

235
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,947
I won't do it.

236
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,923
When an infection spreads,
it often moves very quickly.

237
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,304
What Dr. Andrews is saying...

238
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,126
I understand what he's saying.

239
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,797
I'm 50 years old.

240
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,970
When I went to drop my
daughter off at Michigan,

241
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,305
we went to that bar
on Liberty Street,

242
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,369
where we first met.

243
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,341
I saw myself sitting
there 25 years ago,

244
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,675
young, confident,
full of potential.

245
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,615
Then you raise a kid,

246
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,952
and look after your
husband, a home,

247
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,824
lose touch with who you were.

248
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,506
You said it was
an infection, right?

249
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,967
Like strep throat or something?

250
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,534
That's what antibiotics are for.

251
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,703
Couldn't we just use them?

252
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:40,118
We could try strong,
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

253
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,156
But I really don't wanna do
that. You could become septic.

254
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,349
You could die.

255
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,327
It'll work. It has to.

256
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,230
The brainstem is complex.

257
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,935
Even our best imaging can't
provide a complete picture.

258
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,343
So then you would just
leave the cyst in him?

259
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,571
Other than the pain,
it's not harming Hunter.

260
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,309
It's stabilized now
and done growing.

261
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,611
But what about the pain?

262
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,348
An implanted nerve inhibitor
will completely remove the pain.

263
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,356
But I won't be able to walk.

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,521
No.

265
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,569
Exactly how risky is removing
the mass from the brainstem?

266
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,537
Everything that keeps
your heart beating

267
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,925
and you breathing
is right there.

268
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,732
The nerve inhibitor
is a day procedure.

269
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,801
You'd sleep in your
bed tonight pain-free.

270
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,022
Give me a percentage
on this thing.

271
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,309
Don't do this to yourself.

272
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,058
I don't like to give
those kinds of numbers.

273
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,175
They're population-based,

274
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,794
and they don't apply to
your exact circumstances.

275
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,411
I understand how
statistics work.

276
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,422
But there's a number,
and it's relevant.

277
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,153
There's a 15% chance
this surgery would kill you.

278
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,235
I remember the moment I
accepted I'd never walk again.

279
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,940
It wasn't when Dr. Melendez
told me after the accident.

280
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,978
A few months later,

281
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,276
I was in rehab, and I was trying
to get up in the standing frame.

282
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,548
I looked out the window,

283
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,181
and there was all these
people just living their lives.

284
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,628
I'm trying to fix something
that I can't change,

285
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,422
and life was going
on without me.

286
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,865
So I started living again.

287
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,642
But now there's
something I can do.

288
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,874
Hunter...

289
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,512
I wanna talk to Dr. Melendez.

290
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,328
- No.
- Please.

291
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,627
Just go get Dr. Melendez.

292
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,374
You curious?

293
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,107
About why I gave you the credit?

294
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,015
I assume you
thought it was a set-up.

295
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,964
That Andrews thought you were
wrong, and you tried to throw it on me.

296
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,718
That's very cynical.

297
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,858
The other alternative is
that you were being kind,

298
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,293
which seems very unlikely.

299
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,763
There is a third possibility.

300
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,164
I'm proving a point.

301
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,869
When you lose their respect,
no matter what you do,

302
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,565
no matter how many wins you
chalk up, you'll never get it back.

303
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,765
The game's already
over. You lost.

304
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,011
Does anyone like you?

305
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,940
I like me.

306
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,443
I've got results.

307
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,817
I know this is her first
cycle of antibiotics,

308
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,552
but I'm not seeing
any improvement.

309
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,723
Her neutrophils
are through the roof.

310
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,523
You'd be under
anesthesia for nine hours.

311
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,691
I'll need to make sure

312
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,377
that your body's healthy
enough to handle the stress.

313
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,768
Will you tell him not
to do this? Please.

314
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,215
You don't care what I think?

315
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,799
I'm the one in the chair. You
have no idea what that's like.

316
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,366
I'm right there with you.

317
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,201
Who carries you up the stairs?

318
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,547
Who pushes you
out through the sand

319
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,025
so you can put your
feet in the water?

320
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,727
Well, this way you won't have
to do those things anymore.

321
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,591
So you just wanna
gamble the life that you have

322
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,678
for the life that you had?

323
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,915
Cora,

324
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,823
we have a great life,

325
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,154
but I wanna walk again.

326
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,788
And I want you to see me walk.

327
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,061
I'm not gonna stand
by and watch you die.

328
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,901
If you wanna selfishly
gamble your life away,

329
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,934
you're doing it on your own.

330
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,904
I'm doing this for us.

331
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,607
No, you're doing this for you.

332
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,154
She'll be back.

333
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,470
Hey. Uh, I got a page.

334
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,043
I'm busy, and I don't like being
tricked into coming down here.

335
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,189
Yeah, I know you hate me...

336
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,876
I don't hate you. But seeing
you is not healthy for me.

337
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,950
Okay, wait. Well, I just needed
to tell you that I was sick.

338
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,356
I am sick.

339
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,828
I know. You've been telling
me that for years. You were right.

340
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,291
I got help.

341
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,626
They have me on
mood stabilizers.

342
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,832
I'm doing better now.

343
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,497
I mean, sometimes, the
meds make me feel flat.

344
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,369
You know, no highs, no fun.

345
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,006
No lows though,
either. It's worth it.

346
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,010
I'd like to try again
to be your mom.

347
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,350
I mean, maybe we could
just talk some more?

348
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,488
I'll think about it.

349
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,883
Well, take these.

350
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,818
They need water,
or they're gonna die.

351
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,890
My number's on the card.

352
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,308
I think I just won
the Tour de France.

353
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,710
It's a long surgery.

354
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,772
It will put a lot of
strain on your heart.

355
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,051
Your cardiovascular
fitness is excellent.

356
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,624
You get it, right?

357
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,258
Get what?

358
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,599
Why I want the surgery so bad.

359
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,681
You'd jump at a cure
for autism, wouldn't you?

360
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,265
There isn't a cure for autism.

361
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:13,102
Well, last week, I didn't think
there was a surgery to help me.

362
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,585
The surgery isn't
guaranteed to help you walk.

363
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,917
Why would you risk losing a person
who accepts you the way you are?

364
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,590
You may not find another one.

365
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,893
There are a lot of reasons
to marry me, you know.

366
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,742
I'm sure there are a lot
of reasons to marry you.

367
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,064
Yes. I'm organized.

368
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,933
I have excellent
visual-spatial memory.

369
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,201
And Lea says I'm
refreshingly honest and fair.

370
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,303
I suppose Cora loves me
because I'm determined,

371
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,611
and I'm pretty smart.

372
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,581
Committed to helping others.

373
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,183
Most of all, probably,
because I'm patient.

374
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,786
Were you always those things?

375
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,356
Were you those things before
you were in the wheelchair?

376
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,691
Your autism helped
you. That's your point?

377
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,035
You're saying this chair
made me a better person?

378
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,538
The difference is,

379
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,506
losing this chair now

380
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,844
won't make me lose
the lessons it gave me.

381
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,451
The antibiotics aren't working.

382
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,885
I told you if they didn't,
we'd be doing surgery next.

383
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,458
No.

384
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,195
She's going to die
if we don't act now.

385
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,166
Honey,

386
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,142
we need to listen
to the doctors.

387
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,870
I need you to trust me.

388
00:21:57,016 --> 00:22:01,010
I can't go back to
being like it used to be.

389
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,249
You don't have a choice.

390
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,228
She wants a second opinion.

391
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,124
She's going to die.

392
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,395
I told her that.

393
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,288
Sometimes, it's tough to
actually get out of those doors.

394
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,590
When I was kid,

395
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,758
my little sister had an
accident climbing a tree.

396
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,795
A traumatic brain injury.

397
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,796
And I woke up every morning
dreaming that she was better,

398
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,375
but she wasn't.

399
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,305
I took care of her a lot.

400
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,308
Brushed her teeth,
combed her hair, fed her.

401
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,448
Hunter was my first
patient as an attending.

402
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,422
And I had to walk in that room

403
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,084
and tell him that there was
nothing I could do for him,

404
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,990
nothing I could do to fix him.

405
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,055
And now there is?

406
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,102
But there's no guarantee.

407
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,932
There is never a guarantee.

408
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,341
I'm sorry,

409
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:38,111
but I can't risk losing the
man that I fell in love with.

410
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,182
You're not just afraid that
the surgery will kill him.

411
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,818
You're afraid
that it might work.

412
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,792
You've only known
Hunter in a wheelchair.

413
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:56,097
Walking would be a
fundamental change in who he is,

414
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,128
a fundamental change in
who you are as a couple.

415
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,374
You're worried that no matter what
happens, you're gonna lose him.

416
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,082
Hunter seems to
have a great life.

417
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,015
I don't know if I'd
risk giving that up.

418
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,780
What if there was an operation
to make you a perfect doctor,

419
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,481
never make a mistake,

420
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,117
but it had a, you know, 5% chance
of killing you? Would you do it?

421
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,261
That's not a fair comparison.

422
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,627
Well, you said Hunter's
doing fine the way he is,

423
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,858
but we're talking about
giving him something more.

424
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,995
What about 2%?

425
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,814
I don't think there's
a number for me.

426
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,397
Of course there's a number.

427
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,218
Every time you get in your car...
Hell, every time you leave your home,

428
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,007
you take a risk something bad
could happen, but you do it anyway,

429
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,643
you know, to make yourself
better, to make the world better,

430
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,449
sometimes just to have fun.

431
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,850
Sometimes to go to a carnival.

432
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,415
Kenny's not your friend.

433
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,521
He's using you.

434
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,695
I don't think so. We have fun.

435
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,021
He's got a rap sheet.

436
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:01,192
Mostly misdemeanors, but
there's a couple of felony-theft cases

437
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,091
that were bargained down.

438
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:06,471
Wait. You ran a
background check on Kenny?

439
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,031
Well, you start by talking. I
start by gathering evidence.

440
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:12,875
I'll forward it to you.

441
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,405
In my experience, there
are only two reasons

442
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,126
why a married person has
this kind of cosmetic surgery.

443
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,360
Either you're halfway
out the door, or she is.

444
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,062
Emma loves me.

445
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:40,799
That's what I figured.

446
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,603
The antibiotics aren't working,

447
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,942
so your wife is going to die

448
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,540
unless you get in there,

449
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,292
and you convince her that she
doesn't need any of this cosmetic surgery

450
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,615
because you are a
faithful, loving husband.

451
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:03,955
How's the pain?

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,402
You know, I think the adrenaline
of actually doing this is helping.

453
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,132
It's the oxycodone.

454
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,100
That's good.

455
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,570
I'm glad you came back.

456
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,404
I never left.

457
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,850
I don't wanna do
this without you.

458
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,855
I don't wanna do
anything without you.

459
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:39,354
If you can walk,
you'll be different.

460
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,096
You won't need me anymore.

461
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,130
You think I married you

462
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,936
'cause I was having trouble
hanging clothes in my closet?

463
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,976
You're my girl.

464
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,472
I will always need
you, even if I can fly.

465
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,274
Who's gonna remind me to
call my mom on her birthday?

466
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,577
Or floss? God, I hate flossing.

467
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,783
Who's gonna remind
me to be a better person?

468
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,963
Who's gonna hold my
hand when I'm scared?

469
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,968
That was nice.

470
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,224
You have to have the surgery.

471
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,527
You were distant before.

472
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,370
But since the surgery,
you can't get enough of me.

473
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,104
It worked. You're
happy. I'm happy.

474
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,375
I love you. I always have
loved you. I always will.

475
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,507
- You stopped loving me.
- No. Never.

476
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,243
If you were in love with me, you
never would have cheated on me.

477
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:14,121
Barry, please,

478
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,459
no more lies.

479
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,226
You were never
home. We never talked.

480
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,459
You were never there.

481
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,308
There was never another
woman. I was gambling.

482
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,871
A lot.

483
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,244
I did it because I was ashamed
of the man that I'd become.

484
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,058
When we got married, I
promised you the world,

485
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,948
and instead, I gave
you a mediocre life.

486
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,617
When I was up,

487
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,815
it made me feel like a winner.

488
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,720
And I was too embarrassed
to let you see me like that,

489
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,922
- so I hid it from you.
- Barry...

490
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,305
She's gonna do the surgery.

491
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,799
Thank you.

492
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,453
Andrews needs an
OR for Emma Newton.

493
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,580
Hmm.

494
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,267
Claire,

495
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,776
you're beautiful, smart,
and very good at your job.

496
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,206
Thank you, Shaun. That's
a very sweet thing to say.

497
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:49,221
Would you ever date
someone with a disability?

498
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,617
Yeah, sure.

499
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,759
You could choose
the ideal mate, Claire.

500
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,527
Why would you want
the unnecessary burden?

501
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,002
Everyone is dealing
with something.

502
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:10,699
We just have to love other
people for who they are,

503
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,143
hope they love us, too.

504
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,216
OR-1 is prepped for Hunter.

505
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:24,987
I'll join you in a minute.

506
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,876
So, what changed her mind?

507
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,841
Jared did.

508
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,877
Morgan, you're my first assist.

509
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,893
Make the call.

510
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,026
Thanks.

511
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,673
This is as far as you can go.

512
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,661
Nurse Matthews will take
you to the waiting room.

513
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,305
Okay. Can I...

514
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,079
Can I give him a kiss?

515
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:23,907
Of course.

516
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,522
I can't do this.

517
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,922
Yes, you can.

518
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,560
This is what you do
in a relationship, right?

519
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,796
You take chances together.

520
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,273
- Go.
- Okay.

521
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,925
That's a large tissue
defect in the left breast.

522
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,726
If we'd been in
here six hours ago,

523
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,838
I could have salvaged more
underlying muscle tissue.

524
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,936
I'm noticing a heart rate
jump. You seeing that, JL?

525
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,231
I am now. How's
her surgical sites?

526
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,684
Not seeing any bleeding.

527
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,903
Morgan, what about your side?

528
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,468
Everything looks good here.
Maybe the anesthesia's light?

529
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,448
No. No, something's
definitely happening.

530
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,977
Jared's right.

531
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,885
Suction, Claire.

532
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,059
Give me a 25 on a 130.

533
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,827
All right, Murphy, I want you
to cut right under my forceps.

534
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,387
Very carefully.

535
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,226
Section's cut.

536
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,214
How are the
motor-evoked potentials?

537
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,038
Signal's coming through. Spinal
cord is functioning normally.

538
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,012
The mass has fully
encased the medullary cord.

539
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,578
Give me the ferromagnetic wand.

540
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,592
I can't get the caudal end
clear of the underlying cord.

541
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,004
Had a big drop in potentials.

542
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,293
We're compressing his brainstem.

543
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,142
- What's his pressure?
- Mean arterial pressure's 70.

544
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,243
I got nothing now.

545
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,178
Push IV fluids, keep
that MAP above 90.

546
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,000
Hunter is going into
neurogenic shock.

547
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,181
We need to stop the surgery.

548
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,349
I'm almost there.
Twenty seconds.

549
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,604
Pressure's 60.
Push vasopressors.

550
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,672
The last piece is right there.

551
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,339
It's probably edema. Push
100 of dexamethasone.

552
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,206
Still nothing.

553
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,774
He's dying.

554
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,911
It's one damn
centimeter of tissue!

555
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,850
All clear!

556
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,184
That's her second dose of
amiodarone. She's not responding.

557
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,130
She's thrown a septic
embolism. I'm cracking her chest.

558
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,703
Ten joules. Clear!

559
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,634
Again.

560
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,040
Clear!

561
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,236
Starting cardiac massage.

562
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,464
It's time to call it.

563
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,665
Time of death, 10:23.

564
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,039
Welcome back, Hunter.

565
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,534
The mass was tightly
adhered in some spots,

566
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,841
so we're not exactly sure
what to expect moving forward,

567
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,108
but the cord looked healthy.

568
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,460
We're gonna be bringing in
several specialists to work with you.

569
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,861
The first will be a
neuropsychiatrist...

570
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,013
Thank you. Thank you.

571
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,687
Thank you. I'm
grateful to all of you.

572
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,498
Would you mind if we talked
about the rest of this later?

573
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,255
I just wanna sit with my wife.

574
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,562
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

575
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,663
Hey.

576
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,173
Hey. Hey.

577
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,309
I met a couple today
that lost their way.

578
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,071
They loved each other,

579
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,044
but by the time they remembered
what really mattered, it was too late.

580
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,986
I don't want us to be like them.

581
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,064
I wanna be fully
committed to you.

582
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,829
I love you, too.

583
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,839
There's a surgery I could have
that should make me fertile,

584
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,678
but there's a risk of impotency.

585
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,181
What do you wanna do?

586
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,354
I wanna give you what you
want, what we want, a family.

587
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,454
We are a family.

588
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,358
Yes, I want children.

589
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,863
And there are many ways to do
that, which we'll explore together.

590
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,368
But I draw the line at
anything that risks our sex life.

591
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,447
It's just one night a week,

592
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,111
but I think this could be
my big break, you know?

593
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,055
You always had
a beautiful voice.

594
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,053
Well, everyone's
got one thing, right?

595
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,494
But enough about me,
I wanna hear about you.

596
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,824
Do you have a man?

597
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,493
I did.

598
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,436
Pretty young thing, should
have plenty of choices.

599
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,235
I'm not looking to
complicate my life right now.

600
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,801
Hmm.

601
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,868
Still looking after
everyone else but yourself,

602
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,314
like you did for me.

603
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,957
You know, I brag to everyone,
"My baby, she's a surgeon."

604
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,253
Surgical resident.

605
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,657
Right, sorry.

606
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,593
You like it?

607
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,859
I love it.

608
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,538
Where are you staying?
Are you in town for a while?

609
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,107
Yeah. I'd like to
be closer to you.

610
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,679
I found a place.

611
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,114
You'd like it.

612
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:18,284
But I just need to
put up first and last.

613
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,093
I'll pay you back.

614
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,257
How much do you need?

615
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,796
$2,500?

616
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,404
Plus I have to get
furniture and all of that.

617
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,250
I thought maybe you could
help me pick that stuff out.

618
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,518
You've always
been so good at that.

619
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,119
I really appreciate
it. I'm good for it.

620
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,270
Okay.

621
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,401
Uh, Celeste isn't coming.

622
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,469
She broke up
with me. I hate her.

623
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:19,113
But I'm not gonna
let that ruin our night.

624
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,244
That's what friends are for.
They got each other's backs,

625
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,447
rain or shine.

626
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,855
By the by, I found a $20
in your battery drawer,

627
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,019
so I got us Chinese
food. Don't thank me.

628
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,354
I don't like Chinese food.

629
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,457
Aw, come on, now. Trust me,
everybody likes Ma Jong's kung pao.

630
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:41,362
Here you go.

631
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,871
I'm pretty torn up about that
Celeste thing. She was a real keeper.

632
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,878
You said you hated Celeste.

633
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,641
I do. I hate her 'cause... I
don't know. I kind of love her.

634
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,382
This tastes terrible.

635
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,011
Okay. Then he
hates Chinese food.

636
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,351
More for me. Plain white rice?

637
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,287
I got a gaming console, and I
hooked it up to your bad boy over there.

638
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,730
We could play
some <i>Mortal Kombat.</i>

639
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,731
Come on.

640
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,240
We doing this or what?

641
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:20,868
Sounds fun.

642
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,351
Yeah, here you
go. This one's you.

643
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,820
That's you, on
the left, right there.

644
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,291
- Okay.
- Yeah.

645
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,421
You got four arms to play with,
but you're naked, so here we go.

646
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,664
I gave you a pneumothorax.

647
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,653
I didn't realize how
bloody this game was.

648
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,101
A fireball. I got you there.

649
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,339
Have you played this before?

650
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,172
That looks like
a spinal fracture.

651
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,641
Yeah, I'd say there's
a huge fracture.

652
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,076
You died.
