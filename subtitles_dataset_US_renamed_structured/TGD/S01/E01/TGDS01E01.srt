1
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,944
Mister. Mister?

2
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,557
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

3
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,743
<i>welcome to San Jose
International Airport.</i>

4
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,535
Watch out!

5
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,114
- Adam!
- Adam!

6
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,207
Oh, my God!

7
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,516
Adam! Somebody call 911!

8
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,849
Oh, my God.

9
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,284
I'm a doctor. Let me take
a look. Let me take a look.

10
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,330
His jugular vein's been cut.
Does anyone have a clean cloth?

11
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,833
- Please, someone.
- I have a fresh change of clothes

12
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,096
- in my bag.
- That's great.

13
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,037
You're killing him.

14
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,115
I'm saving his life.
He was bleeding out.

15
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,808
You have it in the wrong place.

16
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,750
I think I remember
enough of Anatomy 101

17
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,311
to know where
the jugular vein is.

18
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,515
You would be in the right
place if he were an adult.

19
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,354
He's not an adult. He is a boy,

20
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,826
which means you're also
putting pressure on his trachea,

21
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,795
which means he's
not currently breathing.

22
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,499
You have to put the
pressure higher up.

23
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,662
There.

24
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,264
Oh.

25
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,852
There's some
glass. He'll be fine.

26
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,079
Who are you?

27
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,848
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

28
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,088
I'm a surgical resident at San
Jose Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

29
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:36,309
Autism, a mental condition
characterized by difficulty

30
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,143
in communicating and using
language and abstract concepts.

31
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,612
That's the definition.

32
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,215
Does it sound like I'm
describing a surgeon?

33
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,816
He's not Rain Man.

34
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,489
He's high-functioning. He's
capable of living on his own,

35
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,525
capable of managing
his own affairs.

36
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,285
"High-functioning"? Is that
our new hiring standard?

37
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,288
If it were, you
wouldn't be here.

38
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,129
I'm sorry. Is this really
necessary? Really?

39
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,135
A special meeting of the board of
directors, as much as I love you all,

40
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,766
questioning one of my hiring
decisions? Did you bother to look up

41
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,675
the definition of "president" while
you were skimming the dictionary?

42
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,511
You're hiring him to be a
surgical resident, my department,

43
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,049
over my objections.

44
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,783
Marcus, stop making
everything so personal.

45
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,115
I made it personal?

46
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,248
You've wanted his job since day
one. Everyone in this room knows that.

47
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,189
And, Aaron, yes,
this is your hospital,

48
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,524
but the money it takes to run it
comes from the foundation I control,

49
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,188
so let's all play
nice, shall we?

50
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,097
Stop acting like you're stunned
that you're standing there.

51
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,600
You tried to slip one past us.

52
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,470
I vetted him like I would
any other candidate.

53
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,596
And you genuinely thought

54
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,039
that his board wouldn't
reasonably have any doubts

55
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,941
about hiring a surgeon who's
been diagnosed with autism?

56
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,104
So justify your decision.

57
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,211
I met Shaun Murphy
when he was 14 years old.

58
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,357
I was living in Wyoming at
the time. He was, and he still is,

59
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,518
an extraordinary young man.

60
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,360
Yes, he has autism, but he
also has savant syndrome,

61
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,068
genius-level skills in several
areas. He has almost perfect recall.

62
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:13,232
He has spatial intelligence, and
he sees things and analyzes things

63
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,537
in ways that are
just remarkable,

64
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,807
in ways that we can't
even begin to understand.

65
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Those are assets.

66
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,711
Undeniable assets
for any doctor,

67
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,449
particularly a surgeon.

68
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,982
I mean, you've known
him since he was 14.

69
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,882
You care about him.
He's like a son to you.

70
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,156
Dr. Andrews, your wife is
gonna be very upset with you.

71
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,073
If you're trying to turn
this into a nepotism case,

72
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,896
we're gonna have to fire her
idiot nephew from bookkeeping.

73
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,699
Hey.

74
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,106
Sorry. You seen Claire?

75
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,404
Would you turn off the light?

76
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,672
Sure. You seen Claire?

77
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,714
Why? Would you
turn off the light?

78
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,271
Melendez wants
to operate on 104,

79
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,544
but Claire hasn't
gotten informed consent.

80
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,848
And she's ignoring her
page. You seen her?

81
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,012
No. Now go away,
and turn off the light.

82
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,112
Sure.

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,165
They need you to...

84
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,764
I heard.

85
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,761
She's such a bitch.

86
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,773
No. She just doesn't like you.

87
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,373
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

88
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,279
Um, maybe. To say for sure,

89
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,652
I'd need to know what
it is you're talking about.

90
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,781
Us.

91
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,985
Well, not silly at all.

92
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,924
Quite a bit of fun, actually.

93
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,363
I meant that we're
hiding it, our relationship.

94
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,656
Hmm.

95
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,965
Well, Jared,

96
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,968
we don't have a
relationship. We have sex.

97
00:07:55,575 --> 00:08:00,309
But, if you wanna tell people
that you're screwing me, go for it.

98
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,169
The veins in the boy's
left arm are popping.

99
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,302
Is that bad?

100
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,539
I don't see...

101
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,044
Intrathoracic pressure.

102
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,208
No. His chest is
rising. He's breathing.

103
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,946
No, the chest is
moving paradoxically.

104
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,420
The left lung is in distress.

105
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,922
Yes.

106
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:57,235
Who here has a sharp knife,
blade, five inches or longer?

107
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,630
Nobody?

108
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,572
You should start
artificial respiration.

109
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,576
He's going to stop
breathing very soon.

110
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,876
I feel fine.

111
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,145
Dr. Melendez would like
to do the surgery today.

112
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,613
You need bypass
surgery, quite urgently.

113
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,917
Would you please
sign the consent?

114
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,916
No.

115
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,117
You're scared.

116
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,653
I'm not scared.

117
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,494
Well, you should be. We're
gonna cut your chest open.

118
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,330
We're gonna stop your
heart, repair it, and restart it.

119
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,030
You're seriously telling me
that that doesn't scare you?

120
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,504
I just want a second opinion.

121
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,305
Callum, yesterday,
your life was perfect.

122
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,777
You were playing tennis.
You had a big anniversary.

123
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,408
Today, you're lying in a hospital
bed trying to figure out the best way

124
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,476
to say goodbye, maybe
forever, to your teenage children.

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,852
Why are you doing this?

126
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,155
Because I can't deal with lies.

127
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,088
If you lie to me, my
answers won't help you.

128
00:09:55,795 --> 00:10:00,028
But, if you're scared,
I can help you.

129
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,026
I'm scared.

130
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,129
Okay.

131
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,869
You can't be back here.

132
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,968
I need a knife.

133
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,981
Where do you keep the knives
people forget they're traveling with?

134
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,313
A knife? Sure. Anything else?

135
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,083
I do also need a
narrow six-foot tube

136
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,056
and high-proof alcohol and
gloves and baggage-handling tape,

137
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,457
but I'm gonna get the
alcohol from the duty-free store

138
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,495
and the tube from the
back of the soda machine.

139
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,806
I wish you all the luck with that,
but I'm not gonna give you a knife.

140
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,699
I need a knife. It's very...
There is a medical emergency.

141
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,668
There's a medical
emergency. That one.

142
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,171
That one right near the top looks
very sharp. Would you get it for me?

143
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,233
I'm not gonna give
you a knife. I'll ask...

144
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,708
There's not the time.

145
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,840
Weapon! Weapon!

146
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,544
Move! Get out of the way!

147
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,012
Drop it.

148
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,456
You idiot! You're lucky
we didn't just shoot.

149
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,052
No! He's trying to
save my son's life.

150
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,369
You get that consent on 104?

151
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,539
Well, I made him a deal.
He's got a meeting with Dr. Max

152
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,544
from Psychiatry at 6:00.
We'll get the consent by 8:00.

153
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,273
We can operate first
thing in the morning.

154
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,178
You did pass Anatomy,
right, Dr. Browne?

155
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,659
His problem's in his
heart, not his head.

156
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,847
He's not psychologically ready
for surgery. He will be soon.

157
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,012
He is physically
ready, so get consent.

158
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,283
We're prepping OR-6 now.

159
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,190
Do I need to cite you the 17
studies that show a correlation

160
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,592
between attitude and
outcome in surgical patients?

161
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,956
Do I need to remind you
that I am your superior?

162
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,768
You do know what the
opposite of superior is, right?

163
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,961
Subordinate. It doesn't...

164
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,598
Sure, subordinate,
or inferior. Either way.

165
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,407
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

166
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,611
I suppose not. But it does mean
you have to act like you're wrong.

167
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,409
He's panic-stricken. Yesterday,
he was young and healthy.

168
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,681
Today, he's mortal.

169
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,417
Just give him a chance to
wrap his head around that.

170
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,286
Dr. Kalu?

171
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,900
Do you think you can get me a
signed informed consent on 104?

172
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,728
Of course.

173
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:18,828
Thank you.

174
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,471
You think he's right?

175
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,443
I think he's my boss.

176
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:33,685
And if I have to choose between
my boss and the woman I'm screwing,

177
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,089
not much of a
choice. Am I right?

178
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,195
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

179
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,411
Incision should take
place two ribs down.

180
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,974
Okay, well, why the bottle?

181
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,138
The air will continue
to leak and accumulate

182
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,182
until the damage can
be properly repaired.

183
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,944
The tube allows
the air to get out.

184
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,782
The water in the bottle stops
the air from coming back in.

185
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,082
A home-made one-way valve.

186
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,414
He's breathing.

187
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,361
You saved his life.
He saved his life!

188
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,572
Shaun, where are you?

189
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,244
Call me as soon as you can,
please. That was a mistake.

190
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,311
I agree. This is not
about the new doctor.

191
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,865
This is about you.
They're baiting you,

192
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,653
- and you're letting them.
- Maybe.

193
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,818
Maybe what? What mistake
are you talking about?

194
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,419
- Your shot at Andrews' nephew.
- Come on, it was funny.

195
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,196
It was very funny. It
was also disrespectful.

196
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,105
You don't show him respect. I assume
it's because you don't respect him.

197
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,263
You show someone respect
because you respect them

198
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,815
or because you're afraid of
them. I don't fit into either category.

199
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,570
- Well, neither do I.
- You should.

200
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:14,474
You're only in that room because
your grandfather founded this hospital.

201
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,277
I'm gonna pretend that this
conversation didn't take this tangent

202
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,516
and instead focus on something
relevant, the debate you are losing.

203
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,221
Here's how you win this.
You don't make it personal.

204
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,332
You don't make it about
you. That is what they want,

205
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,853
and if you give it to
them, you will lose.

206
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,302
I need to get to San Jose
Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

207
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,866
That's where we're going.

208
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,963
Good.

209
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,777
How hard can it be to just
act like a normal human being?

210
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,195
He doesn't know how.

211
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,313
Bull! What are we
supposed to do now?

212
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,721
This is the third school
he's been thrown out of.

213
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,088
We'll find another school.

214
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,969
No, we won't, 'cause
nothing's gonna change.

215
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,928
They can't handle him,
and I don't blame them

216
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,896
'cause obviously we
can't handle him either.

217
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,533
What the hell happened
this time? What happened?

218
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,691
You're hurting him.

219
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,963
What did you do? Shaun!

220
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,300
No!

221
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,343
Will you stop petting
that stupid rabbit?

222
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,982
It changed. The
boy's ECG changed.

223
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,924
It's the same, 86 BPM.

224
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,228
No, it used to be higher.

225
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,862
No, it used to
be 86. It's still 86.

226
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,335
It used to come up to here.

227
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:50,200
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

228
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,676
What's going on?
What does it mean?

229
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,804
It means he's trying to
read 20-year-old equipment

230
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,406
while traveling in a vehicle
going 40 miles an hour.

231
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,949
How did you get him to sign?

232
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,681
I simply told him he was
either consenting or going home.

233
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,289
Then I gave him two forms
and told him to pick one.

234
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,937
And you highlighted the Release
Against Medical Advice form

235
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,931
that mentions the possibility of
death or permanent disability?

236
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,558
Well done. Hand me
the Metz and a pickup.

237
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,501
I'm isolating the
ascending aorta.

238
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,594
Vascular clamp.

239
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,306
Hey, what is that?
Under the left atrium.

240
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,972
Something white. Is
that part of the lung?

241
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:32,348
It's pus. Did he have TB?

242
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,695
No, he doesn't have any...

243
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,796
No, not currently.
Does he have a history...

244
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,064
When he was a younger,
he was exposed to...

245
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,900
This is an abscess.
It's going to...

246
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,152
Suction and a lap
sponge. His BP's crashing.

247
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,638
Two liters saline wide open.

248
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,982
Set up level one. Two
units packed cells now.

249
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,867
Let's get Levophed on board
and keep that MAP at 60.

250
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,529
Get in there with the suction.
I can't see a damn thing.

251
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,627
Suction.

252
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,782
I hope it isn't too
upsetting to him

253
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,208
when he hears he'd have died in
his room if we'd waited till tomorrow.

254
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,871
Dr. Melendez, we've got an
incoming eight-year-old male,

255
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,780
pneumothorax stabilized but
undetermined internal injuries.

256
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,077
Who do you want to catch?

257
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,061
Claire, I don't
think we need you.

258
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,748
This patient is
gonna be fine now.

259
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,256
Eight-year-old healthy boy.

260
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,304
Status, post encounter
with a shattered glass sign.

261
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,694
- Numerous lacerations.
- Echo.

262
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,925
Get him set up in Trauma 3
with an EKG, full blood work,

263
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,058
and a pan scan.

264
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,568
- We need an echo. Echocardiogram.
- Who is this guy?

265
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,264
He helped with
first-aid at the airport.

266
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,432
I'm a doctor. He needs
an echocardiogram.

267
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,599
Where are you taking him?

268
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,371
To surgery. All cardiac vital
signs are within normal range.

269
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,471
- Do you have any ID?
- No. His heart. It's his heart.

270
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,209
His heart is fine.
Now, stay here.

271
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,114
Adam needs an echocardiogram.

272
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,018
No. Behave yourself, or you'll
be removed from the building.

273
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,498
Echo... Echo...

274
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,014
What's that?

275
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,678
A one-way valve. EMT reports
the boy suffered a pneumothorax.

276
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,007
That is cool.

277
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,185
Do you think we should
do an echocardiogram?

278
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,694
Based on the presenting
symptoms, which give no indication

279
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,699
that an echocardiogram is
necessary, I'm going to answer no.

280
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:28,994
Am I missing something?

281
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,426
No, sir.

282
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,829
Knife.

283
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,180
We don't normally
treat rabbits, especially...

284
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,055
This was the closest doctor
place, and it was an emergency.

285
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,304
No, I can see that.
But even if I was a vet,

286
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,490
the rabbit is dead.

287
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,466
I'm sorry, guys.

288
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,807
Everything smells
different when it rains.

289
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,603
What do we do now?

290
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,746
Well, you should
bury him, I guess.

291
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,081
I don't know. Give
him a nice funeral.

292
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,782
Has he gone to heaven?

293
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,853
Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure, he has.

294
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,861
No, I don't want him to go to
heaven. I want him to be here.

295
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,262
This won't happen again.

296
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,805
It can't happen
again. He's dead.

297
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,931
I know that.

298
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,875
I mean, nothing like this is ever
going to happen to us ever again.

299
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,037
Because we're not going home.

300
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,147
We're never going home again.

301
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,508
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

302
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,525
A surgeon needs to communicate,

303
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,725
not just information
but sympathy, empathy.

304
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,794
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

305
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,635
He can't even reliably
show up for a job interview.

306
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,452
Are you going to
sit here and tell us

307
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,174
that there were no other
equally qualified young surgeons,

308
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,582
surgeons without
this one's issues?

309
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:05,214
No, which is why, exactly
why, we should hire Shaun.

310
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,954
We should hire him because he is
qualified and because he's different.

311
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,488
How long ago was it that we wouldn't
hire black doctors in this hospital?

312
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,934
How long ago was it that we
wouldn't hire female doctors

313
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,197
at this hospital?

314
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,473
So you're comparing being
African-American or a woman

315
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,000
with being autistic?
Please, go on.

316
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,675
Okay.

317
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,885
The rationalization
is exactly the same.

318
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,082
Words like "temperament,"
and, "Oh, no.

319
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
"Oh! How are the
patients going to react?"

320
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,120
Aren't we judged by
how we treat people?

321
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,095
I don't mean as doctors.
I mean as people.

322
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,495
Especially those who don't have
the same advantages that we have.

323
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,470
We hire Shaun, and we give
hope to those people with limitations

324
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,508
that those limitations are
not what they think they are.

325
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,543
That they do have a shot.

326
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:07,443
We hire Shaun, and we
make this hospital better for it.

327
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,921
We hire Shaun, and we
are better people for it.

328
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,557
We'd be better people

329
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,829
spending a lot more on
malpractice insurance.

330
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,977
How old is this kid again?

331
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,060
Eight.

332
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,997
Sponge stick.

333
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,744
What was his heart
rate five minutes ago?

334
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,239
Eighty-six.

335
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,373
You sure?

336
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,679
Certain. He's been a
rock. It's barely changed.

337
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,851
No, something's changed.
Something's different.

338
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,803
You asked earlier about an
echo? You had no medical reason,

339
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,090
but you asked anyway. Why?

340
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,125
There was this weird guy, the
one that did the one-way valve.

341
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,033
He kept insisting that the boy
needed an echocardiogram.

342
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,772
- He didn't say why?
- He was really weird.

343
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,908
His blood pressure's
dropping. That makes no sense.

344
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,502
He's not bleeding anymore.
Everything's under control.

345
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,605
Do an echo.

346
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,082
Sir, the boy's wide open.
It's gonna take a while.

347
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,245
Good. That'll give me time to figure
out why the hell we're doing an echo.

348
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,964
Dr. Browne, you're with
me. We're gonna go find

349
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,388
your weird guy. Keep him stable.

350
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,217
Why the echo?

351
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:30,894
Okay. The... The...
Okay. The... I...

352
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,101
Okay. I understand you think
he needs an echocardiogram.

353
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,301
We just don't know why.

354
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,080
Well, I noticed that there was
a slight reduction in the intensity

355
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,637
of the electrocardiogram.

356
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,843
The electrical flow?
I noticed that, too.

357
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,510
The heart rate was the same
but the amplitude dropped.

358
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,844
Pericardial effusion.

359
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,181
Reduced cardiac output.

360
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,518
Would stress other organs.

361
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,989
Causing them to shut down.

362
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,082
Yes.

363
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,896
Hold on. Yeah. We're
coming right back up.

364
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,027
Thank you.

365
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,095
They did the echo. It's
normal. No pericardial effusion.

366
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,766
No, it has to be. There
is no other explanation.

367
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,005
The echo is normal, which
means we just wasted our time.

368
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,536
No.

369
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,921
Okay. Hey. Come
with me. Come on.

370
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,299
Show them.

371
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,810
Again.

372
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:00,649
Again.

373
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,386
Again.

374
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,754
There.

375
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,895
Looks normal to me.

376
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,068
It's not normal. There's a concave
deformity in the right atrium.

377
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,069
No, there's not.

378
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,272
Yes, there is. It's very subtle.

379
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,866
Even if you are
right, that's not

380
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,809
where a pericardial
effusion manifests.

381
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:27,242
Not usually. But it could.

382
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,483
This kid was sprayed with
glass shards. Cut his jugular.

383
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,457
What if a piece of glass
entered his bloodstream?

384
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,860
It could have traveled
down the jugular vein

385
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,867
into the brachiocephalic vein
and onto the superior vena cava.

386
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,569
If it punctured the SVC, a block
could be leaking behind the heart,

387
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,573
restricting the heart's ability to
expand and fill during diastole,

388
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,165
reducing the heart's efficiency.

389
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,601
Lot of ifs there.

390
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,673
Dr. Chen,

391
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,884
prepare a 14-gauge
on the syringe.

392
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,921
All in favor of ratifying
Dr. Glassman's decision in hiring

393
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,327
Dr. Shaun Murphy?

394
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,166
All against?

395
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,164
Excuse me.

396
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,936
- Is this a medical emergency?
- No, no medical emergency.

397
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,221
Then you weren't
supposed to interrupt...

398
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,146
Yes, I know, but
you need to go online.

399
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,237
What? What site?

400
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,213
Pretty much any of them. Twitter,
YouTube, any local news site.

401
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,414
<i>You saved his life.</i>

402
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,191
The YouTube clip already
has over 200,000 views.

403
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,030
Apparently, he's
one of our doctors.

404
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,371
Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy.

405
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:58,608
The boy is in OR-2. Dr. Melendez
isn't sure if he's going to make it.

406
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,521
Your fiancé sure
can handle a knife.

407
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,357
Why did you warn me about
respecting Dr. Andrews?

408
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,893
What's going on?

409
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,228
I'm not gonna always
be here to protect you.

410
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,136
You think you're gonna lose?

411
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,304
Everybody loses eventually.

412
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,975
Is that your guy?

413
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,824
Can we get a TV?

414
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,157
No.

415
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,560
Why not?

416
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,940
Because we're poor,
dude. We live in a bus.

417
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,344
Do you think Mom
is looking for us?

418
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,172
No.

419
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,411
She loves us, but she
knows it's better this way.

420
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,128
I got you a present.

421
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,028
It's not my birthday.

422
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,037
I got you a present anyway.

423
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,115
Here.

424
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,728
Kelly.

425
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,750
Dr. Browne,

426
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,219
you were right.

427
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,503
I don't like pickles.

428
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,638
I know.

429
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,737
I don't want pickles.

430
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,043
And I checked.

431
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,778
You saved that boy's life.

432
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,645
Oh, good.

433
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,485
His name is Adam.
Traumatic pneumothorax.

434
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,484
I'm hungry.

435
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,791
The board reconvenes
in 45 minutes.

436
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,268
Can you stay here
until I get back?

437
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,572
Okay.

438
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,274
Okay.

439
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,722
He's got a serious deficit.

440
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,192
A child is alive today
because of that deficit.

441
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,354
And tomorrow, one may
be dead because of it.

442
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,364
I seem to remember
that when I hired you,

443
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,198
you weren't exactly making
the most adult decisions.

444
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,464
You haven't killed
anyone yet, have you?

445
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,873
Well, thankfully, there's a
cure for youth and stupidity,

446
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,338
time and experience.

447
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,174
There's a cure for
stupidity? Okay.

448
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:31,140
That would be a windfall.
All Shaun has is a diagnosis.

449
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,713
I'd like your help. I take
it I'm not gonna get it.

450
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,616
Okay.

451
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,350
Wait.

452
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,794
What's the story with this kid?
Why is it so important to you?

453
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,533
Why not?

454
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,061
Because letting
things get personal

455
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,130
is a sure formula for
screwing things up.

456
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,073
I don't know.

457
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,078
Letting things get
personal is how we...

458
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,642
How we make it matter.

459
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,187
So are you proud
or disappointed?

460
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,995
Do I have to pick just one?

461
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,329
Hey.

462
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,199
You're new to town, right?

463
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,901
Yes.

464
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,170
Well, I'm sure you
have a lot of questions.

465
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,271
No.

466
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,980
You've got to be curious about
the place, about the people.

467
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,683
Dr. Glassman gave
me a map of the hospital,

468
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,249
and I got a map
of San Jose online.

469
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,592
Okay.

470
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,357
Great.

471
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:00,970
I do have one question.

472
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,733
Yeah.

473
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,237
Why were you rude to
me when we first met,

474
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,213
then nicer to me the
second time we met,

475
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,273
and now you want
to be my friend?

476
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,812
Which time was it that
you were pretending?

477
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,783
Shaun, we're ready.

478
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,330
The vote was clear. Why
are we reopening this?

479
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,201
Is it really because
of a piece of publicity?

480
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,536
It's because the man
just saved somebody's life.

481
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,666
And thank God for that,

482
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,619
but it doesn't change a
single thing we discussed.

483
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,003
Give him six months.

484
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,342
If he proves anything
less than excellent...

485
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,680
Someone less than excellent
means someone else dies.

486
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,514
Well, I would love to
make you happy, Doctor.

487
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,819
I would love to hire someone
who never, ever makes a mistake.

488
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,483
Unfortunately, God
already has a job.

489
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,258
I can accept that
he will have insights

490
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,991
that none of the
rest of us will have.

491
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,841
Can you accept that
he will make mistakes

492
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,143
none of the rest
of us will make?

493
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,863
You won't be the one
who pays the price.

494
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,878
If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,

495
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,846
he will be immediately released,

496
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,718
and I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

497
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,186
We haven't heard
from Dr. Murphy yet.

498
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,953
Perhaps we should hear from
him before we decide his fate.

499
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,523
Shaun.

500
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:54,081
Dr. Murphy, I'd
like you to tell us

501
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,814
why you want to
become a surgeon.

502
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,333
Why do I want them
to be my friends?

503
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,928
Everybody needs friends, Shaun.

504
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,604
It's gonna be cool, okay?
Play hide-and-seek, maybe?

505
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,847
- Okay.
- Tag in the warehouse.

506
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,218
I told you, it's fun, right?

507
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,266
Hey. You know what?

508
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,997
The day that the rain
smelled like ice cream,

509
00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:01,638
my bunny went to
heaven in front of my eyes.

510
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,417
The day that the copper
pipes in the old building

511
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,749
smelled like burnt food,

512
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,882
my brother

513
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,990
went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

514
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,736
I couldn't save them. It's sad.

515
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,605
Neither one had the
chance to become an adult.

516
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,873
They should have become adults.

517
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,154
They should have had
children of their own

518
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,124
and loved those children.

519
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:55,931
And I want to make that
possible for other people.

520
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:10,707
And I want to make a lot of money
so that I can have a television.

521
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,723
Dr. Murphy,

522
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,894
I want to be the
first to welcome you

523
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,404
to San Jose Saint
Bonaventure Hospital.

524
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,475
We're very proud to have you.

525
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,587
Shaun,

526
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,124
Dr. Melendez's team
is going into surgery.

527
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,091
I mean, if you're interested.

528
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,714
Got a messy field here.

529
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,017
Murphy.

530
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:12,996
Suction.

531
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,513
Never forget,
you're the smart one.

532
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,377
You can do anything.

533
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,113
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

534
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,339
Thought you've
seen many of these.

535
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,387
I remember my first.

536
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,293
I kept thinking, "It doesn't
get any better than this."

537
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,702
But for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

538
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,804
You're a nice kid, and
you're obviously very smart,

539
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,946
but you don't belong here.

540
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,214
So, as long as you're
part of my team,

541
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,152
this is all you're ever
going to be doing, suction.

542
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,994
I saw a lot of surgeons
in medical school.

543
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,623
You're much better than them.

544
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,557
I have a lot to learn from you.

545
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,306
You're very arrogant.

546
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,407
Do you think that helps
you be a good surgeon?

547
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,943
Does it hurt you as a person?

548
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,587
Is it worth it?
