1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,847
Previously on The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,831
<i>You need to take a break, clear
your head. You need a vacation.</i>

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,639
I'm gonna quit my job.

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:15,081
I'm not looking forward to
moving to Hershey, Pennsylvania.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,544
I don't want kids, ever.

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,976
I've just been fired for physically
assaulting an employee.

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,525
Go ahead, chop us in half.

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,524
When will they wake up?

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,659
They should've already.

10
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,351
We were worried about you,
Jenny. So glad you're back.

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,219
I am gonna give you three
words. Try to remember them.

12
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,952
Apple. Ball. House.

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,558
Can you count back
from 100 by seven for me?

14
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,957
I'm going to Harvard, you know?

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,602
Ninety-three, 86, 79,

16
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,035
72, 65.

17
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,942
And what city are we in?

18
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,372
San Jose.

19
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,273
And what were those three words?

20
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,710
Apple. Ball. House.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,618
Look out, Harvard.

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,080
We'll be doing a lot more
tests to know for sure,

23
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,749
but your heart
does sound better.

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,723
How's Katie?

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,464
You woke up before
her, so, too soon to tell.

26
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,500
There's virtually no
alpha or beta brain activity.

27
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,437
We must have missed something
during the separation surgery.

28
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,235
- We didn't.
- Katie's BP was steady,

29
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,243
sats were fine, regional blood
supplies were reconstructed.

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,280
Just like Jenny. Yet, she's
awake, Katie's in a coma.

31
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,245
Katie's got the
new sagittal graft.

32
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,975
A problem with blood flow in
that vein could cause her condition.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,485
An MR angiogram should
tell us if the graft is open or not.

34
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,611
Hello.

35
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,289
I will proceed with
the angiogram.

36
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,319
Murphy, you've been gone for
two days. How about we start there?

37
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,121
Okay.

38
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,962
Just because you
talked to the president

39
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,661
doesn't qualify as permission.

40
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:20,271
Okay. Yes, I will
notify Dr. Melendez

41
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,102
next time I go on a road
trip with my girlfriend.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,669
Amazing.

43
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,802
"Road trip"?

44
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,147
Dr. Glassman said you were
dealing with a personal crisis.

45
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,146
That is true.

46
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,220
Do you know the definition
of "personal crisis"?

47
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,281
Yes. A stage in a
sequence of events

48
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,692
at which the trend of all
future events is determined.

49
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,730
- A death, an illness.
- Yes.

50
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,623
No, not a road trip.

51
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,058
Okay.

52
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,335
You and Dr. Browne get
going on Katie's angiogram.

53
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,171
Unless, of course, you have any
personal emergencies to attend to.

54
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,871
No, my crisis is over.

55
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,739
Come in.

56
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,508
Hey.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,549
How are the twins doing?

58
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,981
Jenny's in recovery.

59
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,149
Her numbers look
good, she's talking.

60
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,550
Katie not so good.

61
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,921
We need to talk about Murphy.

62
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,655
I told you he's
on personal leave.

63
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,394
Yeah, well, that's
not what he said.

64
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,827
You talked to him?

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,696
Yes. In the surgical
unit, five minutes ago.

66
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,775
There is the sagittal vein
graft we constructed for Katie.

67
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,208
It's open with good flow.

68
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,777
Graft is fine.

69
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,244
Which means we still have
no explanation for her coma.

70
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,514
Go in closer.

71
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:50,958
The middle cerebral vein, it
has low flow out of the brain.

72
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,875
You're thinking low flow
out means low flow in?

73
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,198
Yes, that is what I'm thinking.

74
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,870
We should look at the
arterial inflow phase.

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,774
We'd like to look at the
arterial inflow phase, please?

76
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,870
So, what'd you do on your trip?

77
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,314
Sometimes, when
we take a road trip,

78
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,621
we're running away
from something.

79
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,281
I kissed Lea.

80
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,421
And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.

81
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,058
What's he mad at you about?

82
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,126
It's almost entirely blocked,

83
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,630
and there's a malformation
in the circle of Willis.

84
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,337
Katie is barely getting
any blood to her brain.

85
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,412
Excuse me. Shaun, may
I speak with you, please?

86
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,473
Dr. Melendez, he was not angry.

87
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,609
Oh, no, Shaun,
Dr. Melendez is angry with you.

88
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,984
He's also angry with me.

89
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,512
Why?

90
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,286
Why? Because I
lied to him for you.

91
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,758
Why did you run away?

92
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,020
I didn't run away.

93
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,324
When you leave without
notifying your attending,

94
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,436
when you drop all of your
responsibilities at this hospital...

95
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,865
When you leave without
telling anyone, including me,

96
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,699
then you are running away.

97
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,971
Did this trip with
this girl help?

98
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,279
Yes. Yes, it did.

99
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,647
Okay, how?

100
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,121
I would like to give
two weeks' notice.

101
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,068
Mom, can you ask them to
bring me some more ice chips?

102
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,307
I'll get them, sweetie.

103
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,509
I'll get a doctor.

104
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,178
No. I'm just...

105
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,054
When you left, there
was no one here.

106
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,727
For the first time in
my life, I was alone.

107
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,689
Sweetie.

108
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,460
It felt cold.

109
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,202
Well, sometimes it is cold.

110
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,432
But you know what?

111
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,911
Someday, you might
find that you like it.

112
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,082
Wrongful termination.

113
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,982
Dr. Kalu assaulted
an attending surgeon.

114
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,421
I don't think you have
strong legal footing here.

115
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,550
There's more to the story.

116
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,166
And, I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu,
but his ends don't justify his means.

117
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,396
Obviously, we can't
tolerate staff members...

118
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,405
And yet you do. Please, read on.

119
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,575
The middle cerebral has narrowed,
it's less than two millimeters.

120
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,121
You bypass the artery
here, and restore blood flow.

121
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,989
Open her back up?

122
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,821
She's just been through
a massive operation,

123
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,787
the brain tissue hasn't settled.

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,920
Another could very
well stroke Katie out.

125
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,021
Other options?

126
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,128
Intravascular.

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,267
I don't see how an intravascular
ultrasound gives us a better picture.

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,495
Not imaging.

129
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,042
He wants to stent the middle cerebral
artery in the angio lab. I like it.

130
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,976
Stenting is usually reserved
for the heart and the carotid.

131
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,605
It's not the usual, but we
are way past the usual.

132
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,980
It would lower the
danger of a stroke.

133
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,451
Dr. Murphy, would
you like to assist?

134
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,546
Yes.

135
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,690
Dr. Melendez, would you like to
write me a letter of recommendation?

136
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,124
You see the narrowing
there, in the horizontal segment

137
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,483
- of the middle cerebral artery?
- Middle cerebral artery.

138
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,899
Yeah, I've heard about you.

139
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,639
You're the one making
the old guard nervous.

140
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,316
Why would I make people nervous?

141
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,378
Because you have a gift,

142
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,887
and surgeons judge
themselves against their peers.

143
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,514
And right now, you're winning.

144
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:47,985
We're in position.

145
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,025
Dr. Murphy, please
inflate the balloon.

146
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,093
And give us another
squirt of contrast.

147
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,399
And we should
have good blood flow.

148
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,509
Yes, the proximal end
of the artery is dissecting.

149
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,090
The balloon is
damaging her artery.

150
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,514
Waveform is worsening.

151
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,041
The stent won't hold. She's
gonna stroke. I'm aborting.

152
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,178
Okay.

153
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,626
Waveform is normalizing.

154
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,393
We're right back
where we started.

155
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,800
Katie's brain is starving.

156
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,397
I want to see Katie.

157
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,736
I know she's in a coma, I
still need to see her. I miss her.

158
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,545
We can't risk contamination
for either of you.

159
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,106
She needs to know I'm there.

160
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:48,052
- We understand.
- You can't understand, no one can.

161
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,781
We have always been
there for each other,

162
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,121
and now when she needs
me most, I'm not there.

163
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,923
You've just been
through a 40-hour surgery,

164
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,157
we need you to focus
on your own healing.

165
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,965
And what about her heart?

166
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,558
We're going to do a
cardiac catheterization test

167
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,433
to see if her heart
circulation has improved.

168
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,139
Inject the contrast to evaluate
the heart's blood supply.

169
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,968
How's my soul looking?

170
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,148
That's a different specialty.

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,015
Katie says the eyes are
the window to the soul.

172
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,113
I say the eyes
lie, it's the heart.

173
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,857
Well, then so far your
soul is looking good.

174
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,855
Strong unobstructed blood flow.

175
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,521
The ventriculogram will tell us
how the muscle function is doing.

176
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,372
So quiet. Is everything okay?

177
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,041
The ventricle's strained and dilated.
We're hoping for some improvement,

178
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,381
post-separation, but
it's barely pumping.

179
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,181
It just doesn't make any sense.

180
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:57,815
The separation was supposed to
relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.

181
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,556
Half the need, half the work.

182
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,957
Jenny's heart is even
sicker than it appeared.

183
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,672
It seems we couldn't see
that because Katie's heart

184
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,096
was doing all the
work for Jenny's.

185
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,358
What can we do to fix it?

186
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,959
Give her a new heart.

187
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,678
We're not gonna find
a donor match in time.

188
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,900
Yes, we already have
the perfect heart for Jenny.

189
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,534
The sisters are monozygotic,
and therefore, a genetic match.

190
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,037
On the other
hand, Katie's alive.

191
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,239
She is GCS 3.

192
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,427
Her heart is still beating.

193
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,007
Yes, but she is unresponsive,

194
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,881
and I don't see a way to
return blood flow to the brain.

195
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,888
In all likelihood,
Katie's not coming back.

196
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,982
Yes, Katie very well may die,
but we can't predict when that'll be.

197
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,085
It could be today, it could
be 20 years from now.

198
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,561
If Katie stays
on the ventilator.

199
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,856
That's not up to us.

200
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,024
I know.

201
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,158
But I also know that,
based on these scans,

202
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,874
Jenny might not make
it through the night.

203
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,503
We need to propose
this to the mother.

204
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,949
There's no chance
Katie will wake up?

205
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,083
We can't say with
100% certainty,

206
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,785
but from what we saw
on Katie's brain scan,

207
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,429
we have little reason for hope.

208
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,768
But what we can
say with certainty

209
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,564
is that without Katie's
heart, Jenny will die.

210
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,896
Can we wait?

211
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,640
Just a little? Maybe
you'll know more?

212
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,972
Maybe something will change?

213
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,540
If we don't do anything, Jenny's
heart will stop before the morning.

214
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,576
How do you...

215
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,157
Would it be painful?

216
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,754
No. We simply power
down Katie's ventilator.

217
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,067
Once off life support,
she will peacefully pass.

218
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,185
Do you want us to
explain this to Jenny?

219
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,686
I'm sure she'll
wanna be present.

220
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,811
No.

221
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,017
I put trust in them
from an early age,

222
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,453
thinking responsibility
would build strength.

223
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,424
I think it worked.

224
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,203
But this? No.

225
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,471
Jenny can't be part of this
in any way. It'd destroy her.

226
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,047
I'll tell her Katie died.

227
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:49,288
"Dr. Shaun Murphy exhibits
technical skills beyond his years."

228
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,386
You wrote that?

229
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,122
Yes, that's why I signed
my name at the bottom.

230
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,869
You think Shaun survives
at another hospital?

231
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,625
I didn't think
he'd survive here.

232
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,166
Without your endorsement,
Shaun isn't going anywhere.

233
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,636
I may have my issues with him,

234
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,309
but no matter how
stupid an idea this may be,

235
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,247
I'm not gonna stop him from
going after what he wants.

236
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,823
There's another
signature line next to mine.

237
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,237
It's where the president
of the hospital has to sign.

238
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,200
The chief oncologist,
this is before I came here

239
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,531
in December of '14.

240
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,369
Dr. Marshall shoved

241
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,436
a scrub nurse during a
post-op discussion of some sort.

242
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,667
Do you remember that?

243
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,105
- I do.
- Your response was to settle with

244
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,545
the nurse while Dr. Marshall
was let off with a warning.

245
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:46,517
There's another, almost identical
instance earlier in that year.

246
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,449
In both cases, the doctors
in question were white.

247
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,188
They were censured.
Dr. Kalu was fired.

248
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,256
You think this was
a racial matter?

249
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:02,097
Do you think I'm racist?
That I favor white people?

250
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,263
Then why the leniency
then, and not now?

251
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,042
They're stars that
happened to be white.

252
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,774
Doctors like Marshall

253
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,474
allow Saint
Bonaventure to compete

254
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,484
with other West
Coast institutions.

255
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:20,979
So, that's our defense?

256
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,122
We're not racist, we just allow
our doctors to assault people

257
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,055
as long as they bring
in enough donors?

258
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,289
They were reprimanded, and
there were no further incidents.

259
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,596
And how do you think all of
this is gonna play out in court?

260
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,260
Settle.

261
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:42,932
Okay.

262
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,270
Hi.

263
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,774
Floor?

264
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,975
Four.

265
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,125
Shaun asked Dr. Melendez
for a letter of recommendation.

266
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,283
Yeah.

267
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,488
All I have to do is
sign it, and off he goes.

268
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,593
I think

269
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,766
he might think that
you're mad at him.

270
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,550
If you don't sign, it
reinforces what he thinks.

271
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,886
But, if you do, it lets him
know that you believe in him.

272
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,236
Can I touch her?

273
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:46,829
Of course.

274
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,478
Goodbye, baby.

275
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,755
Are you ready?

276
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,223
Yes.

277
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,693
She's stabilizing.

278
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,639
I don't understand.
What's going on?

279
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,546
Katie's not ready to go.

280
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,480
She's breathing on her own,

281
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,380
which means Katie has normal
brainstem function, correct?

282
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,085
When a ventilator is
removed, life can continue.

283
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,399
It's rare, but it could happen.

284
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,626
It doesn't change the
prognosis for awakening.

285
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:20,496
Off the ventilator with normal vitals
suggests long-term vegetative state,

286
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,432
- right?
- Yeah.

287
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,405
We just lost our
remedy for Jenny's heart.

288
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,001
What about ECMO?

289
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,474
Use the machine as a
replacement for Jenny's heart.

290
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,171
Buys us two weeks of life?

291
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,405
I don't like it.

292
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,781
ECMO requires blood-thinners.

293
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,078
She just had brain surgery, it
could cause a catastrophic bleed.

294
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,845
ECMO and its complications
may be our only avenue.

295
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,348
Re-conjoin them.

296
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,686
You want... You wanna put
their heads back together?

297
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,454
Not the heads, the thighs.
The femoral vessels.

298
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,158
Is it a funny idea?

299
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,028
I think it's funny
that I didn't think of it.

300
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,466
The girls' blood is identical. No
need for anti-clotting meds, so,

301
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,172
no possibility of a bleed.

302
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,088
As long as they're attached,
Katie's heart will beat for Jenny.

303
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,843
When Katie dies, we
sever the femoral connection

304
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,717
and transplant Katie's
heart into Jenny.

305
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,986
We just spent 40
hours separating them,

306
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,083
and now we wanna
put them back together.

307
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,388
- You tried to kill Katie?
- No.

308
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:29,063
You took her off life-support.
What do you call that?

309
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,866
Mercy. Not just for her.

310
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,867
You need a heart
or you're going to die.

311
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,306
Katie's alive.

312
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,344
She was then and
she's even more now.

313
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,820
Katie's alive in the sense that
she has basic organ function.

314
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,483
But she has no higher
cognitive brain activity.

315
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,650
She's surviving...

316
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,585
But she is not living.

317
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,721
Hours ago,

318
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,867
you thought she'd die as
soon as you pulled the plug.

319
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,000
You were wrong.

320
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,377
How do I know you're
not wrong this time, too?

321
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,040
The demand on Katie's heart
is minimal in her resting state.

322
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,054
She can easily
tolerate helping you.

323
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:30,229
I won't ask Katie to be
my life-support machine.

324
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,945
Dr. Andrews.

325
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,952
Let's put the sisters in
the same room overnight.

326
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:07,329
I don't think that Jenny sees
herself as an individual yet.

327
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,812
You know, I'm thinking the only
thing that'll change Jenny's mind

328
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,771
about the
re-attachment is Katie.

329
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,569
Being close might help
Jenny to see her as lifeless.

330
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,472
It could backfire,

331
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,480
and cement her feelings
that she's killing her sister.

332
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,843
Yeah, possibly.

333
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,419
And then, we're in the
same position anyways.

334
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,115
- Okay, do it.
- Okay.

335
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,487
Well, what about baseballs?

336
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,327
That this girl caught
at a Giants' game.

337
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,991
Signed by Mr. Hunter Pence.

338
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,093
He didn't hit it, but
that doesn't matter.

339
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,263
So, where is the
sporting-goods one?

340
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,464
There.

341
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,640
Oh, no. That does not
go in sporting goods.

342
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:54,970
It doesn't?

343
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,345
I'm applying to move my
residency to Hershey, Pennsylvania.

344
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,346
Really?

345
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,948
Yes. Penn State Medical Center.

346
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,327
Are you following me?

347
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,803
I need to make sure you're not
just doing this to stay close to me.

348
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:21,997
No.

349
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,800
Shaun?

350
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,670
I want my own life.

351
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,505
I want a life that I
control, not Dr. Glassman.

352
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,380
Dr. Glassman is
just trying to help you.

353
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,507
I don't want help.

354
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,013
But what if you need help?

355
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,726
How will I know if I stay?

356
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,160
Too much stuff. You
have too much stuff.

357
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,238
We should book a trip.

358
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,281
Maybe somewhere warm.

359
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,886
Wow, you are so slow.

360
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,337
You're only folding
underwear. Underwear is easy.

361
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,556
Mmm-mmm.

362
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,620
Okay.

363
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,532
No. You know
what? I don't want to.

364
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,129
Fine.

365
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,375
- Let's go, Preston.
- I'm ready.

366
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,234
Go.

367
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,083
Boom. Oh.

368
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,631
You're the only good
thing about my day.

369
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,116
I couldn't sleep last night.

370
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:58,057
I couldn't even
close my eyes until

371
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,567
I could feel Katie's
heartbeat in my hand.

372
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,336
If I do this, at some point,

373
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,018
Katie's heart will
beat for me, right?

374
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,314
That's the plan.

375
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,832
Then wherever I go, she
will always be with me.

376
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,079
Okay, I'll do it.

377
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,883
How you doing, Jenny?

378
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,219
I can't feel anything.

379
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,520
That would be the
magic of local anesthetic.

380
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,936
The vessels are
clamped. Okay, Doctor.

381
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,265
We're ready to proceed
with the anastomotic grafts.

382
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:43,163
It's done, isn't it? I can tell.

383
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,190
Let's put both the girls' vitals
next to each other, please.

384
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,405
Come on now.

385
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,650
Give it a few cardiac
cycles to adjust...

386
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,520
How'd we do?

387
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,257
You did great.

388
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,499
Why Hershey?

389
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,739
Lea is moving there.

390
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,708
Ah.

391
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,156
Well, they make good candy bars.

392
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,419
I don't like candy bars.

393
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,258
I love pancakes.

394
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,342
Well, they make those, too.

395
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,872
I brought you here because

396
00:27:55,674 --> 00:28:00,510
I thought this place would provide
a challenge for your abilities.

397
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,012
But I realized I really brought you
here because I thought you needed me.

398
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,793
This is a now-signed
letter of recommendation.

399
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,435
But, I don't want you to go.

400
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,310
If you stay, I'll back off.

401
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,643
I'll let you make your own
choices, your own mistakes.

402
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,930
I believe in you, Shaun.

403
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,180
Their blood pressure dropped.

404
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,585
Five millimeters of mercury.

405
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,025
I like when you say "their".

406
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,173
You're gonna see
some fluctuation.

407
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,429
BP drops five millimeters every
complete cardiac circulation.

408
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,935
Shouldn't the fluctuation
be inconsistent?

409
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,438
Maybe Katie's heart isn't picking up
the workload for Jenny as expected.

410
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,331
Jenny.

411
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,672
Jenny.

412
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,484
I'm right here, Katie.

413
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,683
Right next to you.

414
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,468
Take Murphy and get a
shotgun work-up on Katie.

415
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,994
I want everything. EKG, EEG
and labs. And an echo on Jenny.

416
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,233
Now.

417
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,696
Katie has an awake alpha rhythm on
her EEG. She's doing remarkably well.

418
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,073
We're still not entirely sure what
caused Katie to regain consciousness.

419
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,834
Attaching them again could
have redistributed fluid into

420
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,569
Jenny's system, possibly
decreasing the swelling in Katie's brain.

421
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,200
We just don't know.

422
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:47,902
I know.

423
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,116
They need each other.
They always have.

424
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,017
The issue right now
has become Jenny

425
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,251
and her heart. When
Katie was in a coma,

426
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,102
the metabolic demand
on her heart was very low.

427
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,566
But now that she's
alert and active,

428
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,394
there just isn't enough
heart for both of 'em.

429
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,790
What does that mean?

430
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,765
We're awaiting test results.

431
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,466
We're not sure how
long Katie's heart

432
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,203
can tolerate the strain of
supporting Jenny's circulation.

433
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,400
We'll closely monitor them
with cardiac labs and echoes.

434
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,170
We need to find a donor heart
for Jenny as soon as possible.

435
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,045
No.

436
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:32,955
"No"? I've had CEOs settle
for half of what I just got for you.

437
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,658
I don't care about the money.

438
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,320
That's beautiful.
It's admirable, even.

439
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,240
But you see, this
is how it works

440
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,784
because we live in
a civilized society.

441
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,398
They hurt you, we hurt them by
making them cut you a massive check.

442
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,304
I don't want them to hurt, I want
them to give me my job back.

443
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:52,968
A third of your job back is, by
my calculation, almost nothing.

444
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,041
I'll pay you a third
of this settlement.

445
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,530
What are you talking about?

446
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,912
You'll be paying me more
than you earn in a year.

447
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,612
I want my job back.

448
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,151
Lunch is on you.

449
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:12,987
Lunch is on me.

450
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,793
<i>Dr. Parker, please
report to Gynecology.</i>

451
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,164
Are you moving to
Pennsylvania to be with Lea?

452
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,603
Does she know that?

453
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,874
Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.

454
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,214
Yeah, but does she know you're
going there because she is going there?

455
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,342
I'm not.

456
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,621
Lea makes me happy.

457
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,898
Well, Lea's not the
only one that can do that.

458
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,829
I'm gonna miss you.

459
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,136
Your BNP.

460
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,979
Jenny Kunkler's cardio
protein levels are...

461
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,814
I've never seen
anything like it.

462
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:11,388
That's because the levels
are for two hearts, not one.

463
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,322
Now Jenny is killing Katie.

464
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,752
What's going on?

465
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,974
We've gotta separate them now,
or we're gonna lose them both.

466
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,718
- We got the twins on the way?
- In transit.

467
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,934
JL's gonna do
a local on the fly.

468
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,408
On my count. Three, two, one.

469
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,275
We can't do this. You'll die.

470
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,109
We're gonna do it.

471
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:46,391
No. We're in this together,
the way we've always been.

472
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,259
The way we were meant to be.

473
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,234
It's Jenny. She's in V-fib.

474
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,629
Push a milligram
epinephrine, now.

475
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,727
Prep an epi bag.

476
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,865
Murphy, start
chest compressions.

477
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,804
It's Jenny.

478
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,239
Her heart had
nothing left to give.

479
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:48,977
Katie?

480
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,413
She's stable.

481
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,684
Her vitals are good.

482
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,790
But we have an issue
that we need your help with.

483
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,318
Okay.

484
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,463
Um, Katie won't allow us
to separate her from Jenny.

485
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,759
If she doesn't acquiesce,
Katie will clot and die.

486
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,805
Heparin, 10,000 units on board.

487
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,818
We'll clear out and
give you some privacy.

488
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,122
Baby.

489
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,563
We have to let her go.

490
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,302
I won't let them separate us.

491
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,008
I never wanted to do this.

492
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,048
You used to say we were
made this way for a reason.

493
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,687
I won't let them do
this. Even if it kills me.

494
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,054
I want you to
look at your sister.

495
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,089
Look at her.

496
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,943
I can't lose both
of my daughters.

497
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,895
Dr. Andrews.

498
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,103
Evening. I checked
out the twins' file.

499
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,609
It's an amazing case.

500
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,643
To be clear, Jared, I
don't want you here.

501
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,046
What we presented to
Ms. Preston was the truth.

502
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,783
I understand that.

503
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,719
And those problem doctors
and the ways we police ourselves

504
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,867
will be dealt with, should have
been dealt with a long time ago,

505
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,052
but you stepped over a line.

506
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,221
- I fought for my job.
- You compromised your integrity.

507
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,710
The incident with that jerk Coyle
had nothing to do with black or white,

508
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,965
but that's what you and
your lawyer sold for leverage.

509
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,267
And when you misrepresent
racism for something it's not...

510
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,268
It sets us two steps back.

511
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,475
She's ready.

512
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,253
Jared, you're on suction.

513
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,493
Mayos.

514
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,036
I'm cold.

515
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:28,166
Gone fishing.
The store's closed.

516
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,799
I spoke to Claire.

517
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,735
Hey.

518
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,871
I wanna break up.

519
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,776
Why?

520
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,924
Because I love you.

521
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,566
That's a hell of a reason
to break up with somebody.

522
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,027
I want you to have
everything in your life.

523
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,227
Which includes kids.

524
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,736
I told you I was
willing to not have kids.

525
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,866
You're gonna regret
that decision one day.

526
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,637
- I won't.
- Yes, you will.

527
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,440
You're just too decent
to think it, but you will.

528
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,540
So what?

529
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,980
We all have regrets. I wanted
to play third base for the Astros.

530
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,052
It's not the same.
That is a child's dream.

531
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,990
This is your life.
This is my life.

532
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,652
And it'd be more devastating
to be resented by you

533
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,661
than to have my heart broken.

534
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:08,304
And you are going
to be a great dad.

535
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:23,778
Shaun.

536
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,488
I wanted to give you something.

537
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,930
I'm letting you borrow it.
Bring it when you come visit.

538
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,026
Okay.

539
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,833
Promise. You're
gonna come visit, right?

540
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,275
I promise. I like Hershey.

541
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,672
You've never been to Hershey.

542
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,803
Lea's there.

543
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,812
Can I put my arms around you?

544
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,361
Are you a good doctor?

545
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,206
'Cause when I think
of you, I think you are.

546
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,370
Remember, I said "borrow".
