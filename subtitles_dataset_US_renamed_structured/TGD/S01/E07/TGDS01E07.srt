1
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,561
Come on. Is the system down?

2
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:28,821
Worked fine for me.

3
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,631
I don't have time for this.

4
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,127
- How you doing?
- The computer's not working.

5
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,961
That's not what
I'm talking about.

6
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,460
I know. I'm fine.

7
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,165
A patient died because
of something you did.

8
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,574
I think it's safe to say the
one thing you are not is fine.

9
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,140
I'm dealing.

10
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,972
How exactly are you dealing?

11
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,682
I'm getting back to work.

12
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:54,953
I have a diabetic toe to debride,
and I'm putting it behind me.

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,281
How do you do that?
Put it behind you?

14
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,985
By moving forward.

15
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,522
- I appreciate the concern.
- You're welcome.

16
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,531
I'm gonna make an appointment
for you for grief counseling.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,603
Dr. Mohan. She's an expert
in dealing with hospital staff

18
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,800
who've experienced
stressful events.

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,040
That's not necessary.

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,211
You agree you've
had a stressful event?

21
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,515
And while I am comforted by
your commitment to move forward

22
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,982
by not looking back,

23
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,453
I still want you
to see Dr. Mohan.

24
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,823
If she says that you are fine,

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,223
then and only then can
you go back to surgery.

26
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,359
It's working now. You
just have to be patient.

27
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,899
Heart rate, 36.

28
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,549
Push another five milligrams of
morphine and prep a nitro drip.

29
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,132
We need atropine on board, stat.

30
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,709
- What do you got for me?
- An MI with severe bradycardia.

31
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,370
He's had aspirin, nitro,

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,812
and now we're trying to give
him a real rate with atropine.

33
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,893
- Cardiology see him?
- He's got a broken pacemaker...

34
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,318
And probably needs his
coronary arteries cleared.

35
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,514
Feels like a triple bypass,
but you're the expert.

36
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,581
His BNP is sky-high.

37
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,753
What do you see?

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,388
His ventricles are
barely pumping.

39
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,529
He's had two massive prior MIs.

40
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,861
End-stage heart failure.

41
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,273
His heart is way beyond repair.

42
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,760
- What are our options?
- He's 73 years old.

43
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,771
His age is an absolute
contraindication for transplant.

44
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,438
- He's dying.
- Well, he's not dead yet. What else?

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,045
How about cardiac
resynchronization?

46
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,824
That will get what's left of
both ventricles working together.

47
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,077
A biventricular pacer?

48
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,936
Should make him feel a little
better in the few months he's got left.

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,752
His rate drops any
lower, he'll arrest.

50
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,401
Claire, prep his jugular to
float in a temporary pacemaker.

51
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,670
Shaun, call up to the cath lab,
and have them get an estimate

52
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,129
on how long it'll take to
get the bi-pacer in house.

53
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,294
Something wrong?

54
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,267
Um, not at all. Just a little bit
too much coffee this morning.

55
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,637
Okay, let's go. Do it now.

56
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,281
Restraints, please.

57
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,319
I don't wanna get
stuck with a needle.

58
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,287
You're scaring him.

59
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,266
You're scaring him.

60
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,552
Haldol five milligrams.
- Thank you.

61
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,072
You're scaring him.

62
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,571
- Who are you?
- Dr. Shaun Murphy.

63
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,256
This patient is
psychotic, Dr. Murphy.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,771
He's not psychotic.

65
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,816
You don't like
people touching you.

66
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,591
He's not psychotic,
he's autistic.

67
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,144
You're being an
excellent patient.

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,178
Okay. We're finished.

69
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:13,511
You're same as me.

70
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,879
Can we release his hands?

71
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,321
Dr. Murphy, his hands?

72
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,221
Now I'm here, son.
Mom and Dad are here.

73
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,860
You can let go of his
hands, he won't hurt you.

74
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,174
Wrong stop. Wrong stop.

75
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,841
Can someone tell
me what happened?

76
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,336
Liam has a 5.4 centimeter
laceration on his forehead,

77
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,880
probably from a fall.

78
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,345
The wound was infiltrated

79
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,817
with five milliliters
of 1% Lidocaine.

80
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,581
Seven...

81
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,190
Seven single-interrupted
5-0 Prolene sutures.

82
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,918
He will have a small scar,

83
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,019
but no other long-term
effects from this injury.

84
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,558
You're my son's doctor?

85
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,562
I am. Dr. Shaun Murphy.

86
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,033
- Shaun with a "U."
- Got lost.

87
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,336
- Got lost. Got lost. Got lost...
- Yes, yes, yes.

88
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,033
- But you're okay.
- Got lost...

89
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,334
You won't be taking
that bus again.

90
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,775
This light is too bright.

91
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,938
These rooms make him
anxious. Can we take him home?

92
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,174
No.

93
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,377
Your son is jaundiced,

94
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,970
clenching his right abdominal
muscles when touched, and febrile.

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,249
He should not go home.

96
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,556
Why am I here?

97
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,726
Your pacemaker malfunctioned.

98
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,563
You had a heart attack.

99
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,231
I think I get that part.

100
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,410
Your neighbor's gardener saw
you on the ground inside your house.

101
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,108
Called 911, saved your life.

102
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,448
Well, I must
remember to thank him.

103
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,789
How old are you?

104
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,716
Me?

105
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,453
I know how old I am.

106
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,387
I'm 28.

107
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,559
We have a biventricular
pacer on its way,

108
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,273
and it's gonna make
you feel a lot better.

109
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,159
Is it?

110
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,007
I will be back to
prep you for surgery.

111
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,936
Liam has elevated
bilirubin and liver enzymes,

112
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,742
a white cell count of 23.

113
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,141
Abdominal ultrasound shows
dilatation of the bile ducts.

114
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,587
Sounds like
ascending cholangitis.

115
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,748
It can lead to sepsis

116
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,815
if the bacteria gain
access to his blood.

117
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,256
- Is he stable now?
- Yes, his vital signs are stable.

118
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,029
The cause could be anything
from cancer to diet, so...

119
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,033
Liam's parents have him
on a special ketogenic diet.

120
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,626
High-fat diets can cause
obstructive gallstones,

121
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,303
which could have
set the whole thing off.

122
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,972
Do an ERCP to clear them.

123
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,438
After that, a few weeks of
broad-spectrum antibiotics

124
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,636
should take care of things.

125
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,565
I want your help.

126
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,565
With what?

127
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,398
Endoscopic Retrograde
Cholangiopancreatography.

128
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,540
ERCP? Why?

129
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,036
You've done those before, Shaun.

130
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,875
You're good with
people who have autism.

131
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,648
Okay, Glen, let's
get this started.

132
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,993
Glen, you almost finished?

133
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,027
It's Dr. Kalu.

134
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,161
Glen?

135
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,772
Yeah, we have a code green.

136
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,249
Patient is a Caucasian
male, 185 pounds.

137
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,563
Shaun, can you talk
to him or something?

138
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,098
I can't push the midazolam.

139
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,701
Four lights. Four doors.

140
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,263
Yes. Lots of things.

141
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,202
Thirty-two, eight.

142
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,305
Thirty-two, eight.

143
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,048
Thirty-two is the number
of cabinet windows.

144
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,981
And eight is the
number of handles.

145
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,154
His end-tidal CO2 is rising.

146
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,781
He needs oxygen, he
has respiratory depression.

147
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,621
It's a common
reaction to midazolam.

148
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,299
CO2 is coming down.

149
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,064
You can proceed, Claire.

150
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,260
Thank you.

151
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,146
Have you been around a
lot of other autistic people?

152
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,012
I've never met
someone with autism.

153
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,308
Ah!

154
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,819
So it must be nice to spend
some time around Liam, then?

155
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,589
Why? Why would that be nice?

156
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,353
Okay.

157
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,288
There are no stones.

158
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,592
Where are the stones?

159
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,298
There is scarring.

160
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,999
This has nothing to
do with gallstones.

161
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,501
The entire biliary tree
is so thick with scarring,

162
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,440
we can't even get
the camera through.

163
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,719
The differential diagnosis for
biliary tree scarring includes

164
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,551
primary sclerosing cholangitis,

165
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:50,715
liver failure,

166
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,850
secondary to primary
biliary cirrhosis.

167
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,621
Yeah, Shaun, we can add a
few cancers to that list as well.

168
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,957
It's a long and ugly one.

169
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,792
Find another way to
figure out what it is.

170
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,958
We could do an MRI.

171
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,229
No, we couldn't.

172
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,567
It's not possible.

173
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,049
That's the first time I've
ever heard you say that.

174
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,666
- Liam is stimming.
- Stimming?

175
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,802
The tics and spasms are a
neurological response to stress.

176
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,079
If he's doing an
MRI, there is stress,

177
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,724
if there is stress,
he won't keep still,

178
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,293
if he won't keep still,
we can't do an MRI.

179
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,717
Therefore it is impossible.

180
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,030
Maybe if you just keep talking
to him like that, he'll doze off

181
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,215
and it'll all be simple.

182
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,518
Give him a mild sedative.

183
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,517
He didn't respond well to midazolam
during ERCP. Depresses his breathing.

184
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,492
His respiratory saturation can't
be properly monitored inside...

185
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,829
I get it. He could die in the
MRI and we wouldn't know.

186
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,312
You're just gonna have to
find a different way to calm him.

187
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,531
Okay, we'll do it.

188
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,431
Guess he has an idea.

189
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,709
<i>We have a code green.</i>

190
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,610
<i>Patient is a Caucasian
male, 73 years of age.</i>

191
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,580
Shaun, what are you doing?

192
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,441
Counting.

193
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,850
- Counting what?
- Distance.

194
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,712
Why?

195
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,185
I want $1,643.

196
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,193
You can get that by counting?

197
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,364
That's why you're alone
and pacing in this room?

198
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,461
- What do you want the money for?
- I want to buy a television.

199
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,128
- $1,600 for a television?
- And 43.

200
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,964
I'm a surgeon, I get paychecks.

201
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,406
You're not a surgeon yet,
you're a surgical resident.

202
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,945
There's a big difference
in the paycheck there, pal.

203
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,946
I am not a child, "pal."

204
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,046
How about $1,000
for a television?

205
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,986
No. The one I want
is $1,643, okay?

206
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,386
- Well, I know, but you have a budget.
- A budget?

207
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,652
You have rent,
food, bills to pay.

208
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,057
I should do my own
budget. I have an MRI to do.

209
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,831
These are live feeds.
Entrances, ER, receiving dock.

210
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,752
If your patient had
left, we would've seen it.

211
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:50,903
Then where'd he go?

212
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,001
A freight elevator.

213
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,591
But we don't have
cams in the freights

214
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,773
and he doesn't pop back up.

215
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,080
So we're dealing with
an alien abduction here?

216
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,081
Sorry.

217
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,987
We don't have cams
on the freight elevators

218
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,956
on levels one, four and
five, and the basement.

219
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,770
And you've got people
looking on those floors?

220
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,994
We've covered four and five,
and we're moving on to one.

221
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,214
Hey.

222
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,617
What's in the basement?

223
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,720
Pediatric patient
lost a blanket,

224
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,330
just gonna check lost and found.

225
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,460
That's nice of you.

226
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,703
While you're there,
you might wanna

227
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,906
check if they found
your code green.

228
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,047
<i>Hello, this is Doctor...</i>

229
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,715
<i>This is Shaun.</i>

230
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,655
I can hear you when you speak.

231
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,921
<i>I was thinking about something.</i>

232
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,926
<i>There are 24 steps from
the ambulance to the ER.</i>

233
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,566
Please turn down the lights.

234
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,405
That helps calm him.

235
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,771
<i>There are 24 steps from
the ambulance to the ER.</i>

236
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,211
There are 22 steps

237
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,917
<i>from the ambulance to the ER.</i>

238
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,354
He has very long strides.

239
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,215
Yes.

240
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,221
There are 22 steps from
the ambulance to the ER.

241
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,601
There are 37 steps

242
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,867
from the elevator to Room 405.

243
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,737
There are 37 steps

244
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,945
from the elevator to Room 405.

245
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,980
In Room 405,

246
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,151
<i>there are six steps to the sink.</i>

247
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,050
Six steps to the sink.

248
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,349
We're getting good images.

249
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:23,059
It's amazing how accomplished
you are for someone with ASD.

250
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,292
Three steps to the window.

251
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,958
Three steps to...

252
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:29,895
<i>Three...</i>

253
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,839
<i>It's seven steps.</i>

254
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,000
<i>It's seven steps to the door.</i>

255
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,170
Liam, there are seven
steps to the door.

256
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,092
- You need to get him out.
- Just a little more time.

257
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,676
- He's scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

258
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,844
We need to finish this.

259
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,818
- Seven...
- You're doing wonderfully, honey.

260
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,512
<i>Just breathe.</i>

261
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,757
<i>Just breathe.</i>

262
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,817
No, it's seven
steps to the door.

263
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:20,946
Glen.

264
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,622
Glen?

265
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,691
Glen.

266
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,900
Glen?

267
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,836
It's Dr. Kalu.

268
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,539
Let's get you upstairs.

269
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,736
Go away.

270
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,714
We've got to get
your new pacer in.

271
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,912
Don't you get it?

272
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,245
I broke my pacer on purpose.

273
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,590
I want to die.

274
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,882
With the new pacemaker,
you'll feel better.

275
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,870
So, I'll be cured?

276
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,599
Good as new?

277
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,020
Well, it'll reduce your
pain and then hopefully...

278
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,964
You think this is the
first time I've heard that?

279
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,779
It's always the next best thing.

280
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,049
The truth is,

281
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,115
I'll just keep getting
worse. I know it, you know it.

282
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,277
Do you have any
family you can talk to?

283
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,452
Brother's dead,

284
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,194
and I don't have a wife,

285
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,529
so no, there's no-one around to
nag me into doing what you want.

286
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,595
We have great
counseling services here.

287
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,471
I'm in pain, Twenty-Eight.

288
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,935
All the time.

289
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,435
Talk therapy gonna
talk that away?

290
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,738
Let's get you upstairs.

291
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,555
Your color's not good, and
your lungs are crackling,

292
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,957
which means there's
fluid building in...

293
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,142
I know my...

294
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,773
I know my rights.

295
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,277
I don't have to get
treatment if I don't want it.

296
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,746
The minute I catch my breath,
I'm gonna walk out of here,

297
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,957
so you can just leave.

298
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,731
I'm not leaving.

299
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,945
We can't treat it until we
find the underlying cause.

300
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,776
- How do you do that?
- Surgically.

301
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,078
It's called exploratory
laparoscopy.

302
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,284
We use a camera to
navigate Liam's mid-section.

303
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,526
Now, there are
significant risks.

304
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,658
Perforation of an
organ. Accidental spread.

305
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,924
Seeding a malignancy.

306
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,367
And you have to do this because
he can't stay still during an MRI?

307
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,631
You obviously know
your son better than I do.

308
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,125
Do you think we
should try again?

309
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,119
So, Shaun told me
he's getting a TV.

310
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,962
Seventy inches, all the works.

311
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,158
Is he now?

312
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,528
It's just a TV.

313
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,301
It's not about a TV.

314
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,997
Why are you so
worried about him?

315
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,671
He's showed up late for
work half a dozen times,

316
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,485
he calls me at 2:00 in the morning
because he can't find a screwdriver,

317
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,411
and his superintendent wants
to kick him out of his building.

318
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,071
- Did you show up?
- What?

319
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,308
At 2:00 in the morning,

320
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,248
when he called you
about a lost screwdriver,

321
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,180
did you show up?

322
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,346
He was frantic. I didn't
know what he was gonna do.

323
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,083
There are 47 residents here.

324
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,401
All of them show
up late sometimes,

325
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,054
all of them make mistakes,
and hopefully, all of them learn.

326
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,922
You wanna worry
about Shaun, fine.

327
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,566
But you fought to hire him
because you know he can learn.

328
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,436
The question is, are
you willing to let him?

329
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,939
Shaun?

330
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,746
I can see the pixelation.

331
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,299
- That's great, listen...
- It's not great.

332
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,389
It's not good.

333
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,720
On a high-quality display,

334
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,193
the human eye at 20-20
cannot detect the pixels.

335
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,398
You disappeared
after the failed MRI.

336
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,093
I failed.

337
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,907
Yeah, see, I don't
think it's about that.

338
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,405
You were hesitant with
this kid even before that.

339
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,040
You asked me to do the ERCP.

340
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,941
Doctors don't have to
like their patients, Claire.

341
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,821
- You don't like him?
- I don't know him.

342
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,447
Shaun, there's something
else going on here.

343
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,991
- I know you know that.
- No.

344
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,253
No. Uh-uh.

345
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,721
He has the same
condition you have.

346
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,265
You have never
met anyone with...

347
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,493
Do you like all
people with psoriasis?

348
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,802
- I don't have...
- Yes, you do.

349
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,331
And you can never get rid of it.

350
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,099
Okay.

351
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,111
It's too bad you don't like him,
because I think he likes you.

352
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,578
Not only that, I think
he looks up to you.

353
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,977
So, you know how he thinks?

354
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,319
Well, not as much
as you probably do.

355
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,961
What are you waiting for?

356
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,829
For you to pass out.

357
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,026
And judging by the
size of your ankles,

358
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,668
that shouldn't be
too long from now.

359
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,139
Then hopefully I can get
you upstairs before you die.

360
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,107
Why do you give such a damn
about what I do with my life?

361
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,844
I don't know, Glen.

362
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,812
Why do you wanna die so bad?

363
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,617
I've lived.

364
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,628
I've had decent jobs. I've
had jobs that went nowhere.

365
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:10,029
Had a good roof over my head,
and had that good roof taken from me.

366
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,130
I loved a girl and
we got married.

367
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,041
Twenty happiest
years of my life.

368
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,844
Then she died.

369
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,176
And now I'm alone

370
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,749
and in pain.

371
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,057
Feels like the end of the story.

372
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,592
- I understand.
- Yeah?

373
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,692
You've had some tough
times too, Twenty-Eight?

374
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,165
Nobody understands what it's like to
be so good-looking and successful?

375
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,235
I was raised by nannies
and housekeepers.

376
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,938
Oh, my God, you're an ass.

377
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,907
Your point is you didn't suffer

378
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,883
because you were
good-looking and smart,

379
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,618
you suffered because
you were rich?

380
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,617
Only time I ever saw my
parents was Christmas.

381
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,227
Seriously, the story continues?

382
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,126
They had this big
party every year

383
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,753
and wherever they were traveling,
they'd always fly home for it.

384
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,436
And I'd have to come home, too,

385
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,700
from whatever school
they'd sent me off to.

386
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,041
When I was 18, I
decided I was fed up.

387
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,043
I was a man.

388
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,780
Done being their son.

389
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,120
And I was gonna
tell them publicly,

390
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,923
tell all their friends what
horrible people they were.

391
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,152
So I came home from school,
and I knocked on the door and...

392
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,927
someone answered.

393
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,401
But it wasn't my
parents, it was a stranger.

394
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,165
Turns out they'd sold
the house months ago.

395
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,497
They were gone.

396
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,467
I guess they were
done with me, too.

397
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,685
To prep Liam for
the laparoscopy,

398
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,450
we'll need to make four
small incisions in his stomach.

399
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,350
I don't need to do it.
I don't need to do it.

400
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,292
- Liam, you do need to...
- I don't need to!

401
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,906
If you could just hold
still for a second, Liam?

402
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,094
The, the bus driver
lets me off, I get lost.

403
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,826
- You're safe now.
- I get lost.

404
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,870
I'm hungry. I can't make food.

405
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,268
Can't do bath.

406
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,204
Don't need to do it.

407
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,036
Can't do food.

408
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,643
Can't put on clothes.

409
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,871
Can't do bus.

410
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,344
I took the bus.

411
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,013
I got off at the wrong stop.

412
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,684
I got scared, but
then I found my way.

413
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,720
I did an MRI and a man got hurt.

414
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,326
I made a mistake.

415
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,130
I make a lot of mistakes.

416
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,533
You tried to walk.

417
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,631
You made a mistake.

418
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,365
But mistakes are good.
You should make more.

419
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,401
You're like me.

420
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,981
You have red eyes, uveitis.

421
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,824
Liam takes vitamins.

422
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,724
Does Liam also take
herbal supplements?

423
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,352
Kava root. Why?

424
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,395
He doesn't need the
laparoscopic surgery.

425
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:27,761
I know what's wrong with him.

426
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:29,891
The red eyes.

427
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,880
They're caused by
an immune flare-up,

428
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,429
which can create the scarring

429
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,405
that we're seeing in
his digestive system.

430
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,232
The solution
requires us to go in

431
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,676
and remove damaged segments
of the bowel, piece by piece.

432
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,837
"Us"?

433
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,506
Yes, myself and my team.

434
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,549
Is Dr. Murphy on your team?

435
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,909
Of course.

436
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,783
Thank you for
diagnosing our son.

437
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,058
Dr. Melendez, you have our
permission to do the surgery.

438
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,796
But in no way will
Dr. Murphy be in it.

439
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,576
The parents, they won't budge.

440
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,220
They don't believe that
anyone who has autism

441
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,542
is capable of doing surgery.

442
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,945
Well, clearly they're irrational, I
don't know, shallow-minded people.

443
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,144
Who cares? What's the difference?
You agree with them, right?

444
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,579
- Do you agree with them?
- It's my team.

445
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,767
I don't want anybody telling me
who's supposed to be on my team.

446
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,072
- Including the Board.
- You're not answering my question.

447
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,627
- Your question's moot.
- Moot?

448
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:30,952
No, it's not.

449
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,095
If you agree with them,
then the only issue is

450
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,100
somebody stepping
on your poor little toes.

451
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,994
Get over it and go save the kid.

452
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,429
If you don't agree,

453
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,234
if you think Shaun
can handle surgery,

454
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,104
then tell them that. Tell
them to go screw themselves.

455
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,446
Either they agree that Dr. Murphy
belongs in that room with you,

456
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,810
or you can go find them
someplace else to do the surgery.

457
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,453
I was an 18-year-old
with no-one and no money.

458
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,759
So I worked three
jobs and took out loans.

459
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,172
Still alive.

460
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,641
That's not a bad
story, Twenty-Eight.

461
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,037
What happened with the parents?

462
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,517
I talk to them now, but...

463
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,373
they're not the people
who got me here.

464
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,916
It was the people
I didn't expect.

465
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,490
The ex-Marine at the shelter
who got me my first job.

466
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,187
And this crazy artist girl

467
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,560
who convinced me to go
after what I really wanted.

468
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,002
When you think
you're alone, Glen,

469
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,063
you're not.

470
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,673
All right.

471
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,413
All right?

472
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,653
Ready? One, two, three.

473
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,162
No disturbing dreams?

474
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,860
After a 36-hour shift?

475
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,354
From the moment
my head hits the pillow

476
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,700
to the moment I wake up,

477
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,399
all I see is black.

478
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,441
How's your level
of concentration?

479
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,340
Have you had any
difficulty focusing?

480
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:29,013
I mean, I can do the <i>New York
Times</i> crossword puzzle in one sitting.

481
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,119
Sure, sometimes I
wish I was more focused.

482
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,555
But that's pretty normal, right?

483
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,388
Shaun's different.

484
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,528
He also has savant syndrome.

485
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,199
He has a remarkable memory.

486
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,931
He has autism.

487
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,866
Same as our son.
Same limitations.

488
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,264
You saw what happened
to our son in the MRI.

489
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,467
He knew he needed to
lie still, but he couldn't.

490
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,279
Now, what happens if
Dr. Murphy breaks down like that

491
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,939
while he's standing over
my son at an operating table?

492
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,950
You know your son,

493
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,112
I know surgeons.

494
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,954
And after working with
Dr. Murphy, after challenging him,

495
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,649
in surgery and everywhere else,

496
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,585
probably more than he deserved,

497
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,262
I can tell you, he has
my complete confidence.

498
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,403
I'm sorry,

499
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,239
he doesn't have ours.

500
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,972
So, what do we do now?

501
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,914
I've contacted my
colleague at St Joseph's,

502
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,145
updated her on Liam's
condition. They have good people.

503
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,417
We can arrange for
transportation as soon as possible.

504
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,485
Where's my phone?
Have you seen my phone?

505
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,184
Where's his second bag?
The one with his medications.

506
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:50,986
I want...

507
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,825
I want...

508
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,791
What, honey?

509
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,928
He said I could do it.

510
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,438
I want Dr. Shaun.

511
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,544
Your pacemaker's here.

512
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,250
The techs are
programming it as we speak.

513
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,232
The moment they're
ready, we're gonna put it in.

514
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,627
I told you my wife died.

515
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,135
The truth is

516
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,702
she left me.

517
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,202
But I gave her
good reason for that,

518
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,337
so I got what I deserved.

519
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,007
We all make...

520
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,814
But you didn't get
what you deserved.

521
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,487
Good parents who loved you.

522
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,726
They were lucky
to have you, Jared.

523
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,877
- You appear remarkably well-adjusted.
- Thank you.

524
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,415
That's not a compliment.
That's my concern.

525
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,578
Well, I assume everyone
responds differently.

526
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,752
The thing is, everyone responds.

527
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,921
Strictly speaking, you
don't meet the criteria

528
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,430
to be required to go into treatment,
or take a leave of absence.

529
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,395
So I'm not gonna ground you.

530
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,964
You're a strong woman, Claire,

531
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,904
and that strength has
undoubtedly played a major role

532
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,444
in getting you where you are.

533
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,914
But if you have suppressed
feelings about this incident,

534
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,752
you need to find someone
to share them with.

535
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,612
Because if not,
they will eat you up,

536
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,988
no matter how strong you are.

537
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,161
All right, Glen. Second time...

538
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,430
Oh, come on.

539
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,734
Thank you.

540
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,946
It should be a very
interesting surgery,

541
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,641
I'm glad I'm participating.

542
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,247
His pressure is bottoming out.

543
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,516
- What's happening?
- His bowel must have perforated.

544
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,351
He's going into septic shock.

545
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,842
His perforation
could be anywhere.

546
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,966
What's the best way to access the
entire bowel as quickly as possible?

547
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,678
Full-length midline incision.

548
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,822
Good. Mark it.

549
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,490
And what do we do
once we get in there?

550
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,030
Eviscerate the entire bowel
so we can check every inch

551
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,370
for necrotic segments.

552
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,170
Okay. Let's make the cut.

553
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,376
Are you gonna take it or not?

554
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,709
This is the Number Three L.

555
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,345
It's made of high-carbon
steel. It doesn't break.

556
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,713
That's correct, Dr. Murphy.

557
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,127
Time of incision, 2:05 p.m.

558
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,208
<i>We have a code green.</i>

559
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:50,259
<i>Patient is a Caucasian
male, 73 years of age.</i>

560
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,461
Where'd he go?

561
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,865
Yeah. On my way.

562
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,935
I have a five-centimeter
segment of proximal jejunum.

563
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,741
It's necrotic, but
not perforated.

564
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,174
Mark it and move on.

565
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,227
Shaun, why are you
just standing there?

566
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,583
We have 25 feet of bowel to run.

567
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,419
Shaun, we need to get moving.
Unless you've found something.

568
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,590
I have. The perforation.

569
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,572
Clamp it off, I'll get in there
with the enterotomy scissors

570
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,894
and remove the damaged segment.

571
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,057
I can't.

572
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,134
You can't? Why not?

573
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,432
It's a phlegmon.

574
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,939
You found a walled-off abscess?
- It's large.

575
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,953
Don't touch it. - I already am.

576
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,421
If you move and
that thing ruptures,

577
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,108
the pus will spread to his entire
abdominal cavity. This boy dies.

578
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,078
I know, that's why
I'm not moving.

579
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,709
Claire, I need you
to open it up gently.

580
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,650
I'm gonna evacuate
the septic contents,

581
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,187
flush the cavity
with antibiotics,

582
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,128
and then I'm gonna have
you remove the capsule.

583
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,693
- I didn't do anything.
- That's the pressure tanking.

584
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,633
You need to finish what
you're doing right now.

585
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,323
Let's go, Claire. Come on.

586
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,863
Clamp.

587
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,768
You guys check left.

588
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,041
Hey. Hey, come on.

589
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,175
Stop.

590
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,857
Come on, Glen, we can do this.

591
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,887
I don't want to. I
just don't want to.

592
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,719
Please, leave me alone.

593
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,826
Once I get my strength
back, I'll climb up and jump.

594
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,133
I can't let you do that.

595
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,847
When this temporary
pacer fails, which it will,

596
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,586
your heart may stop and
you may die suddenly.

597
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,756
But more likely, Glen, you
slip back into that slow rhythm,

598
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,256
your chest is racked
with excruciating pain,

599
00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,674
and your lungs
start to fill with fluid

600
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,098
and slowly you suffocate.

601
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,331
Yeah, give it a
rest, Twenty-Eight.

602
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,096
Just get me a DNR and a cab.

603
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,539
You can't help me.

604
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,278
Yes, I can.

605
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,398
It was a difficult procedure.

606
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,569
- We removed a total of two feet of...
- Is he okay?

607
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,861
He will be okay.

608
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,274
Thank you.

609
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,573
Thank you.

610
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:47,744
Thank you.

611
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,646
I... I'm sorry.
We're... We just...

612
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,587
He's our son.

613
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,658
You shouldn't feel bad.

614
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,095
You did what you
thought was best for Liam.

615
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,790
You love Liam.

616
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,795
I didn't have that
from my parents.

617
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,562
It also means I didn't
have to take Kava root

618
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,163
so I didn't get
hypereosinophilic gastroenteritis.

619
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,448
Are you gonna get
in trouble for this?

620
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,459
You're worried about me now?

621
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,658
You signed the DNR.

622
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,326
All I'm doing is
sitting with you.

623
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:59,147
<i>When they say your father's name</i>

624
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,610
<i>They're talkin' about a boat</i>

625
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,056
<i>They're not talkin' about him</i>

626
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,060
<i>'Cause they don't
trust you as far</i>

627
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,789
Are you feeling any anxiety?

628
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,658
No.

629
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,625
Pain?

630
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,229
Some.

631
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,409
Would you like a dose of
morphine to help with that?

632
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:27,475
<i>But back then, the
ship seemed sunk</i>

633
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,315
<i>I couldn't sleep
when I wasn't drunk</i>

634
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,646
<i>I couldn't sleep
when I wasn't drunk</i>

635
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,926
<i>But now a bad idea</i>

636
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,054
<i>Has cut you in two</i>

637
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,000
<i>Darlin', I just don't know</i>

638
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,263
Thank you.

639
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,264
<i>Darlin', I just don't know</i>

640
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,745
<i>Some things you just let go</i>

641
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,342
<i>Some things you just let go</i>

642
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,114
<i>Oh...</i>

643
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,625
Find your guy?

644
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,798
I did.

645
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,541
You put in the biventricular?

646
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,574
How long did it take to get
access to the coronary sinus?

647
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,244
I didn't do the surgery.

648
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,153
I didn't put in a
pacer in. He, um...

649
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,485
He didn't want it.

650
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,896
He was a good guy.

651
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,444
I lost a patient, too.

652
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,679
Want to talk about it?

653
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,782
I do.

654
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,483
Your surgery went well.

655
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,022
You should be able to get up
and move around in two weeks

656
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,620
once we're sure the antibiotics
have cleared your infection.

657
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,123
Hear that?

658
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,694
It won't be too long
until we can go home.

659
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,628
You did great, honey.

660
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,002
The lights.

661
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:18,911
Are the lights okay?

662
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,046
Do you want them dimmed?

663
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:29,353
They're okay.

664
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,741
You'll love the software.

665
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:52,446
It makes it very easy to budget.

666
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,780
And the best part, it links
directly to the bank and...

667
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,416
Get rid of the ball!

668
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:00,549
He was the first
quarterback picked in 2013,

669
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,118
but his stats outside the pocket
are only 27% completed passes.

670
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,626
Their back-up QB is
65% under pressure.

671
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,259
Absolutely.

672
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,865
- He's wasted potential on the bench.
- Yes.

673
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,367
Anyway, the link to the bank
will help make automatic... Oh!

674
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,407
Did you see that?

675
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,911
He pinned it against his
helmet, even with the Pl.

676
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,914
I want to go to the Super Bowl.

677
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,526
Okay, see? That's exactly the
kind of thing you have to think about

678
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,247
before you buy. Tickets
are very expensive.

679
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,420
No, you know
what? You should go.

680
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,621
- I should go. We should go.
- Okay.

681
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,229
Excuse me.

682
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,731
It's almost closing time, so...

683
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,665
I'd like to buy this TV.

684
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,264
Stay as long as you like.
