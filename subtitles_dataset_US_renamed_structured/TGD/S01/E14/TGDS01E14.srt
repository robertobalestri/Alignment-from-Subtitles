1
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,536
Morning, doc.

2
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,481
Good morning, Kenny.

3
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,046
Hey, hey, hey.

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,684
Brosef, your cable's out.

5
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,888
I don't have cable.

6
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,790
- I have a digital antenna.
- Why?

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,858
Digital antennae
receive superior picture

8
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:38,303
and sound quality, and
the channels are free.

9
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,049
Yeah, but you only get,
like, 10 channels that way.

10
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,769
I only watch three.

11
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,862
You mind if I run
a line to your tube?

12
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,812
Cable guy can't fit
me in till next week.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,512
Mmm-hmm...

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,389
Come on, 10 channels
are better than none.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,514
- Yes, they are.
- All right. <i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

16
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,448
What?

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,450
Mmm...

18
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,026
Dr. Reznick was orphaned
once Dr. Coyle was transferred,

19
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,657
so she'll be joining our team.

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,861
Hi. I'm Claire.
Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,704
- Are you the autistic one?
- No.

22
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:15,367
That's me.

23
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,738
- Dr. Shaun Murphy.
- Mmm, hi.

24
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,046
We've got two pretty
straightforward cases,

25
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,342
nice level playing
field for an eager group.

26
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,354
- Not interested.
- Competition can foster teamwork.

27
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,050
Which can lead to a greater
understanding and appreciation

28
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,821
of residents' strengths and
weaknesses and improve patient care.

29
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,705
You're playing the same
game Glassman had us do

30
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,391
when we were
interns. Not interested.

31
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,526
Winning team gets first dibs on
assisting on all surgeries next week.

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,161
- In.
- Out.

33
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,297
Mmm-hmm...

34
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,968
I pick the boy genius.

35
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,073
That's you.

36
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,187
Dr. Browne.

37
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,254
- Kalu.
- Dr. Reznick.

38
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,858
Thank you. I'm
looking forward to it.

39
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,827
Thank you.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,870
Same stakes as last time?

41
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,537
Absolutely.

42
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,083
Hi, Quinn. We hear you've
had some stomach pain.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,327
Do you mind if we take a look?

44
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,819
It doesn't hurt that bad.

45
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,821
Poor thing says
everything is okay,

46
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,323
but when Quinnie didn't
want to go swimming today,

47
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,451
I knew that something
must be wrong.

48
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,188
We'll be as gentle
with her as possible.

49
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:49,226
Quinn's parents are out of
town, so I, I flew in to babysit.

50
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,868
Mmm-hmm.

51
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,170
Okay. Let's see.

52
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,910
- That's a...
- Penis.

53
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,313
She's not a girl. He's a boy.

54
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,460
- It's just a phase.
- Stop saying that.

55
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,024
I'm not a boy. I'm a girl.

56
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,933
- You're transgender?
- Yes.

57
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,031
No. Quinn has XY
chromosomes like Jared and me,

58
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,769
not XX like you.

59
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,435
Science says he's male.

60
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,706
No, Quinn has gender dysphoria.

61
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,108
Her assigned gender is not
the one she identifies with.

62
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,048
She's mismatched, Dr. Murphy.

63
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,648
- But biologically...
- Other than biologically...

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,518
How do you know you're
supposed to be a boy?

65
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,793
Your question doesn't make sense.
I'm not supposed to be anything.

66
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,524
I am a boy.
Biologically, that's it.

67
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,233
Okay, deep tenderness
at McBurney's point.

68
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,601
Could be acute appendicitis.

69
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,433
Murphy, get imaging to confirm.

70
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,969
Mmm.

71
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,484
Mr. Shaw, your chart says
that you passed out in class.

72
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,383
- What do you teach?
- History.

73
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,718
I got a little dizzy because
I skipped breakfast.

74
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,816
Uh, it's nothing. The school
insisted on calling an ambulance.

75
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,460
Taken any medications
in the last few months?

76
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,930
Uh, I took some Vicodin after I
threw out my back six weeks ago,

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,368
and then I had a stomach
flu, so I took ofloxacin.

78
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,397
But the flu part didn't totally
go away, so I took azithromycin

79
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,540
and prednisone because
my glands were swollen.

80
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,513
Uh, but I still had a sore
throat, so I took some Cipro.

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,508
What doctor
prescribed you all that?

82
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,848
They were leftovers I had
in my medicine cabinet.

83
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,150
- Uh...
- All right, lay back for me.

84
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,190
Look, I'm a single
dad with twins

85
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,995
who bring home every disgusting
germ they touch at preschool.

86
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,099
Uh, I can't afford to miss work.

87
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,365
You've got a fever

88
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,682
and you've gone through two IVs,

89
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,546
which tells me that you're
severely dehydrated.

90
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,543
You can't stand me touching your
stomach without wincing in pain.

91
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,277
Dr. Reznick, let's get
Mr. Shaw here an ultrasound.

92
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,384
- We've been trying for a while.
- Five months.

93
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,780
I realize my prime egg
days were two decades ago,

94
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,947
but I've been vigilant.

95
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,490
Ovulation kits, LH and FSH
testing, basal body temp.

96
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,790
I've checked my
estradiol and AMH levels.

97
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,954
The old-fashioned
way wasn't working.

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,898
Okay, well, there are a lot
of possibilities to consider.

99
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,968
Many benign, many
easily corrected.

100
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,128
So I will take some
samples from you both,

101
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,738
run some tests,
we go from there.

102
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,830
There's a clock.

103
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,342
We need to know if
we start with IUI or IVF...

104
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,902
Both of you, you
need to stop worrying.

105
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,078
Isabel, you are not the
first 40-something woman

106
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,708
to come here and
ask these questions.

107
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,075
Myself included.

108
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,488
You came to me
because you trust me, yes?

109
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,187
Right. So let me do what I do,
and you two focus on each other.

110
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,253
Hey.

111
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,526
We're a team, babe.
In this together, all right?

112
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,694
Okay.

113
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,082
I'm afraid, Howard, your
appendix has already ruptured.

114
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,279
Book an OR stat
and page Melendez.

115
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,820
Wait. I need to figure out who's
gonna take care of my kids,

116
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,981
call the school, so they
can get subs for my classes.

117
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,217
Mr. Shaw, if we don't
get you into surgery now

118
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,491
your infection could spread
and you could become septic.

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,552
Dr. Browne will make all
the necessary phone calls

120
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,154
while I prep you for surgery.

121
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,630
Isn't that so, Dr. Browne?

122
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,629
You're in good hands,
Mr. Shaw. We've got you covered.

123
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,727
Let's go.

124
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,039
Hello.

125
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,710
- Do you wear dresses?
- Murphy, don't.

126
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,820
Quinn is a boy who
thinks he's a girl.

127
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,753
I want to know
why he thinks that.

128
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,257
Sometimes I wear dresses,
but sometimes I wear leggings.

129
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,590
Do you like the color pink?

130
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,029
I'm more of a purple girl.

131
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,360
Do you play with dolls?

132
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,901
Since I was five, but
I'm super into mermaids.

133
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,731
- Do you take dance?
- Murphy, 20 questions are up.

134
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,329
I only asked four.

135
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,616
- Do you wear perfume?
- It doesn't matter.

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,785
- The CT's ready. Let's go.
- Do you always paint your nails?

137
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,936
Let's go.

138
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,615
Perforated appendix is out.

139
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,520
Lavage or no lavage, Dr. Browne?

140
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,858
Lavage before closing the wound
decreases residual fluid accumulation

141
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,091
and minimizes
residual contamination.

142
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,397
Claire's right. Although, a recent
study documented a higher abscess rate

143
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,028
when irrigation was used
for perforated appendicitis.

144
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,748
Well, someone
did their homework.

145
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,968
I'm partial to AMSURG
since they published me.

146
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,269
As a medical student?

147
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,246
It was about the cost and
stabilization of disease in patients

148
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,976
undergoing transcatheter and
surgical aortic valve replacement.

149
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,223
Are you thinking of
specializing in cardio-thoracic?

150
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,646
A girl can dream.

151
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,383
Staple up and close up.

152
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,982
Well,

153
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,551
it's, uh, it's good to have
you on board, Morgan.

154
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,397
It's great to have
another female surgeon.

155
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,734
Oh, uh...

156
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,134
I'm sorry, you and I
are not gonna be friends,

157
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,663
and hanging out, having
sleepovers, braiding each other's hair.

158
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,001
That's not exactly
where I was going with it.

159
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,136
When residency's over,

160
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,972
the hospital's likely
only keeping two of us.

161
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,483
Shaun is Glassman's
pet project, so he's in.

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,015
Jared is persona
non grata, so he's out.

163
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,249
Which means every time
you win, I lose. And vice versa.

164
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,989
Thanks for the heads up.

165
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,836
Do you think he's
complicated or confused?

166
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,410
Dude, you've got to
quit calling her a "he."

167
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,723
We're never going
to win this competition

168
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,147
with you disrespecting
our patient.

169
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,893
Don't they have transgender
people in Wyoming?

170
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,819
Okay. Transgender patient care

171
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,187
was not part of my
medical school curriculum.

172
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,623
Was it part of yours?

173
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,785
No.

174
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,125
Quinn doesn't have appendicitis.

175
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,933
He has testicular cancer.

176
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,234
She.

177
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,175
We found a mass
on Quinn's left testicle.

178
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,514
- She has cancer, but...
- Am I gonna die?

179
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,554
No, no. Prognosis is very good.

180
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,764
We've caught it
before it spread,

181
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,723
and we'll do surgery
on the mass to remove it.

182
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,885
The CT also showed
he has osteopenia.

183
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,938
Murphy, stop with the "he."

184
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,925
Uh...

185
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,828
- Quinnie, it's your mom. I have to...
- Of course.

186
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,771
Osteopenia. That's
low bone density, right?

187
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,503
Yeah. How'd you know that?

188
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,207
Do you know how I got cancer?

189
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,756
There are several possible
causes, but I would...

190
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,375
Microlithiasis,
mumps, hypospadias...

191
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,714
- Murphy.
- Intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia...

192
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,244
- Inguinal hernia, HIV...
- Murphy? Enough.

193
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,849
Your parents are
on their way here.

194
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,292
Um, they just told me... Quinn,
are you on puberty blockers?

195
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,932
That's the likely cause
of the osteopenia.

196
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,129
Are you taking
leuprorelin or histrelin?

197
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,802
I... I've been on
leuprorelin for nine months.

198
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,512
Well, why didn't you
say anything earlier?

199
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,634
Because my parents didn't
want my grandma to know.

200
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,115
Looks like he has an abscess.

201
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,545
You have an infection.

202
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,610
We'll drain it, put
you on antibiotics.

203
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,797
It's nothing to worry about.

204
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,966
It just means you might be in the
hospital a couple of extra nights.

205
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,701
I can't spend a
couple of extra nights.

206
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,023
I need to get out of here.

207
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,123
Are you worried about your kids?

208
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,455
Well, they're with
my sister, they're safe,

209
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,467
but they've never spent a night
without me since they were born.

210
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,534
Well, then consider this a blessing.
A free vacation from your kids.

211
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,169
They're my life.

212
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,534
My wife died of
ovarian cancer last year.

213
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,210
I, uh...

214
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,815
I hate hospitals.

215
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,952
I'm so sorry.

216
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,890
Why don't I find a laptop
so you can Skype with them?

217
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,023
And I'll rustle up a couple of toy
bears from Peds for you to take home.

218
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,690
Thank you.

219
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,203
I want to reassure you
that the puberty blockers

220
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,762
are in no way responsible
for causing cancer.

221
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,569
The leuprorelin did
cause your osteopenia.

222
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,938
Does this mean I have to
stop taking puberty blockers?

223
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,035
Yes.

224
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,691
We'll get you on dietary supplements
to help regain your bone strength,

225
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,193
but the puberty
blockers are hurting you.

226
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,337
You'll be fine without them.

227
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,610
Fine?

228
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,357
I don't want an Adam's
apple or a deep voice

229
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,952
or hair all over my body. You
can't reverse that, can you?

230
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,454
No, I'm afraid not.

231
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,263
Girls have body hair, too.

232
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,645
Toy bears, Skype with
kids? You've got game.

233
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,086
"Game"?

234
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,787
I believe the name for what I
did is "basic human decency."

235
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,422
Everyone has an agenda.

236
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,624
Sometimes it's conscious,
sometimes it's not, but it's always there.

237
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,666
And you've got this whole
"queen of kindness" thing down pat.

238
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,003
Awfully cynical for
someone so young.

239
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,505
Mmm, not cynical. Just the
reality of how the world works.

240
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,666
It's Howard.

241
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,508
He spiked a fever, temp's
105. BP's tanking, 80 over 40.

242
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,742
He's soiled his sheets.

243
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,807
Site's clean. Infection
should be clearing by now.

244
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,212
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Page Melendez.

245
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,778
Give me 500 milligrams
acetaminophen,

246
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,847
two grams of meropenem
IV infusion empirically.

247
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,516
Run a full chem panel,
CBC, and get cultures ASAP.

248
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,161
Hang in there, Howard.
We're gonna figure this out.

249
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,935
Any word on Quinn Darby's labs?

250
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,941
Big backup today.
Nothing much I can do.

251
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,373
- Text you when they're ready?
- Yeah.

252
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,303
Hey, Gus.

253
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,450
I saw raspberry and rose petal
doughnuts in the cafeteria today.

254
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,815
Got you the last one.

255
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,217
You remembered. Thank you.

256
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,487
Howard Shaw's labs. I
put a rush on 'em for you.

257
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,026
You're the best.

258
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,027
Why did you give Gus a doughnut?

259
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,727
I was being nice.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,834
I needed my patient's labs
expedited. Gus likes doughnuts.

261
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,905
- It's called bribery.
- I call it "basic human decency."

262
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,898
See you later.

263
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,805
Howard has a superbug.

264
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,613
A c. diff infection?

265
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,210
It's resistant to
all medication.

266
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,819
Quinn's pre-op labs are normal,

267
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,704
so we can do the surgery
first thing in the morning.

268
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,892
The procedure is called a
radical inguinal orchiectomy.

269
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,796
It's radical in that the entire
cancerous testicle is removed.

270
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,100
Uh, all functionality
will remain the same.

271
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,151
Quinn should be able to resume her
normal activities in one or two weeks.

272
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,143
- See? Baby, that's good news.
- No, not really.

273
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,355
Without the puberty blockers,

274
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,507
I'll be the freak in
ballet with a mustache.

275
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,374
Aren't there any other options?

276
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,185
- I wish there were.
- If we do a bilateral orchiectomy,

277
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,813
Quinn will have the
testosterone level of a girl.

278
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,915
We are not removing
both testicles.

279
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,026
You want to castrate
my grandson?

280
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,254
- No!
- No!

281
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,523
- Oh...
- I'm so sorry for Dr. Murphy's outburst.

282
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,699
I'm gonna have gender confirmation
surgery when I'm 18 anyway.

283
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:03,928
Why not just do it now?

284
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:12,639
Quinn is a child who still plays
dress-up and make-believe.

285
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,412
He may want to have
children of his own someday.

286
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,574
Ew.

287
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,282
- We'll give you some privacy.
- Thank you.

288
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,821
- I will not allow you...
- It's not up to you.

289
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,064
You are making me doubt the
wisdom of drafting you, Murphy.

290
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,076
If you go around saying
inflammatory things to people,

291
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,534
it will only upset them.

292
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,436
How will I know if I said
something inflammatory until I say it?

293
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,931
Test it on Kalu first.

294
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,970
Which you can do while the two
of you prep an SDA for this case.

295
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,247
An SDA?

296
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,714
A Shared Decision Aid

297
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,960
is a paper presenting the pros
and cons of making a difficult...

298
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,282
I know what it is, Murphy.

299
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,016
But why am I being punished?

300
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,612
It's not a punishment,
it's necessary.

301
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,100
It'll help Quinn's
family understand

302
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,990
all the options available
to them for her care.

303
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,484
Understood?

304
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,691
Understood.

305
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,597
The stool culture
and sensitivity tests

306
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,967
indicate that you're
resistant to every antibiotic.

307
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,563
Which only happens when you've
been exposed to every antibiotic.

308
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,366
I did this to myself?

309
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,746
But I've used those medications
before without a problem.

310
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,145
Why did this happen now?

311
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,776
You weren't under
a doctor's care,

312
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,787
so you were likely taking
the wrong medication

313
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,947
for the wrong symptoms.

314
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,485
But you can fix this, right?

315
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,957
We're gonna have to
perform a colostomy,

316
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,790
where we attach an ostomy
pouching system to your abdomen

317
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,353
to collect waste from your body.

318
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,424
For how long?

319
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,009
Well, with the level of
damage we're seeing

320
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,467
throughout the
colon, indefinitely.

321
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,832
I'm so sorry, Howard.

322
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,513
I don't understand why you'd
suggest the bilateral orchiectomy

323
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,028
when you don't even
believe Quinn's a girl.

324
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,612
I was answering
Dr. Lim's question.

325
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,886
She said there were no
other options, but I found one.

326
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,496
- And now we're here.
- Yes.

327
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,407
You're actually enjoying
this scut work, aren't you?

328
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,730
Yes. We are being helpful.

329
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,495
We're not doing this
to be helpful, Murphy.

330
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,540
We're doing this because
you pissed off Lim,

331
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,165
and I'm collateral damage.

332
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,610
Okay. We're still being helpful.

333
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,842
Doesn't matter.

334
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,943
Doesn't matter,
competition's over.

335
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,746
Is it?

336
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,832
We're in here and
not with the patient.

337
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:40,349
No face time, plus you calling her
a "he", equals crappy survey scores.

338
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,624
It's okay. It's a game.
It's not important.

339
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,925
It is to me.

340
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,360
I'm a pariah.

341
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,299
These scores are part
of our resident evaluation.

342
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,431
Our jobs depend on them.

343
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,803
Mine does, at least.

344
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,485
Then we should do
this scut work very well.

345
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,392
Finola called.

346
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,938
She found an irregularity
with one of the tests

347
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,434
but wants to
re-run it to be sure.

348
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,269
Okay, so...

349
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,031
We wait until she re-runs it.

350
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,405
Marcus, we're both doctors.

351
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,910
The results aren't gonna change.

352
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,315
I waited too long.

353
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,411
It's all my fault.

354
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,259
This is the part where
you say, "No, babe, it isn't."

355
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,657
You had goals, other priorities.

356
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,800
You said you supported
my career choices...

357
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,867
- Just like I supported yours.
- I do support you. Always.

358
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,395
And I am so proud of you.

359
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,931
But it came at a cost that
we both knew was possible.

360
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,833
We should have
started trying sooner.

361
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,372
When? When you were 3,000
miles away teaching at Dartmouth?

362
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,541
Or, what, when you were
chasing down head of surgery?

363
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,827
We would have figured it out.

364
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,411
"Figuring it out" would have meant
me and a nanny raising a baby.

365
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,546
I didn't want that.

366
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,698
I tried to bring it
up four years ago,

367
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,367
but you wanted to get your
practice up and running.

368
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,868
A baby didn't fit in
that picture, either.

369
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,292
It is not the same.

370
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,892
How many pregnant
women get hired for anything?

371
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,674
Or when they find out a
woman's got a child at home,

372
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,894
suddenly it's all, "Who's
gonna take care of the baby?"

373
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,765
No one asks men that question.

374
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,463
Well, none of it matters now.

375
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,049
Right? Because
it's probably too late.

376
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,406
And I knew it. I knew
this was gonna happen.

377
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,146
You've been stewing over this.

378
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,073
Resenting me. For how long?

379
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,374
I don't resent you, Is.

380
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,478
But, you know, if you want
me to sit here and tell you

381
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,717
that it's not your fault, I...

382
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,893
I can't do that, I'm sorry.

383
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,866
<i>- Oh.
- I love you, my friend.</i>

384
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,072
Hey. You like?

385
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,415
- That door was locked.
- I know.

386
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,696
The cable guy had a
cancellation, so he hooked me up,

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,744
got us a two-for-one.

388
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,099
Little thanks for
being so chill earlier.

389
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,456
Mmm, <i>gracias, amigo.</i>

390
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,912
So, what kind of doctor are you?

391
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,034
- I'm a surgeon.
- A surgeon?

392
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,368
Your stuff doesn't
say surgeon, does it?

393
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,802
It's like, uh,
Selena and Justin.

394
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,147
It doesn't really go together.

395
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,693
Furniture's from, like, a
dozen different places.

396
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,741
Fourteen.

397
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,045
Fourteen.

398
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:58,148
The people in Casper knew
I didn't have any money,

399
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,125
so they gave me
things to make a home.

400
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,822
The bookshelf is from
Jennifer, the town librarian.

401
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,664
My table and chairs are
from Mr. Grady's diner.

402
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,432
The lamp is from Sheryl who teaches
Sunday school at Highland Church.

403
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,736
Dr. Glassman, he
got me my bed...

404
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,402
Well, you don't have to
tell me the whole list, but...

405
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,841
Okay. Yes.

406
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,743
Everything I have works.
There is no need to change it.

407
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:25,910
Respect.

408
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,430
Mmm... Hi.

409
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,304
- I'm Dr. Glassman.
- Hi.

410
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,003
- I'm the president of the hospital.
- Is everything okay?

411
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,439
Sit down.

412
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,039
There has been no
change in Quinn's condition.

413
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,446
However, her grandmother

414
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,851
has made a claim of child abuse

415
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,122
against you and your husband.

416
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:09,194
She's claiming that putting
Quinn on puberty blockers,

417
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,153
and, these are her words...

418
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:15,001
"Making her think that
being trans is okay"

419
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,130
is a form of emotional
and physical abuse.

420
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,073
Now, just to be clear,

421
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,974
we don't believe any
of these allegations

422
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,342
have any merit whatsoever.

423
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,007
I know my mom, okay?
She's not gonna drop this.

424
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,680
She'll go to court.

425
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,047
Could she get custody?

426
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,814
Well, she could try, but,
uh, Dr. Lim would testify.

427
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,315
- They could put her in a foster home.
- Hey.

428
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,057
Ty, she won't make it.

429
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,387
If we let Quinn do the surgery
she wants now, it'll all be over.

430
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,992
There will be no reason
for Ruth to fight us.

431
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,525
Yeah?

432
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,696
Yeah.

433
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,704
Do what Quinn wants.

434
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,608
Do the bilateral surgery.

435
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,620
There is an issue.

436
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:13,692
Your tests confirmed abnormalities
in the semen parameters.

437
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,631
- I beg your pardon?
- The semen analysis.

438
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,759
It showed that you have a low
sperm count and low motility.

439
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,335
- It's my fault?
- No.

440
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,566
We... We do not
speak in terms of fault.

441
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,710
15% of all couples
struggle with infertility,

442
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,873
and of those, 50% have
a male factor component.

443
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,780
It's not great news,
but it's not a dead end.

444
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,214
So what's the next step?

445
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,223
I'm gonna refer you
to Dr. Arjun Dhillon.

446
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,790
He's an excellent urologist, and
he'll give Marcus a full physical,

447
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,122
do some blood work,
and an ultrasound.

448
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,926
- That can't be right.
- Marcus.

449
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,297
- It can't be right.
- Marcus. We got this. Okay?

450
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,188
We're gonna get
through this together.

451
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,003
Hey. Hey!

452
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,178
Why didn't you tell me
Howard's labs came back?

453
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,292
I should have been there when
you broke the bad news to him.

454
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,751
So Melendez could see your
touching bedside manner?

455
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,586
- It doesn't matter anyway.
- Oh, it doesn't? How the hell not?

456
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,620
The poor guy's
getting a colostomy.

457
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,492
There's no way we're
winning this competition.

458
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,030
You really have no sympathy
for what Howard's going through.

459
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,589
It's a major bummer, no doubt.

460
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,644
But we don't have time
to get emotionally invested

461
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,000
in every patient that we treat.

462
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,497
Our job is to go in, do
the surgery, and get out.

463
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:39,373
Afterwards, his poop, someone
else's poop, it's not our problem.

464
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,773
Hey, well, wait.

465
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,482
What if we could get Howard
a fecal microbiota transplant?

466
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,049
FMT for a surgical case?

467
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,386
Theoretically, we transfer
healthy feces to him,

468
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,256
it restores good flora to
the body, kills off the CDI,

469
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,022
and he avoids
surgery altogether.

470
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,056
We could actually
win this thing.

471
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,331
I'm gonna pull all the research
before pitching it to Melendez.

472
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,569
So, this meeting is called

473
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,405
a Challenging Patient
Consultation Process.

474
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,879
The name sucks, but there
are things about it I do like.

475
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,282
All you got to do
is talk and listen

476
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,013
and try to understand
each other.

477
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,423
What's to understand? Ruth
accused us of being child abusers.

478
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,822
And what's to discuss?

479
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,918
We are Quinn's parents. We
get to make her medical decisions.

480
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,622
What if Quinnie's
better off as a boy?

481
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,098
You have no idea what
Quinn has been through.

482
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,795
Every kid goes
through rough patches.

483
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,428
Every kid is confused.

484
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,633
Quinn has always told us exactly
who she was, ever since she was three.

485
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,472
So you let Quinn play
with dolls. Big deal.

486
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,844
You don't make life-altering decisions
because a child wants to be a princess.

487
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,716
We used to let Quinn do
whatever she wanted at home.

488
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:01,423
But when she went out in public,
we made her present as a boy.

489
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,787
It felt false to her.

490
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,694
She hated it.

491
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:08,559
She hated herself.

492
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,729
She became reclusive, depressed.

493
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,532
And then a year ago,
Quinn tried to kill herself.

494
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,743
Sorry I'm late.

495
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,357
Howard might not
need the colostomy

496
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,397
if we give him a fecal
microbiota transplant.

497
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,931
Hasn't the FDA gone
back and forth on that?

498
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,413
We could be introducing new bacteria
into his system that could kill him.

499
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,769
The likelihood of that is low.

500
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,898
But not zero.

501
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,636
But if we do the colostomy, we
may not really be helping him.

502
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,769
15 to 30% of patients get
recurrent CDI after the initial bout.

503
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,042
That's a good point.

504
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,210
I believe 65% of that time,
recurrent CDI becomes chronic,

505
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,404
which can lead to repeated
hospitalizations and death.

506
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,685
Are my numbers right, Claire?

507
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,225
Yes.

508
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:13,323
But recent studies show better
than a 95% success rate with FMTs.

509
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,460
Howard is a good candidate.

510
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,036
We should try it before he
develops a toxic megacolon.

511
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,163
Don't we owe it
to him, to his twins,

512
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,433
to at least try an
experimental treatment

513
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,444
before doing an invasive surgery
which will alter his life forever?

514
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,538
You're right. Prep
him for the procedure.

515
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,807
I appreciate your passionate
advocacy for your patient.

516
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,350
Good work, both of you.

517
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,859
- Oh, now you're a team player.
- When it benefits me, yes.

518
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,871
Speaking of which, while
you were doing your research,

519
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,591
I found Howard a
match at the stool bank.

520
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,632
- Sample arrives in a couple of hours.
- Great.

521
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,498
I let them know you'd
be the designated doctor

522
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,060
to handle the medical chain of
custody when the sample arrives.

523
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,263
So?

524
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,773
So you're the only person
who can handle the sample.

525
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,401
You'll have to dilute it, blend
it, strain it all on your own.

526
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,517
To safeguard against
cross-contamination, of course.

527
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,812
Of course.

528
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,159
Your temperature
and BP are normal.

529
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,158
Normal, whatever that means.

530
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,062
Typical. Usual.

531
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,026
Expected.

532
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,120
Yeah, I don't feel like
any of those things.

533
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,600
What does it feel
like to be a girl?

534
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,642
Are you angry? Was that
an inflammatory question?

535
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,512
I'd rather people ask questions
instead of pointing and staring.

536
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,278
When I used to look like a boy,

537
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,953
I felt different.

538
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,761
The kids at school didn't
understand me, so they picked on me.

539
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,853
I spent a lot of time alone.

540
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,196
When my parents let me be me,

541
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:59,696
I felt like I didn't have
to pretend anymore.

542
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:06,074
I felt free, like when you're in a
pool and you just let go and float.

543
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,780
I'm not a very good swimmer.

544
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,962
I don't know what it feels
like to be anyone but me.

545
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,129
Me, too.

546
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:38,106
Is the bilateral more risky
than the unilateral surgery?

547
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,103
The big issue
with the bilateral is

548
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,409
Quinn will never be able
to have biological children.

549
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,877
If Quinn's parents think

550
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,261
that Quinn's mature enough
and strong enough in her beliefs,

551
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,365
then they should do it now.

552
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,253
It's an elective
surgery on a child.

553
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,881
There is no medical necessity.

554
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,927
Except with a previous
suicide attempt, she's still at risk.

555
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,427
Her situation is different now.

556
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,260
She's socially transitioned
and living as a girl.

557
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,957
But there just isn't enough good
data on trans kids and their outcomes.

558
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,298
On the other hand,

559
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,168
there's very good reason
to preserve future fertility.

560
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,738
Dr. Lim and Dr. Andrews are
both very excellent surgeons,

561
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,301
and they very clearly have
some passionate points of view,

562
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,641
but their views are their own.

563
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:18,013
You all need to decide
what's best for Quinn.

564
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,110
Whatever we decide,

565
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,454
Quinn is still gonna be a girl.

566
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,025
I don't know if I'll ever
be able to accept that.

567
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,724
I know that makes
me sound horrible.

568
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,832
I know what it's like to
not put your family first.

569
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,231
And it cost me.

570
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,065
It cost me a great deal.

571
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,775
And if I had to do it all
over again, I'd ask myself,

572
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,576
"Is it really worth
sacrificing a life

573
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,477
"with someone I love

574
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,683
"over an idea that
may never be?"

575
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,693
Why don't we give them the room?

576
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,197
Hey. I got the page.
What's going on?

577
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,171
She started screaming in
pain and vomiting. Temp's 104.

578
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,267
Increased groin pain
could be attributed to

579
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,972
epididymitis, kidney
stones, inguinal hernia.

580
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,166
The extra weight of the tumor could
be causing the testicle to twist on itself.

581
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,280
There'd be no blood flow.

582
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,047
Thank you.

583
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,258
She has a testicular torsion.
She needs surgery now.

584
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,642
Excuse me. Have
you made a decision?

585
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,997
Not yet. I mean, there's
a lot to work through...

586
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,200
We need one now.

587
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,708
Quinn has testicular torsion.

588
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,077
The spermatic cord is twisted
and cutting off blood supply.

589
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,273
We need to operate.

590
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,378
If you want Quinn to
live the way she wants,

591
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,650
don't limit her future now.

592
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,260
You heard her when my mom
said she might want kids someday.

593
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,053
She can't even fathom the
thought because she's just a child.

594
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,902
Just do what's
medically necessary.

595
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:32,784
Doesn't appear to be any
palpable lymphadenopathy.

596
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,285
It's likely a stromal tumor, but
get that to pathology right away.

597
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,414
Yes, sir.

598
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,620
Quinn has tachycardia
and hypotension.

599
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,632
- I'm not seeing any bleeding.
- EKG's normal. It's not coronary.

600
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,029
CO2 and O2 are
normal, so it's not a PE.

601
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,765
It must be a reaction
to the anesthesia.

602
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,035
I'm already pushing
fluids and vasoconstrictors.

603
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,947
Six syringes in, and
no sign of leakage.

604
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,450
Okay, we're wrapped up here.

605
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,288
Let's get Howard into recovery.

606
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,721
- Well done.
- Thanks.

607
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,822
I was thinking of
writing up the procedure,

608
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,691
possibly submit
it for publication?

609
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,660
I'd be happy to assist,

610
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,355
seeing as I've done it before.

611
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,353
Thanks, but I think I can...

612
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,996
I read your paper in AMSURG,
Dr. Reznick. You continue to impress.

613
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,665
Coming from you, I take
that as a huge compliment.

614
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,244
When you get a chance,
Dr. Browne, you should read it.

615
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,208
Will do.

616
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:46,584
I've given vasopressors and
reduced her meds as much as I can.

617
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,802
She's losing volume somewhere.

618
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,159
It was dry when we
ligated the spermatic cord.

619
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,339
I'm still not seeing the bleed.

620
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,299
Could be vagal stimulation
from the severed nerve.

621
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,494
But she's not
responding to epi. Sepsis?

622
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,848
It's too early for an infection.

623
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,730
Her MAP is 20.
She's barely profusing.

624
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,102
All right.

625
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,272
Okay, excuse me, guys.

626
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,937
- You're breaking scrub.
- I'm so sorry.

627
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,241
Grey-Turner sign.

628
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,436
Could be a
retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

629
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,026
Jared could be right.

630
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,562
It is possible that there
is internal bleeding.

631
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:33,631
The testicular artery can
retract up into the pelvis.

632
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,469
It's rare, but it can happen.

633
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,799
Rare is an understatement.
Dr. Andrews?

634
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,705
I don't think we have any other choice.
We need to do an ex-lap. 10 blade.

635
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,950
Murphy, retract.

636
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,135
Internal bleeding.
Jared was right.

637
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,498
- Nice call, Dr. Kalu.
- Thank you, sir.

638
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,768
Kalu, suction. We need
a clear view of the field.

639
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:24,387
Fever's down, and the flora in your
system seems to be returning to normal.

640
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:28,120
- We expect a full recovery.
- Thank you. For everything.

641
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,188
Do you know when
I can have visitors?

642
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,263
I thought you might
ask that question.

643
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,528
There are a couple of eager
preschoolers who'd like to say hi.

644
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,931
- Oh. Keira! Sammy!
- Daddy!

645
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,934
Oh, I think you guys have grown.

646
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,872
Hey. Hey, these are the
doctors that saved Daddy.

647
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,679
Dr. Reznick, and
this is, uh, uh, uh...

648
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,315
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

649
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,714
Dr. Browne.

650
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,682
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

651
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,623
You're welcome.

652
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,360
Okay.

653
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,893
Who's this guy?

654
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,365
- Bear Bear.
- Bear Bear?

655
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:19,575
Did you do it? Did
you remove both?

656
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,205
No. Just the cancerous one.

657
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,047
What? Why not?

658
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:27,944
That's on me.

659
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,179
I couldn't, in good conscience,
remove a healthy organ.

660
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:38,192
Quinnie, this was our decision.

661
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:41,358
- No! You said you were on my side.
- Hey, we are.

662
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,825
Always.

663
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,802
We haven't had
enough time to talk,

664
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,670
not with each other, with your
therapist, with your doctors.

665
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,542
So I'm gonna turn into a boy?

666
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,174
Not right away.

667
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,157
Your endocrinologist
will talk to you

668
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,080
about the right timeline for
starting feminizing hormones.

669
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,412
You know...

670
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,519
The thought of having your own
kids someday is a big decision,

671
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,686
but you never know what you will
or will not want once you get older.

672
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:13,190
Cis people are always so
worked up about having bio kids.

673
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,600
If I really want a kid
that bad, I can just adopt.

674
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:23,264
You know, I'll be back when I'm 18
for my gender confirmation surgery.

675
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,209
And when you do,
I'll be here to help you.

676
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,686
Patient satisfaction survey
scores are in, and it was very close.

677
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,316
Not really. She's being kind.

678
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,427
Congratulations go to
Dr. Reznick and Dr. Browne.

679
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,226
- Yes.
- Thank you.

680
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,698
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Shaun.

681
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,135
Claire and I make a nice team.

682
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,270
- You should be psyched.
- Yeah. I should be.

683
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,712
To the victor belong
the spoils. Pay up.

684
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,583
Oh, humility was
never your strong suit.

685
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,885
Thank you, Mortimer.

686
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,619
Don't spend it all in one place.

687
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,522
Spend it? I'm gonna frame it.

688
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,563
What made you think of a
retroperitoneal hemorrhage?

689
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,432
Homework. You were right.

690
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,161
Prepping for an
SDA was important.

691
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,303
We make a good team.

692
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,540
Quinn doesn't like pink.

693
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,671
- Oh...
- Uh, I think she will like these.

694
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,143
I hope so.

695
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:44,482
She's more of a purple girl.

696
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,389
Did you read Morgan's
AMSURG article yet?

697
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,663
It is on the top
of my to-do list.

698
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,167
I didn't tell you to
read it to rub it in.

699
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,019
I told you to read it so you
knew what you'd be up against.

700
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,807
You think I need to
be more cutthroat?

701
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,644
No. That's Morgan's
MO. You're different.

702
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,241
You're smart, you're special.

703
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,552
Rise up, play the game
on your own terms.

704
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,881
Don't wait for it.

705
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,580
I heard you saved Quinn's life.

706
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,748
Jared and I did. I like her.

707
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,786
"Her."

708
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,592
So you get that she is a "she"?

709
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,462
I have lots of questions.

710
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,593
Yeah, well, questions are good.

711
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,896
Leads to awareness
and understanding.

712
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,634
And, who knows,
maybe even acceptance.

713
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,738
Being a kid is tough
enough, but being a trans kid?

714
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,748
Oh, man, that's off the chart.

715
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,382
I can't imagine how
it must feel to be so

716
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,385
different on the outside
than you are on the inside.

717
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,433
Hey, Shaun. I
can give you a lift.

718
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,729
Mmm...

719
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,101
We could grab a bite.

720
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,242
You said you can't be my friend.

721
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,612
So, no, thank you.

722
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,510
Okay.

723
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,286
- Hey, <i>amigo.</i> What's up?
- I need your help.

724
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,511
You're not gonna do
any laps or nothing?

725
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,403
No.

726
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,512
Then what are you doing?

727
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,587
Understanding.

728
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,758

729
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,389
