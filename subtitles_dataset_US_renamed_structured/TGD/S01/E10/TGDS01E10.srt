1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:03,828
Good news.

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,683
I have a VIP who needs a multiple
ligament reconstruction on his elbow.

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,869
And I've got room for
a couple of residents

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,433
to assist me and Dr. Melendez.

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,568
Awesome.

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,079
I've never assisted
on one of those before.

7
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,358
Dr. Andrews knows that.

8
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,826
That's why he's acting
like it's Christmas morning.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,513
I'm guessing you've never
operated on a pro athlete either.

10
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,356
Um, last time I checked,
a couple means two,

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,890
and there's three of us.

12
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,118
More good news.

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,454
Whoever isn't with us
will be assisting Dr. Coyle

14
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,557
on a double-leg fasciotomy.

15
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,179
Feeling lucky?

16
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,194
Murphy.

17
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,739
"VIP elbow." Sweet.

18
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,103
"Fasciotomy."

19
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,611
Ooh.

20
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,979
Bobby Ato? Don't think I've
heard of him. He's a pro athlete?

21
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,794
He's a pro. I don't know
if I'd call him an athlete.

22
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,911
E-sports.

23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,945
Video games?

24
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,132
He's one of the
best in the world.

25
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,767
Last year, he won enough
prize money to buy his mom

26
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,225
a beach house in Monterey.

27
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,654
He paid cash.

28
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,557
Is he considered a
very important person

29
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,623
because he's an athlete, or
because he has a lot of money?

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,927
Both.

31
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,159
Hmm.

32
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,775
I have to go.

33
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,848
Morning. Shaun.

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,584
This is Melissa Bourne,

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,919
the therapist that
we talked about.

36
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,461
That you agreed to meet with.

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,254
Right, Shaun?

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,989
Hi, Shaun. It's
nice to meet you.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,124
Hi.

40
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,246
Dr. Glassman thought it'd
be a good idea for us to meet

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,763
before our first in-home session.
Just to make sure you're comfortable.

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,502
I am not comfortable.

43
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,977
Shaun, it's gonna be fine.

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,104
You two are going
to like each other.

45
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,640
Dr. Bourne has a PhD
in cognitive psychology.

46
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,278
She can really help you, but
you have to give her a chance.

47
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,382
Okay?

48
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,523
Okay. Okay.

49
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,732
I'm proud of you, Shaun.
I'm already proud of you.

50
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,660
Notice the separation
at zero degrees?

51
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,522
It's indicative of complete
tears of the LCL and the UCL.

52
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,726
A perfect candidate for surgery.

53
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,501
How's your mom?
Still beating cancer?

54
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,167
Oh. She's good, bro.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,215
She said she gets checked
out at the beach all the time

56
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,916
ever since you did her
breast reconstruction.

57
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,205
So, thanks, I guess?

58
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,273
We're gonna take good care
of you. See you in the OR.

59
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,403
Thank you.

60
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,759
Which part of the UCL is the
principal secondary restraint

61
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,115
to excessive valgus movement?

62
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,057
- Anterior.
- Everything okay?

63
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,110
Yes, I'm fine.

64
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,946
I'm fine.

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,284
Squeeze my hands.

66
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:42,112
There is a paradoxical loss
of grip strength on the left.

67
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,725
There are many possible
explanations for that, one of which is...

68
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,628
One of which is... He has
ligament tear is in his left arm.

69
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,226
The anesthesiologist will be up in
a few to get you ready for surgery.

70
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,502
Dope. Thank you.

71
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,669
Uh, Dr. Murphy?

72
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,668
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

73
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,647
I have a condition called...

74
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,581
You're autistic, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I get it.

75
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,017
But what is wrong with you, bro?

76
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,919
You gotta be legit smart
to land a gig as a surgeon,

77
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,449
and he just shut
you down like a noob.

78
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,593
I'll bring the idea
up again. I do that.

79
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,126
They don't respect you.

80
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,666
They should listen
to you the first time.

81
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,796
I can't control what they do.

82
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,150
Of course you can. That's what
playing the game is all about.

83
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,508
It's about controlling your opponent.
You gotta find the right strategy.

84
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,840
It is not a game.

85
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,540
Everything's a game,
man. Everything's a game.

86
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,346
Just sometimes the stakes are
higher, and this time, it's my arm.

87
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,960
So, I'm guessing you
drew the short straw?

88
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,519
I beg your pardon?

89
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,327
Well, you're here, and your
co-residents are on the VIP case.

90
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,328
I'm awesome, and I'd still rather
be with Melendez and Andrews.

91
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,467
- No, it's fine...
- Relax, it's cool.

92
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,178
Tell me about our patient.

93
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,641
Thirty-four-year-old
female, software engineer,

94
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,802
entrepreneur, presenting
with compartment syndrome

95
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,005
caused by extreme
overexertion in a spin class.

96
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,391
The condition has caused
the muscles in her legs to...

97
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,043
- Okay, great.
- I wasn't finished.

98
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,230
Finished enough to show
me you're smart and thorough.

99
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,563
You know the treatment plan?

100
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,351
- We need to make incisions on...
- Good.

101
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,181
You take lead.

102
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,395
We need to make a number of long
incisions down both sides of each leg

103
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,702
to relieve the tension and
return healthy circulation.

104
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,043
It's important we act quickly. If we
don't get the swelling under control,

105
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,779
the damage could be irreparable.

106
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,516
What does that mean?
I could lose my legs?

107
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,677
From working out too
hard in a spin class?

108
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,711
No, don't worry. Your
sister's gonna be just fine.

109
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,881
Look, I am very confident
we caught this in time.

110
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,249
If you could lean forward,

111
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,659
I just need to check your
kidneys haven't been affected.

112
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,757
Let me know if you
have any tenderness.

113
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,298
Extracting the palmaris now.

114
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,109
Dr. Andrews, I read your
op-ed in <i>Gen Surge News.</i>

115
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,377
Brilliant piece.

116
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,283
I never realized the
lack of continuity of care

117
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,789
was such a severe problem.

118
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,553
Dr. Melendez,

119
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,428
you have very beautiful hair.

120
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,058
Thank you.

121
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,261
Given the patient's
grip weakness,

122
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,631
we could do a
nerve conduction test

123
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,570
to rule out any
concurrent nerve damage.

124
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,830
No.

125
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,735
Okay, that looks like
a good stopping point.

126
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,782
Dr. Kalu, step in.

127
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,928
- Something wrong?
- No. It looks good.

128
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,853
I just want to give
Dr. Kalu an opportunity

129
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,753
to show us what he can do.
As long as that's okay with you.

130
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,648
Sure.

131
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,488
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

132
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,706
All right, looking good.

133
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,348
Let's move to the lateral side.

134
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,478
So, what are we
doing tonight, ladies?

135
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,783
How about we go to Viva's?

136
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,116
Sounds good.

137
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,882
Bovie.

138
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,292
You're awfully quiet
over there, Dr. Browne.

139
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,023
I'm just focused.

140
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,009
I know you're used to
operating with Melendez,

141
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,127
but we have fun here.

142
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,303
I feel like when it's less tense,
people make fewer mistakes.

143
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,798
Okay.

144
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,176
You wanna take the other leg?

145
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,202
Really?

146
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,212
Yeah, best way to
learn is by doing it, right?

147
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,038
Definitely.

148
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,172
So, go for it.

149
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,118
<i>Well, it's another warm day</i>

150
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,623
<i>In the city of cold hearts</i>

151
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,300
<i>They all just play the
part of who they are</i>

152
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,965
<i>And I'm here on my own</i>

153
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,939
<i>I'd rather be alone</i>

154
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,573
<i>Than try to be
someone that I'm not</i>

155
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:17,247
<i>And you seem like someone
who could appreciate the fact</i>

156
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,755
<i>That I'm no ordinary man</i>

157
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,775
Shaun. Good morning.

158
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,780
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,845
How'd it go with Melissa?

160
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,157
She was very helpful.

161
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,160
You're wearing the same
clothes as yesterday, Shaun.

162
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,187
After you.

163
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,037
Apparently, we
are at an impasse.

164
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,870
I feel strongly that Melissa
can be very helpful to you,

165
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,380
you feel so strongly
that she can't

166
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,941
that you're willing to sacrifice a
good night's sleep and hygiene.

167
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,017
Shaun, you smell.

168
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,657
I will shower in
the doctors' lounge.

169
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,156
Well, great. That
solves one problem.

170
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,334
You stayed here all night
just to avoid a confrontation?

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,393
Just say no, Shaun.
You know? Just say no.

172
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,528
No.

173
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,166
No.

174
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,005
Great. That's just great.

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,035
I don't have to see Melissa?

176
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,671
No, you don't have
to see Melissa.

177
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,978
You're a grown man, you
can make your own decisions.

178
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,214
I just happen to feel that she
could be of great help to you.

179
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,850
Tell you what, you
see Melissa three times,

180
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,020
and I will buy you the surround-sound
system you want for your television.

181
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,695
Are you bribing me?

182
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,034
I suppose I am.

183
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,942
If you don't like
her, she'll leave.

184
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,402
And I promise I will never
say another word about it.

185
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,104
That's a pretty good deal.

186
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,109
Okay.

187
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:24,842
Okay.

188
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,444
I will meet with her tonight.

189
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,018
That's good, Shaun.

190
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,601
Saline? I've never seen
it done quite like that.

191
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,968
Yeah, I had a
professor from Portugal.

192
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,971
Apparently, that's how
they do it over there.

193
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,105
It's supposed to
lessen the pain.

194
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,224
Well, the good news is
your tissue's nice and pink,

195
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,272
which means it's healthy.

196
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,246
Unfortunately, the swelling's
not coming down like we'd hoped.

197
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,714
Does this mean you're
going to have to amputate?

198
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,289
No, no. Sometimes it just
takes time. We'll take care of you.

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,153
Very nice work, Dr. Browne.

200
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:23,000
Hey. Can you do me a
solid and trade patients?

201
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,442
No. Not a chance.
Andrews let me take lead.

202
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,945
Coyle let me take lead, too.

203
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,311
So, what is the problem?

204
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,642
He's a little too friendly.

205
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,746
He patted my
back in a weird way.

206
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,518
I don't know, it
was... It was awkward.

207
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,877
I'm sure he's just trying
to establish a rapport.

208
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,760
Maybe. I don't...

209
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,593
Shaun? Switch?

210
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,132
No. I like Bobby.

211
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,495
He has very good advice.

212
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,602
<i>So, who did what?</i>

213
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,977
Well, I did most of the
surgery, along with Dr. Andrews,

214
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,778
and Dr. Kalu aided in replacing
one of your torn ligaments.

215
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,250
You should be back in competition
shape in a few weeks' time.

216
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,687
Word! What about
you? What'd you do?

217
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,825
I helped to clean
the grafted tendons.

218
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,685
Huh...

219
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,955
That's it?

220
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,553
Yes.

221
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,132
Come on, you
didn't get up in there?

222
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:30,076
Your muscle weakness, along
with the high body temperature,

223
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,578
could be an early indicator
of multiple sclerosis.

224
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,474
We should order an MRI.

225
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,018
No, we have talked
about this countless times.

226
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,750
Yes. We should order an MRI.

227
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,320
We are not ordering an MRI.

228
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,552
You don't respect me.

229
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,184
Not right now, I don't.

230
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,854
Dr. Andrews, Dr. Melendez.

231
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,740
Given the fact we're
dealing with a pro athlete,

232
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,604
even the slightest hiccup
could be problematic.

233
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,598
I think Bobby would be impressed
by our being extra attentive.

234
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,264
Kalu is right. He is a pro
athlete in his prime earning years.

235
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,276
We should make sure
we leave him 100%.

236
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,109
Do the MRI.

237
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,583
Nice score. You got
'em to listen, do the MRI.

238
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,060
No. Jared did.

239
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,423
How'd he get there
when you couldn't?

240
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,127
He asked nicely.

241
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,890
Okay. You asked nicely.

242
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,194
Yes. Yes, I did.

243
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,940
You gotta be fierce if
you want the glory, bro.

244
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,605
No. I do not want the glory, bro.
I just want to be a good surgeon.

245
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,649
Everyone wants glory. It's
how you get what you want.

246
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,048
And everybody's got wants.

247
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,221
I want a surround-sound
speaker system.

248
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,784
To get it, I have
to see a therapist.

249
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,886
I don't wanna have
to see a therapist.

250
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,666
Okay, yeah, that's... That's
how I got my first PS2.

251
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,327
Yeah, my parents bribed me to
go to therapy after they split up.

252
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,300
What was therapy like?

253
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,270
Pretty basic, bro.
She'd tell me what to do,

254
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,502
how to deal with my parents.

255
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,803
Was it helpful?

256
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,079
I don't know. I never did
anything she told me to do.

257
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,179
Is that an option?

258
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,245
Doing whatever the hell you
feel like doing is always an option.

259
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,127
Just a gentle reminder. Dinner
with my dad tonight at 8:00.

260
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,530
It is on my calendar.

261
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,100
So was the Gypsy Kings
concert, and I seem to remember...

262
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,194
Fair enough.

263
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,332
How was the VIP case?

264
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,676
Shaun seems off about something.

265
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,005
Did you talk to him?

266
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,307
Yes, because talking to
Shaun solves problems.

267
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,282
- And Andrews is...
- Is a pain in your ass.

268
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,850
No. He's actually too friendly.

269
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,384
Jared kisses his ass
and suddenly he's cutting.

270
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,617
Well, ass-kissing is a
useful skill for a surgeon.

271
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,870
That's a very beautiful blouse.
Do I still have to go to dinner?

272
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:05,854
Yes. It'll be nice. We'll have some
nice wine, and my dad will pay.

273
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,795
- He'll push us to set a wedding date.
- April 25th.

274
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:09,961
Did you book something?

275
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,867
No. But my dad doesn't
need to know that.

276
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,806
What do you got?

277
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,242
Looks like the surgically
repaired elbow is fine.

278
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,140
As I suspected.

279
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,082
But Murphy noticed
something in periphery,

280
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,982
a little higher up,
just above the bicep.

281
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,885
It was my idea.

282
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,717
Yes, I just said that.

283
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,192
So, we took an image from
higher up and noticed this.

284
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,255
It's encasing the entirety
of his brachial plexus.

285
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,532
This thing is massive.

286
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,939
Biopsy indicated it's
definitely a schwannoma.

287
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,942
And it's definitely malignant.

288
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,378
It's in a tricky spot, but you
might be able to remove it,

289
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,280
follow it up with a combo of

290
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,510
radiotherapy and
chemo to finish it up.

291
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,745
What? What's the problem?

292
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,791
Robert Ato. Bobby Ato?
Pro-gamer Bobby Ato?

293
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,916
You a fan?

294
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,463
I met him three years ago,
oncology consult for SF Muni.

295
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,524
He had cancer three years ago?

296
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,706
Why the hell wouldn't you tell us
that you had already had cancer?

297
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,804
It was in my lower
leg three years ago.

298
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,525
How's that gonna change
how you fix my elbow?

299
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,226
It would have a huge
effect on how I viewed

300
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,741
the symptoms that
Dr. Murphy noticed.

301
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,281
You didn't listen to Dr. Murphy
because you don't respect him.

302
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,721
'Cause Dr. Murphy is different.

303
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,658
I respect him. He has good
ideas and he has bad ideas.

304
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,820
Turns out this was a good
one. That you shot down.

305
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,421
Why did you hide the truth?

306
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,458
A previous cancer
diagnosis isn't shameful.

307
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,611
After the first diagnosis,
all I was thinking was,

308
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,912
"Will it come back?
How bad will it be?"

309
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,811
I was distracted,
man. I couldn't focus,

310
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,320
and I hit a slump and...

311
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,333
You were worried that cancer
was messing with your gaming?

312
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,759
Yeah, man! It cost
me a championship.

313
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,529
I decided to block it out, along
with all the thoughts of negativity

314
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:23,331
and physical weakness, and like
that, I became the best in the world.

315
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,201
We need to do a full body scan

316
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,143
to make sure the cancer
has not already metastasized.

317
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,107
What he said.

318
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,712
What I said.

319
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,047
This looks great.

320
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,392
The swelling is starting to reduce.
We can start tightening the sutures.

321
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,693
Finally, some good news.

322
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,228
You look like you're doing
better, too, now your boss is gone.

323
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,901
Dr. Coyle? He's fine.

324
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,431
You don't have to toe
the party line with me.

325
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,203
Trust me, I get it.

326
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,741
I almost rode myself
to death in a spin class

327
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,007
because I overheard a
couple of investors say that they

328
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,311
liked the concept just fine,

329
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,182
but that my cankles
were too distracting.

330
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,754
What? Your idea is brilliant.

331
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,750
And you're beautiful.
Screw those jackasses.

332
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,555
Grace, you don't get
it. You've got the face,

333
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,562
the perfect, little
hip-to-waist ratio.

334
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,223
And most VC firms are
run by a bunch of bros,

335
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,530
so there is an inverse relationship
between the size of my ass

336
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,934
and how much money I can raise.

337
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,347
Then you should
do something else

338
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,033
where you don't
have to deal with bros.

339
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,534
Like what, become a nun?

340
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,101
- Sorry.
- You agree with her?

341
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,111
She nearly worked
herself to death

342
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,079
trying to please some
pigs with money?

343
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,440
She shouldn't have to.

344
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,390
Great. Let me know
when you find utopia.

345
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,581
But until then,
I love what I do,

346
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,856
so I gotta play the game,
'cause if I call them out,

347
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,925
I just get labeled a
bitch, or even worse.

348
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,594
Your heart rate's going up.

349
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,631
Hazel?

350
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,796
Hazel? She's barely
moving any air.

351
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,402
Hazel, can you hear me?

352
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,867
Code blue! I need
to intubate her.

353
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,465
Give me a laryngoscope
and an ET tube.

354
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,752
<i>Code blue, 4 North, Room 407.</i>

355
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,887
Let's get her on 100% oxygen.

356
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,779
<i>Code blue, 4 North, Room 407.</i>

357
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,950
Talk to me.

358
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,044
Her lungs. I think it's
a reperfusion injury.

359
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,088
Ugh. There's no room in here.
A Mallampati three, maybe four.

360
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,990
- You should take over.
- You're doing fine.

361
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,652
Here, use the bougie.

362
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,578
- You feel the epiglottis?
- I think so.

363
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,447
Okay, go a bit further,
you should feel it stop.

364
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,151
If it keeps going,
you're in the esophagus.

365
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,275
It's stopped. Got it. ET tube?

366
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,478
It's gonna be okay.

367
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,278
Strong work, Doctor.

368
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,959
Best in the world or
not, this guy's insane.

369
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,995
Hiding from a diagnosis?

370
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,188
It doesn't work. It'll find you.

371
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,293
Bobby wanted to be
the best. He is the best.

372
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,115
I don't think he was
trying to be the best,

373
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,219
I think he was just scared.

374
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,038
What's that? Next
to the brain stem?

375
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,314
Oh. Another schwannoma.

376
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,453
So much for the power
of positive thinking.

377
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,857
He's a strange
kid. He had cancer.

378
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,529
Stopped going to follow-ups
because he started losing.

379
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,399
What's so strange? Sounds
like a classic case of denial.

380
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,364
I was thinking we could try
something new. Maybe gamma knife?

381
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,171
I don't think so. Wrong
type of tumor for that.

382
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,808
What if I told you
every few months that

383
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,581
you had a real possibility
you were gonna die?

384
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,152
I'd be scared. And I'd listen.

385
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,179
Maybe you would,
maybe you wouldn't.

386
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,414
Personally, I think he's right.

387
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,722
Shut down those voices of doom,
spend your days living instead of dying.

388
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,988
But he may also be crazy.

389
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,890
Short of making him a vegetable,

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,680
I don't know if there's
anything we can do.

391
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,174
Is... Is Shaun okay?

392
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,709
Is his work okay?

393
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,906
- Yeah. I just, um...
- Then he's fine.

394
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,472
Damn. Horse walks into
a bar. Bartender says...

395
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,108
We found another mass.

396
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,976
That's not how it goes, but
cool. Let's knock it out, too.

397
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,243
The mass is located
on your brain stem.

398
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,942
Which controls your
autonomic nervous system,

399
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,585
your heart, respiration.

400
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,954
Its positioning
makes it inoperable.

401
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,637
I had a good run.

402
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,933
Wish it was longer,

403
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,836
but I'm gonna go out on top.

404
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,986
If you went out today, could
you say the same thing?

405
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,335
She's lucky you were there.

406
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,369
Me? You're the
one who saved her.

407
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,836
With your help. A lot
of it. So, thank you.

408
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,447
Hey, look, you wanna...
You wanna get a drink?

409
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,948
Maybe take the edge off?

410
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,675
No. But thank you, though.

411
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,220
Are you sure? I
promise you'll have fun.

412
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,151
Like, I give great massages.

413
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,397
And I'll make a killer
omelette in the morning.

414
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,827
That's really
inappropriate. I said no.

415
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,195
I'm sorry... Where's
this coming from?

416
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,167
You were... You were
clearly giving me signals.

417
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,647
No, the only signal
I gave you was that

418
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,640
I wasn't interested
in the slightest.

419
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,842
Okay, see, I
just... I heard about

420
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,878
you and Kalu banging
in the call room, so I...

421
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,641
This conversation is
over. You're an ass.

422
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,043
I'm pretty easygoing, but you're
approaching insubordination.

423
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,352
You're gonna report me?

424
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:49,852
I'm not gonna report anybody.

425
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,147
But maybe next
time, try not to have

426
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,386
such a stick up your ass
about being asked out.

427
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,729
Oh, come on. I always thought
Bunny was the cutest nickname.

428
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,815
Of course you did, but you
could have stopped calling me that

429
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,365
when I was 12, or... Or 20.

430
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,170
Rough day?

431
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,883
Yeah. Yeah, it was something.

432
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,909
Well, this should make
you a little happier.

433
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:25,080
I have decided to take
care of your entire wedding.

434
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,751
We don't need it.

435
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,286
- You're welcome.
- We're not 21.

436
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,956
We're more than capable of
paying for our own wedding.

437
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:34,627
We make good money.

438
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,698
But you won't once you
start having kids, Bunny.

439
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,484
What are you doing in here?

440
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,450
I'm hiding from my therapist.

441
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,724
I am not going to get a
surround-sound speaker system,

442
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,658
but I am doing whatever
the hell I feel like doing.

443
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,391
Mmm-hmm. Can you
hand me that mop?

444
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,659
Okay.

445
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,178
Are you satisfied with what
you've done with your life?

446
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,317
Would you be happy
if you died tomorrow?

447
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,018
Uh... Satisfied? Happy?

448
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,423
I mean, I clean up a building.

449
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,628
But I... I married
the love of my life.

450
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,591
We raised three beautiful kids.

451
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:45,597
One of them had some troubles,
but she's doing great now.

452
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,505
And the other two are
doing all right for themselves.

453
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:54,280
And I was good to people.
At least, I think I was.

454
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,946
That's a very good answer.

455
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,166
I've got pictures of the
girls if you wanna see 'em?

456
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,214
No.

457
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,653
So, why do I need to quit
my job to have a family?

458
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,189
Agreed. She can be a great
lawyer and a great mom.

459
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,692
Yes, she can, but why?

460
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,697
Why waste your time working?
You should be enjoying life like me.

461
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,467
There's plenty
in the family trust.

462
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,808
Dad, my work is important.
I'm helping people.

463
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,043
Bunny, you're pushing papers.

464
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,879
How is that really
helping anyone?

465
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,144
I mean, maybe I'm
old-fashioned, but I don't get it.

466
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,744
I thought you were
smarter than that.

467
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,881
You'd prefer her to be a lazy
parasite living off a trust fund,

468
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,153
as opposed to actually
contributing to society?

469
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,023
Parasite?

470
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,388
My father made a lot of money.

471
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,929
I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

472
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,559
He made sure his children

473
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,036
and his grandchildren
could enjoy their lives.

474
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,096
I'm not hurting anyone.

475
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,109
In fact, I go out of my
way to help people.

476
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,543
So, I'm sorry if that
doesn't qualify me

477
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,839
as a worthwhile
person in your book.

478
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,577
I'll get the check
on my way out.

479
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,616
Dad, you don't have to...

480
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,945
What am I doing wrong, Shaun?

481
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't know.

482
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,320
I've tried

483
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,497
encouraging, I've
tried being supportive.

484
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:53,998
I've tried bribing you...

485
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,729
I don't need a therapist. No.

486
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,500
Look around you, will you?
You're sleeping... What is this?

487
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,801
A broom closet?

488
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,906
Look at the sacrifices you're
willing to make just to avoid...

489
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,317
We're going to
pick this up later.

490
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,161
You have to file a
complaint with HR.

491
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,287
I do that and I get
labeled hostile and difficult.

492
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,796
Neither of which work with
my complexion or gender.

493
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,306
All the more reason
to take a stand.

494
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,769
Claire, this situation is
exactly what HR is for.

495
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,317
I didn't say it was easy.

496
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,663
Yeah, you did.

497
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,585
Look, it's scary and it takes
courage, but it's the right thing to do.

498
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,941
It's a pointless thing to do.

499
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,446
- They'll listen to you.
- They will shift the blame onto me.

500
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,545
- Like you did.
- Whoa. What? How did I...

501
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,812
I came to you. You
accused me of exaggerating

502
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,129
- to get back onto the case.
- No, no, no.

503
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,497
It's not what I
meant. I had no idea...

504
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,046
I said he was too friendly.

505
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,387
You said he was trying
to establish a rapport.

506
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,957
I'm sleeping with you, Jared,
and you thought I was overreacting.

507
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,466
How do you think three
strangers will see things?

508
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,734
Claire, I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

509
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Don't worry about it.
It's just the way it is.

510
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,504
I've got a patient to round on.

511
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,977
Dr. Melendez and I had a talk,

512
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,814
and we believe we
can excise the tumor

513
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,380
if you're willing to
make a sacrifice.

514
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,546
Sacrifice?

515
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,254
- That sounds better than death.
- My thinking as well.

516
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,488
We believe we can
remove the mass,

517
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,431
but we'll also have to take a
piece out of your brain stem,

518
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,058
a chunk of the red nucleus

519
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,501
which helps control
the left side of your body.

520
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,066
You'll be paralyzed
on that side.

521
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:46,111
It could also result in
difficulty eating and swallowing.

522
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:47,940
Speech difficulties.

523
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:53,908
Let's do it.

524
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,050
Good for you. Here.

525
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,248
Hold on, hold on.

526
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,021
Bobby, this is
very risky surgery.

527
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,791
You could die on the table,
and even if all goes well,

528
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,626
you will be severely disabled.

529
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,930
Yeah, I... I was
listening, and I'm in.

530
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,577
Guys, hey, I get it.

531
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,279
If I'm dead, I'm... I'm dead.

532
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:31,588
But if not, PT, re-learning
stuff, whatever...

533
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,289
It's not gonna stop me
from competing. Not ever.

534
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,732
Bobby, your career is over.
We need you to understand that.

535
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,136
Yeah?

536
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,747
Once a gamer,
always a gamer, huh?

537
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,947
You got my respect.

538
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,775
What the hell is your problem?

539
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:27,506
If you ever threaten Claire,
take a disrespectful tone,

540
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,672
or so much as look at
her cross-eyed again,

541
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,009
I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more
than put you up against a wall.

542
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,649
We clear?

543
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,858
Your lungs are
looking a lot better.

544
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,906
Overall, you're in
pretty good shape.

545
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,873
Thank you.

546
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:06,018
You're welcome.
All part of the service.

547
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,147
And good for you.

548
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,255
I wasn't sleeping.

549
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,756
I heard the way you
handled that other doctor.

550
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,563
You heard that? All of it?

551
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:23,934
I wish I'd done that.

552
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,433
You were brave.

553
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,200
No. No.

554
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,407
If I was brave...

555
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,248
Rick Allen.

556
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:43,945
Who?

557
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,655
The one-armed drummer for
Def Leppard. Come on, man.

558
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,187
And there is the tumor capsule.

559
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,023
Richie Parker. Anyone?

560
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,339
Isn't he a NASCAR guy?

561
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,197
An engineer, right?
Born without arms.

562
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,403
And Nurse Ocampo
gets the door prize.

563
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:04,804
And now we will take just a
little piece of our friend here.

564
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,742
- A nice sample to test.
- Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,053
And now the rest.

566
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,811
He may not be able
to tie his own shoes,

567
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,580
but I wouldn't bet against
him ever competing again.

568
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,420
<i>Aut libertatem aut
mortem mihi da.</i>

569
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,890
Shaun, do you know
what that means?

570
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,289
No. It's not relevant
to this surgery.

571
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,623
Oh, it's relevant. Look it up.

572
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,993
No, it's not.

573
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:31,626
Heart rate and ETCO2 are rising.

574
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,429
Slight change in
body temperature.

575
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,882
His heart rate's 108.

576
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,431
Check tube placement
and suction him.

577
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,838
If he takes a turn, we
might have to abort.

578
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,675
I don't think so. I'm too
far in. Keep him stable.

579
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,305
He's tachy. Heart
rate's climbing.

580
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,943
115, 117, 120 and rising.

581
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,749
He is going into V-tach.

582
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,419
Robert Ato's dying.

583
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,092
I'm gonna pull out
of the pons slowly.

584
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,808
No, hold on. You pull out
now, you might damage

585
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,856
the cerebellar peduncle.

586
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,679
If I don't get out now, I'll
kill him if he starts seizing.

587
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,695
Something's not
right. Tachycardia?

588
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,296
Bradycardia would
make more sense.

589
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,669
- Ideas?
- Anyone?

590
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:15,823
Tell me what you see.

591
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,011
Got tachycardia, rising
body temperature, again,

592
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,853
muscle rigidity, CO2 is rising.

593
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,331
Muscle rigidity? Which side?

594
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,550
It's all over.

595
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,733
Then it's not the brain stem.

596
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,589
We'd only have muscle
rigidity on one side.

597
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:31,691
Think. Tachycardia,
rising temp, CO2.

598
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,499
CO2. It's the anesthesia.

599
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:36,877
Malignant hypothermia.

600
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,268
Get the MH cart.
140 Dantrolene, stat.

601
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,048
Kalu, Murphy, get as many
cooling blankets as you can.

602
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,249
We need to get this
temperature down. Now.

603
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,417
- Coming up.
- Now.

604
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,171
Hyperventilate with 100% O2,

605
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,712
10 liters per minute,
flush out the old anesthetic,

606
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,838
lower the ETCO2.

607
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,953
I want vecuronium on deck. We
gotta keep him under. Let's move.

608
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,617
And we're on.

609
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,258
- Uh, temp's not coming down.
- Wait.

610
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,030
CO2 is coming down.

611
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,095
Heart rate is coming down,
too. Temperature is 101.

612
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,208
Okay. Nice work, everyone.

613
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,573
Thank you very much.

614
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,370
Terry Fox.

615
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,148
Or my personal
favorite, Jim Abbott.

616
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,391
Come in.

617
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:45,293
Hi. I need to talk to
you about Dr. Coyle.

618
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,236
Dr. Browne.

619
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,812
I wanted to talk to you
about the same thing.

620
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,603
Please.

621
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,116
Surgery was a success.

622
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,126
And the outcome might
be better than expected.

623
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,277
There will still be significant
neurological dysfunction

624
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:19,100
on your left side, but not
as much as we'd anticipated.

625
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,668
Sick!

626
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,666
Thank you.

627
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,669
You did good, my friend.

628
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,286
You have to be patient.

629
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,487
Nah.

630
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,565
Is patience a bad thing?

631
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,865
Acceptance is a bad thing.

632
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,842
When I was a kid, I
wasn't good at jack.

633
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,252
But I never quit.

634
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,216
Found my thing.

635
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,989
Don't ever let anyone tell you

636
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:26,327
what you can and can't

637
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,699
do.

638
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,393
I'm sorry for last night.

639
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,867
It was a rough day, I was
tired. Probably had a few, too.

640
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,744
Your relationship with your
father is your business...

641
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,111
Neil, you don't have to.

642
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,558
I'll call your dad and...

643
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,386
I don't wanna have kids.

644
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,938
Shaun, I'm gonna drive you home.

645
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,240
You're gonna see Melissa. If
you don't like her, she'll leave.

646
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,942
But there's no
more running away.

647
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,612
Why do you think I'm doing this?

648
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,188
Because you are stubborn.

649
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:56,184
Okay. Yeah, okay,
sure, I'm stubborn,

650
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,523
but I'm doing
this for you, okay?

651
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,198
So that you can have a better life,
so that you can have a happier life.

652
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,329
What if it doesn't
make me happy?

653
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:11,005
What if it doesn't make me happy?
What if it only makes you happy?

654
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:15,279
You think... You think I'm
doing this to make me happy?

655
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:19,010
I'm not happy, Shaun. I'm
not close to being happy,

656
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,484
and you know what?
I am done explaining,

657
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,319
I am done bribing, and I
am done talking. Now let's go.

658
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,189
- No, let's go.
- No! No.

659
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,821
No, I want to make
my own decisions.

660
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,607
Shaun, can you keep
your voice down, please?

661
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,863
You cannot keep
ordering me around, okay?

662
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,368
You're not my father!

663
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,966
I know that, Shaun.

664
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:48,372
I don't understand why this
is so upsetting, I don't get it.

665
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:53,179
Don't let anyone, anyone ever
tell you what you can and can't do.

666
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,554
Okay, don't let anyone ever
tell you what you can or can't do.

667
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,387
I have to make my own decisions
and I want to make my own decisions!

668
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,395
- Hey, just calm... Shaun...
- I don't want help!

669
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,243
What were you thinking?

670
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,746
I do not need you
to fight my battles,

671
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,713
and I certainly
never asked you to.

672
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,945
And if you really respected me,

673
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,350
you would not treat me like some
damsel who needed protection, okay?

674
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,014
You would treat
me with the respect

675
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,956
that you would
automatically give to a man.

676
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,226
You'd treat me like a person
capable of handling her own life!

677
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,796
I don't know, maybe, maybe
it's too much to ask of you.

678
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,864
Apparently Andrews
agrees with you.

679
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,589
I've just been fired for physically
assaulting an employee.

680
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,471
Shaun? Shaun!

681
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:00,580
Where would he go? Is there
a place he likes to hang out?

682
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,119
A place where he
feels comfortable?

683
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,477
No. I don't know.

684
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,216
He's not at the hospital.

685
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,652
And there used to be
a picture here of Shaun

686
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,292
