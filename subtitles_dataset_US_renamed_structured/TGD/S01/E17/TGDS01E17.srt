1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,294
The timing was good.

2
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,062
I just got a job transfer.

3
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,000
Gretchen will start
at a new school.

4
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,069
We're gonna start a whole
new life. It's very exciting.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,371
In college, my dad
majored in cheerleading.

6
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
That was a joke.

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
Gretchen's got a
great sense of humor.

8
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,045
I'm laughing on the inside.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,149
Soon, you'll be laughing
on the outside, too.

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,415
Dr. Park?

11
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,548
Moebius syndrome
is the paralysis

12
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,320
of the sixth and seventh
pair of cranial nerves.

13
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,794
The seventh pair
controls facial expression.

14
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:02,989
Luckily, in Gretchen's case,

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,023
we haven't found any
limitation to the sixth pair.

16
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,831
I'm a lucky girl.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,495
We'll be taking two slivers
of muscle from your thighs,

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,300
along with their nerves
and blood supply,

19
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,815
and transplanting
them into your cheeks.

20
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,217
There will be
considerable recovery time

21
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,107
before you'll be
able to smile at will.

22
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,576
Maybe three months.

23
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,244
So what do you say?
Are you up for this?

24
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,540
Can I sleep on it?

25
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,115
See what I have to live with?

26
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,621
Nobody knows when I'm joking.

27
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,818
Sorry, Dr. Andrews.
Yes, I am very up for this.

28
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,862
Ah, okay. Great. So, unless
there are any other questions...

29
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,261
Do you want to be a comedian?

30
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,166
People getting your jokes
must be very important to you

31
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,071
if you think it's worth the risk
of dying during elective surgery.

32
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:55,875
Hmm.

33
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,052
I apologize for Dr. Murphy.

34
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,825
He's still learning that
silence is the right choice

35
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,729
when you have
nothing useful to offer.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,631
We are required

37
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,494
to have an honest
risk-benefit discussion

38
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,903
with our patients.

39
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,199
We are giving a lovely
young girl a smile.

40
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,333
That's a simple equation.

41
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,571
Well, it's more than
the smile or the jokes.

42
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,873
She can't express
any emotions at all.

43
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,619
No one can tell if she's
happy or sad or scared.

44
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,477
Anything.

45
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,386
She's never had
much of a social life.

46
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,416
Ever since her mother died,
she's been completely withdrawn.

47
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,325
All I wanna do is bring my
baby girl back into the world.

48
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,768
Don't worry, Mr. Milman, we'll
take great care of her, all right?

49
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,571
Lucy has a post-op
infection of unknown origin.

50
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,944
Infusing 900 milligrams
of clindamycin.

51
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,609
It's terrible, isn't it?

52
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,542
Yes, it is.

53
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,962
Have you been
changing your dressing?

54
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,045
Every day.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,952
- Soaking it in clean, warm water?
- Yes.

56
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,514
Taking your antibiotics,
one pill three times a day?

57
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,316
That's a no.

58
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,960
Lucy, I know I gave
you a script for antibiotics

59
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,142
along with one for pain meds.

60
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,926
Why haven't you been
taking your antibiotics?

61
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,636
Did you have a bad
reaction to them or...

62
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,705
I never filled my prescription.

63
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,036
I didn't think it was
necessary until it got really bad,

64
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,581
and then I was too
weak to go myself,

65
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,583
and I didn't have anyone
to pick it up for me.

66
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,278
Okay, mystery solved.

67
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,982
I'm sorry. I know it was stupid.

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,183
Very stupid.

69
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,229
Okay.

70
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,030
Hey, Shaun.

71
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,577
- Oh, hello.
- Haven't seen you in ages.

72
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,669
What's... What's new?

73
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,343
- I'm buying an apple.
- I can see that.

74
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,977
- Here, I'll... I'll get it for you.
- No, thank you.

75
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,419
- Thank you, Shaun.
- Yes.

76
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,854
What else is new?

77
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,148
You didn't want to be friends.

78
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,022
Mmm.

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,188
Yeah, no, uh, we...
We're colleagues.

80
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,658
You know, we're...

81
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,962
Whatever we are, we can
still talk. We should talk.

82
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,002
I have a new friend. Kenny.

83
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,264
Here you go.

84
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,274
Thank you, Debbie. Kenny,
huh? That's, uh... That's great.

85
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,003
Do you have a new friend?

86
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,545
- No.
- Okay.

87
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,946
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,278
We can talk, you know?
We can talk about sports.

89
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,763
We can talk about
weather. We can talk about...

90
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,016
Debbie?

91
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,365
Why would you wanna
talk about Debbie?

92
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,789
Debbie was flirting with you.

93
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,049
She was?

94
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,590
Yes, I noticed her
exhibiting two typical signs.

95
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,823
- Not the trifecta, though?
- No, not the trifecta.

96
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,231
And one atypical sign.

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,577
I think she's just
trying to be friendly.

98
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,070
She gave you an
extra dollar in change.

99
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,365
And the fact that you didn't
notice means you like her, too.

100
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,271
Maybe she's just bad at math.

101
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,615
My dad said that
you're on the spectrum.

102
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,987
That's why you said that
about people getting my jokes.

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,222
People always get my jokes.

104
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,890
Then you're very lucky.

105
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,325
That was a joke.

106
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,630
I see what you did there.

107
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,464
Yes.

108
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,578
They call me
"Resting Gretch Face."

109
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,075
"Shaun the Moron."

110
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,080
Not very witty. No, I'm
obviously quite smart.

111
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,783
I drew this to their attention.

112
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,322
I'm on a spectrum, too.

113
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,601
It's somewhere between
inscrutable, unapproachable,

114
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,436
and actively scorned.

115
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,331
I don't want to be
more approachable,

116
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:19,569
and I prefer people not reading
my emotions. They're mine.

117
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,444
But that's what
you do with friends.

118
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,326
You really think this
surgery's too risky?

119
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,589
Possible complications
include embolism, hemorrhage,

120
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:40,794
collateral paralysis, asymmetry,
brain damage, and stroke.

121
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,202
It's also expensive and
medically unnecessary.

122
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,810
Okay. Look straight ahead.

123
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,412
There's a two-hour wait in
the ER, and what are we doing?

124
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,351
Treating a woman because she
wilfully ignored doctors' orders.

125
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,218
I know what a parasite
looks like, and it's not Lucy.

126
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,150
So this is a mom thing with you.

127
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,623
Growing up with a whack
mother means that you can identify

128
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,321
any and all problem
personalities.

129
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,797
And that is the sole upside to my
miserable childhood. Thank you.

130
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,767
Well, at least you had a
mom. Mine died when I was six,

131
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,545
and Dad instantly
married a child-hating bitch

132
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,367
with a butt-load of debt.

133
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,671
Morgan, I'm sorry. I...

134
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,904
I didn't tell you to get sympathy.
Just that I know parasites, too.

135
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,512
Got you booked first
thing tomorrow morning.

136
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,480
Dad.

137
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,683
- What? Too soon?
- It's...

138
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,358
You're nervous.

139
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,388
I get it.

140
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,128
If you have any more
questions, feel free.

141
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,791
I've changed my mind.

142
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,199
I'm not having the surgery.

143
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,108
Murphy.

144
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,612
Hello.

145
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,217
Gretchen's father is very upset.

146
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,594
Seems you talked
her out of the surgery.

147
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,997
No, I didn't talk her out
of it or talk her anywhere.

148
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,501
I just gave her the
list of potential risks.

149
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,706
Embolism, hemorrhage,
collateral paralysis, asymmetry,

150
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,206
brain damage, and stroke.

151
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,107
- "Stroke"?
- Yes. There was a case in Brazil

152
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,577
- in 2004, and the patient suffered...
- Uh... Uh...

153
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,884
It seems that you don't believe
that restoring this girl's smile

154
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,975
is that important.

155
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,550
Smiles are overvalued. There
are studies that support that.

156
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,943
And there are
studies that don't.

157
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,229
When we smile, we produce
endorphins. They make us happy.

158
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,456
They make other people happy.

159
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,589
When we see smiles,

160
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,465
our basotemporal lobes are
activated, and we duplicate what we see.

161
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,800
Murphy, smiles are contagious.

162
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,295
You see?

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,010
I feel good. You feel good.
Everybody likes smiles.

164
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:09,839
I don't.

165
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,950
In any case, your
smile wasn't sincere

166
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,386
since it didn't demonstrate
the Duchenne marker.

167
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,616
There was no involvement

168
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,557
of the <i>orbicularis oculi</i>
muscles around the eyes,

169
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,618
which means you didn't
release endorphins.

170
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,230
You know, if you can talk her out
of a surgery she's wanted for years,

171
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,996
I'm pretty sure a conversation
with someone objective

172
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,401
can talk her back into it.

173
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,634
Get Park, come
with, and keep quiet.

174
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,200
Okay.

175
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,639
Dr. Kalu.

176
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,384
Remember me?

177
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,175
Fish girl?

178
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,653
- Uh, hi. Celez, hi.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,883
Yes, of course I do.

180
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,188
Hope it's okay that
I requested you.

181
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,229
I'm glad you did.
How are you doing?

182
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,165
Ooh, that's what
you're going to tell me.

183
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,426
I've been wearing the, uh,
tilapia skins for five months.

184
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,603
I'm getting really tired of being
followed home by stray cats.

185
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,270
How's the pain?

186
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,336
Compared to what
it was? Nothing.

187
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,119
- Uh, any fever, itchiness, or swelling?
- Nope.

188
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,551
Well, it looks very good.

189
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,113
But...

190
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,183
How much longer?

191
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,124
Um...

192
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,458
How do you feel about tomorrow?

193
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,427
- Seriously?
- I never joke about tilapia.

194
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,971
What's the matter?

195
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,866
I... I just wasn't
expecting that.

196
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,304
I...

197
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,084
I'm afraid of how
I'm going to look.

198
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,326
You're going to look beautiful.

199
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,082
Tomorrow.

200
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,863
I know Dr. Murphy informed
you about the risks of this surgery,

201
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,333
and some risks are
significant, and some just aren't.

202
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,602
This is as close to risk-free
surgery as we can get.

203
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,770
It'll give you a smile.
It'll let you laugh.

204
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,901
No.

205
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,080
Dr. Murphy didn't
talk me out of it.

206
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,449
He inspired me.

207
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,479
He helped me realize that this
could actually make me stronger.

208
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,320
I don't wanna run
from it anymore.

209
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,797
She's lying.

210
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,775
She's a smart,
sarcastic young woman,

211
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,777
not exactly someone who's
prone to inspirational stories.

212
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,155
Why would she lie
about changing her mind?

213
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,238
Well, when I was a cop,

214
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,659
I had a lot of people change
their minds about testifying in court,

215
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,652
and it always came down
to one of three reasons.

216
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,652
Fear, confusion, or
they were paid off.

217
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,833
- She doesn't seem confused.
- And I don't think she's afraid.

218
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,883
So Gretchen was paid off?

219
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,128
I admit the
analogy isn't perfect.

220
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,995
It's close enough.

221
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,737
Guess who's back in the ER.

222
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,043
You're happy, so I'm guessing
it's a non-compliant patient.

223
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,409
You misjudged Lucy.

224
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,179
She made an honest mistake
forgetting her prescriptions.

225
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,186
You called her, didn't you?

226
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,349
She didn't spontaneously
remember. You had to remind her.

227
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,920
Is that a mom thing, too?

228
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,692
Gretchen.

229
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,729
Are you worried that your
dad can't afford this surgery?

230
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,890
The insurance
company is paying for it.

231
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,369
Dad, I know it isn't.

232
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,095
It's elective.

233
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,008
It's medically unnecessary.

234
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,402
No one can put a
value on your smile.

235
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,281
Not bullies, not an
insurance company,

236
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,441
not even Dr. Murphy.

237
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,680
In my opinion, this surgery
is medically necessary.

238
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,256
Gretchen, sweetie,

239
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,423
my first memory of your mother

240
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,800
was of her smiling at
me from across the room.

241
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,461
And because of that smile,

242
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,596
we ended up with you.

243
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,772
And my last memory of her

244
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,207
is that radiance lighting
up the world one last time.

245
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,983
I mean, we never had much money,

246
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,954
but as long as I had
that smile, it didn't matter.

247
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,158
I love you, Dad.

248
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,164
And that's why I can't let
you give up everything for this.

249
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,420
- Lucy Callard?
- I'm here.

250
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,588
Um...

251
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,957
Lucille Elizabeth Callard?

252
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,720
Yes, that's me.

253
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,094
A Dr. Browne called me
to pick up my prescriptions.

254
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,570
You're the victim of
identity theft, Lucy.

255
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,804
There's an impostor using your
name and medical ID to get benefits.

256
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,521
Did you have your
purse stolen recently?

257
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,672
Six weeks ago.

258
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,881
And you had your driver's
license and credit cards replaced,

259
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,350
but not your health
insurance card?

260
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,383
Is this why the pharmacy
refuses to fill my prescriptions?

261
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,057
I'm on pain meds for
postherpetic neuralgia.

262
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,827
It's getting really bad.

263
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,896
Once the impostor filled her
prescription for pain meds,

264
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,957
the pharmacy must have thought
you were overfilling opiates.

265
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,502
Oh! It always flares
up when I get upset.

266
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,738
Don't worry, Lucy.
We'll get you your meds.

267
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,905
We... We can't.

268
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,546
We're already
treating Lucy Callard.

269
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,581
Nice game, Tony.

270
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,024
- Hi, Jim.
- Marcus, hey.

271
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,855
- You coming or going?
- Neither.

272
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,160
Fifteen-year-old girl
with Moebius syndrome.

273
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,028
Your company denied coverage.

274
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,393
No respiratory issues,

275
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,662
deformities, pain.
She doesn't even drool.

276
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,003
- She's fully functional.
- She can't smile.

277
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,773
That's a function.

278
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,705
Marcus, I think it's wonderful

279
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,609
you wanna give this
little girl her smile.

280
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,443
But if we paid for
everything wonderful,

281
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,710
we'd go bankrupt. And
then who are we helping?

282
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,682
We all know doctors cheat
diagnoses to get coverage.

283
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,812
Deviated septum gets
you a free nose job.

284
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,049
Migraine gets you botox.

285
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,092
Do you really want
me to play that game?

286
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,860
This isn't a game for me.

287
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,557
We're a reputable company
with very high standards.

288
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,725
Very high bonuses that get
even higher with your denial rate.

289
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,180
I was gonna suggest we end this
before we say something we'll regret,

290
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,763
but I believe that
just happened.

291
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,868
Gretchen's socially
isolated, depressed,

292
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,638
and that's only gonna get worse.

293
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,389
What if she slashes her wrists?
You'd prefer to cover that?

294
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,644
Are you threatening me
with a teenage girl's suicide?

295
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,207
And God forbid something
does happen to her,

296
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,429
'cause I'll make sure
that this conversation

297
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,733
is part of the permanent record.

298
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,329
Dr. Andrews said
smiles are contagious,

299
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,599
and I'm testing that hypothesis.

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,939
Well, I'm not sure your
study will prove anything.

301
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,649
It might have something to do with
the lack of the Duchenne marker.

302
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,475
Oh. Yes.

303
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,339
But here you go.

304
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,114
That wasn't a smile.

305
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,778
Sure, it was.

306
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,124
I want to show you something.

307
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,366
You need to follow me.

308
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,372
Okay.

309
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,408
The impostor has poisoned
the real Lucy's medical record.

310
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,856
We have to go through
every medication,

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,714
every notation, every test
to determine whose is whose.

312
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,480
Doing that with zero tolerance
for errors could take six months.

313
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,886
Well, the paperwork is
our problem, not hers.

314
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,981
Not if the confusion results
in a harmful treatment

315
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,252
or incorrect diagnosis.

316
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,793
Well, we have to do something.

317
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,624
This poor woman
is in serious pain.

318
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,328
So we treat her.
Just be clever about it.

319
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,896
Shaun. Shaun, I've
already had two iced coffees.

320
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,941
Debbie. Hello, Debbie.

321
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,704
- You flirted with Dr. Glassman.
- Oh, my God.

322
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,105
So I have a new friend,
and he needs one, too.

323
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,275
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay, look, Dr. Glassman,

324
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,684
Debbie's facial proportions
are close to optimal, okay?

325
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,245
0.38 vertical and
0.48 horizontal.

326
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,485
- I'm so sorry.
- So you should find her attractive.

327
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,654
- Thank you?
- Shaun. I'm so sorry.

328
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,560
And I think you're both Jewish.

329
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,893
Tribal commonality is highly
conducive to social bonding.

330
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,503
Shalom.

331
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,638
Bullies can't put a
value on your smile,

332
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,978
nor can Dr. Murphy,

333
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,245
but it seems the
insurance company can.

334
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:45,725
They've agreed to pay $43,750,
about 85% of the entire cost.

335
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,027
I can cover the rest of that.

336
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,286
I swear.

337
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,958
Oh, sweetie, please,
let me do this for you.

338
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,301
Okay.

339
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,537
Okay.

340
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,842
"Jane Doe"?

341
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,795
That's the only way that
we can treat you right now.

342
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,082
Go home and get some rest.

343
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,147
The records department
will call you to sort all this out.

344
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,087
A year ago, I was
playing tennis.

345
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,896
And then the shingles hit,
and I was laid up for six weeks.

346
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,230
And I've been on
pain meds ever since.

347
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,730
I lost my job. My husband
treats me like I'm an old lady,

348
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,969
and my daughter thinks I'm too
medicated to be around the new baby.

349
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,410
Maybe I'll be better
off as Jane Doe.

350
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,783
The impostor returns.

351
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,326
Lucy? Lucy, can you
squeeze my fingers?

352
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,668
"Lucy"?

353
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,533
She's in septic shock.

354
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,439
Order a lactate
level, blood cultures,

355
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,807
and a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

356
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,108
I'll tell Melendez we've
initiated the sepsis protocol.

357
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,925
We should report her. She's
a criminal and a flight risk.

358
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,212
And very, very sick.

359
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,628
We should put
someone outside her door

360
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,143
and arrest her
when she's stable.

361
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,348
We don't report patients
we find with drugs

362
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,115
or non-violent people with guns.

363
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,989
We do report people
who steal from us.

364
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,154
What would happen if
people who needed our help

365
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,339
thought they would be arrested?

366
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,542
If they thought they would
be arrested for stealing an ID,

367
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,843
maybe they wouldn't steal an ID.

368
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,787
I don't remember anything
in the Hippocratic Oath

369
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,067
about checking payer
sources before treatment.

370
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,437
Strongly suggesting there
was no health insurance

371
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,839
in fourth century BC Greece.

372
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,807
We have a duty to treat, and
we have the right to get paid.

373
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,846
But first things first. Oh, God.

374
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,821
Really do not wanna be sued
by either one of these women.

375
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,891
Maintain the pretense,

376
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,427
and as soon as she's stabilized,
we're gonna press charges.

377
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,204
Dr. Park, pull the
muscle, please.

378
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,900
We don't want any excess
gathering in the suture line.

379
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,943
Thank you.

380
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,843
Okay, remove retractors.

381
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,246
Ready?

382
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,271
Are you sure you don't
want something for the pain?

383
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,459
No. No, I'm good. As long
as you keep talking to me.

384
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,366
Especially if you share
something, uh, very painful.

385
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,597
- Painful?
- Mmm.

386
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,135
Okay.

387
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,374
Like the time I mistook
my biology teacher

388
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,947
for my girlfriend and
picked her up in the hallway.

389
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,484
Yeah. Twirled her around three
times before I realized my mistake.

390
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,577
That kind of painful?

391
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,250
You may have to dig
even deeper than that.

392
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,328
How about

393
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,102
the time I finally found
myself in the perfect situation?

394
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,335
You know, work, friends, future.

395
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,603
Something I never
really had before.

396
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,615
Maybe that's why
I screwed it up.

397
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,848
You're not responding to
the antibiotics like we'd hoped,

398
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,583
Lucy.

399
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,785
You know, don't you?

400
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,625
When the real Lucy Callard
showed up, it kind of gave you away.

401
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,692
Is there anyone we can contact?

402
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,333
Do you have any children?

403
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,238
A son.

404
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,277
But he'd be so ashamed of me.

405
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,976
- Where is he?
- College, first one in our family.

406
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,043
I had to choose between
premiums and tuition.

407
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,957
Your son is very lucky to
have such a loving mother.

408
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,155
I just wish you'd
got your antibiotics

409
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,349
when you got your pain meds.

410
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,889
I didn't get either medication.

411
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,558
Are you sure?

412
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,803
Because the real Lucy was
having problems with the pharmacy.

413
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,706
I didn't wanna risk
using the card again.

414
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,975
Is she okay?

415
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,479
Maybe it's time to move on,

416
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,420
take the lesson with you,

417
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,414
find new friends.

418
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,919
I went to Denver for
an interview last week.

419
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,559
And?

420
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,032
And we're done.

421
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,698
Really?

422
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,535
Take a look.

423
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,597
Hey, trust me.

424
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,348
See? Beautiful.

425
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,419
The kid, college, it's just
a convenient sob story.

426
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,483
Why would she lie
if she may be dying?

427
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,127
Here's what we don't
know about fake Lucy,

428
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,295
whether her story is true.

429
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,770
Here's what we do know.

430
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,168
She's a liar who just
found out she's busted.

431
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,232
Speaking of lies,

432
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,435
that shingles virus that
the real Lucy had last year?

433
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,138
According to Dr. Spindler
at Santa Clara General,

434
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,495
she had it the year before, too,

435
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,714
and, according to Dr. Millhouse
at SF Muni, the year before that.

436
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,551
She wasn't denied the pain
meds because of her impostor.

437
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,788
She was denied because
she is a garden-variety addict.

438
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,428
Well played, sir.

439
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,771
Dr. Park says the
surgery went well.

440
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,512
- It's been too long.
- What has?

441
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,715
She should be breathing
on her own by now.

442
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,843
Even after prolonged anesthesia,

443
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,251
it should only take
60 to 90 minutes.

444
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,189
Is she okay?

445
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,726
Mmm. She should have
protective airway reflexes,

446
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,358
motor activity, and a
return of consciousness.

447
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,864
I need to page
Dr. Andrews, stat.

448
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,838
- What's going on?
- Something bad.

449
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,916
Gretchen's glucose
is within normal limits,

450
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,078
and her electrolytes
are also normal.

451
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,213
And we've ruled out
hyper and hypothermia.

452
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,154
That doesn't leave much.
What about hypoxia?

453
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,818
She's maintained normal
oxygen as well as end-tidal CO2

454
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:01,973
throughout the entire case,

455
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,019
and we've given
her reversal agents,

456
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,158
which we will repeat.

457
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,894
Do you feel bad?

458
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,865
It's okay.

459
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,240
You told them it
was close to risk-free.

460
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,335
They knew there were
risks, and I told them, too.

461
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:24,415
Get a CT. Rule out clots,
hematoma, bleeding, and stroke.

462
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,859
WBCs and lactate are rising.

463
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,834
O2 sat and MAP are falling.
Sepsis protocol isn't working.

464
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,697
Multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome. Medications?

465
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,067
Add another antibiotic, uh,

466
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,006
continue crystalloids,
increase her vasopressors?

467
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,789
- Low-dose steroids?
- Give them all a try.

468
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,606
And intubate her
and insert a Swan.

469
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,506
And, yes, I understand
this is out of our own pocket.

470
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,054
Mmm.

471
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,962
Um, do anything
exciting for Purim?

472
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,937
Purim? Uh, no. Yeah.
You know, the usual.

473
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,202
Ate a little matzo

474
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,704
and celebrated our
exodus from slavery,

475
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,476
which I think is
Passover and not Purim.

476
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,675
Mmm.

477
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,414
Truth of the matter
is, I'm only half-Jewish,

478
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,249
so only half the knowledge.

479
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,951
The truth is, I'm
not Jewish at all.

480
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,588
Ah.

481
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,823
Yeah.

482
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,422
Yeah, my first husband was.

483
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,395
So I guess we have our lack
of Jewishness in common.

484
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,569
You know what, Debbie?
I think I should get going.

485
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:03,113
Okay. Well, it was nice, uh,
finally meeting you officially.

486
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,074
Same.

487
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,085
Oh, no, look at that.

488
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:16,720
A 1975 300D, one of the
most perfect Mercedes ever,

489
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,286
just got a little less perfect.

490
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,594
I beg to differ. If you're
looking for perfection,

491
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,966
you look no further
than the 1967 280SE.

492
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,699
- Cabriolet or coupe?
- The coupe, an all-time classic.

493
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:31,842
Well, an owner of a 300SL
Gullwing might argue otherwise.

494
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,510
- A Gullwing?
- Yeah.

495
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,877
Can I get you another coffee?

496
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,315
Yeah.

497
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,284
- Iced, large, black.
- That's it.

498
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,516
I know.

499
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,639
That's a little bit
unsettling, Murphy.

500
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,636
Hmm.

501
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,540
Okay.

502
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,743
Why are you studying the
current of ions during electrolysis?

503
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,883
Uh, it's not the chemical
kind of transference,

504
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,325
it's the doctor-patient kind.

505
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,593
I'm dealing with a
personal situation.

506
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,961
I don't think the
Internet is very helpful

507
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,091
for solving personal situations.

508
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,096
True.

509
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,598
But I can't exactly ask
Claire for her advice,

510
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,435
and I barely know
Park. And Morgan...

511
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,168
Morgan would be bad.

512
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,271
Very bad.

513
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,611
I'm a person.

514
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,421
Yeah. No, no, yeah, of course,
Shaun, I'd, uh... I'd love your advice.

515
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,448
Okay.

516
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:57,423
Uh, so I think Celez, my burn
patient, has feelings for me,

517
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,699
and I may have
feelings for her, too.

518
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,071
But there's a good chance
her feelings aren't real,

519
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,370
and if they are real, then
they may not be permanent.

520
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,206
You know, it's kind of
textbook transference.

521
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,078
She's grateful, and
she's vulnerable.

522
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:24,613
And all I've ever known in
my life is unrequited love.

523
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,787
From Claire and from my parents.

524
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,932
And that makes
me vulnerable, too.

525
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,748
You should call in sick.

526
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,739
Uh...

527
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,250
Lea says calling in
sick is all you need

528
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,257
to gain superior
wisdom and knowledge.

529
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,348
She was right.

530
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,398
The CT showed no abnormalities,

531
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,636
and the reversal agents have
been repeated without effect.

532
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,306
So what else could it be?

533
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,574
Anoxic brain injury,

534
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,808
a complication of anesthesia.

535
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:30,011
Unfortunately, we believe
your daughter is brain-dead.

536
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,989
What?

537
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,898
All for a smile.

538
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,970
I made her think she wasn't
good enough the way she was.

539
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,914
I should have listened to you.

540
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,809
Yes.

541
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,979
There's just no predicting how
individuals will react to anesthesia.

542
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,415
Huh.

543
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,192
Park. You just walked
out on that man.

544
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,910
The last thing a grieving
family member needs

545
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,062
is to see their doctor tap out.

546
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,498
Maybe she's still
under anesthesia.

547
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,938
Succinylcholine. It's
one of the anesthetics

548
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,673
- Gretchen was administered.
- Yeah.

549
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,773
Now, what if she has a plasma
cholinesterase deficiency?

550
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,494
It'd mean her body couldn't
break down that specific drug.

551
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,885
Complete deficiency
is extremely rare.

552
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,685
I've never personally seen it,
and I don't know anyone who has.

553
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,088
Yeah, but if she does have
it, she's just gonna wake up.

554
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,597
Should I tell her father?

555
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,964
No, not yet. No way we're
letting him grieve twice.

556
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,309
Your labs are not improving.
Your organs are shutting down.

557
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,146
You're running out of time.

558
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,876
I'd like to stop
calling you Lucy.

559
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,271
You're welcome, Beatrice.

560
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,247
What are you doing?

561
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,914
Corneal reflex.

562
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,452
It's mediated by the nasociliary
branch of the ophthalmic branch.

563
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,625
What does it mean?

564
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,270
It means we were wrong.

565
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,370
She's gonna be just fine.

566
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,107
Thank you, Doctor.

567
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,672
Thank you.

568
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,144
Thank you. Oh.

569
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,484
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

570
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,325
Honey, you're gonna be
okay. You're gonna be just fine.

571
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,992
I was drawing a bath, and
I leaned over to turn it off,

572
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,559
and I dropped the pill bottle.

573
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,572
- And before I could fish it out...
- All the pills were ruined.

574
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,971
So you need a refill?

575
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,042
My pain has made me so clumsy.

576
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,736
Lucy, you're a liar

577
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,474
and a cheat and an addict.

578
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,281
We know about the
frequent prescriptions,

579
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,879
the multiple doctors, and
the ever-recurring shingles.

580
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,660
You have a serious
medical problem.

581
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,658
Let me help you.

582
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,268
- Three months?
- Hopefully.

583
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:13,210
But we might be able to
give you a pretty good idea

584
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,008
of what you're gonna look like.

585
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,345
Those things by your
ears are neuro-stimulators.

586
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:21,785
When we activate them,
instant smile. Sound good?

587
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,588
Dr. Murphy?

588
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,530
It's your mother's smile.

589
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,636
She seemed like a good template.

590
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:49,873
Hmm. There is no Duchenne
marker. Her smile is not real.

591
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,816
Thank you.

592
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,087
But all the other ones are.

593
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,258
All the other ones are.

594
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,225
I spoke with Jim Ransler,

595
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:14,634
who made it very clear that
we owe him big time for this.

596
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,569
Don't worry, Marcus.
I can handle him.

597
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,143
I'm very impressed.

598
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,309
It was all very
presidential of you.

599
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,417
You really went
above and beyond.

600
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,609
Yes, I did.

601
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,790
I thought I was saving her
life. Instead, I nearly ended it.

602
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,124
Celez, hi.

603
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,824
This is the
brilliant Dr. Murphy.

604
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,425
He'll be assuming
your care from here on,

605
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,833
though I don't expect
you'll need much.

606
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,367
I understand.

607
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,933
I don't think you do.

608
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,803
You see, doctors aren't
allowed to date their patients.

609
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,843
What are you doing tomorrow?

610
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,347
Uh, I'm calling in sick.

611
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,796
I think you may still
have some friends here.

612
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,304
Guess there is one
upside to all this.

613
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,383
If she hadn't bought the
stolen insurance card,

614
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,678
the real Lucy wouldn't
be in rehab right now.

615
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,856
You were surprisingly nice.

616
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,822
I told her what she
needed to hear to get help.

617
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,521
Trust me, I get it.

618
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,758
Too soft, people
take advantage of you.

619
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,333
But with your badass upbringing,
no one messes with you.

620
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,901
Upsides everywhere.

621
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,537
I mean, you have way
more street cred than, say,

622
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,876
someone whose mom's a
Johns Hopkins cardiologist,

623
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,311
whose dad is a pathologist,

624
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,940
and whose parents have been
happily married for 37 years.

625
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,222
Coming from
privilege, zero respect.

626
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,787
It must be really
hard to overcome.

627
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,796
- I'll call a code.
- No.

628
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,097
There's nothing left to save.

629
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,379
Time of death, 8:14 pm.

630
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,296
I'll notify her son.

631
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,608
<i>We're gonna show
you that we're tough</i>

632
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,476
<i>We're gonna show
you that we're tough</i>

633
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,248
<i>Y'all gonna stand</i>

634
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:21,816
<i>We'll get back up</i>

635
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,427
<i>Yeah, we're gonna
show you what we've got</i>

636
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,610
Oh, hey. Um...

637
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:49,579
My homies decided to pop by
and play some Texas Hold'em,

638
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,974
so I'm gonna have to take a
rain check on that pizza night.

639
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,589
You got a 70-inch
flat-screen, too.

640
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,391
Uh, no. I borrowed yours.

641
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,427
Makes no sense for us
both to have one, right?

642
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,867
Plus, my homies got to
watch <i>March Madness.</i>

643
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,464
- Okay.
- Oh. Um, sorry, <i>amigo.</i>

644
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,368
It's four-player Texas Hold'em.

645
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,277
I don't like poker anyway.

646
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,710
Hey, Shaun.

647
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,644
Look, you're a great guy, um,

648
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:24,782
but you got a few,
like, quirks, you know?

649
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:31,695
And that... It doesn't really
jive with this kind of face time.

650
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:34,971
You get what I'm saying, right?

651
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,067
I love you, man.

652
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,220
I once drove a
300SL... Thank you.

653
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,089
A 300SL Gullwing.

654
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,489
- On the road?
- No.

655
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,461
For 200 feet at the
Concours d'Elegance.

656
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,795
Oh, in Pebble Beach?
That's just as cool.

657
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,459
- The car show, you know it.
- Of course, yeah.

658
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,465
This year they're featuring a
Rollston coachwork display.

659
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,439
Including the Mercedes SS?

660
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,767
- I don't know.
- Ah.

661
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,270
But we should find out.

662
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,301
Wanna go?

663
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,139
I couldn't.

664
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,111
Yeah, no, I... Why?

665
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,815
No reason.

666
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,085
I just... I just thought that I
should make that my first response

667
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,216
before I accepted.

668
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,297
Can I get you anything else?

669
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,400
No, thank you. We'll
just take the doorstop.

670
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,270
I'm sorry. Um...

671
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,176
Well, you can
bring the doorstop.

672
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,242
Aaron?

673
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,577
Sorry. Um...

674
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,280
The thing...

675
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,217
The thing that tells
you how much to pay.

676
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,659
The doorstop.

677
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,263
Uh...

678
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,694
Could you call a...

679
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,314
- Can you call an ambulance, please?
- Mmm-hmm.

680
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,465
Thank you.
