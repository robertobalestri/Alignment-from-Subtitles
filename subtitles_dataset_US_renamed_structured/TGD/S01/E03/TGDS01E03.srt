00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,513
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:07,497
How hard can it be to just
act like a normal human being?

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,934
No!

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,875
Will you stop petting
that stupid rabbit?

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,572
We're never going home again. We
have each other, and that's all we need.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,681
Your fiancÃ© sure
can handle a knife.

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,453
He's got a serious deficit.

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,190
So, are you proud
or disappointed?

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,358
Marcus, stop making
everything so personal.

10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,073
You've wanted his job since day
one. Everyone in this room knows that.

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,156
How did you...

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,231
It's my department, it's
my job to know everything.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,065
Since I work for you, doesn't that
make all this actually your fault?

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,947
I'm sorry. I stopped
listening after "I work for you."

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,203
A surgeon needs to communicate.
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

16
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,385
Can he do that under stress?

17
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,868
Can he do that knowing that a
human life literally hangs in the balance?

18
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,865
So, I'm in the
middle of <i>Uncharted</i>

19
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,842
and I'm dead. Can I borrow
some triple-As? I'm your neighbor.

20
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,469
Hello.

21
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,605
Thirty-four.

22
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,647
I moved in last
week. Thirty-three.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,974
Yeah, I know.

24
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,217
I work at a hospital.

25
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,950
That's cool.

26
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,146
Yes.

27
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,157
Triple-As, <i>por favor?</i>

28
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:07,886
Batteries.

29
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,123
Right. Do you have any?

30
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,075
Triple-A batteries.

31
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,475
Thank you. Piece of
advice? Don't feed the cat.

32
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,974
What cat?

33
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,041
Feed it once, and it'll
never leave you alone.

34
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,486
Thank you for the
batteries, neighbor.

35
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,752
You're welcome.

37
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,262
<i>Environmental cardiac seven.</i>

38
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,940
Surgical. Well, you're in
luck, because I'm not a nurse,

39
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,239
I'm a surgical resident.
How can I help you?

40
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,388
We got a liver for Chuck.

41
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,823
- Where?
- SF Municipal Hospital.

42
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,903
And how long do we have,
body-to-body, on a liver transplant?

43
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,986
Eight hours.

44
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,792
You don't know the
longevity of a liver?

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,222
This is a teaching
hospital, and I'm the teacher.

46
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,432
You and Murphy,
you're on organ pick-up.

47
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,568
Check the health and bring
the liver back from SFM.

48
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,868
I was at Chuck's intake.
I'd really like to be...

49
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,979
Now you're gonna be at
the intake for his new liver.

50
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,582
Jared, get Chuck down
here and get him prepped.

51
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,330
We've got eight hours on this
thing and the clock starts ticking now.

52
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm not interrupting
your pregame, am I?

53
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,836
I think this is my 400th
breast reconstruction.

54
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,668
The board should
give me a plaque.

55
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,571
What's up?

56
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,910
Your 4:00 p.m. The
VIP. Wannamaker.

57
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,610
Yes. The free-flap. He's
checked into the penthouse suite,

58
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,243
resting comfortably, I'm sure.

59
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,153
I have been working on him
for a while now, and he's close.

60
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,856
He's real close to making
the Foundation his tax relief.

61
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,948
That's good to hear.

62
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,688
I want aces on this.
Everything perfect.

63
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,796
That's good to know. I
was gonna phone it in.

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,604
<i>Dr. Montego to the ICU.
Dr. Montego to the ICU, stat.</i>

65
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,902
Is this the chairman's
version of a pep talk?

66
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,705
I'm looking for a fail-safe
outcome on the procedure.

67
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,643
I want you to use
Dr. Melendez as your second.

68
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,343
That's your fail-safe? Melendez?
I'm your chief of surgery.

69
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,783
It's just a precaution. To
guarantee a perfect outcome.

70
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,084
Are you doubting my abilities?

71
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:54,219
Wannamaker is important.
Everything has to be perfect.

72
00:04:54,628 --> 00:05:00,363
You said that already. I'm
your fail-safe. The VIP'll be fine.

73
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,871
How you doing?

74
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,010
I know these sounds and
everything might be a lot for you.

75
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,339
It's hard for anyone.

76
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,706
I like helicopters.

77
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,813
I didn't know you'd
been on a helicopter.

78
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,911
I haven't.

79
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,572
Fifteen minutes to San
Francisco Municipal Hospital.

80
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,837
Should be a smooth ride.

81
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,529
<i>You do know what this is,
right? I'll tell you what it is,</i>

82
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,069
<i>it's scut work.</i>

83
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,699
<i>Jared gets the golden ticket
and we get pizza delivery.</i>

84
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,319
<i>The rotors just go round and
round, Shaun. They don't change.</i>

85
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,230
<i>How do I talk to you?</i>

86
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,409
So, Chuck, any chest
pain, shortness of breath?

87
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,536
No.

88
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,580
- Any alcohol in the last six months?
- No.

89
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,876
Just a quick pinch.

90
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,075
Any swelling in your limbs?

91
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,113
It's like Walmart on
Black Friday in here.

92
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,730
Things speed way up when
you're having a transplant.

93
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,985
I like it. It's good energy.

94
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,834
So that's a "no"
on the swelling?

95
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:09,523
No. I feel lousy all
the time, pretty much.

96
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,866
But I've got a second chance,
you know, with this liver?

97
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,959
Sure.

98
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:20,000
Excuse me. It's my daughter.
I already spoke to Mom.

99
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:24,769
And Uncle Tommy, too.
Yeah, I need to see your face.

100
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,181
All right. I love
you. All right.

101
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,553
She just graduated from law
school at Cal. I told you that.

102
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,585
No. Congratulations.

103
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,989
Must've told Dr. Browne,
then. Where is Dr. Browne?

104
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,914
Here's your liver. I'm
gonna need you to sign for it.

105
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,881
Standard operating
procedure is to leave the liver

106
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,305
in the safety of
the body cavity.

107
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,808
I'm aware of the procedure.
We had a John Doe at the top

108
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,640
of the registry, but that John
Doe died before we could plant.

109
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,704
- How long ago did you take it out?
- Three hours.

110
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,744
We just lost three hours.

111
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,823
Technically, three
hours and five minutes.

112
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,195
The true clock is on the cooler.

113
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,020
Can't go below 39 degrees,
or above 47 degrees.

114
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,549
You wanna sign for it?

115
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,425
Tissue looks healthy.

116
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,361
What are you doing?

117
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,031
What are you looking for?

118
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,900
- What's he doing?
- I'm not sure.

119
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,945
Shaun, what are you
looking for, masses? Cysts?

120
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,783
They're clean. Think
we'd miss a tumor?

121
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,555
There's nothing there.

122
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,225
I know. There's nothing there.

123
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,702
Okay, the liver needs to go back
into cold storage and we gotta go.

124
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,799
Then I'll release the vascular
clamp and let your blood

125
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,069
- perfuse the new donor liver.
- That's it?

126
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,475
Connect the bile ducts,
sew you up, and then we wait.

127
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,644
Huh. Does the new
one always take?

128
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,471
Over 70% of the time.

129
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,081
Well, I can live
with those odds.

130
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,920
You get some
rest. See you later.

131
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,266
He looks at something, I
don't know what he's looking at.

132
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,818
Is he... You know, is he curious? Is
he concerned? He won't answer me.

133
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,762
You're having trouble communicating
with him? It's a weekday,

134
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,925
it's Shaun... Let's see,
that seems about right.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,832
He seemed different
at the hospital.

136
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,312
You know, I could
kind of talk to him.

137
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,703
<i>Yeah, well, he knows what
to expect in the hospital.</i>

138
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,571
Outside, everything's different,
everything's new. New stimuli.

139
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,941
So, what do I do? I don't
know what he's thinking.

140
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,344
Claire, you're not gonna
figure out what he's thinking,

141
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,076
so don't even try. In fact, if
he's thinking about something

142
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,460
in his own mind,
just let him be.

143
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,612
I'd appreciate it if people
gave me the same courtesy.

144
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,211
I thought with your history...

145
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,881
<i>Claire, if you wanna
connect with him,</i>

146
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,084
you're gonna have to
figure out your own way in.

147
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,685
How's Chuck?

148
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,562
<i>Chuck? Chuck's fine. He's waiting
for a liver. So, come home, please.</i>

149
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,758
Okay.

150
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,272
- Doctor?
- What's up?

151
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,103
I just wanted to thank you.

152
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,699
But I haven't done anything yet.

153
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,803
You have. You've
given my dad hope.

154
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,796
You know, Chuck
was my first patient.

155
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,483
Six months ago, first
day at Saint Bonaventure,

156
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,584
I get a liver failure. One of
the nicest guys in the world.

157
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,891
I wanted to be the one
to give him the good news.

158
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,124
We're not leaving.

159
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,991
You said you liked helicopters.

160
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,366
We're not leaving.

161
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,663
We made it here safe.

162
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,071
Yes. We're not leaving.

163
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,573
We're not leaving.
Fog's rolling in too quick.

164
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,975
Does that mean
it rolls out quick?

165
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,347
Could be an hour, could
be three. Don't know.

166
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,015
Okay, uh... We're
gonna need a new ride.

167
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,161
Excuse me, I need an
ambulance to Saint Bonaventure.

168
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,788
Sorry, I just don't have the
EMS. I've got a pile-up on I80,

169
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,457
and four other
vehicles out on call.

170
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,899
Not one ambulance?

171
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,998
Let me be clear. This is
emergent. It's time-sensitive.

172
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,098
Honey, this ain't Hertz.

173
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,006
What about a police escort?

174
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,884
That can be arranged.

175
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,651
Of course. Why didn't you?

176
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,523
Don't wanna
ruin the festivities,

177
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,592
but if I could just get a few
minutes with my patient alone.

178
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:46,130
Mr. Wannamaker. Dr. Andrews.

179
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,902
How we doing today?

180
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,267
Incomplete.

181
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,610
Let's see what we can
do about that. Look here.

182
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,651
Well, looking not too bad,
considering we cut out a tumor

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,881
less than two weeks ago.

184
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,789
Yeah, I've been walking
around with a hole in my mouth.

185
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,893
You ever drink Scotch with a hole in
your mouth? Waste of good Scotch.

186
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,796
We needed to
give it time to heal.

187
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,592
Yeah, yeah, you told me.

188
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,797
Have you continued to smoke?

189
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,131
It constricts the vessels,
slows the healing.

190
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm not a quitter.

191
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,947
We are going to graft
some skin from your leg,

192
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,478
and fix that cheek
up better than new.

193
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,249
I'm a real estate guy.
There's an old saying,

194
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,835
"You can have it fast,
you can have it good,

195
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,987
"you can have it
cheap. Pick two."

196
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,224
It's not gonna be cheap.

197
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, I like doctors like
you. You're good. You know it.

198
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,475
Yes. It was harvested
before we got there.

199
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,272
We're waiting
for transportation.

200
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,479
The itinerary and life
clock have changed.

201
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,213
- Yeah, four hours and 14 minutes.
- Excuse me.

202
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,108
Are you talking to the hospital?

203
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,478
Have someone tell Dr. Glassman
that I might be late for our lunch.

204
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,616
Yeah. Okay.

205
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,012
So, how'd you know
about the weather?

206
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,366
Is it some kind of gift?

207
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,539
Come on, I gotta know.

208
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,572
What, Shaun Murphy is Zeus?

209
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,143
I watch The Weather Channel.

210
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,242
You my doctors?

211
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,418
Shaun? Shaun, we gotta go.

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,771
You're home.

213
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,677
Your dad and mom have had a
tough night with your brother and all.

214
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,375
Come on, let's go.

215
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,545
No.

216
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,556
No. No. He... He promised me!

217
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:24,629
He promised. He promised me!
He promised me! He promised me!

218
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,039
I think we'll get there much
quicker if we drive, Shaun.

219
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,147
Could you turn off
the flashers, please?

220
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,992
What's the patient's name?

221
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,025
- I told you, it's Chuck.
- No.

222
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,589
- No?
- No, the, the donor. What's his name?

223
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:06,398
What, the liver? Oliver?

224
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,635
Oliver.

225
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,246
Hey, you got a second?

226
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,515
What's up?

227
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,350
Just waiting on the liver.

228
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,823
Transplant. Everyone wants in.

229
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,120
They'd trade their
liver to do the liver.

230
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,364
Hey, look, you, you want some help
on this free-flap... What's his name?

231
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,093
- Wannamaker.
- Right.

232
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,638
You got the transplant, that
should keep any attending busy.

233
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,697
Well, I can make time.

234
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,674
Aoki come to you about this?

235
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,253
Look, I get it,
you're the chief...

236
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,404
That's right.

237
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,741
Look, this isn't a coup.

238
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,008
What is it?

239
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,241
It's about making
sure this hospital is first

240
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,717
on Wannamaker's donation list.

241
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,048
I'm aware of the stakes.
Thanks for coming by.

242
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,768
You know, it doesn't make
you any less of a surgeon

243
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,103
having me in there
as your second.

244
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,652
I'm the chief,
you're my attending.

245
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,221
Can't argue with that.

246
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,857
And we both know what your
presence in my OR will say.

247
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,259
That's not my intention.

248
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:13,136
It's the impact. Intention doesn't
matter. Thanks, but I'm good.

249
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,882
These can't be right.

250
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,521
Whatever it is, it's right.

251
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,925
Chuck's labs. It's got to be
a false flag, or a bad reading.

252
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,725
- For what?
- Medications? Foods? I don't know.

253
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,041
Look, if this is right,
we lose our transplant.

254
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,204
I'm sorry, that doesn't
change the results.

255
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,335
There's alcohol in his system.

256
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,541
He drank. The blood doesn't lie.

257
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,011
Run the lab again.

258
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,483
ETA to Saint Bonaventure?

259
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,785
Seventy minutes.

260
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,528
What are you looking
for? What do you see?

261
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,863
I have a girl neighbor.

262
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,434
Okay. Is she nice?

263
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,375
What does she do? Does
she have a boyfriend?

264
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,943
Do you know her name?

265
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,818
What the hell are you
looking for on the scans?

266
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,763
What... The
temperature is going up.

267
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,294
Officer, we need to find
a place with ice, like, now.

268
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,439
I tested it, Chuck,
and re-tested it.

269
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,436
Talk to me. You know
the six-month rule.

270
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,706
- Was it a craving, or...
- It was three days ago.

271
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,416
My daughter's graduation.

272
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,926
Nobody in my family
had ever gone to college.

273
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,524
There she was,

274
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,959
my little girl,

275
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,531
wearing the robes...

276
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,300
And for just that day, I...

277
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,632
I wanted to be normal.

278
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,681
So I had a glass of champagne.

279
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,584
You're out of ice?

280
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,924
It's broken. Supermarket's
about three miles down.

281
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:53,365
We don't have time. Right, okay.

282
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,771
The temperature's
already at 47 degrees.

283
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,401
We can't let it go any higher.

284
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,542
Are you gonna help me?

285
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,514
It's sweet. You'll like it.

286
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,214
What should I do with him?

287
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,901
Child Services are
down in Cheyenne.

288
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,934
That's 150 miles,

289
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,527
and they'll just turn me around
and send me back to the parents.

290
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,402
Parents don't want him?

291
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,813
I don't know. He
doesn't seem to want

292
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,077
the parents, that's for sure.

293
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,014
Could take him to the
hospital. Social worker there.

294
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,020
That won't work.

295
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,521
How do you know? Shaun?

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,466
You're right, it's
not working. Why?

297
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,134
Shaun! Are you
even listening to me?

298
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,231
Just one drink?

299
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,712
That's what he said.
Should I inform the registry?

300
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,167
How long ago did
Chuck have the drink?

301
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,708
Three days ago.

302
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,910
Give me a marker.

303
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:32,764
Units. Estimated
blood alcohol content...

304
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,001
What type of alcohol?

305
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,332
Champagne.

306
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,981
What percentage
of alcohol is that?

307
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,005
- I don't know. What's the difference?
- Take out your phone and look it up.

308
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,173
I don't know why
it's not working.

309
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,175
It needs to be
submerged to cool.

310
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,228
Hey! Every five
seconds is an XL.

311
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,929
Why did you answer me
last time? But not before?

312
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,136
Was it because I was angry?

313
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,507
Was it random? Why can't
you answer my questions?

314
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,109
This better work.

315
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,277
It will work.

316
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,784
You answer when I don't ask.

317
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,224
You don't like questions.

318
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,723
I don't.

319
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,137
I didn't do well in calculus.

320
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,465
This is algebra.

321
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,465
With his severe cirrhosis,

322
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,373
his alcohol clearance rate is
one milligram per deciliter per hour.

323
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,074
One drink, say, eight ounces...

324
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,642
It's champagne.
Six ounces, tops.

325
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,484
Play conservative.
Eight ounces results in

326
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:07,220
a blood alcohol level of
39 milligrams per deciliter.

327
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,018
One standard drink.

328
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,458
Well, the purpose of abstinence,

329
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,831
at least according to
the transplant registry, is?

330
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,879
Patients who kill their liver
due to excessive drinking

331
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,235
prove they can be sober.

332
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:24,837
Let me see that report.
Zero-point-zero-two.

333
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,110
Chuck was telling the truth.
He did just have the one drink.

334
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,411
He didn't fall off the wagon.

335
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,012
Corporate loves its data.
I'm not sure it'll actually

336
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,955
make a difference, but it
does give us an argument.

337
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,021
You're a genius.

338
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,297
You don't like
the cafeteria food?

339
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,409
They only make one thing well.

340
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,255
What does it say when the staff
sees the president of the hospital

341
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,907
not eating their cafeteria food?

342
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,507
Well, it says the
president of the hospital

343
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,949
isn't allowed in the kitchen.

344
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,778
You sat down. What
can I do for you?

345
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,014
I'd like your advice.

346
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,753
Really? Where's
Aoki? Did she die?

347
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,088
This was a mistake.

348
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,230
That's insulting. Sit down. At
least hear what I have to say,

349
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:22,063
and then decide
it's bad advice. Sit.

350
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,333
Aoki is pushing Melendez
on me for the VIP.

351
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,408
Ah. You didn't get the email
blast. Rich people aren't allowed

352
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,842
to die in this hospital.

353
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,676
You're not the young
star anymore, Melendez is.

354
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:35,906
I know that.

355
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,574
And you're upset
about the "why"?

356
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,010
"Why does Aoki think that?"
You should be asking, "Who?"

357
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,180
"Who?" I know who. Melendez.

358
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,953
"Who" are you? Are you a chief
who wants to be top surgeon,

359
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,052
or are you a chief who
wants to be president?

360
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,359
Because if it's the
latter, take your ego,

361
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,832
shove it in a cupboard somewhere,
and start acting presidential.

362
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,664
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a
visitor in the main lobby.</i>

363
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,536
<i>Dr. Kravitz, a visitor
in the main lobby.</i>

364
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,356
Dr. Melendez is going to argue
to the board that you get this liver.

365
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,939
I think it's a pretty
good argument.

366
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,541
Do I deserve it?

367
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,283
Um, I'm not sure
that's relevant.

368
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,023
You know, when you're dying,

369
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,195
and I've been
dying for a long time,

370
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,401
you start to think
about your life.

371
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,797
I haven't led a great one.

372
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,502
I could have been a
better dad, a better man.

373
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,846
Newsflash.

374
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,015
I drank too much.

375
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,586
You know, I also have a son.

376
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,515
Yeah. First marriage.

377
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,156
I haven't seen
him in three years.

378
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,093
Getting a liver's not
a second chance.

379
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,531
And it's not a reward
for being perfect.

380
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,725
It's just what we can do.

381
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:11,438
Maybe. But on the registry,
all of us wait in line together.

382
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,107
And I see these...

383
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,683
These people here, waiting.

384
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:25,519
I know their faces,
even their names.

385
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,355
They all have stories.

386
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,396
We're in it together.

387
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,226
And I...

388
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,237
I broke the...

389
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,170
Chuck? Chuck! Chuck!

390
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,210
Code blue! Chuck,
can you hear me?

391
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,314
We're in.

392
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,388
Yeah, he's got blood
in his esophagus.

393
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,822
He's got a variceal bleed.

394
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,731
All right. Saline wide open.
Type and cross four units.

395
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,328
I'm gonna band the vein.

396
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,341
Pressure's coming up.

397
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,946
- Chuck had a variceal bleed.
- I was in there.

398
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,247
Portal hypertension,
decompensated...

399
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,208
Are you finished? He's got
three months to live, maybe.

400
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,278
You have to be six months alcohol
free before you're registry-eligible.

401
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,473
And you said you
weren't good at math.

402
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,678
He gets this one or he dies.

403
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,157
Do you know what this
thing looks like at 8:00 a.m.?

404
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,724
I need a police escort
to work every morning.

405
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,566
280 South. Where all roads meet.

406
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,999
No, they don't.

407
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,493
What's wrong with him?

408
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,246
He's autistic, Officer.

409
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:40,493
What's that mean? Does
he need to be in a hospital?

410
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,087
The last place he
should be is a hospital.

411
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,287
What are you doing? Shaun?

412
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,182
What are you thinking?

413
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,096
Okay, this isn't a
question, I just...

414
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,526
I don't know what
you're looking for, Shaun.

415
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,729
Yes. I can feel it, it's firmer.

416
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,972
And? I don't know
what that means.

417
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,409
There must be a clot.
But there isn't a clot,

418
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,910
the scans show no clot.

419
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,420
That's because the scans were
taken before they harvested the liver.

420
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,222
Prior to the liver being flushed
with UW solution. It's dying.

421
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,381
To preserve the liver,
they replace all its blood

422
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,141
with a solution to protect
it from the cold storage.

423
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,210
But they must have left some
blood behind, which clotted.

424
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,760
- How long to Saint Bonaventure?
- Less than 30 minutes.

425
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,431
Can't wait. We have to
immediately remove the clot

426
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,838
and flush the left lobe to
protect it from the ice bath.

427
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,672
- Hey, we need to stop the car.
- Here?

428
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,144
Yes. Yes. We need to
operate, right here, right now.

429
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,693
Flushes from the
right. So, the left lobe,

430
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,596
starting at the
middle hepatic vein.

431
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,636
A less intrusive cut would
be along the falciform ligament

432
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,432
to allow access to Segment 3.

433
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,785
When you locate the blockage,
I'm gonna have to remove it.

434
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,031
I need a straw to
cannulate the vein, please.

435
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,532
There's a straw in my cup.

436
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,739
UW solution will
stabilize the cell walls...

437
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,683
And preserve the
integrity of the organ.

438
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,560
This is better than
having a baby in my car.

439
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,200
How are you feeling?

440
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,839
Like I'm writing a blank check.

441
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,108
You're gonna be fine.

442
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,178
You're the best.

443
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,852
This bleed, these varices...
This isn't good news.

444
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:05,230
It tells us that your liver failure
has progressed considerably.

445
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:07,524
How much?

446
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,565
You have two to three months.

447
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,297
We're getting the liver
today, in an hour. I don't get it.

448
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,300
You didn't tell them?

449
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,434
What?

450
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,604
Your father had a drink.

451
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,404
He had one glass.

452
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,416
Transplant registry doesn't
quantify things like that.

453
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,913
So he doesn't get the liver?

454
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,420
I'm gonna try
and get it for him.

455
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,484
What are you, a car salesman?
What, are you gonna try?

456
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,321
The final decision
is out of my hands.

457
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,323
And if you fail?

458
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,634
I'm gonna do
everything that I can.

459
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,896
I am meeting with the
committee in 10 minutes.

460
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,465
Excuse me.

461
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,178
I handed my dad the drink.

462
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,852
It doesn't matter
how it happened.

463
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,751
He didn't want it, he just
wanted to make me happy.

464
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,851
If you let him die, I will
have killed my father.

465
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,616
It was a glass. A glass of champagne
at his daughter's graduation.

466
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,622
I have the labs to prove it.
Chuck didn't fall off the wagon,

467
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,252
he had one drink.
He never went back.

468
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,992
The transplant registry guidelines
don't play in the gray for a reason.

469
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,625
Those guidelines are so arbitrary.
Have one drink and you die.

470
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,602
A couple pills of
ecstasy, no problem.

471
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,437
Hepatitis B from careless sexual
practice, no, nothing at all about that.

472
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,452
So, what do you want us
to do? Throw out the rules?

473
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,072
I want us not to hide behind
them. We do have a responsibility.

474
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,281
Without the rules, we're
playing God. We need the rules.

475
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,977
Does that help you
sleep better at night?

476
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:10,352
Yes, it does. We
have one liver today,

477
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,591
and 800 people
in this state need it.

478
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,559
I don't wanna be
haunted by the other 799.

479
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:18,724
Your guy hasn't earned it.
He knew the rules. And this...

480
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,424
It's a technicality.

481
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,059
No, the drink is a technicality.

482
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,928
Jessica, what's the
legal burden here?

483
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,030
Significant. If we move
forward with this transplant,

484
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,541
we could lose
privileges on the registry.

485
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,736
If it was discovered.

486
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,607
"If it were discovered"? How
narrow can you be about this?

487
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,178
Dr. Glassman,
where are you on this?

488
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,384
I can make a good
argument either way.

489
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,612
Go ahead. Please.

490
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,030
Better to remove the
arguments altogether.

491
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,989
What the hell is
he talking about?

492
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,458
The hell I'm talking about is that
we have a patient in this hospital

493
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,654
who needs a liver.

494
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,391
We also just happen to have
a liver that needs a patient.

495
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,523
It's not that simple.

496
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,467
It is that simple, if you consider
the patient. Rules are secondary.

497
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:02,165
But is saving this
patient worth the risk

498
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,266
of not being able to
save hundreds of others?

499
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,306
I don't have hundreds of
patients right now, I have one.

500
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,711
His name is Chuck.

501
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,080
Blood pressure steady.

502
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,418
Donor vessel to the facial artery,
and we're ready to close him up.

503
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,890
10-0 polypropylene
and vascular forceps.

504
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,119
Nice work, Dr. Andrews.

505
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,290
What do we have here?

506
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,260
A hematoma?

507
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,235
I can see that.
Let's find its source.

508
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,966
- Sponge, stick, and probe.
- Sponge, stick, and probe.

509
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,887
It's not my recipient artery.

510
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,607
Heart rate is dropping.
Whatever it is,

511
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,012
it's compressing his carotid.

512
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,312
I can't get deep enough
here. I need better access.

513
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,918
We'll move through zone
three from the outside.

514
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,080
Zone three's a minefield.

515
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,019
I'm aware, but
we need to do this.

516
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,923
Whatever you're
gonna do, do it quick.

517
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,689
It's strangling him
from the inside.

518
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,598
Get me Melendez.

519
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,268
We made it. Yeah. We're
here. Downstairs. Coming up.

520
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,922
No, no, no, no. Jared,
you're not gonna believe.

521
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,113
What... Yeah...

522
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,812
Got it.

523
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,054
Um...

524
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,231
Chuck's been moved
to the bottom of the list.

525
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,362
San Jose Presbyterian
are coming to get the liver.

526
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,773
- Oxygen sats tanking.
- Up him to 100% O2.

527
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,658
You have to go through
the mandible from the inside

528
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,562
while I probe for the
source. It's the only way.

529
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,512
Loupes.

530
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,712
We have to be
careful in there...

531
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,651
Or he'll get a stroke.

532
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,883
We'll just have
to be careful, then.

533
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,254
Give Dr. Melendez a
mandibular channel retractor

534
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,593
and Number 5 bone-cutter.

535
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,785
Number 5 bone-cutter.

536
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,082
Twenty-nine
minutes. It's a lifetime.

537
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,276
Thank you. This is amazing.
Gotta go, the whole team is waiting.

538
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:29,948
His name is Oliver.

539
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,430
It was a good day.

540
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,904
We saved a life...

541
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,973
Just not Chuck's.

542
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,663
<i>You can still see
where the water was</i>

543
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,835
<i>In a line at the top
Of the chimney bricks</i>

544
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,471
It's not your fault.

545
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,601
I want to believe that.

546
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:33,482
<i>So we saved a few
things That were spared</i>

547
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,385
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,854
<i>And brought it to the ground</i>

549
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:45,997
<i>'Cause you always build it
better The second time around</i>

550
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,382
Hi.

551
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:15,918
Hello.

552
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,628
Are you a lab guy or something?

553
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,494
- I'm a surgeon.
- That's insane.

554
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,056
May I have my batteries back?

555
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,563
The ones you borrowed.

556
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,596
Yep.

557
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,677
<i>You can still see

558
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,412
There you go.

559
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:40,407
<i>In a line at the top
Of the chimney bricks</i>

560
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,079
What's your name?

561
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:43,914
I'm Lea.

562
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,250
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
Nice to meet you.

563
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,628
<i>So we saved a few
things That were spared</i>

564
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,469
<i>And brought it to the ground</i>

565
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:08,076
<i>Cause you always build it
better The second time around</i>

566
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,436
<i>I drove past the place
Where we used to live</i>

567
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,974
<i>Where you said you
never wanted kids</i>

568
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:48,582
<i>Sometimes, something so
broken Can never be fixed</i>

569
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,675
You'll stay with me tonight.

570
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,881
And tomorrow, we'll
figure out the rest.

571
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:42,303
<i>You always build it better</i>

572
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:47,668
<i>You always build it better</i>

573
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:54,186
<i>You always build it better
The second time around</i>

574
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:04,092
<i>You always build it better
The second time around</i>

575
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,360
<i>You always build it better</i>

576
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:13,935
<i>You always build it better
The second time around</i>
