1
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,414
So, who was that?

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,039
A housekeeper.

3
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,209
Leaving your place
at 7:00 in the morning?

4
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,650
I was interviewing her.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,916
You're hiring a housekeeper
for a studio apartment?

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,321
I'm not hiring her. Her
clothes don't match.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,715
Right.

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,722
You're such an
ass-hat, Shaun Murphy.

9
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,937
Today, we realize
a dream, seeing our

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,241
international humanitarian
program come to fruition.

11
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,578
Our cardiothoracic
surgeon Dr. Neil Melendez,

12
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:54,053
in consultation with our head
cardiologist Dr. Avi Mehta,

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,352
evaluated children from
Tanzania, to Malawi, to Guinea.

14
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,361
They screened over 100
candidates, each of them needing

15
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,589
life-saving surgeries.

16
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,925
Ultimately, we decided on

17
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,728
a particularly inspiring
young boy named Gabriel,

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,360
who hails from the
Democratic Republic of Congo,

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,732
with severe congenital
heart anomalies.

20
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,038
We identified three
perfect candidates,

21
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,269
children I can actually help.

22
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,404
Gabriel wasn't one of them.

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,537
Yes and no.

24
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,873
I signed off on your choices.

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,874
But I wouldn't have
necessarily eliminated Gabriel

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,077
based on the echo I saw.

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,881
A non-surgeon
undermining a surgeon on his

28
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,421
selection of
surgical candidates?

29
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,486
It's healthy when colleagues
challenge each other's decisions.

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,093
It doesn't make any sense.
We gave you good candidates.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,441
You're not a doctor, why
wouldn't you stick with the list?

32
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,760
There were several intangibles.

33
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,429
Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,330
One of those intangibles,
I'm guessing, is cuteness.

35
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,779
Family displaced during the war.

36
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,466
Mother took care of her husband
until he died of yellow fever.

37
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,822
He bled out at home.

38
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,321
A month later Gabriel was born.

39
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,629
People tend to give more
when the cause is not only noble,

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,759
but photogenic.

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,763
Adorable kids and sympathetic
moms may work on donors,

42
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,783
but they won't work on me, and they
certainly won't work on echo results.

43
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,934
Kinda working on me.

44
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,045
Before you say no, at
least do your own work-up.

45
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,152
<i>Mommy, why can't I come?</i>

46
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,692
The hospital's worried
that children bring in germs.

47
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,793
<i>I won't, Mommy, I promise.</i>

48
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,228
Oh, Boo. It's just the rules.

49
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,158
Okay, baby, I have to go now.

50
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,143
Do what Aunt Maggie
says. I'll call you later, okay?

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,863
I love you to the moon.

52
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,130
<i>And back.</i>

53
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,910
Can't imagine voice rest could
be very easy with a 3-year-old.

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,008
Yeah. Not very effective for
my podcast audience either.

55
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,136
Of which, by the
way, I'm a huge fan.

56
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,174
Grim irony though, right? A
podcaster who loses her voice?

57
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,175
Elizabeth, I'm sure the
nodule will be benign,

58
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,629
and this'll be nothing
more than inspiration

59
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,746
for another great episode.

60
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,712
And if it's not benign, Isabel?

61
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,168
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Today we're just focused on removing

62
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,524
the nodule and doing the biopsy.

63
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,004
And you've done
everything you could do.

64
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,205
And when the hoarseness started,

65
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,754
you sought early
care from the best.

66
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,944
And I sent you to the best.

67
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,028
You work perfectly together,
kind of ping-and-pong-ish.

68
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,504
It's nice. A lot of doctors who are
married are more like Miss and Match.

69
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,339
Mrs. Bangura, this is
Dr. Murphy and Dr. Kalu.

70
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,438
They're gonna help me
run some tests on Gabriel.

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,927
I heard that you and Gabriel have
never been away from home before.

72
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,829
I was hoping that these
would make him feel welcome.

73
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,345
Yes. You are kind.

74
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,437
I brought one for myself, too.

75
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,396
Hey, how about we
all do some medicine?

76
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,203
He really needs our help.

77
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,279
"He needs our help"?

78
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,731
He sounds like he's got
a blow-dryer in his chest.

79
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,587
Exactly. Which is
why he needs our help.

80
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,101
This is the problem
with cardiologists.

81
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,269
You're really good at telling
people when something's broken,

82
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,971
not so good at knowing
when they can't be fixed.

83
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,639
If that kid is dying, I'm not
gonna tell his mother that

84
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,063
unless I'm damn sure.

85
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,156
You heard that heart.

86
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,462
I heard that heart, and
it sounded like crap.

87
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,564
But until we do a
transesophageal echo,

88
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,832
I don't know anything.

89
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
Do a transesophageal echo.

90
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,075
She has a master's degree in
sociology, impeccable credentials,

91
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,816
excellent references. And
you turned her away because

92
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,450
her clothes didn't match?

93
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,619
It's relevant. If a life
skills coach can't select

94
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,322
a complementing
wardrobe, they lack life skills.

95
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,331
But she's not gonna pick out your
clothes for you. She's not a nanny.

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,860
She's there to help you
with problem-solving,

97
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,630
financial, social interaction...

98
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,002
You're doing this
because I did not react well

99
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,098
to a man with a gun
robbing a store I was in.

100
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,642
Statistically, that is very unlikely
to ever happen to me again.

101
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,376
Social interactions will happen
again, and again, and again.

102
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,314
Statistically irrefutable.

103
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,962
Now, if you learn how to get
along with people a little bit better,

104
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,148
you'll have a fuller
life. A happier life.

105
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,382
If you don't like this woman,
we'll find somebody else.

106
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,815
I am happy.

107
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,793
- You could be happier.
- I don't think so.

108
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,467
My neighbor, Lea. If she were
ever in a fire, she'd be rescued first.

109
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,558
Why's that?

110
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,868
Dr. Melendez says attractive
people have advantages.

111
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,703
Dr. Melendez says that, does he?

112
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,901
Why is that funny?

113
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:48,005
I don't know. It's just some people
consider Dr. Melendez attractive.

114
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,875
So, how's it going with Lea?

115
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,843
She doesn't like me.

116
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,380
Why do you say that?

117
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,920
She said I was an ass-hat.

118
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,226
Yeah? What was she
doing when she said that?

119
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,487
Touching me.

120
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,996
She was flirting with you.

121
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,065
Sometimes people say the
opposite of what they mean.

122
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,861
They use teasing as a way of
saying something they don't mean,

123
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,770
instead of saying
something that they do.

124
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,008
I haven't seen any data on the use
of antonyms as a flirting technique.

125
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,907
Okay. Well, um,
here's what to look for.

126
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,405
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

127
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,283
Okay. The pretentious giggle.

128
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,055
The squirm.

129
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,887
And the hair sweep. I
call it the flirting trifecta.

130
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,518
Hair scuffing is used in both
animals and humans, Claire.

131
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,361
Secreting glands are
located in the scalp and fur.

132
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,867
Scuffing sends hormones
out into the environment

133
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,815
to let a potential mate
know they're interested.

134
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,303
Or it could be ringworm.

135
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,475
Yeah, I suppose you have
to factor for that possibility.

136
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,540
Nice touch.

137
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,914
Beauty increases happiness.
Happiness improves outlook.

138
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,247
Still on mission Carpe Diem?

139
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,617
You might wanna try it.

140
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,813
I'm doing fine.

141
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,199
We're having dinner at the sink.

142
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,954
No, we're enjoying dinner at
the sink. Although if you keep

143
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,819
talking like that...

144
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,261
Andrews. Well, look
again. It has to be there.

145
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,661
Yeah. Okay.

146
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,731
Who was that?

147
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,774
The lab. They misplaced
Elizabeth's specimen.

148
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,901
Oh, my God.

149
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,137
Don't worry, they'll find it.

150
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,170
Satisfied?

151
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,338
It's somewhere.

152
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,442
Somewhere else. I love how everyone
in surgery is so fast to blame the lab.

153
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,112
Well, double-checking
can't hurt.

154
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,452
Actually, it can. Because you
are here when you should be

155
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,616
double-checking surgery.

156
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,024
I saw the specimen
go in the container.

157
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,458
It means it has to be here.

158
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,862
No, all that means is that it was
put in a container. It doesn't mean that

159
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,677
that container was actually put
in the surgery refrigerator, or that it

160
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,431
was actually picked
up by the courier.

161
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,298
He's even worse than we thought.

162
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,875
Yeah. Hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defect,

163
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,443
abnormal insertion of
the mitral valve leaflet.

164
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,680
I've never seen so many
anomalies in one heart.

165
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,786
I'm sorry I pushed
for additional testing.

166
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,779
That only got his
mother's hopes up.

167
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,520
Any medication that'll help?

168
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,793
Beta-blockers. Maybe metoprolol.

169
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,674
It's not like they'll get
him playing soccer,

170
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,690
but they might help him
get to the field to watch.

171
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,802
For a couple of years, anyway.

172
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:28,070
It's better than dying on the
table tomorrow. You tell Aoki.

173
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,212
I'll break it to the mom.

174
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,561
It's called <i>sakara</i>,
given by our shaman.

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,931
It's his heartbeat.

176
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,744
It follows the sound.

177
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,604
Reminds it to
beat until you fix it.

178
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,277
Mrs. Bangura, I've
completed all the tests.

179
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,183
And I'm sorry that
you've come this way.

180
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,850
When Gabriel was in my
belly, evil spirits came to him.

181
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,258
Invade his heart.

182
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,556
Our village shaman
tried to rid them.

183
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,792
He could not.

184
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,197
Then a vision came to him.

185
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,533
A stronger healer would come.

186
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,568
You.

187
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,407
You will save Gabriel.

188
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,550
I don't know about evil spirits.

189
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,924
All I know is that your son was
born with a heart that I can't fix.

190
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,115
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,252
Would not have come
so far if I did not believe.

192
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,280
We'll give him medicine
to make him feel better,

193
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,043
and then you can take him home.

194
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,820
We tell her we're sorry, we
have no news yet, and then...

195
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,762
Nope. Can't say that,
it's an expensive word.

196
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,856
Sorry?

197
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,868
You can act sorry,
you can feel sorry.

198
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,632
In fact, you should feel
sorry, you just can't say it.

199
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,607
Okay. I feel bad for you because
we made a mistake. And...

200
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,698
Nope.

201
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,038
A mistake isn't a mistake?

202
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,943
Well, it's an unanticipated
outcome of an expected action.

203
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,313
You can't use language that
implies blameworthy conduct.

204
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,453
But if we did lose the specimen,
isn't it actually a mistake,

205
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,819
and aren't we sorry, and
aren't we blame worthy?

206
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,321
Yes. Doesn't mean we can
make it any easier for her attorney.

207
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:05,857
Hello, Elizabeth. I'm Jessica Preston
from Risk Management. How are you?

208
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,305
I don't like the sound of that.

209
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,393
I know, I really
need a new job title.

210
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,397
It seems that we've encountered
an unexpected occurrence.

211
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,199
The laboratory has been unable
to locate your tissue specimen.

212
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,640
We don't want you to
be unnecessarily alarmed,

213
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,145
but we want you to be fully
aware of what's going on.

214
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,377
But how will I know if I have
cancer if you don't find it?

215
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,080
We are looking everywhere.

216
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,479
We will find it. As
long as it's in formalin

217
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,353
or a refrigerator,
everything will be fine.

218
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,514
For how long?

219
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,753
At least 24 hours,
maybe even 36.

220
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,560
Well, then you better find it.

221
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,478
Because I will be damned if I'm
gonna have my voice-box removed just

222
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,697
because somebody screwed up.

223
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,870
I've implemented a
proactive educational plan.

224
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,577
Well, that's terrific, Shaun.

225
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,280
Why are we talking
about that here?

226
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,513
I'm not stupid.

227
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,600
I didn't say you were stupid,
Shaun. Nobody said you were stupid.

228
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,890
But sometimes you lack common
sense. I'm so sorry to bother you...

229
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,452
This patient is deaf.

230
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,525
Oh.

231
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,139
I started flirting
lessons yesterday.

232
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,037
"Flirting lessons"? Wish they
had that when I was young.

233
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,975
Yes. I learned about
the flirting trifecta.

234
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,140
There's the
pretentious giggle...

235
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,489
Shaun, what are you getting at?

236
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:36,986
Flirting, it requires primarily
non-verbal interactions.

237
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,988
Being perceptive in one
social dimension translates well

238
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,652
to other social skills.

239
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,823
You're studying flirting?
Are you lonely, Shaun?

240
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,801
'Cause, you know, there are
websites now where you can...

241
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,268
I like being alone.

242
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,801
Yeah, well, being alone and
being lonely are two different things.

243
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,275
Sometimes we're lonely
and we don't even know it.

244
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,344
How would I know it?

245
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,917
Well, uh, loneliness,
it's kind of a dull...

246
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,150
It's like a dark...

247
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,349
Are you lonely?

248
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:20,097
Yeah, sometimes. You
know, sometimes, very much.

249
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,704
You should learn the trifecta.

250
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,441
Hey. Hey. We're looking for a
lost specimen that I am positive

251
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,540
left the OR.

252
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,194
And I'm positive it
didn't make it to the lab.

253
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,796
And since you're the
link between the two,

254
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,654
we wanted to ask you about
your 3:00 run yesterday.

255
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,818
So, you took everything that
was in the refrigerator in the OR.

256
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,653
In the refrigerator,
out of the refrigerator,

257
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,872
everything that's
meant to go, I took.

258
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,023
Did you stop on the way?

259
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,328
No. Straight from surgery to
the lab, just like the rules say.

260
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,835
Well, did you stop at the
restroom? Or the coffee machine?

261
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:57,962
The cafeteria?

262
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,149
Yeah, believe it or not, I can go a
whole 30 minutes without stopping

263
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,334
for a cream puff.

264
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,004
We're just desperate. All
we care about is the specimen

265
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,807
and avoiding a
full-on investigation.

266
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:07,805
Investigation?

267
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,880
Yeah. Yeah. If we don't find it, then
the legal department gets involved.

268
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,331
Everyone who was
in contact with it,

269
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,153
who might have
been in contact with it,

270
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,818
goes under a magnifying
glass. I'm not looking forward to it.

271
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,071
You looking forward to it?
She's not looking forward to it.

272
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,672
They're gonna check your
social media, your computer...

273
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,720
Blood tests.

274
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,026
Blood tests.

275
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,897
But if you find
it before then...

276
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,436
Then life goes on,
same as it always has.

277
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,374
I did stop at the cafeteria.

278
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:40,277
The cashier is smokin'. I might
have been distracted for a little while.

279
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,414
Okay. Thanks.

280
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,420
Water.

281
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,496
Always more water.

282
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,226
Even more.

283
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,502
I know it's scary.

284
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,570
You are good with children.

285
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,242
You are father?

286
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,513
No. One day, I hope.

287
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,257
Page rapid-response team, stat.

288
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,315
The meds should've improved
his arrhythmia, not made it worse.

289
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,426
Maybe in addition
to his other problems

290
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,645
he's developed endocarditis.

291
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:30,850
His echo didn't reveal vegetations
on his valves or endocardium.

292
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,789
He has not developed a fever.

293
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,796
Let's be sure. Get blood cultures.
Order them times two, 15 minutes.

294
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,103
It's in the wrong place.

295
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,229
It was in the wrong place.

296
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,635
Okay. Times two,
15 minutes apart.

297
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,817
Hey. Um...

298
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,216
Leonard says that he
stops by here to see you.

299
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,055
Yeah, he pretends the
cafeteria's on his route.

300
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,560
Like I don't know
where the lab is.

301
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,322
Yesterday around 3:00, Gwen,
notice anything on the food trays

302
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,559
that wasn't food?

303
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,998
Around 3:00? Just the usual.

304
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,541
Uh, Tupperware, sunglasses,
cell phones, a condom.

305
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,269
Around 4:00, I
found a glass eye.

306
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,042
- See a biohazard bag?
- Uh...

307
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,877
- The Ziploc bag with the red circles?
- Yeah.

308
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,776
Come on.

309
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,746
You can move the mitral valve.

310
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,518
Thanks for the visual aid.
You can't move the mitral valve.

311
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,094
Now, if Mr. Potato Head had an
atrial septal nose and hypertrophy...

312
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,429
I believe the abnormal
insertion of the mitral valve

313
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,763
- can be...
- Stop.

314
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:53,963
Follow me.

315
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,806
Pretty sure I saw a biohazard
bag in here yesterday.

316
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,077
You're lucky you came when you
did, it's due to get dumped in two hours.

317
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,083
Ugh, dentures.
They're the worst.

318
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,713
You know, every patient gets a
denture cup with their name on it.

319
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,224
So tell me, why are the
dentures never in the cup?

320
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,055
And if they are,
it's the wrong cup.

321
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,222
One of life's mysteries?
Biohazard bag sighting.

322
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,900
A biohazard bag for
a coin purse? Really?

323
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,730
Finally, a septal myectomy
will open the outflow tract,

324
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,470
and the mitral valve
can be reimplanted

325
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,442
into a more normal position.

326
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,507
Thank you. That's my idea.

327
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,909
Can you do this
procedure on Gabriel?

328
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,579
No. It's a terrible
idea and it won't work.

329
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,283
So, what was the point of
this dog and pony show?

330
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,870
'Cause you seemed keen on
making medical decisions for me.

331
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,291
So just insubordination?

332
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,827
And we were probably gonna
wind up coming to you anyway.

333
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,324
Once Dr. Murphy gets
an idea, he stays with it,

334
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,089
regardless of what anyone says.

335
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,799
This can work.

336
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,201
Yes, this can work. And
it would be a great idea

337
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,796
if the boy had
two hours to live.

338
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,543
Is fear of failure a good
reason not to do this?

339
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,948
No. But you know what is?

340
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,776
The thought that he might
have a few more birthdays.

341
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,988
Or make a best friend.

342
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,683
I don't know. I'm not
sending him home in a box.

343
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,992
We gotta go. Gabriel's
arrhythmia, it's gotten worse.

344
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,844
You still haven't found it?

345
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,788
I can get Ms. Preston to
address any questions...

346
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,737
She wasn't in the
surgery, you were.

347
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,141
She's the point person for
all therapeutic misadventures.

348
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:42,007
Are you kidding me? I may lose
my voice for absolutely no reason,

349
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,549
and you're using canned jargon?

350
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,048
That sample cup
doesn't have toothpaste,

351
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,178
or socks, or sun block
in it, okay? It has my life.

352
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,584
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,389
Thank you.

354
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,362
Good for you.

355
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,273
Yeah, right. I just
broke about eight rules.

356
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,902
Maybe. Ms. Preston
won't hear about it from me.

357
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,741
You should go find
that sample, though.

358
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,947
Yes.

359
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,584
Meds aren't working.
The question is why.

360
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,385
Maybe the arrhythmia is
just another manifestation

361
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,091
of Gabriel's LV dysfunction.

362
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,293
We'd still be seeing at least a
modest decline in his ectopy.

363
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,700
Maybe his gradient is worse. We
could try calcium channel blockers.

364
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,467
There's a much
simpler explanation.

365
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,116
Good news about his
endocarditis, heart inflammation.

366
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,721
His tests are normal.
But we still are concerned.

367
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,721
For some reason, his
medication isn't helping.

368
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:04,290
Our best explanation is, he
hasn't been taking his medication.

369
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,643
I am trying to save his life.

370
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,907
By withholding his medicine?

371
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,472
By keeping him here.

372
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,203
If he takes the medicine
and becomes better,

373
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,981
you send him home to die.

374
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,665
But there is nothing else
that we can do for him here.

375
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,091
You do not understand
where I live, what it is like.

376
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,326
I don't know your village,

377
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,698
but I do know what
it's like to be poor.

378
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,266
I grew up with nothing.
My sister was disabled,

379
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,772
and my parents couldn't
afford her meds or treatments.

380
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,541
And it killed them, and me,

381
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,342
to watch her suffer.

382
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,978
But when nothing can be
done, nothing can be done.

383
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,350
You became a doctor?

384
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,149
You did not accept being poor.

385
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,950
No.

386
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,662
Then you do not
understand at all.

387
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:20,132
We want for everything.
Food, peace, medicine.

388
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,543
But our greatest want is hope.

389
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,809
If we leave here, we
leave hope behind.

390
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,518
Okay. I'll do what I can.

391
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,431
I dropped by to see Elizabeth.
Not surprisingly, she's very upset.

392
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,724
There wasn't much I could
offer in the way of comfort.

393
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,104
If only people did their jobs...

394
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:56,769
Which people?

395
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:00,212
Scrub nurses,
couriers, lab techs...

396
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,378
That's a curiously limited list.

397
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,993
I did the surgery correctly. I don't
think it's too much to expect others

398
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,451
to do their jobs
correctly as well.

399
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,683
So, not your fault,
not your problem.

400
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,565
What are you trying to
do, make me feel guilty?

401
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,854
Yes. I want you
to feel horrible.

402
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,236
It's the only thing that's
gonna make you change.

403
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,284
Into what?

404
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,922
The guy I married. The guy who
cared more about patients than politics.

405
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,029
Oh, okay, I get it.

406
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,592
This is about me vying
for president of the hospital.

407
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,868
Which we discussed
at length, which you said

408
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,283
you were 100
percent behind me on.

409
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,798
I didn't realize how far behind.

410
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,641
You think I've left you behind?

411
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,943
Hmm. Uh...

412
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,740
Tuesday. "Capital expenditures
meeting delayed. Will be late."

413
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,983
Wednesday. "Fund-raising
event ran over. Don't wait up."

414
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,765
- Thursday...
- Iz, there are things about my job...

415
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,384
Right. Not your fault.

416
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,762
Hello.

417
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,232
Hey.

418
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,836
Do you know that specimens
in formalin go to one place,

419
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,846
exempt specimens somewhere else,

420
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,576
aerobic and anaerobic
cultures two different places,

421
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:15,019
um, radioactive, medical device,
forensic specimens, all different,

422
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,351
and all handled by different
staff? Did you know that?

423
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,088
- Yes.
- Oh.

424
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,325
I made a chart, too.

425
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,762
A qualitative observation
log of what you taught me.

426
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,855
What did I teach you?

427
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,664
Flirting. Every time I saw
someone flirt, I noted it

428
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,171
and cross-referenced the subject,
object and non-verbal gestures.

429
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,374
I knew it.

430
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,773
Gwen the cashier.

431
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,545
She made out that it
was all the courier, but...

432
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,970
That's my name.

433
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,513
Yes, you made flirting gestures.

434
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,311
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

435
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:51,121
You brushed your hair back.
Right hand side-sweeping.

436
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,491
At Dr. Melendez?
No, I don't think so.

437
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:58,360
Shaun, no.

438
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:02,629
Yes. You were at the nurses'
station, and he said, "Good for you."

439
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,728
And you said, "Yeah, right. I just
broke about eight rules," and smiled,

440
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,636
and giggled, and
brushed your hair back.

441
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,905
Ms. Preston won't
hear about it from me.

442
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,182
It's possible you have ringworm.

443
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,913
Shaun, sometimes people toss
their hair just 'cause it's in their face.

444
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,319
Murphy, I'd like you to
elaborate on your idea.

445
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,157
My terrible idea?

446
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,586
That's the one.

447
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,745
You can move the anterior
leaflet of the valve and reattach it.

448
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:53,579
No, we can't. This is an
exact replica of the kid's heart.

449
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,421
There's no anchor
point to reattach it.

450
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,085
So, that part of your
idea? Still terrible.

451
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,248
Okay.

452
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,085
But the rest of it?

453
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,130
We're dealing with a huge
septum. It's 25 millimeters.

454
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,909
What would that number
be in a healthy kid?

455
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,060
About eight.

456
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,602
If we go anywhere
near that number,

457
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,762
it won't have enough
support for the valve.

458
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:19,806
But let's say we
took that down to 20.

459
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,447
And that won't be enough to
relieve the outflow obstruction.

460
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,387
Okay. Eighteen.

461
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,116
Okay.

462
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,973
Let's take him off bypass.

463
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,127
- He's dead.
- Again. Sixteen.

464
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,823
I'm really tired.

465
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:52,470
I used to think that I wanted to
be the best surgeon in history.

466
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:57,634
But my new goal is just not to
get washed out of my residency.

467
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,378
You have a surgery now?

468
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,816
No. I'm here to
see how I can help.

469
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,317
The chief of surgery
joining the search party?

470
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,548
Should I take a selfie?

471
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,385
Show my friends that
this really happened.

472
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,237
This is a team problem, it
should be a team solution.

473
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,089
How do you get a boss like this?

474
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,491
What do we know so far?

475
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,232
Let's take him off bypass.

476
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,412
His outflow is perfect
at 13 millimeters.

477
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,617
Which is irrelevant
when the mitral valve

478
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,162
doesn't have enough
support to close.

479
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,616
He's dead.

480
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:50,687
Again.

481
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,524
Dr. Browne.

482
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,127
Any reason you assumed
responsibility on behalf of the hospital?

483
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,295
Told Elizabeth you were sorry?

484
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,972
Because I was.

485
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,575
Well, I hope we don't
see the price tag on that.

486
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,945
And I think you're out of time.

487
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,057
Let's take him off bypass.

488
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,432
Yes.

489
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,643
Fourteen millimeters.

490
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,809
Exactly.

491
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,512
Yeah, exactly.

492
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:52,624
Our margin of error
is exceedingly low.

493
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,450
Good luck.

494
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,185
You believe in luck?

495
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,160
It's something people
say in difficult situations.

496
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,134
Neither do I. Again.

497
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,338
The reality is, even if we
found your specimen now,

498
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,176
it's unlikely it'd
still be viable.

499
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,179
You don't know if I have cancer

500
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,220
and there's no way to find out.

501
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:30,229
So my choices are
surgery I may not need,

502
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,295
that will leave me
without speech,

503
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,898
or I do nothing and maybe die.

504
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,138
Unfortunately, yes.

505
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,547
<i>Oh</i>

506
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,986
<i>That ancient light, weigh</i>

507
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:05,421
<i>On your shoulders</i>

508
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,896
<i>And the river of time</i>

509
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:16,167
<i>Love is all that's left to lose</i>

510
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:23,107
<i>Love is all that's left to lose</i>

511
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:45,736
<i>Lust, love, I'm
not alone anymore</i>

512
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:52,641
<i>Lust, love, I'm
not alone anymore</i>

513
00:31:56,782 --> 00:32:00,219
<i>This ancient light</i>

514
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,049
<i>This ancient light...</i>

515
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,146
Knife.

516
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,966
Three hours, 30 minutes.

517
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,476
You didn't want him on bypass
any longer than five hours.

518
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,950
"Wynken and Blynken
are two little eyes.

519
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,450
"And Nod is a little head.

520
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,352
"And the wooden shoe
that sailed the skies,

521
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,324
"is a wee one's trundle bed.

522
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,358
"So shut your eyes

523
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,518
"while Mother sings."

524
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,783
How does it look, Dr. Murphy?

525
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,879
Fourteen millimeters. Exactly.

526
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,537
Perfect.

527
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,346
His septal tissue...

528
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,154
It's stiffer than I anticipated.

529
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,601
I don't think it's gonna be
enough for adequate outflow.

530
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,674
I'm taking the
septum down to 13.

531
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:38,475
Okay. The valve wasn't
supported at 13, the patient died.

532
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,178
That was a model, not a patient.

533
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,650
We're at five hours
and three minutes.

534
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,695
We're taking him down to 13.

535
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,593
Field.

536
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:05,007
All quiet for the time-out.
Patient is Elizabeth McLaren.

537
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,069
No known allergies. We'll
be doing a total laryngectomy

538
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,841
with a Gluck-Sorenson
U-shaped incision.

539
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:10,939
Is everyone in agreement?

540
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,911
Antibiotics in?

541
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,830
One gram of cefotaxime
has been infused.

542
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,231
We anticipate a specimen.

543
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,855
I've requested
labels be printed.

544
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,183
Pen?

545
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,255
Prepare to intubate.

546
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,054
Dentures.

547
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,731
You've gotta hold the surgery.

548
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,426
Uh, just give me a little time.

549
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,101
That's 13.

550
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,074
Damn it.

551
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,409
Too thin?

552
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,924
The valve doesn't
have adequate support.

553
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,158
It won't be able to close.

554
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,391
I was wrong.

555
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,740
Whoa, there's a
reattachment point.

556
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,494
We must not have seen it at 14

557
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,919
'cause it was obscured
by the subvalvular tissue.

558
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,458
We can use that as an anchor
point and move the valve.

559
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,322
Your terrible idea just got
a hell of a lot better. Stitch.

560
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,153
Five hours, 23 minutes.

561
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,337
Hey.

562
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,674
Dentures. They always
end up in the wrong cup,

563
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,694
which is why they're so
hard to get back to the owner.

564
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:54,777
Okay.

565
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,152
Right. What if the label on
the specimen was wrong?

566
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,123
What if the nodule is here,

567
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,004
but the container has
the wrong name on it?

568
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,789
I'm reconciling the operative records
to the surgery schedule to specimen.

569
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,503
I'll read the cases,
check the containers,

570
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,022
and feel like a
jerk for judging you.

571
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,364
Well, you're only
a jerk if I'm right.

572
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,195
Pump time?

573
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,674
Six hours, 48 minutes.

574
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,306
Get Mehta in here.

575
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,646
Let's take him off bypass.

576
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,074
Twelve seconds.
Should I get the paddles?

577
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,676
Not yet. Come on, Gabriel.

578
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,695
How long has he been on bypass?

579
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,500
Nearly two hours too long.
We need to jump start...

580
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,548
Not yet!

581
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,067
Yeah? Yes!

582
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,170
Dr. Murphy, close him up.

583
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:33,812
<i>And I will hold you tight</i>

584
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,914
<i>Like the moon in
the arms of the sky</i>

585
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:47,325
<i>And I will keep you warm</i>

586
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,392
<i>I will build...</i>

587
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,129
It's beating just
fine on its own.

588
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,939
<i>And I'll build a fire,
you fetch the water</i>

589
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,137
<i>And I'll lay the table</i>

590
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,177
<i>And in our hearts, we still
pray for sons and daughters</i>

591
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,744
Marcus.

592
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,190
<i>And all those evenings out in
the garden, the red, red wine</i>

593
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:19,028
<i>These quiet hours
turning to years</i>

594
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,496
There was a specimen cup
in the OR prior to your surgery.

595
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,002
It was supposed to be
used for a bullet removal,

596
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,266
but they left the
bullet in the body,

597
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,165
and the cup was used
accidentally for your specimen.

598
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,677
Not only was it in formalin,

599
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,305
but it was refrigerated
and fresh as a daisy.

600
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,679
Elizabeth, you
don't have cancer.

601
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,987
Thank you.

602
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,154
Doctor.

603
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:59,703
<i>And I'll build a fire, you fetch
the water and I'll lay the table</i>

604
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:05,837
<i>And in our hearts, we still
pray for sons and daughters</i>

605
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,072
Intangibles.

606
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,416
Hello.

607
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,551
Hello.

608
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,186
I had a very good day today.

609
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,357
Yes, you did. That was
a hell of an operation.

610
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:30,197
Yes. And I caught
Claire flirting.

611
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,361
With you? Shaun, I
think you might be...

612
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,564
With Dr. Melendez.

613
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,363
Ah, Dr. Melendez.

614
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,874
I conducted observations,

615
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,035
successfully interpreted
them and logged them.

616
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:42,543
Romance in a
spreadsheet. I love it.

617
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,412
I was aware of the cues
even when Claire wasn't.

618
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,246
I think she needs
a life skills coach.

619
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,780
Extrapolating. I like that, too.

620
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,914
That's great, Shaun.

621
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,959
You're paying
attention, you're learning.

622
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,297
And when we find you a life
coach, one with a fashion sense,

623
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,424
then you're gonna be learning
better, you're gonna be learning faster.

624
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,570
Are you giving up on me?

625
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:12,767
What? No. I haven't
given up on you.

626
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,869
I don't want a
stranger helping me.

627
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,941
I know, Shaun, but...

628
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:22,943
And I can't, uh...

629
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,254
I can't always be there.

630
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,785
I can't always help you the
way you need to be helped,

631
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,658
the way you
deserve to be helped.

632
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,823
I don't want a
stranger helping me.

633
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,140
Congratulations.

634
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,242
You, too, on your
mad sleuthing skills.

635
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,942
Something to fall back on
if this surgery thing gets old.

636
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,466
- You did a nice job, Claire.
- Thanks.

637
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,858
And here is our price
tag. We've been served.

638
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,489
But we found it.
Elizabeth's fine.

639
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,122
I know. But we put her
through two days of hell

640
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,177
and she wants to make sure it
doesn't happen to anybody else.

641
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,601
I mean, good for her.

642
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,699
What is this?

643
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,041
Gabriel's pacemaker.

644
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,037
I heard you were
brilliant again today.

645
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,607
I got lucky.

646
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,533
Do you think Armen would
kill me if I got a pet hedgehog?

647
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,767
I mean, I read that
they're actually...

648
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,316
- Lea.
- Yes, Shaun?

649
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,456
You look absurd in that sweater.

650
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:50,308
I have apples. Do
you want an apple?

651
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:54,502
Yeah.
