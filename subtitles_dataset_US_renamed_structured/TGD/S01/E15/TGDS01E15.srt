Please walk around

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,074
Be careful...

8
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,740
What happened?

9
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,648
Nothing. They're just getting
the lobby ready for the big party.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,080
<i>It's an annual fundraiser.</i>

11
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,956
Like a carnival?

12
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,926
No, it's a swanky
black-tie ball.

13
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,827
You think a hospital
lobby is swanky?

14
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,329
Not yet. Add some
lights, a few decorations,

15
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,765
and, most importantly, alcohol.

16
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,494
It becomes a streamer and
balloon-infested hospital lobby

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,629
with a cash bar.

18
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,539
It's for charity. Better to
spend the money for the cause.

19
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,611
Actually, it's worse. You need
to spend money to make money.

20
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,345
I don't like parties.

21
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,472
It doesn't matter.

22
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,711
All residents will be expected
to attend and make a donation.

23
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,817
This is Dr. Alex Park, he's
the last of Coyle's residents

24
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,446
to be reassigned to our team.

25
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,490
Meet doctors Jared Kalu,
Claire Browne and Shaun Murphy.

26
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,719
Hi.

27
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:33,920
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,193
Welcome back.
How was Costa Rica?

29
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,941
Beaches were awesome.
Monkeys were horrible.

30
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,576
Little bastards stole my
new camera and a pair of...

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,727
How old are you?

32
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,527
Forty-five.

33
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,265
That's even older
than Dr. Melendez.

34
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,000
Dr. Murphy is a talented
doctor who has autism,

35
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,806
which sometimes causes him
to ask inappropriate questions.

36
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,343
No worries. Inappropriate
questions can be very revealing.

37
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,472
I'm a late bloomer.

38
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,382
Park's being modest,
which is very unlike him.

39
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,816
He was a cop for 15 years
before he went to med school.

40
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,199
Now that we all know each other,

41
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,022
Reznick and Browne have
dibs on cases this week.

42
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,117
You make your picks?

43
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,318
- Yes.
- Definitely.

44
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,121
Is there karaoke?

45
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,093
And now, our all-star line-up,

46
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,431
playing center out of
Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

47
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,232
Whoo!

48
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,737
Spirit, stop it. They don't
have time to fool around.

49
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,776
I'm not fooling around. I need to
document the momentous event.

50
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,805
Then at least get it right.
I'm from Taipei, Taiwan.

51
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,416
Correction, from Taipei, Taiwan,

52
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,575
which I believe is a
suburb of Moose Jaw,

53
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,850
Dr. Audrey Lim...

54
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,158
And assisting Dr. Lim are

55
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,352
two docs I've never met.

56
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,660
Hello, I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy
from Casper, Wyoming.

57
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,300
And...

58
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,628
Dr. Morgan Reznick. Mill
Valley, California. Represent.

59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,866
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

60
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,771
Okay, Spirit, that's enough.

61
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,436
All right, put your phone
away, or it becomes my phone.

62
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,211
Well, folks, looks like the
suits are shutting me down.

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,148
Thanks for all your
support. Love you. Bye.

64
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,676
Sorry, but my friends
insist I keep them up to date.

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,116
It's all right. It's a big day.

66
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,650
Spirit was born with
ectopia cordis. She's been...

67
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,660
Why didn't they repair it
when she was an infant?

68
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,658
They couldn't. Her
rib cage was too small.

69
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,663
But after 14 years of
slow and steady growth...

70
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,724
It's time to put this
baby where it belongs.

71
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,913
This is an interesting view.
I can see the aortic arch.

72
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,753
- Murphy.
- Oh, it's all right.

73
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,316
I'm used to people
being curious.

74
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,004
I'm sure you're looking forward

75
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,472
to when there's nothing
to be curious about.

76
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,331
Mmm, what I'm really
looking forward to is crowds.

77
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,668
You like crowds?

78
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,766
I don't know. I've
never been in one.

79
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,674
I can't go to a normal school,

80
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,040
and my parents barely
ever let me leave our house.

81
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,616
Well, when a small bump could
stop your heart, it makes sense.

82
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,174
But you still have
a lot of friends?

83
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,247
Yeah, of course. I mean, I just
can't do anything fun with them.

84
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,214
If you can't do anything fun,

85
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,847
then how did you get
them to be your friend?

86
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,587
Well, in case you haven't
noticed, I like to talk.

87
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,888
- And, uh...
- Yes.

88
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,655
We all do everything
online now anyway.

89
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,743
The first thing I'm gonna
do when I get out of here

90
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,531
is take all my
friends to a concert.

91
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,628
Like, general
admission, on the floor.

92
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,504
I don't even care who the band is,
just as long as the place is packed.

93
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,099
Oh, and I'm gonna hug everyone.

94
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,641
You've never hugged
anyone? Not even your parents?

95
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,641
Kissed by my parents,
high-fived by my friends,

96
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,808
but, nope, no hugs.

97
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,442
It's just too risky.

98
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,586
Hugs make me feel trapped.

99
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,960
Sorry. Almost done.

100
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,893
Pain in the upper
right quadrant.

101
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,252
It's jaundice.

102
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,895
Bilirubin's off the chart.

103
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,699
That doesn't make sense.

104
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,526
He's been doing so
well since the transplant.

105
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,045
Every check-up this
year's been perfect.

106
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,935
Well, it could just be
a temporary flare-up.

107
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,903
We'll increase his anti-rejection
meds and do a full liver exam.

108
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,998
We'll know more then.

109
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,477
You two, do the work-up,
and you find a new liver.

110
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,165
Shouldn't we wait
for the biopsy result?

111
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,953
Not when I already
know what it's gonna say.

112
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,683
He needs a new liver ASAP.

113
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,253
I mean, that's gonna be
hard. He's blood type O.

114
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,388
It's gonna be impossible.

115
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,008
He's lucky they were
able to find the first one.

116
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,409
Well, he better get lucky again

117
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,129
'cause it's our only
way to keep him alive.

118
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,962
We're screwed.

119
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,271
Barbara Boxer got ear
barotrauma scuba diving in Cozumel

120
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,538
and cannot fly for two weeks,
which means we don't have

121
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,102
a keynote speaker for our gala.

122
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:48,972
You think this is funny?

123
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,148
I've just never
seen you anxious.

124
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,452
And I seriously doubt
Barbara Boxer scuba dives.

125
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,751
It's just an excuse.

126
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,167
She sent me a picture
from the hospital.

127
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,352
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

128
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,926
Anyone can fake a photograph.

129
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,361
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing a search

130
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,667
to see if our esteemed senator
from the great state of California

131
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,966
ever once, once talked about
scuba diving in an interview.

132
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,215
It doesn't matter if it's true.

133
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,470
What matters is that
we find a replacement.

134
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,686
I need you to get me a
meeting with Aidan Coulter.

135
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,939
- Oh, Aidan Coulter?
- Yes.

136
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,641
Uh... What? I sat next to
him once at an A's game.

137
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,910
And the story I remember

138
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,452
is that you two were talking
smack that entire game.

139
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,282
And after he spilled
his beer on you

140
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,222
and insisted on buying you a
new jacket, you refused him.

141
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,717
So he owes you.

142
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,545
Just get me a meeting. I will
handle everything from there.

143
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,531
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

144
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

145
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,505
Huh.

146
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,738
You'll be fine. You've
had liver biopsies before.

147
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,576
And they've always hurt a lot.

148
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,376
Please, is there another way?

149
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,764
Well, the other way, Eric,
would be going through your neck,

150
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,468
and I don't think you'd
like that any more.

151
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,921
Eric, you know why NBA players
all wear headphones before games?

152
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,820
Now, don't look at him. Look
at me. I need you to answer me.

153
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,562
Why do NBA players wear
headphones before games?

154
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,964
I don't know. I
guess they like music.

155
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,729
No, they need music.

156
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,069
Music helps them forget
about everything else

157
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,665
and focus on what's important.

158
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,073
The game.

159
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,104
Who's your favorite player?

160
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,673
Curry.

161
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,877
Okay. This is the song he
listens to before every game.

162
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,977
How do you know?

163
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,885
Because he's my
favorite player, too.

164
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:39,217
I want you to close your
eyes and focus on this.

165
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,922
Just this.

166
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,197
- It's cold.
- Yeah, now it is.

167
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,860
But if you stay focused,
pretty soon it'll stop feeling cold

168
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,061
and start to feel warm.

169
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,813
When that happens, I
want you to nod your head,

170
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,830
and you'll feel some
pressure and a small pinch.

171
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,906
- But what if it doesn't?
- Now close your eyes

172
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,240
and focus.

173
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,842
You ready?

174
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,826
Two minutes,
he'll be good to go.

175
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,227
How'd you know he
was a basketball fan?

176
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,162
His shoes.

177
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,051
He's not wearing any shoes.

178
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,973
Yeah, they're in a
backpack in his room.

179
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,272
You searched his backpack?

180
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,445
Well, it's less
invasive than a rectal

181
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,176
and, most of the
time, more useful.

182
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,448
Okay, Spirit, just
keep still and...

183
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,219
"And during a few parts of the exam,
we may ask you to hold your breath,

184
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,884
"but it'll only be
a few seconds."

185
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,392
You got it.

186
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,395
You gonna buy a tux or rent one?

187
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,400
The fundraiser is black-tie.

188
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,768
I have a suit. It's new.

189
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,138
I bought it for my
resident interviews.

190
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,309
It doesn't matter how
new it is. It's not a tux.

191
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,979
Wearing a uniform at
work reassures patients.

192
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,450
Wearing a uniform at a party

193
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,181
does nothing but make
you hot and uncomfortable.

194
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,848
This party is work.

195
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,520
Get a tux. And not a crappy
one from some outlet store.

196
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,026
Get fitted by a pro and
spend a minimum of two grand.

197
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,006
You're gonna meet rich
people who can help your career.

198
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,641
And they're not gonna wanna
help some slob in a suit...

199
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,689
I'm not a slob.

200
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,432
No, I am very clean and make
sure my clothes are never wrinkled.

201
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,063
And it's too big.

202
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:40,104
Her heart, it's enlarged
53% since her last exam.

203
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,412
Her last exam was
only six months ago.

204
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,915
It won't fit.

205
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,178
Too big.

206
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,783
The biopsy confirmed
acute cellular rejection.

207
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,552
We maximized his
immunosuppressives, but...

208
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,683
I found one.

209
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,189
A type-O liver.

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,453
Are you sure?

211
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,706
Park and I checked the
registry, and there weren't any.

212
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,028
I found it online.

213
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,967
He, uh, already tried to make a
direct donation a few months ago,

214
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,765
but the patient died
before the surgery.

215
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,430
I contacted him,
which wasn't easy,

216
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,599
but he still wants
to be a donor.

217
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,408
That's amazing. Great job.

218
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,507
What's the catch?

219
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,558
He wants to be a donor,
but he's not on the registry.

220
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,982
I mean, there's
got to be a catch.

221
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,576
He, uh... Well, he
can't be on the registry

222
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,616
because he is in prison.

223
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,916
For murder.

224
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,259
Actually, um, seven murders.

225
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:38,330
Boris Tirayan was a Russian mafia
enforcer convicted of seven murders.

226
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,133
Who now wants to make amends.

227
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,934
He tried to be a donor
a few months ago,

228
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,568
but the patient died before the
red tape could be worked out.

229
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,243
But now it has.

230
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,105
Are there any laws against
an inmate becoming a donor?

231
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:53,009
No. But there is a ton of liability.
What if he attacks someone here?

232
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,546
He'll be guarded by state
prison guards on a separate level,

233
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,523
away from patients and
all non-essential staff.

234
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,837
Everyone deserves a
chance to turn their life around.

235
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,725
Guy wants to do something
decent, we should let him.

236
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,957
I don't think we owe
a murderer anything.

237
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,967
But maybe he owes us
something. He has a debt to society.

238
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,603
Which he would repay by
donating his inner organs?

239
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,539
Isn't it a slippery slope between
a guy who wants to make amends

240
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,771
and turning our prison system
into a superstore for body parts?

241
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,109
A slippery slope that
saves a child's life.

242
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,140
<i>It'll never happen.</i>

243
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,693
He's just trying to get to a hospital
where it'll be easier to escape.

244
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,379
You have no idea
what his motivation is.

245
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,782
I know he's a lying sociopath

246
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,299
who doesn't care about
anyone but himself.

247
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,383
He's been a model
inmate for nine years,

248
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,259
tutors other prisoners
in the library...

249
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,971
Yeah, because he's trying
to get someone to trust him,

250
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,795
to give him an inch,
and as soon as they do...

251
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,022
We got approval.

252
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,068
He's gonna stall, make excuses,
and when he sees his chance,

253
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,331
someone's gonna get hurt.

254
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,202
I think it's worth
taking that chance.

255
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,566
Anybody who doesn't agree,
feel free to sit this one out.

256
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,291
When you started menstruating,

257
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,012
the increased estrogen
caused pulmonary hypertension,

258
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,153
which isn't a
surgical issue in itself,

259
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,451
but along with your
atypical vascular system...

260
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,582
Your heart's grown too big.

261
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,284
We will control
your blood pressure

262
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,851
so that you will keep growing,

263
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,523
but your heart won't, and
then by the time you're 18,

264
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,466
- we'll be able to...
- No. I'm not waiting any longer.

265
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,299
- Spirit, honey, it will be okay.
- No, it won't.

266
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,839
I'm sick of being
stuck inside all the time.

267
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,500
I'm sick of this!

268
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,207
I don't ever wanna text,
call, or video chat again.

269
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,181
Mom, I wanna be touched.

270
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,050
I wanna be shoved.

271
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,355
I wanna be punched. I don't
even care. Just... Please.

272
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,089
Please.

273
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,361
I want the surgery now.

274
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,129
I need it.

275
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,373
I'm sorry. We can't.

276
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,512
We need to get rid of all
the furniture and artwork.

277
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,886
I get removing the
paintings, but the furniture?

278
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,255
Don't want the prison
guards sitting down on the job.

279
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,959
He's gonna be in full
restraints, cuffed to the bed.

280
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,756
Well, that's our plan.

281
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,799
But we also need to
be prepared for his plan.

282
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,745
Okay, we need to get rid of
the window blinds, curtain rods,

283
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,769
jacket hooks, and make
sure there's no metal rivets

284
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,999
or eyelets on the mattress.

285
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,234
Uh, what's he gonna
do with a metal eyelet?

286
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,919
Tear it off the mattress and
file it down to cut your jugular

287
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,345
or bend it into a handcuff key
or shove it into an electric socket

288
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,848
to create a spark
and start a fire.

289
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,418
I've seen knives made out
of toilet paper, soap, and salt

290
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,614
that could amputate
a fat guy's femur.

291
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,928
I'm not quite sure he needed
the part about the guy being fat.

292
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,938
So I've been thinking.

293
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,607
You wanna go to the
fundraiser together?

294
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,076
It's not a prom. We
don't have to bring a date.

295
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,669
Yeah, we don't have to,

296
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,111
but we can, if we want.

297
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,853
Everyone basically knows
we're seeing each other, but still,

298
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,217
you know, I think it might
be a nice opportunity to

299
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,849
take our relationship
out into the open.

300
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,659
Unless you don't want to.

301
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,064
No, it's a good idea.

302
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,768
Are you sure? 'Cause,
you know, we don't have to.

303
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,770
Yeah. Let's do it.

304
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,167
Let's go.

305
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,073
What's wrong?

306
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,658
It's fine. He'll be all right.

307
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,311
No, I won't. I don't want
a murderer's liver. It's evil.

308
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,719
Eric, there's no such
thing as a good or bad liver.

309
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,020
It's just, uh, just an organ.

310
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,021
Eric, this is your only choice.

311
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,153
If we don't do the
transplant, you will die.

312
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,673
Look, I don't want
him to be a part of me,

313
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,666
inside me forever, all right?

314
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,758
I don't care what you or
anybody else says, okay?

315
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,427
It's my body,
and I don't want it.

316
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,667
That's ridiculous.

317
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,177
Personality traits aren't
transferred in an organ transplant.

318
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,607
It's also irrelevant.

319
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,080
Children don't consent to
surgeries. Their parents do.

320
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,850
But if he doesn't cooperate
with the anti-rejection regimen,

321
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,896
we could be wasting a liver that
could save someone else's life.

322
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,388
No one's getting
saved by Tirayan.

323
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,099
I found a type-A donor. It's
not a perfect match, but...

324
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,092
His body's already
rejected a perfect match.

325
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,540
There's no way it can tolerate
an incompatible blood type.

326
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,119
No, the only way to save Eric

327
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,132
is to do the transplant with
Tirayan's liver. That is it.

328
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,958
We have no other option.

329
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,771
Let the OR know we're
gonna need more restraints.

330
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,735
Dr. Clinton Ford out of Alberta

331
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,640
developed an experimental
resorbable material.

332
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,648
It would allow us to
expand her rib cage

333
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,707
and create room to
fit her heart inside.

334
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,291
An artificial sternum.

335
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,953
That would actually grow
along with the patient.

336
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,418
The surgery isn't reversible.

337
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,823
If it doesn't work,

338
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,691
we can't just move her
heart back to where it was.

339
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,424
It would allow
her to have a life.

340
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:05,825
She has a life.

341
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,027
And she'll be healthy as long
as she stays out of crowds,

342
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,502
doesn't hug anyone, or do
anything where she might fall...

343
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,732
I get you're autistic,

344
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,497
but I know even you realize

345
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,373
when a patient cries and
throws her phone against the wall,

346
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,207
they're not happy with
their current health.

347
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,878
There's no reason
to make this personal.

348
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,925
There is if his medical
judgment is biased.

349
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,941
I saw she was upset.

350
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,754
You saw it, but you
didn't understand it.

351
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,821
You're very competitive.

352
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,255
Are you trying to make
Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

353
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,593
or are you trying to
undermine my confidence?

354
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,466
I'm actually trying to
help you and the patient.

355
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,233
She wants to be
able to rub elbows,

356
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,100
and you need to learn
how to trade elbows.

357
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,975
The resorbable plate is
experimental and risky.

358
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,712
But my medical judgment
is that it's worth it.

359
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,149
Make sure she agrees,
and then get her prepped.

360
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,154
Why me?

361
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,524
I'm not famous. I don't know
anything about medicine.

362
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,958
And giving the keynote
speech at your fundraiser

363
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,396
is a steep price to pay
for a beer-stained jacket.

364
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,528
You grew up in San Jose.

365
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,272
You went to San Jose State

366
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,537
despite being accepted
by both Princeton and MIT.

367
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,805
And you headquartered
your company here,

368
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,073
despite huge tax breaks offered
by Chicago and Minneapolis.

369
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,647
And it was his favorite jacket.

370
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,994
And when I offered
to have it cleaned,

371
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,296
he said not to bother because
he didn't even like the jacket.

372
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,344
He was being polite.

373
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,650
"Polite"?

374
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,562
I take it you've never
been to a game with him.

375
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,221
You did some
homework, but not enough.

376
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,854
I love this city, but I
hate giving speeches.

377
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,695
So don't give a speech.

378
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,531
Tell us a story.

379
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,546
Like the one you
told at the wrap party

380
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,266
at the Youth Dance
Company's fall musical,

381
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,298
the one where you got
lost at the Paris catacombs.

382
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,168
I stand corrected.

383
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,372
Your success is
inspiring, Aidan,

384
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,672
as well as your
loyalty to this city.

385
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,582
And the fact that you're
young, apparently very funny...

386
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,947
I'm in.

387
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,165
Actually, I was in as
soon as Aaron told me

388
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,680
what you wanted to meet about,

389
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,723
but I was curious what your
attack strategy would be.

390
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,285
So how was it?

391
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,924
It was very effective.

392
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,897
Now, don't worry. He's been
a model inmate for nine years

393
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,931
and tutors the other
prisoners in the library.

394
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,413
Coke nail come in
handy up at Pelican Bay?

395
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,412
I make jewelry. Helps
me pick up the beads.

396
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,284
Is there a history of cancer
or liver disease in your family?

397
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,016
I went through this a couple of
months ago. You have my file.

398
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,992
We need to do our own exam.

399
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,640
And there's nothing about
your family in previous records.

400
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,757
Are they still alive?

401
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,855
They're dead to me.

402
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,127
Quit stalling, or we'll
send you back right now.

403
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,766
I haven't spoken to anyone in
my family since I was 15 years old.

404
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,775
Last I know, uh, both of my
parents were healthy enough

405
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,439
to kick the crap out
of me on a daily basis.

406
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,047
Any other questions?

407
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,811
Why do you want to do this?

408
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:50,055
Maybe I just like cute nurses
and bad Jell-O. What do you care?

409
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,691
We don't. As long as
you do what you're told.

410
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,690
Don't worry. I'm very
good at following orders.

411
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,998
Councilman Burns must be
very happy with his facelift.

412
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,677
He just bought another
table for the fundraiser.

413
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,973
I aim to please,

414
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,511
but you already knew that,

415
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,309
and I need to get into surgery,
so stop being so coy. What's up?

416
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,311
You and Isabel always
seem very happy,

417
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,151
able to manage both your
professional and personal lives.

418
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,819
I'm flattered you think
so. But still a bit coy.

419
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,360
When I met with Aidan
Coulter about being our keynote,

420
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,591
I thought there was a spark.

421
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,098
Okay, so now we're
getting somewhere.

422
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,726
Surgery can wait a few minutes.

423
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,268
Is it unprofessional
of me to explore it?

424
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,968
He's not a hospital employee
but potentially a significant donor

425
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,910
and younger.

426
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,173
Quite a bit.

427
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,374
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,876
I don't know. Maybe
I'm just imagining

429
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,387
something that
doesn't even exist.

430
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,547
Oh, I doubt that.

431
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,682
You're an attractive,
smart, interesting woman.

432
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,090
I'm sure there was a spark.

433
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,494
But you can't date
a donor like Coulter.

434
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,890
Sorry.

435
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,396
There's no actual
policy against it.

436
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,867
I'm not talking policy.
I'm talking optics.

437
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,064
The last thing you want is
someone thinking you'd use sex

438
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,466
to get a big donation.

439
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,404
It's a double standard, I know,

440
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,644
but it's the world we live in.

441
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,545
I said no! I don't want it!

442
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,051
I thought you gave him
something to calm him.

443
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,416
We did, but he's too agitated.

444
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,182
I'm going to start him
on IV midazolam now.

445
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,657
Eric? Eric, remember what
Dr. Park said earlier about focusing?

446
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,120
I know you can do that.

447
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,037
How about we get you
those earbuds you had earlier?

448
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,257
- No. Leave me alone!
- Eric, stop it!

449
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,423
Look at me!

450
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,900
Do not move.

451
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,348
You wear very stylish clothes.

452
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,855
Um, thank you. I assume you
mean when I'm not in surgery.

453
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,385
Yes. Do you think people believe

454
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,485
you're a better doctor
because of that?

455
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,592
Some people.

456
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,066
Others probably just
think I'm a show-off

457
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,262
or arrogant, gay. I don't care.

458
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,668
I do it for myself.

459
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,233
You look good, you feel good.

460
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,138
Does it help you make friends?

461
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,779
Feeling good about
yourself helps with everything.

462
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,747
Do you know where I
can buy a stylish tuxedo?

463
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,013
I can pay $2,000.

464
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,612
Okay.

465
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:40,054
Dr. Reznick says if I want people
who matter to help my career,

466
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:44,290
I need to wear a tuxedo that
costs $2,000 to the fundraiser.

467
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,807
Have you talked to
Glassman about this?

468
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,892
No. I make my own decisions now.

469
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,598
Murphy, people who
matter will help your career

470
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,837
because they're impressed with
your talent and potential as a surgeon.

471
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,076
And I could send
you to my tailor,

472
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,745
where you'll definitely
spend two grand,

473
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,382
but my advice would
be, just rent one.

474
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,061
Make sure you get
fitted by the manager,

475
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,418
and for a couple of
hundred bucks, you'll be fine.

476
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,591
I'm gonna need you to
count backwards from 10.

477
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:25,029
Ten, nine, eight...

478
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,729
Eight...

479
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,068
Looks like you were wrong.

480
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,774
I said he'll do anything
to convince us to trust him,

481
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,277
to let our guard down.

482
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,780
His eyes, they're swelling up.

483
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,269
So's his tongue. He's
having an allergic reaction.

484
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,352
Stop the anesthesia.

485
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,122
Give me 0.5 migs
epinephrine IM now.

486
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,220
I'm on it.

487
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,458
Epi's in.

488
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,297
He's hypoxic. We
need to intubate.

489
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,893
Getting a 5.0 tube.

490
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,162
Now!

491
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,223
You had a severe allergic
reaction to the anesthesia.

492
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:20,488
We had to intubate you
and give you steroids.

493
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,421
Wait...

494
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,758
You didn't do it?

495
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,893
We can't operate on you if you
can't breathe under anesthesia.

496
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,328
You did everything you could.

497
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,406
The patient's parents
wanted you to know

498
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,118
they're extremely grateful
for everything you did

499
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,940
or tried to do.

500
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,179
You can try again.

501
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,482
I'm sorry. We can't.

502
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,349
No, you try again.

503
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,247
Try again.

504
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,250
You try again.

505
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,687
Try again. Try again!

506
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,256
- Calm down.
- Try again! Try again!

507
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,029
I said calm down now.

508
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,773
Same old, same old, yeah?

509
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,021
That's the way it's
always been for me.

510
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,525
Nothing I ever...

511
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,272
He's still on top
of the UNOS list.

512
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,174
We're gonna be calling and
rechecking every registry and database

513
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,472
all night.

514
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,305
How long do we have?

515
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,050
Without a new
liver, maybe a day.

516
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,182
So what'd you get?
Hugo Boss? Armani?

517
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,521
Dr. Andrews said I
should just rent one.

518
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,906
And you're gonna listen to him?

519
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,958
He's the chief of surgery,
and he knows about clothes.

520
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,502
If Andrews had a son, you think

521
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,403
he'd let him go to an important
event in a cheap rental tux?

522
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,944
He said people who matter
judge people based on their talent.

523
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,440
Yeah, that's what he
tells someone else's kid.

524
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,015
To his own, or someone he
actually respects, he tells the truth.

525
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,275
Cut here.

526
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,418
Do you respect me?

527
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,026
You're smart, able to
memorize a ton of information,

528
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,736
but, no, not really.

529
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,231
Suction the mediastinum.

530
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,124
You've certainly
put a lot of thought

531
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,811
into what someone you claim
not to respect wears to a party.

532
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,531
Just because I don't respect
him doesn't mean I don't like him.

533
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,919
Everyone's uncomfortable
in fancy clothes

534
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,890
and hates kissing up to
bigwigs at a fundraiser.

535
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,223
They do it. They don't
cower at home alone.

536
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,256
You use your autism as a crutch.

537
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,376
Okay, I think if you liked him
any more, he'd have a black eye.

538
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,609
Make sure we're clear on that
side and the aorta isn't kinked.

539
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,838
The aorta isn't kinked.

540
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,011
Good. Now for the
moment of truth.

541
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,484
Position the plate.

542
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,482
Perfect fit.

543
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,601
What the hell? What did you do?

544
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,701
I don't feel nothing.

545
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:55,797
No, don't touch him.

546
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,852
If he can't control
his bladder...

547
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,469
He can control
himself just fine.

548
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,739
Nice try, but the
vacation's over. Stand up.

549
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,043
Re-check his cuffs first.

550
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,882
You're getting changed,
and we're going.

551
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,586
Just take him like he is.

552
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,031
I'm not gonna get
stuck in the van

553
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,956
for the next three
hours with him like that.

554
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,325
Watch his hands!
Watch his hands!

555
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,497
Put the gun down! Now!

556
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,229
You shoot me, he dies.

557
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,358
Now, no one is shooting
anyone. Everyone, stay calm.

558
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,832
Give him space.

559
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,969
You did something good,
Boris. Don't ruin it now.

560
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,474
I did nothing, yeah?

561
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,539
I accomplished nothing!

562
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,911
Whatever happens next is
completely in your control.

563
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,918
You have power,

564
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,521
but it's not unlimited.

565
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,584
You're not gonna escape.
You're not just walking out of here.

566
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,653
But there are
things, concessions,

567
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,093
that can make your life better.

568
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:54,023
So let's just take
our time and talk.

569
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,998
There's no rush.

570
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,094
What do you want, Boris?

571
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,505
What do you really want?

572
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,401
I don't want anyone to help me.

573
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,942
Whatever you call it, these
life-saving measures, I...

574
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,242
No. No.

575
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,750
Do not do it.

576
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,025
No, don't listen to her. It's your
choice. You do what you want.

577
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,857
Yeah.

578
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,024
Boris, no!

579
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,643
Let's go. Let's go. Move! Move!

580
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,043
Melendez is en route.

581
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,717
All right, ready? Let's
go. Three, two, one.

582
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,819
Page urology and
cardio-thoracic, stat.

583
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,273
He's dead, and he
has a donor card.

584
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,937
We're gonna take
everything he can donate.

Thank you so much.

590
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,528
Your speech was
perfect and hilarious.

591
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,063
Oh, you're very welcome.

592
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,690
And I appreciate the
opportunity to help change my rep.

593
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,790
You have a rep?

594
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,370
All work and no play.

595
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,269
It's something I'm
working on changing.

596
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,165
Your rep or your lifestyle?

597
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,637
I need less stress and more fun.

598
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,684
Would you like to
play golf sometime?

599
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,523
On a real course
with actual grass?

600
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,316
Absolutely.

601
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,853
Would you like to dance?

602
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,790
I'd love to.

603
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,156

00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,231
We need to get Eric
prepped right away.

607
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,974
What's happening? Did
you find a new liver donor?

608
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,306
Actually, it's the same one.

609
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,981
Circumstances have changed.

610
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,108
What?

611
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,549
This is incredible.

612
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,345
No, I don't want it.

613
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:32,319
Eric, when the donor found out

614
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,225
that he couldn't do
the surgery to help you,

615
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,419
he became incredibly sad

616
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,162
because he wanted you to live

617
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,091
more than he wanted to live.

618
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,437
He ended his life

619
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,568
so that you could
have his liver.

620
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,174
He...

621
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,369
He knew he'd done
some bad things,

622
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,277
and I think that this
was the only way

623
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,381
he knew how to make amends.

624
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,052
I think we should
try and help him.

625
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,457
Do you think you can do that,

626
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,060
help someone do something good?

627
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,397
Yeah.

628
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,379
Everything looks good.

629
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,381
Remember to take deep breaths so
you don't develop any lung complications,

630
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,214
and obviously,

631
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,914
avoid lifting anything too
heavy for the next few weeks.

632
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,150
What, honey?

633
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,484

No, it cost $2,368.

639
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,210
Well, it was worth every penny.

640
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,430
Good investment.

641
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,438
I'm glad to see you're treating
yourself. You deserve it.

642
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,641
How much did your dress cost?

643
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,546
I don't remember.

644
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,182
- Okay.
- And just so you know,

645
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,118
that's not the best question
for an event like this.

646
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,382
Why not?

647
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,722
I don't know. It just isn't.

648
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:49,851
Okay.

649
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,123
Can I buy you a drink?

650
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,168
I don't like tequila
anymore. It makes me vomit.

651
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,970
Well, okay, they
have other choices.

652
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,771
Glass of wine or a soda?

653
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,864
No, thank you.

654
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,069
Uh, that's a partner at a firm

655
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,013
that did some pro bono
work for us last month, so

656
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,642
I have to go thank him.

657
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,783

670
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,257
She runs the Rivington
Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic.

671
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,628
I wonder who brought her here.

672
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,556
I don't know.

673
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:01,893
Mingle.

674
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,366
You still think
people can't change?

675
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,062
He didn't.

676
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,002
He's an assassin who
murdered people for money.

677
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,173
Today was just one
more cold-blooded killing.

678
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,241
You helped him sacrifice his life
so that he could save someone else.

679
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,050
I am not a fan of what you did.

680
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,949
Look, even if it did prove...

681
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,721
He didn't sacrifice anything.

682
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,257
He died a long time ago.

683
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,927
His crew was probably gone.

684
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,092
In prison, he was a nobody.

685
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,827
And now he lives on as a hero

686
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,767
to Eric's family, to
the press, to you.

687
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,245

It's been a great night.

691
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,622
Three other lives
were saved as well.

692
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,292
Do his parents know what he did?

693
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,022
I wanna send them a card.

694
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,330
I know they're gonna be sad, but

695
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,833
I wanna tell them I'll take
good care of their son's liver.

696
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,174
I think that's a great idea.

697
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,296
Wow, this is impressive.

698
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,464
It's kind of like prom
but without the acne.

699
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,131

the MGM Grand last week.

Strawberry mango. It
comes with the lip gloss.

00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,260
