1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,291
- I was late.
- It's okay, sweetie,

2
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,946
- it's not your fault.
- I just wanted to play

3
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,994
one more game at Gary's.

4
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,370
What? You did great,
you called 911 right away.

5
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,033
- He looks dead.
- Daddy's not dead.

6
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,474
He's gonna be okay, right?

7
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,308
- He had a stroke.
- That's not possible.

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,211
Well, the CT confirmed
a ruptured aneurysm.

9
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,725
We have to operate
to clip the bleeding

10
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,561
- and reduce intracranial pressure.
- No, he had a stroke six years ago.

11
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:52,883
They put him on diltiazem.

12
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,274
We're gonna take
good care of your dad.

13
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,826
Naja Modi, 28 years old,

14
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,557
suffered a burn to her left hand
as a result of a cooking accident.

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,426
Are Jared and I being punished?

16
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,563
This is not a very
interesting case, is it?

17
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,998
Lesson one.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,204
Don't suggest to the head of Surgery
that working with the head of Surgery

19
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,738
is a form of punishment.

20
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,543
Dr. Melendez is very
unhappy with Jared

21
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,175
for how he got his job back.

22
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:29,221
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy
with me for taking two days off...

23
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,758
I don't think he wants
to talk about this, Shaun.

24
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,522
I was an idiot.

25
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,127
It's on the stove. Of
course, it's hot, right?

26
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,914
You wouldn't believe how often
we see these types of accidents.

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,470
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

28
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,402
Okay. What do we
need to do here, Murphy?

29
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,935
A superficial partial-thickness burn
should be managed conservatively.

30
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,036
Cleanse the area,
debride with soft gauze,

31
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,572
and then cover with an
antimicrobial petroleum dressing.

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,549
All of which means this should
heal with minimal scarring.

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,068
Naja, are you having chest pain?

34
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,091
I think I'm having a heart
attack. It's hard to breathe.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,787
Just relax if you can.

36
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,266
Put her on oxygen, a 12-lead EKG,
and order a portable chest X-ray.

37
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,552
Murphy, let's move. Come on.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,501
Her vitals are stable.

39
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:23,240
- What the hell's going on here?
- I don't know. But it is interesting.

40
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,234
We've got a
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

41
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,454
Suction. I need to
isolate the aneurysm.

42
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,524
Poor kid. Imagine
finding your dad like that.

43
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,795
Well, that's exactly
how I wanna die.

44
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,180
If the dad doesn't make it,

45
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,832
the kid will always
remember that moment,

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,099
be traumatized by it.

47
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,266
Because he loves him.

48
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,796
The idea of dying without
anybody getting hurt...

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,805
There's nothing sadder
than an empty waiting room.

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,045
Okay, what do you see?

51
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,481
A bulge on the anterior
communicating artery.

52
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,683
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm
is compromising blood flow

53
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,815
to the frontal lobe.

54
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,620
Prep an eleven-millimeter
standard clip.

55
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,391
- Are you married?
- Not anymore.

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,031
Turns out he had even
worse judgment than I did.

57
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,866
Speaking of creeps. You
hear Coyle got transferred?

58
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,233
I'm so glad they shut him down.

59
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,862
Yeah, I guess.

60
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,040
Just wish they'd spent the
money on a pediatric trauma pod.

61
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,905
They gave him a raise.

62
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,141
Clip.

63
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,849
The EKG confirmed you
weren't having a heart attack.

64
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,581
I wasn't faking. I
wouldn't do that.

65
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,748
We know.

66
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,098
The imaging also confirmed

67
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,953
that you have considerable
lung inflammation.

68
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,381
Is it possible you
inhaled smoke?

69
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,825
Well, I guess I must have.

70
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,730
There was a minor grease fire.

71
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,335
- What happens now?
- You need a bronchoscopy.

72
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,247
We put a camera down your throat
to see how much damage there is,

73
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,711
and what we need
to do to repair it.

74
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,903
But don't worry,
you'll be sedated.

75
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,032
Please don't.

76
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,939
Oh, I'm sorry, the test
is absolutely necessary.

77
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,445
The test is fine. But,
please don't touch me.

78
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,111
Except for medical purposes.

79
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,575
Yeah, of course.

80
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,956
That does not make sense.

81
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,963
A number of religions
have rules about touching.

82
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,226
- I don't quite get it, but...
- That makes sense.

83
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,633
People shouldn't touch people
unless there is a very good reason.

84
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,638
Okay, then what
doesn't make sense?

85
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,400
The grease fire.

86
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,904
The grease fire
explains the whole thing.

87
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,139
The burn, the smoke.

88
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,771
She told us she forgot
the stove was hot.

89
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,818
How can you forget
something's hot when it is on fire?

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,731
Shaun, I'm sure we would
have heard more of the story

91
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,155
if she hadn't suddenly thought
she was having a heart attack.

92
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,395
Why didn't you fire him?

93
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,243
Because his story
was different than yours.

94
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,307
And you believe his story?

95
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,332
I believe your story.

96
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,463
But you can't prove it,

97
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,737
and we simply can't make a
policy of believing every woman

98
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,574
who files a complaint
against every man.

99
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,646
After a few thousand
years of doing the opposite,

100
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,184
it wouldn't kill
us to overcorrect.

101
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,096
And the fact that your
boyfriend assaulted him

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,816
took away any leverage I had.

103
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,620
I did what I could.

104
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,990
I got him to take a position
where he has very little contact

105
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,356
with staff, with patients.

106
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,485
Outreach chair.

107
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,164
And it's a lousy assignment.

108
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,684
Sooner or later,
he's gonna quit.

109
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,959
And get a job somewhere else.

110
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,431
If you have any better ideas,

111
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,372
I look forward to hearing them.

112
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,366
You're very lucky.

113
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,888
The aneurysm was in a
small communicating artery.

114
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,772
We were able to restore blood
flow to the impacted brain areas.

115
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:02,954
He's gonna be okay.

116
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,122
Thank God.

117
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,135
Is this what life is gonna
be like from now on?

118
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,970
Are these things just
going to keep happening?

119
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,006
We're gonna keep
him here for a few days,

120
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,371
do some follow-up testing,

121
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,640
make some adjustments
to his medications.

122
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,408
Hopefully we'll find
out why this happened.

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,744
I have to go.

124
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,668
- Another one?
- Post-operative imaging showed

125
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,526
a 26 millimeter aneurysm
in the basilar artery.

126
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,686
That size and location,

127
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,323
we're looking at a
high risk of rupture.

128
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,061
He must have a
genetic predisposition.

129
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,929
Maybe a
connective-tissue disease.

130
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,670
All academic till we repair it.

131
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,816
Through the pharynx

132
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,002
and over to grandmother's
house we go.

133
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,704
There's the epiglottis
and the vocal cords.

134
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,133
I know you're not happy
that I sued the hospital,

135
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,195
but I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

136
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,708
That makes it simple.

137
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,945
I did it because I
want to be here.

138
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,857
I believe I can learn a lot from
you. Even from your doghouse.

139
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,605
I just hope you give
me a chance, sir.

140
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,519
There's the carina.

141
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,196
I'm gonna pass into the
mainstem bronchus of the left lung.

142
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,463
Is breaking up with
your fiancée traumatic?

143
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,730
When I saw a woman get shot,

144
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,438
everyone told me it was traumatic
and that I should be going home.

145
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,140
Should you be going home?

146
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,408
Give me a mucosal brush

147
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,280
- for a cellular sample.
- Loading it now.

148
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,445
How long does it take to get over a
breakup with the woman you love?

149
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,391
I'm seeing a lot of inflammation,
but no smoke damage.

150
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,588
That makes sense.

151
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,472
I thought we were doing this
because she inhaled smoke?

152
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,331
She said she inhaled
smoke. I didn't believe her.

153
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,046
Whatever the cause, the
inflammation and the damage are real.

154
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,561
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

155
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,334
If I move down here...

156
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,485
The scope breached
a bronchial wall.

157
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,603
- She's hemorrhaging.
- This is bad.

158
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,737
Prep the OR.

159
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,314
Type and cross two units
of blood. We've gotta move.

160
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,565
We know there was a burn.

161
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,952
Was it something
related to the grease fire,

162
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,684
or a separate,
coincidental injury?

163
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,830
You don't have a theory?

164
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,024
Or are you refusing
to talk to Jared?

165
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,732
I didn't answer
because it doesn't matter

166
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,087
until we can
repair this puncture

167
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,604
before bacteria passes
through and spreads an infection.

168
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,029
That's true.

169
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,198
Cut this suture.

170
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,173
Let's approximate
the edges with forceps.

171
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,272
Are you and Jared even now?

172
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,543
He made a mistake, so did you.

173
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,173
Exactly what mistake did I make?

174
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,445
This breach was your fault.

175
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,720
Is that traumatic?

176
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,525
I had breakfast by myself.

177
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,823
Where were you?

178
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,387
I'm sorry. Were we supposed
to have breakfast this morning?

179
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,493
I had an early consult.

180
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,367
Yes. We always have
breakfast on Mondays.

181
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,471
- We do?
- Every Monday.

182
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,308
Every Monday.

183
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,471
Thank you.

184
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,547
Well, I guess our streak
has been broken then, huh?

185
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,518
If someone punctures
the bronchus

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,747
during a routine bronchoscopy,
that's a mistake, right?

187
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,686
Well, I can't imagine
how it wouldn't be.

188
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,159
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

189
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,661
I'm wondering if I need
to report Dr. Melendez.

190
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,824
Dr. Melendez did that?

191
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,698
The protocol is very clear.

192
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,435
I need to report it.

193
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,240
But I've seen how
Jared is being treated.

194
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,778
Will Dr. Melendez treat
me badly if I report this?

195
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,376
He shouldn't, obviously. But
human nature being what...

196
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,611
Human nature?

197
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,287
Shaun, you know what? You
should make this decision for yourself.

198
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,395
In fact, you should make

199
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,765
all your decisions
yourself from here on in.

200
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,795
That's what we agreed on, right?

201
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,373
Have you considered an
endovascular embolization procedure?

202
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,608
I have. It's a little less risky,
but I haven't done as many.

203
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,777
So, I'm not sure which
way we're better off.

204
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,263
You want me to check the roster?

205
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,447
See if there's somebody
available with more experience?

206
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,148
I would like to assist, but yes.

207
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,417
Okay, here we go.

208
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,890
No, he's not available.

209
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,624
So make him available.

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,059
I got a husband and father

211
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,297
who presented with two
aneurysms in the last 12 hours.

212
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,269
I'd rather not. This
particular surgeon

213
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,572
was recently transferred.

214
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,605
Not a chance.

215
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,149
Coyle is the best available
surgeon for the job.

216
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,586
Coyle should have been fired.

217
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,466
And if he'd been fired,
he wouldn't be available.

218
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,570
And if he wasn't available,

219
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,225
you would be the
best person for the job.

220
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,324
Our ultimate duty
is to the patient.

221
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,023
No, it's not.

222
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,041
You agree he should
have been fired?

223
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,314
- Of course...
- Even if he was the best doctor

224
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,298
in the hospital, he should
have been fired, right?

225
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,100
Yes.

226
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,203
So some things have to matter
more than who is the most skilled.

227
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,938
If we forgive Coyle just
because he's good at something,

228
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,515
what does he do next?

229
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,616
Either he matters, or we matter.

230
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,161
Were you upset
during the procedure?

231
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,836
Did Murphy tell you
that I was traumatized?

232
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,514
You think that I might
have almost killed a person

233
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,631
because you dumped me?

234
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,884
The fact that you're
describing it as me dumping you

235
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,536
suggests that you are upset.

236
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,542
Look, I'm fine, you're
fine, nobody's upset.

237
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,807
Great.

238
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,647
But you do understand that I
have to ask you these questions?

239
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,648
That I need a
statement from you?

240
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,382
Yes. Here's my statement.

241
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,559
I wasn't distracted.
I didn't screw up.

242
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,154
Did you get all that?

243
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,585
Your bronchus was
punctured during the procedure,

244
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,943
- but it's been repaired.
- How? How could that happen?

245
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,574
Why did you lie?

246
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,544
You said that you inhaled smoke,
but there was no evidence of smoke.

247
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,078
So, what do you gain
by lying to your doctors?

248
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,585
I wasn't lying. I was
just confused, I guess.

249
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,027
I was in a lot of pain and it
was all happening so fast.

250
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,720
My stomach...

251
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,762
Naja, what are you feeling?

252
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,233
It's really sore and I
feel like I'm gonna...

253
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,843
Can we get some help over here?

254
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,038
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

255
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,104
Airway inflammation,
abdominal pain, nausea...

256
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,685
We need a full blood panel
and abdominal ultrasound.

257
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,912
The procedure will
seal off the aneurysm,

258
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,548
but there will almost certainly
be some brain damage.

259
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,218
Anything from mild visual
or speech disturbances

260
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,991
to significant paralysis.

261
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,292
But without the
surgery, he'll die.

262
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,167
No.

263
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,004
I won't consent
to the operation.

264
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,247
There really isn't
a lot of choice here.

265
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,117
- Without the operation...
- After his first stroke,

266
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,187
it took him so long to recover.

267
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,091
It was frustrating
and painful for him.

268
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,196
But he did recover.

269
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,030
He made it clear he'd never
want to live compromised.

270
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,167
Excuse me.

271
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,858
Thank you for having
breakfast with me.

272
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,451
My pleasure.

273
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,987
People lie a lot, don't they?

274
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,964
No, I meant it, Shaun. I'm
happy to spend time with you.

275
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,025
There are seven reasons
that I've thought of.

276
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,700
There may even be more.

277
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,640
Do people ever lie
without a reason?

278
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,732
No.

279
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,911
Reason number six.
I think you just lied.

280
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,747
I think you just lied
to avoid something.

281
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,654
- You don't like this conversation.
- Shaun? Shaun, I'm sorry.

282
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,558
I'm just... I'm just
a little distracted.

283
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,187
My aneurysm patient,
we're treating him

284
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,763
with blood pressure meds
to try and avoid a rupture.

285
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,060
You should do an
endovascular embolization.

286
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,660
He doesn't want one. It could
leave him with brain damage.

287
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,772
- I thought he was unconscious.
- He is.

288
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,707
But his wife knows
what he wants.

289
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,680
It's amazing. I just...

290
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,226
I don't think I'd
be able to do that.

291
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,112
She's sacrificing her
happiness, her future,

292
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,016
- just because she knows...
- She's lying.

293
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:26,016
She's lying. It could be
either reason number four, or...

294
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,924
No, she's not lying,
Shaun. She loves him.

295
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,519
- She doesn't love him.
- You haven't even met her.

296
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,207
You haven't seen
what she's like with him,

297
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,462
- with their son...
- I'm not good at reading people.

298
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,934
- Well, I am...
- I think people-reading

299
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,230
embraces personal biases.

300
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,199
I think we should
try to avoid biases.

301
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,078
Knowledge of human behavior

302
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,445
can help us make
informed, intuitive decisions.

303
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,145
My way is better.

304
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,617
It's based on
actions. She's lying.

305
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,978
Okay.

306
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,920
If you love someone,

307
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,717
you'll do anything to
prevent their death.

308
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,398
This situation, there seems
to be a conflict of interest.

309
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,176
So, I would like to bring in
someone else from legal to handle it.

310
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,337
Yeah, I agree.

311
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,180
You're an excellent
lawyer, but...

312
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,408
But what?

313
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,516
Do you think this is my problem?

314
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:27,977
It's understandable.

315
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,765
Forty-eight hours
ago, we were engaged.

316
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,452
And now, suddenly you're
supposed to be investigating me?

317
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,584
Yes.

318
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,025
And doing crazy
things like expecting you

319
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,927
to give me complete answers
to appropriate questions.

320
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,297
You were trusting Murphy's
judgment over mine.

321
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,595
His judgment about my demeanor.

322
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,095
Seriously?

323
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,000
I asked you a question.

324
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
You wanted me to screw up.

325
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,107
You did screw up. So what?

326
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,112
So we just deal with it.

327
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,107
But if you can't even admit

328
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,447
- that you're not always perfect...
- I am not perfect!

329
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,349
Clearly, I have made
mistakes in my life.

330
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,882
But not this time.

331
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,694
That punctured
bronchus was not my fault.

332
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,040
The nurse says his
vital signs are stable.

333
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,910
- No change.
- That's good.

334
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:42,686
It's such a great sacrifice

335
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,925
to respect his wishes
enough to let him go.

336
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,064
You must love your
husband very much.

337
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:06,615
But, there could be
another explanation.

338
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,182
Either you love him
enough to let him die,

339
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,921
or you hate him
enough to let him die.

340
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,729
You don't know what
you're talking about.

341
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,898
There is a doctor
here who harassed me.

342
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,131
He made me feel
vulnerable, worthless.

343
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,276
Neither of which I am.

344
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,280
But he never hurt me.

345
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:40,777
I can't imagine how
I would feel if he did.

346
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,120
What I would do.

347
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,422
What I would want to do to him.

348
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,843
What did your husband do to you?

349
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,561
He's a good father.

350
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,461
No, he's not.

351
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,738
A good father
doesn't hurt a mother.

352
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,133
Payton loves him.

353
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,834
- All the more reason...
- No.

354
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,647
Payton doesn't know
anything. He never can.

355
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,449
I know you're afraid
he'll come after you,

356
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,185
but there are
people who can help.

357
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,434
Payton is better off with the memory
of a loving father than the truth.

358
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,269
Let him die.

359
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,987
Methanol is causing
her abdominal pain.

360
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,524
She drank wood alcohol?

361
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,138
People drink whatever
they can drink.

362
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,028
Well, she's Muslim.
Wouldn't let me touch her.

363
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,962
Religious people aren't
immune to hypocrisy.

364
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,470
There are other ways to
explain the presence of methanol.

365
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,301
It's also produced by the liver

366
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,035
when the body is exposed
to certain caustic chemicals.

367
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,311
If inhaled, caustic chemicals
could also inflame the lungs.

368
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,678
And caustic chemicals also burn.
So it would explain all her symptoms.

369
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,527
Do you happen to have a list of
which caustic chemicals do all that?

370
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,486
Dimethyl sulfate.

371
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,249
It's used in the
pharmaceutical industry.

372
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,154
- She's a school teacher, Murphy.
- It's also used in water treatment,

373
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,490
industrial pesticides
and chemical weapons.

374
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,639
She has no reason
to be involved with

375
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,529
water treatment or
industrial pesticides.

376
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,762
But she could be a school
teacher and a terrorist.

377
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,168
So, what do we do?

378
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,335
The surgery.

379
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,278
We don't have her consent.

380
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,678
Technically, the issue is
we don't have his consent.

381
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,108
We go to the wife
because we can't get his.

382
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,804
The assumption being that she's
operating in his best interests.

383
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,767
Pretty sure that's
not happening here.

384
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,935
Go back to the wife, get
her to change her mind

385
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,052
or we'll take it to court.

386
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,752
Okay.

387
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:04,887
Hey, you look annoyed.

388
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,025
I'm annoyed we're sending him
home to keep abusing his wife.

389
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,229
She's a world-class liar.

390
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,214
I mean, for all we know,
she wants her husband dead

391
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,278
so that she can run off
with her Pilates instructor.

392
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,403
- I'll get the consent.
- Thank you.

393
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,144
She refused initial treatment
for methanol toxicity.

394
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,225
It's ethanol. Because she's
Muslim, she can't consume it.

395
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,880
She has alcohol in her system,

396
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,067
but won't let us put alcohol
in her system to treat it

397
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,931
because she doesn't
want alcohol in her system.

398
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,925
- We put her on...
- Dr. Murphy.

399
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,542
Is this part of your evidence
that she's a terrorist?

400
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,757
Because she's a Muslim?

401
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,210
There are billions of
Muslims that aren't terrorists.

402
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,669
Is that part of your
evidence that she's not?

403
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,435
I think she's a terrorist

404
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,669
because it's the easiest way to
explain her symptoms and her lie.

405
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,175
Do you have a way?

406
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,739
She had an
accident, it scared her.

407
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,170
Maybe we scare her.

408
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,909
Hell, maybe this
whole place scares her.

409
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,227
There are a lot of reasons
people don't tell the truth

410
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,395
other than criminal activity.

411
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,910
Six other reasons.

412
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,821
If a person comes in
with a gunshot wound,

413
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,290
we have to report it.

414
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,351
Why don't we have to report someone
who might be making chemical weapons?

415
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,965
Because unfounded accusations
can destroy people's lives.

416
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,634
Well, what does it matter
what people speculate

417
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,135
as long as the truth comes out?

418
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,934
Because people make up their
minds before the truth comes out.

419
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,072
Says the guy who played the race
card when he needed an advantage.

420
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,103
Even if you're right,
she's not making bombs

421
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,441
while she's in our ICU.

422
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:28,971
Also, you're wrong.

423
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,848
Keep me posted. If she's not
better in the next two hours,

424
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,508
I wanna know.

425
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,999
We need you to consent
to your husband's surgery.

426
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,894
I said no.

427
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,800
There's a better way, Tessa.

428
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,470
Leave him.

429
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,343
Start a new life.

430
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,174
I'm afraid.

431
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,481
I know.

432
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,654
But this,

433
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,059
this isn't the answer.

434
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,056
If you don't consent,
we'll take this to the court.

435
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,498
We'll tell a judge what we know.

436
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,368
I told you those
things in confidence.

437
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,430
You are not my
patient, your husband is.

438
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,102
Two things will happen.

439
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:37,279
We will get the consent and
Payton will find out the truth.

440
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,875
Tessa...

441
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,455
You are stronger
than you think you are.

442
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,772
Your methanol
toxicity is abating.

443
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,408
The treatment's working.

444
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,340
Great.

445
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,481
Do you think that I'll
be able to leave soon?

446
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:54,083
All of your symptoms are consistent
with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.

447
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,958
- I've never heard of dimethyl...
- Dimethyl sulfate is used

448
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,624
to make chemical weapons.

449
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,643
I didn't expect this from you.

450
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,608
I made a statement.

451
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,840
But you're different.

452
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,511
I have autism.

453
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,344
You've experienced bigotry.

454
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,612
Yes.

455
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,887
Have people
refused to serve you?

456
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:35,824
Have you seen people change
their flight because of you?

457
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,202
Have people cursed you out
before you've opened your mouth?

458
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:48,072
I'm not prejudiced,
I have evidence.

459
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,646
Nobody's prejudiced,

460
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,348
everybody has evidence.

461
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,719
And I'm always brown.

462
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,925
Maybe you're not so different.

463
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,156
You're sweating.

464
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,165
Perspiration is a
sign of dishonesty.

465
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,499
My chest...

466
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,176
Chest pain can be
brought on by anxiety.

467
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,374
But this time, you are
having a heart attack.

468
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,844
EKG, stat!

469
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,281
The endothelial lining

470
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,754
had moderate inflammation
that appeared acute,

471
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,755
and there was evidence
of mucosal edema.

472
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,285
I made no extraordinary motions,

473
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,090
nor did I apply any
unnecessary force.

474
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,691
And yet the bronchus
was punctured.

475
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,801
Which is a risk, albeit a small
one, with this kind of procedure.

476
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,469
Well, thank you.

477
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,907
I appreciate the
thoroughness of your answers.

478
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,401
Not sure I understood it all...

479
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,743
But I think I've
got what I need.

480
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,208
I probably shouldn't
say anything,

481
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,797
but I know you and Ms. Preston are
going through something right now.

482
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,882
- That really wasn't relevant.
- I know. I know. It's just...

483
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,551
I know she'll get
through it, but,

484
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,736
it's good you're
handling it better.

485
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,299
It's one thing to be distracted
while drafting a contract,

486
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,497
and a whole other thing
entirely doing what you do.

487
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,275
Inject dye.

488
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,082
Injecting dye.

489
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,418
Hanging a left at
the vertebral artery.

490
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,798
Okay, withdrawing
the guide wire.

491
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,168
Inserting the platinum matrix.

492
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,970
I mean, sometimes
you do the right thing

493
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,250
and things get a little better.

494
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,314
And sometimes things still suck.

495
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,841
Entering the aneurysm.

496
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,213
Okay.

497
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,621
- Blood pressure's spiking.
- Wait, why?

498
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,352
There's no rupture,
no bleeding, no stroke.

499
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,025
If his BP goes up any
higher, he will have a stroke.

500
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,463
I'm terminating the procedure.

501
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,161
Push 20 milligrams
of labetalol, stat.

502
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,909
We need to stabilize him
before we can retry the procedure.

503
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,347
Which means we need to
figure out what we missed.

504
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,709
This wasn't our fault.

505
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,911
His BP was stable going in.

506
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,965
He's been on calcium
channel blockers

507
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,833
- the last six years...
- Well, we missed something.

508
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,553
BP doesn't skyrocket
for no reason.

509
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,752
Run a full workup.

510
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,859
Why would a 28-year-old

511
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,868
with no risk factors
have a heart attack?

512
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,663
Mm.

513
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,099
Her heart is burning.

514
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:02,897
Burning?

515
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,374
From the caustic chemical.

516
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,838
- Murphy...
- It's going through her system.

517
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,015
Unlike thermal burns, chemical
burns get worse over time.

518
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,286
And it also explains
the punctured bronchus.

519
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,515
The caustic chemical
thinned the bronchial walls.

520
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,248
You did not make a mistake.

521
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,971
That's not the only explanation.

522
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,620
But I'll shut up now.

523
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,849
You think you have a good idea,
but you're going to shut yourself up?

524
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,528
It could be caused by an infection
from the bacteria that leaked,

525
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,461
as a result of the puncture.

526
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,634
The treatments are
diametrically opposed.

527
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:42,204
Antibiotics if it's infection,
steroids if it's inflammation.

528
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,251
If we give antibiotics and
she needs steroids instead,

529
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,717
it will suppress
her immune system,

530
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,653
causing the infection
to flourish and kill her.

531
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:52,216
If she needs steroids and
we give her antibiotics, then...

532
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,489
- I get it, we better be right.
- Yes.

533
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,792
Sir, I think we should bring
another senior attending in

534
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,957
- to consult on this decision.
- Why?

535
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,786
Because if Shaun's
right, you're exonerated.

536
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,712
And if I'm right, you may
have made the mistake

537
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,816
that could kill this woman.

538
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,239
You don't think I
can be objective?

539
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,072
I think you're
incredibly professional...

540
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,167
Shut up, Jared.

541
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,413
It is possible
that I screwed up.

542
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,207
Let's put her on broad
spectrum antibiotics.

543
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,917
You're wrong.

544
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:31,025
Making a decision on the assumption
you made a mistake is a mistake.

545
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,097
You're very arrogant.

546
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,031
It helps you be a great surgeon.

547
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,103
Fortunately, I don't
need your approval.

548
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,680
We've determined what
the underlying problem was.

549
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,993
What caused your husband's
aneurysm to rupture,

550
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,184
and why his blood
pressure spiked in the OR.

551
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,851
According to his labs, he
hasn't been taking his meds.

552
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,162
As far as I know, he has.

553
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,221
I mean, that's
just not like him.

554
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,505
We don't think
it's like him either.

555
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,903
You think I had
something to do with this?

556
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,663
That I what?

557
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,300
Threw his meds away?

558
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,636
He'd just order more.

559
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,743
But if you emptied his capsules

560
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,145
and filled them with
sugar, or even better, salt...

561
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,651
It would end your nightmare.

562
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,853
I was willing to let him die.

563
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,084
But I could never...

564
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,330
If I were strong
enough to kill him...

565
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,411
Is there a chance your son
knows more than you think he does?

566
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,563
Her heart rate's 90.

567
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,605
That's in the normal range.

568
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,040
But it was 83. It
should be going down.

569
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,711
All her other signs are normal.

570
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,881
You were right, this
is the proper treatment.

571
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,974
Ninety-five.

572
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,088
I'm switching her to steroids.

573
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,791
If we give her steroids, it will
suppress her immune system,

574
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,238
causing the
infection to flourish...

575
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm gonna push 40 milligrams
of methylprednisolone.

576
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,391
And she'll die.

577
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,091
This is on me.

578
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,993
I know.

579
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,907
We switched her to
methylprednisolone.

580
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,408
It's working.

581
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,012
You were wrong.

582
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,478
Yeah, I got that.

583
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,512
Just about the treatment choice.
You didn't do anything wrong

584
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:12,921
- in the OR.
- Don't kiss my ass.

585
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,153
Jared saved her life.

586
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,595
If he hadn't acted so
quickly, she would've died

587
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,463
and that would've
been your fault.

588
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,634
- Yes, it would've.
- You should thank him.

589
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,839
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

590
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,434
Hey. Can I help you?

591
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,535
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

592
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,905
You're my new
neighbor. Number 34.

593
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,602
Yeah. Cool.

594
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,307
- Do you wanna come in for a beer?
- No.

595
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,381
Nice work.

596
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,518
You, too.

597
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,422
You can have the honors.

598
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,966
This is the first time
I'm not looking forward

599
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,933
to telling the
family it went well.

600
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,557
You're going to be fine.

601
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,224
The treatment worked?

602
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,992
The second one did. The
first one almost killed you.

603
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,648
The fact that you're
alive right now is evidence

604
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,316
that you were working
with dimethyl sulfate.

605
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,775
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

606
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,941
My brother works
for a drug company.

607
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,644
They use dimethyl sulfate to
make one of their medications.

608
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,842
He stole some for me.

609
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,149
So you could make
a chemical weapon.

610
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,321
So I could make perfume.

611
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,153
Smell that.

612
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,537
It's beautiful.

613
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,038
But very stupid.

614
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,305
Yeah.

615
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,716
Especially since my brother would
get fired if anyone ever found out.

616
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,948
You believe her?

617
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,656
Protecting someone.

618
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,322
Reason number three.

619
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,063
So, we good?

620
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,110
The thing is, I'm not
sure it really matters.

621
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,374
I've been told I can only
have three residents next year.

622
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,502
- That's great.
- Not really.

623
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,005
Because of Coyle's
transfer, I have to take on his.

624
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,333
Reznick?

625
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:54,836
She's a pain.

626
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,974
Pain can be a
hell of a motivator.

627
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:58,706
Good luck.

628
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,414
You were right.

629
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,493
And I think you were right
that I wanted you to be wrong.

630
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,388
And I'm sorry.

631
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,091
You were right, too.

632
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,733
I kept telling myself
that I'm fine, but,

633
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,333
it's been hard.

634
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,901
Got me second-guessing myself,

635
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,038
maybe affecting my
judgment, I don't know.

636
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,178
If we're hurting so bad,
maybe we made a mistake.

637
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,746
No.

638
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,718
It just means that
what we had mattered.

639
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,819
It doesn't mean
that it was right.

640
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,129
I've also been thinking that

641
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,359
arrogance does make
me a better surgeon.

642
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,523
But it's not gonna make
me a better husband.

643
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,299
I'm sorry.

644
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,079
Kristin?

645
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,920
Hey, I'm Claire.

646
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,723
Hi. Thanks.

647
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,231
I am doing some
research on Dr. Coyle.

648
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,003
On the women who worked
with him and then quit.

649
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,338
I got another offer at SF Muni.

650
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,448
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

651
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,281
And I think you were, too.

652
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:59,328
Doing the right thing can
make things a little better.

653
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,698
Especially if we do it together.

654
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,272
Yeah.

655
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,631
I have a new neighbor.

656
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,292
Hmm. So, Lea's really gone, huh?

657
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,030
So, can we have
breakfast tomorrow?

658
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,138
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

659
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,239
We, um...

660
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,851
We talked about this, right?

661
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:52,316
I said that I would back
off if you stayed, right?

662
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,916
- More space, less fathering?
- I don't need a father,

663
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,426
I hate fathers.

664
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,063
- Right, so...
- I need a friend.

665
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:09,071
Shaun, I am someone who
can't help but give advice.

666
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,768
You know, I don't
know if I can not do that.

667
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,343
So, you think I can
change and you can't?

668
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,419
I think that we have a
certain kind of relationship,

669
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,521
and we can call it
something different if we want,

670
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,084
but we can't magically
make it different.

671
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,023
You said that you wanted space,
you said that you needed space.

672
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,137
I think you should be my friend.

673
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,640
Shaun...

674
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,391
Okay.

675
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,294
Shaun...

676
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,011
<i>What are you smelling right now?</i>

677
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,150
Pine trees.

678
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,955
Mm.
