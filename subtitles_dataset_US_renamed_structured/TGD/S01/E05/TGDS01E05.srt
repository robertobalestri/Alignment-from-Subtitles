00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,468
How hard can it be to just
act like a normal human being?

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,634
No!

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,678
Stop petting that stupid rabbit!

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,455
<i>We're never going home again.</i>

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,159
<i>We have each other,
and that's all we need.</i>

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,343
<i>My brother went to
heaven in front of my eyes.</i>

8
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,156
Never forget, you're the smart
one. And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,503
<i>I can throw in the hanger as
well, but I wanna get you ordering.</i>

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,053
<i>I only have 560 of these.</i>

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,155
- Dad?
<i>- This is $10 off...</i>

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,002
Hey! Penny. Hey.
I missed you, too.

13
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,869
No, Penny, come. Stay.

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,336
Hey, Dad.

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,141
Sorry it's so
early, I just landed.

16
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,180
Actually you're a bit late.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,674
Five weeks.

18
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,014
I know. I know.

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,513
I'm sorry. It's... It's...
It's a long story, okay?

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,493
But how was it?

21
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,757
It was your mother's funeral.

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,192
Dad, I...

23
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,836
Okay. Well, you
have my cell number...

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,438
It only works if you answer it.

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,780
Dad?

26
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,248
Dad?

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,353
Dad! Hey, hey.

28
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,227
Hey, are you okay? Are you okay?

29
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,232
You can't breathe? No? No. Okay.

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,426
I'm gonna call for help.

31
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,059
Hello, 911?

32
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,196
My dad collapsed. He
can't breathe. Please hurry.

33
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,364
Just hold on, Dad.

34
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,106
Good morning, everyone.

35
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,911
Right on time. What, did you sleep
here, or use a teleportation device?

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,048
I used a teleportation device.

37
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,722
Nonsensical questions
usually imply sarcasm,

38
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,228
which I've found people
often answer sarcastically.

39
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,555
Good one.

40
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,260
Trauma wants a consult
on a 66-year-old male

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,392
who collapsed from
severe anaphylaxis,

42
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,564
complicated by
respiratory arrest.

43
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,915
Now, his son just got
back from Thailand,

44
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,465
and almost immediately, the
father had his allergic reaction.

45
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,509
The patient has a few
allergies, pollen, mold, shellfish,

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,674
but no corresponding
allergens were in evidence.

47
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,877
Why are we doing a
surgical consult on an allergy?

48
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,749
No, we're not.
We're doing a consult

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,015
on the excruciating
abdominal pain he now has.

50
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,186
As you may have heard.

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,986
Mr. Wilks? Hi, I'm
Dr. Neil Melendez.

52
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,762
Heard you have
some abdominal pain.

53
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,069
The guy was in some serious pain,
10 milligrams of morphine worth.

54
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,938
Test results show elevated lipase,
amylase, pancreatic enzymes.

55
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,570
Pancreas is enlarged. Could be
pancreatitis, maybe alcohol-induced?

56
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,357
The son said he smelled alcohol
on his father at 6:00 in the morning.

57
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,579
And anaphylaxis has been known
to precipitate attacks of pancreatitis.

58
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,210
Guess that's it, then.

59
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,588
Meaning you totally disagree.

60
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,537
Not everyone who starts their day
off with a mimosa fries their pancreas.

61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,972
Your eyesight must be a whole lot
better than mine, because I can't see

62
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,431
the entire pancreas due
to the overlying bowel gas.

63
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,769
We'll order an abdominal
CT and take a better look.

64
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,931
There you go.

65
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,566
Where the hell's Murphy?

66
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,910
It's a severe fracture, but I
don't think you'll need pins.

67
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,008
Young bones tend
to heal very well.

68
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,413
<i>"Young Bones."</i> Isn't that a
<i>Star Trek: Origins</i> graphic novel?

69
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,009
Hmm.

70
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,579
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,216
No, that was a joke.

72
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,618
Where are your parents?

73
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,784
They're coming. They
both work in the city,

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,294
so it's a long drive for them.

75
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,726
I was on a school field trip
when I tripped over my own feet.

76
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,457
Of course, it was right
in front of Shelby Lomar.

77
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,766
At least it was pretty gross, so I
got some sympathy points for that.

78
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,639
I would expect this to have been
caused by a more serious accident.

79
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,646
Nope, just a trip.
I do that a lot.

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,981
What can I say, I'm clumsy.

81
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,245
Yes, now follow my finger.

82
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,152
You have some nystagmus,
an involuntary eye movement.

83
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,891
So, what's that mean?

84
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,261
When you fell, did
you hit your head?

85
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,124
No. What, you think I
have brain damage?

86
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,499
Nystagmus can be a sign
of a neurological issue.

87
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,099
Oh. Well, that would explain
the "C" I got in social studies.

88
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,468
That was another
joke, wasn't it?

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm going to order
a head CT for you.

90
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,441
Go for it.

91
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,564
Shaun, are you
getting any sleep?

92
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,612
Yes.

93
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,681
Really? I mean,
really getting sleep?

94
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,885
I got here on time.

95
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,018
Well, that's good.

96
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,925
I used a teleportation device.

97
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,629
Radiology form, please.

98
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,967
Shaun, that boy,
he looks like...

99
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,511
Steve. He does.

100
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,539
Is he related?

101
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,848
His name is Evan
Gallico, so I don't think so.

102
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,881
Wow. That is uncanny.

103
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,286
- Just coincidental.
- He looks exactly like your brother.

104
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,622
No, he doesn't.
His hair is shorter.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,386
It freaks me out. It
doesn't freak you out?

106
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,460
- No.
- It's okay if it does.

107
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,124
No, he's not
Steve. Steve's dead.

108
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,537
"I used a teleportation
device" was a joke.

109
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,735
Yeah, that's... That's good.

110
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,081
So, I couldn't come to Mom's
funeral because I fell in love.

111
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,194
She was another teacher
at the school. A Thai woman.

112
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,997
And she was kind, and
beautiful, and loving,

113
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,403
and very, very sick.

114
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,237
She had a congenital
heart defect.

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,881
Look, if you don't wanna
tell me where you've been

116
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,477
for the last six months,
then don't, it's your business.

117
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,317
But don't insult
my intelligence.

118
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,669
Well, I couldn't just leave her.

119
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,192
You couldn't leave her for five
minutes to make a phone call?

120
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,388
This a bad time?

121
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,531
No, come in.

122
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,363
According to the CT, you
have a lesion on your pancreas.

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,184
Well, what do you think
this lesion could be?

124
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,268
We're not sure. That's
why we need to biopsy it.

125
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,607
It could just be a benign cyst.

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,904
Or?

127
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,040
Or

128
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,045
It could be cancer, right?

129
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,580
We'll know soon enough.

130
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,439
<i>This won't take long.</i>

131
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,605
I know, I've had two of these.

132
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,337
One more and I
get my Scout badge.

133
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,605
That was funny.

134
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,517
<i>Tough to tell without looking at you,
but I'm guessing that was sarcasm.</i>

135
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:11,655
No. I have autism, which makes
it hard for me to read social cues.

136
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,419
<i>Jokes are difficult.</i>

137
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,860
I used to know a kid
with autism. Peter.

138
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,028
He was kinda
weird, but super-nice.

139
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,195
Used to know?

140
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,092
You don't know him anymore?

141
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:28,469
<i>He died. Hit by a car. You
know anyone who died?</i>

142
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,970
My brother.

143
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,137
<i>That sucks.</i>

144
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,143
Why did you have
the other CT scans?

145
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,550
<i>My parents have...</i>

146
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,782
<i>What's the word for
fear of getting sick?</i>

147
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,051
Hypochondriasis.

148
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,050
<i>No, worse than that.</i>

149
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,119
<i>They have nosophobia.
I love that word.</i>

150
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,288
What do you think
of Ms. Gannett?

151
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,792
She's nice.

152
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,995
I think she's callipygian.

153
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:58,995
She's what?

154
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,370
Callipygian? It means "having
shapely buttocks," Shaun.

155
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,567
Duh.

156
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,882
You read the dictionary?

157
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,416
<i>Where it lacks in plot,
it makes up for in vocab.</i>

158
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,680
So, you married?

159
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,983
<i>Girlfriend?</i>

160
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,150
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

161
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,887
<i>Tropical fish?</i>

162
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,421
- I like Lea.
<i>- Hmm.</i>

163
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,556
And who's Lea?

164
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,993
Lea is a friend.

165
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,659
<i>A friend you date?</i>

166
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,667
<i>A friend with benefits?</i>

167
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,999
I lend her batteries sometimes.

168
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,507
<i>I like where this is going.</i>

169
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,616
<i>So, you know, keep going
'cause if you don't, I will.</i>

170
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,951
<i>It's kinda my thing, you know?</i>

171
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,045
<i>Just constant talking.
It annoys everyone.</i>

172
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,214
Murphy.

173
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,122
<i>- Well, I guess not everyone.</i>
- Hey.

174
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,690
<i>- My family's pretty used to me...</i>
- Hey.

175
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,529
My friends are pretty
talkative, as well, so...

176
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,040
You're giving the
fractured arm a head CT?

177
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,123
Yes.

178
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,223
Get back to the pancreas.

179
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,134
He's not clumsy. He has a
brain tumor behind the inner ear.

180
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,862
Forget the pancreas.

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,878
Mr. and Mrs. Gallico?

182
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,378
- Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,019
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
I'm treating your son.

184
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,145
Well, how is he?

185
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,248
We were told it was a bad break,
but it should heal no problem.

186
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,722
I know why Evan tripped.

187
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,485
He has a tumor in the
temporal bone behind his left ear,

188
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,086
which is affecting his balance.

189
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,495
I've arranged for a consult

190
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,242
with Dr. Najid in
oncology, and she's going...

191
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,734
No, that won't be necessary.

192
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,731
We already have an oncologist.

193
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,307
Evan's been diagnosed
with stage-four osteosarcoma.

194
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,338
He was complaining
of a sore shin.

195
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,779
And the last thing that we
expected was bone cancer.

196
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,777
The doctors at SFM, they
gave him a year to live.

197
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,490
That was seven months ago.

198
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,019
Osteosarcoma explains
the severity of his fracture.

199
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,927
He will need pins
in his arm after all.

200
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,760
Can we see him?

201
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,664
Yes. He's in Room 414.

202
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,533
Dr. Murphy?

203
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,038
He doesn't know
about his diagnosis.

204
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,337
We would really like
to keep it that way.

205
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,653
He's the patient. Doesn't he
have the right to know the truth?

206
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,784
Well, no.

207
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,056
He's also a minor,
so, no, he doesn't.

208
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,597
Evan's very intelligent,
he'd be able to handle it.

209
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,157
Well, Shaun, maybe
it's not just about Evan,

210
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,635
maybe it's about
his parents as well.

211
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,233
Maybe it's just too difficult

212
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,807
for them to tell Evan
right now. I don't know.

213
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,486
Then they're the ones
who shouldn't be told.

214
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,072
Well, let me ask you this, Shaun.
What's so wrong about Evan

215
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,810
being allowed to enjoy as
much of his life as possible?

216
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,251
Evan wants to know the truth.

217
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,478
How do you know that?

218
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,025
If this were Steve, if
this were your brother,

219
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,563
would he wanna know the
truth? Is that what this is?

220
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,493
Dad's such a tool.

221
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,170
I found my birthday
present in their closet,

222
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,518
right where they always hide
it. I was just about to open it

223
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,408
when Dad caught me
snooping and freaked out.

224
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,240
I hate all that
phony surprise stuff.

225
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,509
It's an Aqua Blast Water Cannon.

226
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,245
I was with Mom
when she bought it.

227
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,080
Thank you, Shaun.

228
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,185
Your honesty's refreshing.

229
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,623
Yes, he would want
to know the truth.

230
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,357
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it.

231
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,599
It's not your decision,
it's theirs. He's their son.

232
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,608
Claire, I need you.

233
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,081
Sure, what's up?

234
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,291
I need someone to lie for me.

235
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,218
Okay.

236
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,590
I'm flattered?

237
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,727
Hey, Doc.

238
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,270
There's something I
need to tell my dad.

239
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,603
We haven't moved him.
He's still in room 326.

240
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,409
Do you have a medical
question for me?

241
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,342
Is he dying?

242
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,578
We don't know yet. The
biopsy will tell us more.

243
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,844
Okay.

244
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,855
My dad is a good guy.

245
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,292
We've just never been on
the same page, you know?

246
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,168
My mother was the
one that I could talk to.

247
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,363
Same for him.

248
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,666
So, without her,

249
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,707
we're both pretty useless.

250
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,211
Room 326.

251
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,380
Right.

252
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,232
Dr. Murphy called me
in for a second opinion.

253
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,526
You need some pins in your arm.

254
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,730
Why? What's changed?

255
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,335
Well, after studying
the radiology report,

256
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,841
given how bad the break is,

257
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,344
we just think it would be
a prudent step to ensure

258
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,847
an efficient and thorough
mending to the break.

259
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,175
Will I be able to
play baseball again?

260
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,809
Well, I don't see why not.

261
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,616
Once it's completely healed,
and after some physiotherapy.

262
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,316
How long before I can pitch?

263
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,585
It's hard to say.

264
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,992
He wanted someone
to lie for him.

265
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,328
And he picked you.

266
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,604
Merrill's son asked
for personal advice.

267
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,001
- And he picked you.
- I know, right?

268
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,335
He's lying to his
dad about something.

269
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,342
Yeah? What?

270
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,606
I don't know.

271
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,206
You didn't ask?

272
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,280
It didn't seem
relevant. Medically.

273
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,682
You know, it's not that
difficult to be a human being.

274
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,952
Just tell him to come clean.

275
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,361
Honesty's the best policy.

276
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,557
A lie is a stone in your heart.

277
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,356
Who said the last one?

278
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,759
- Me. I made it up.
- Huh.

279
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,865
And I got it.

280
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,187
He's anaphylactic.
Would you get me an epi?

281
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,722
- I'm coming out.
- His throat's constricting.

282
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:47,770
Pull the tube.

283
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,829
So, what's up with Dr. Browne?

284
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,390
She's Lea, isn't she?

285
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,868
Claire is my colleague.

286
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,462
Oh, come on, I saw the
way you were looking at her.

287
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,763
How?

288
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,737
I don't think I
looked like that.

289
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,980
Okay, so then why'd you
call her in for a consult?

290
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,307
Mmm...

291
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,743
Okay.

292
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,288
Yes, she's better at
talking to people than I am.

293
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,018
Wow, I counted,
like, 50 tells there.

294
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,154
- You really suck at lying.
- I know.

295
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,330
Too bad, it's an
important social skill.

296
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,765
So, how do you know when to lie?

297
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,071
When people need to know
things, they need to know.

298
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,438
If they don't, lie through your
teeth and feel good about it.

299
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,842
What if they need to know
the truth, but it'll hurt them?

300
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,782
Some can handle it, some can't.

301
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,043
So how do you know
who can and who can't?

302
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,583
You tell the truth.

303
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,624
If they like you after,
then you'll know.

304
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,060
If they don't, then it
doesn't really matter anyway.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,161
You have cancer.

306
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,871
Yeah, I know.

307
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,577
My parents took
me in for a sore leg.

308
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,018
After a whole bunch of tests,

309
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,320
they talked to the doctor and
came out, told me I was fine.

310
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,393
That's it. Just "fine."

311
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,425
The next day, they
bought me a PS4.

312
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,594
So, I googled my symptoms

313
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:52,105
and I narrowed it down to
osteosarcoma or growing pains.

314
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,500
Kids don't get gaming
systems for growing pains.

315
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,403
Hey.

316
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,436
It's okay.

317
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,945
I'm not afraid to die.

318
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,041
You're not?

319
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,056
Well, I mean, the dying
part will suck if it hurts,

320
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,284
but I'm not afraid about
the actual death part.

321
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,725
Because you believe
you're going to heaven?

322
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,257
Because I don't.

323
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,460
If I believe in heaven,
then I gotta believe in God.

324
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,529
Then I gotta believe
God made me sick.

325
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,473
How messed up is that?

326
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,868
It's just easier to think
that it's all random,

327
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,243
and when it's over, it's just...

328
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,778
Over.

329
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,957
So, what about Lea?

330
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,993
Where'd you guys meet?

331
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:50,888
In the hallway.

332
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,466
- That's a beautiful story.
- Yes.

333
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,333
She's my neighbor.

334
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,065
Convenient.

335
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,052
He had another
allergic reaction.

336
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,237
The pancreas?

337
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,673
Merrill Wilks, yeah.

338
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,045
And the second attack was
even more severe than the first.

339
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,346
It coincided with biopsying
the pancreatic lesion,

340
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,749
which now appears was a cyst.

341
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,997
Well, now we know he's
allergic to whatever's in that cyst.

342
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,499
We also know that the next cyst
that pops will probably kill him.

343
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,890
Well, if there is a next.
Let's run a couple of tests,

344
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,690
see if there's any evidence of
parasites and MRI his entire body.

345
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,162
If we're lucky, he only had the
two cysts and he can go home.

346
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,526
Are you looking for loopholes?

347
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,294
Hoping to save Evan?

348
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,996
Everyone makes mistakes.

349
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,439
Which means you should
double-check every file in the hospital.

350
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,180
The oncologist flagged his
neutrophil count of 634 as low.

351
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,441
- That is low.
- Below normal.

352
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,712
I can still hear the
word "low" in there.

353
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,723
He's just a kid. I know how
hard it is to think of him dying.

354
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,023
He's okay with that.

355
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,697
I find that hard to believe.

356
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,993
We all die. If we accepted
that, we'd be happier.

357
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,896
Maybe, but we're not
good with contentment.

358
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,135
Fighting death is
what keeps us alive.

359
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,241
Okay.

360
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,813
We got a hit. Echinococcus.

361
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,790
Echinococcus? The cysts
are filled with tapeworms?

362
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,486
"Cysts?" There are more?

363
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,960
- Three more?
- Four more.

364
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,428
You missed the one in his brain.

365
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,925
- Dr. Glassman?
- Yeah.

366
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,327
You used to be a
neurosurgeon, right?

367
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,565
So they say.

368
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,900
Take this, will you?

369
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,041
I need one. Who'd you recommend?

370
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,170
What you got?

371
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,251
Wow, that's cool.

372
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,520
How the hell did I get
tapeworms in my head?

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,254
No idea, but you do.

374
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,758
You can pick up the eggs
from coyotes or wolves.

375
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,831
Have you been hanging
around coyotes or wolves?

376
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,367
I live in the suburbs, we
don't even have a petting zoo.

377
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,699
You might have had these
cysts for quite some time.

378
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,302
When one of them burst,

379
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,278
that's what caused
the first allergic reaction.

380
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,635
Well, why did it burst?

381
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,232
Why did it burst?

382
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,744
Any sudden movements,
twists, turn, squeeze.

383
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,947
- A hug?
- Could be.

384
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,252
But you weren't there
for the second one.

385
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,888
I punctured the cyst on your
pancreas during the biopsy.

386
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,052
As you've seen, allergic reactions
get worse each time they happen.

387
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,927
So, a third one,
that would be bad,

388
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,365
that would be... That
would be very bad.

389
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,767
So we're gonna have to surgically
remove all of the cysts intact.

390
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,234
Dr. Glassman's one of the most
highly-acclaimed neurosurgeons

391
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,105
in the state. You are
very lucky to have him.

392
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,476
And Dr. Kalu is fast becoming
a very accomplished flatterer.

393
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,009
The cranial cyst,
that is a big deal.

394
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,444
We're gonna have to take
off the top of your skull.

395
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,411
You'll be digging into my brain?

396
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,288
Well, yeah, pretty
much. With saline.

397
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,019
We use it to gently displace
the cyst, and then, puff.

398
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,561
It magically pops out. Kind
of like delivering a baby.

399
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,790
You know, if childbirth
were painless.

400
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,191
And then we move
on to the other cysts.

401
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,527
Hey, we're gonna
take good care of you.

402
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,731
Evan doesn't have cancer.

403
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,699
It might not be cancer.

404
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,618
It might not be cancer.

405
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,189
Look at you on
time. Two for two.

406
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,627
It might not be cancer!

407
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,187
- The fractured arm?
- Yes.

408
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,493
You said he'd been diagnosed
with stage-four osteosarcoma.

409
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,059
Evan was diagnosed with
the flu eight months ago,

410
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,868
but his symptoms were actually
a better fit with Epstein-Barr virus,

411
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,171
which is linked to
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

412
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,007
which causes osteolytic lesions in
the long bones of the upper limbs.

413
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,980
And those lesions could be
misdiagnosed as signs of osteosarcoma.

414
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,482
- Yes.
- What about his brain tumor?

415
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,745
Langerhans can also
manifest in the skull.

416
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,097
Instead of a death sentence,
he could have something

417
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,090
that could easily be
treated with prednisone?

418
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,059
Next, we need to do a
bone-marrow aspiration to confirm.

419
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,592
I assume you looked at his file?

420
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,720
For a very long time.

421
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,308
Well, there must've been a biopsy.
What did the pathology report say?

422
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,791
Yes, there were two biopsies,
both were positive for osteosarcoma.

423
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,498
Murphy.

424
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,005
They could be false-positives.

425
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,904
Do you have any idea how unlikely
it is to have two false-positives?

426
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,068
0.3%.

427
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,821
Which we can comfortably
round off to "not likely."

428
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,904
It is possible...

429
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,109
Yes, but it means telling the parents
of a dying child that there's hope,

430
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,310
when really, there isn't.

431
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,245
Grab a shower and
get ready for rounds.

432
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,617
Wow.

433
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,289
- Imaginative and creative.
- Yes.

434
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,774
What are the
chances you're right?

435
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,857
0.3%.

436
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,196
Well, 330-to-1.

437
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,758
333-to-1.

438
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,068
You really think that it's worth
putting Evan's parents through all this?

439
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,269
Of course. If we
did this 333 times,

440
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,778
we'd be giving false
hope to 332 people

441
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,280
for approximately four hours,

442
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,816
and we'd save one
life. Isn't that worth it?

443
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,144
Anyway, Dr. Melendez won't
let me ask for a consent to test.

444
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,222
What if I don't tell
them what I'm doing?

445
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,289
A blatant ethics violation,
that's your solution?

446
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,794
Yes. How do I do that?

447
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:40,132
Well, you do it, and then
you don't tell anyone. No one.

448
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,505
If anyone asks, your attending
noticed a low RBC count

449
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,568
and needed to find the
cause. That's it, no biggie.

450
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,204
Hmm.

451
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,656
You know Wilks' Grocery?
Santa Clara and 17th?

452
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,095
It's been an institution
for nearly 60 years.

453
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,333
My grandparents
started it in 1958,

454
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,097
and my wife and I
took it over in '82.

455
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,163
But when my wife got sick,
and I started talking to Kevin

456
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,232
about taking it
over, he just took off.

457
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,447
To him, it was just a place
to sell lettuce and toilet paper.

458
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,954
My father chairs a real-estate
development company in the UK.

459
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,652
Thought I'd be the perfect
person to set up the US office.

460
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,956
You wanted to be in
the helping profession?

461
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,888
I wanted to be in my profession.

462
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,233
It's not about how small
or how big the venture is,

463
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,201
it's about doing
something that's yours.

464
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,295
I guess.

465
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,809
When he was little,
we were inseparable.

466
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,652
He used to love to
come to the store.

467
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,081
To work.

468
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,192
I even had a little
apron made for him,

469
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,559
had his name on it, too.

470
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,633
Still, you know,
kids... Grow up.

471
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,638
I'm just grateful that he
stayed close to his mother.

472
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,471
He could talk to
her, tell her anything.

473
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,804
So could I.

474
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,116
And when she went,

475
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,317
I lost them both.

476
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,353
Looks like he's back now.

477
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,994
All I know is he ditched
me when I needed him.

478
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,328
Well, you know, as a
wise person once said,

479
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,668
"Holding a grudge is
a stone in your heart."

480
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,538
What's that for?

481
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,378
Local anesthetic for a
bone-marrow aspiration.

482
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,214
Why do I need a
bone-marrow aspiration?

483
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,953
My attending saw a low RBC
count and wants to find the cause.

484
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,149
No biggie.

485
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,086
"No biggie?"

486
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,185
You're lying.

487
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:18,855
What's going on?

488
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,027
You already told me I
have terminal cancer,

489
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,328
what's worse than that?

490
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,864
You might not.

491
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,002
Might not be osteosarcoma,

492
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,743
might be Langerhans cell
histiocytosis, which is treatable.

493
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,684
"Treatable?" As
in I might not die?

494
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,517
That's why I need to
aspirate, to find out for sure.

495
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,922
Do my parents know?

496
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,527
I was told not to
get their hopes up.

497
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,021
Then let's do it
before they get back.

498
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,659
Roll onto your side.

499
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,843
Is there a Scout
badge for aspirations?

500
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,509
I think someone
just made a joke.

501
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,146
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

502
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,350
Painkiller. My arm hurts.

503
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,760
That wouldn't explain why I'd
be injecting your lumbar region.

504
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,626
Okay.

505
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,035
Yes, hello. I think Evan may have
been misdiagnosed with cancer.

506
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,474
I think he has something

507
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,170
that creates bone lesions
that look like osteosarcoma.

508
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,577
It's a small chance,
0.3%, but I...

509
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,775
You... You told Evan
that he has cancer?

510
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,383
And now you are telling
him, and us, that he doesn't?

511
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,852
I'm telling you he might not.

512
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,821
That's why I need to
perform this aspiration.

513
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,858
He says whatever I
have might be treatable.

514
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,052
- Are you insane?
- No, I am not insane.

515
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,186
I thought you'd be happy!

516
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,040
There is a significant link between
Langerhans cell histiocytosis and...

517
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,293
Get out. Go. Get out.

518
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,668
Let me get you some water.

519
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,510
- Oh, my God.
- Dad's right here. Right here.

520
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,641
Respiratory, stat!

521
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,889
He has a massive embolus,
probably thrown from his fracture.

522
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,926
It's located at the bifurcation
of the pulmonary arteries.

523
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,551
He's close to
hemodynamic collapse.

524
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,721
Yeah, no kidding.

525
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,923
I'd like to assist.

526
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,591
Not a chance.

527
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,767
Okay. I'd like to assist.

528
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,236
You're obviously
too close to the case.

529
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,295
I think I'm just the
right amount of close.

530
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,897
Murphy, you lied to the parents

531
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,685
just so you could try to
prove your ridiculous theory.

532
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,007
You're too damn close.

533
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,041
Saddle embolism. Scrub in.

534
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,483
We have to get rid of the
embolus before he arrests.

535
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,101
His heart is barely
pumping blood.

536
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,616
I can feel the pulmonary artery,

537
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,060
I just need to find
the obstruction. There.

538
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,392
I got it. Knife.

539
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,966
EKG's showing right heart strain.
He can't take this much longer.

540
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,627
I know, but if I
move any quicker,

541
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,702
I could nick the left main
artery and kill the boy.

542
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,676
The phrase "no
biggie" gave me away.

543
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,908
You really gotta learn
how to lie, Shaun.

544
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,011
Am I in trouble?

545
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,375
Yes.

546
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,215
Unless you're right.

547
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,021
If I'm wrong, they
shouldn't be upset.

548
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,889
They know it's highly unlikely.

549
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,933
False hope, Shaun,
it's just plain cruel.

550
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,846
Hey. Did he talk to you?

551
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,180
Did you talk to him?

552
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,289
I don't know what to tell him.

553
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,397
You love your father, don't you?

554
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,728
Yeah, of course.

555
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,853
Right, well, he's about
to go into brain surgery.

556
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,339
There's huge risks
involved. Whatever this lie is,

557
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,965
can you live the rest of your
life knowing you kept it from him?

558
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,412
My... My girlfriend wasn't sick.

559
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,821
Okay? She dumped me.

560
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,496
She's married, with two kids,
had no intention of leaving them.

561
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,626
I... I was an idiot.

562
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,892
You got your heart broken.
That's the problem here?

563
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,128
No. No, Dad.

564
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,065
The problem is,

565
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:57,406
I didn't run away to Thailand because I
thought Wilks' Grocery was beneath me.

566
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:03,282
I was afraid that I would
never be able to fill your shoes.

567
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,649
And then I proved myself right.

568
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,104
Left pulmonary artery's
open. Ring forceps.

569
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,465
Ring forceps.

570
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,536
Come on.

571
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,706
Got it.

572
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,812
EKG is normalizing.

573
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,190
He's okay. Nice job.

574
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,156
All right, flush the left
pulmonary artery, close him up.

575
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,488
Okay.

576
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,468
Um, Dr. Melendez,

577
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,671
take a look at this.

578
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,929
Recycling, Shaun,

579
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,495
very responsible.

580
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,664
It's a book.

581
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,368
I appreciate that.

582
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,678
Thanks, Shaun.

583
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,520
Hey.

584
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,694
We got the embolism.

585
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,396
He's in recovery
and he's doing fine.

586
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,737
But, while we were in there,
we did find something else.

587
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,904
Lesions on his ribs.

588
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,409
Irrefutable proof
of osteosarcoma.

589
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,745
It's metastasized
to his chest cavity.

590
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,548
I'm sorry.

591
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,125
I'm very sorry.

592
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,787
Give that a nice,
warm, saline bath.

593
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,295
Forceps and Taylor
scissors, please.

594
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,108
- Forceps and scissors.
- Thank you.

595
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,532
Look at that.

596
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:20,042
That's what built the pyramids,
painted the <i>Mona Lisa...</i>

597
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,545
Invented the Internet.

598
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,084
And there is our interloper.

599
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,477
Squeezeball, please, Dietra.

600
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,980
"Squeezeball"?

601
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,416
His name for it, not ours.

602
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,817
The saline gently
displaces the cyst,

603
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,794
and will coax it out
of its little hiding place.

604
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,392
Hopefully in one piece,
so we don't have to call 911.

605
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,366
Come on now.

606
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,533
Tray, please.

607
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,602
There we go.

608
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,203
There we go.

609
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,910
And you got it.

610
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,706
Got it.

611
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,342
He has his father's eyes.

612
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,543
That was incredible.

613
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,848
One down, three to go.

614
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,230
Hey, there he is.

615
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,362
Hi, sweetie.

616
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,431
What's the matter?

617
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,901
Nothing, we're just
happy. You did so great.

618
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,809
You had what's
called an embolism.

619
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,809
It clogged an
artery in your lungs,

620
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,781
but the good news is they got it

621
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,223
and you're gonna be just fine.

622
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,549
Hmm.

623
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,588
Still, too bad about
the cancer, huh?

624
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,991
No. No, no, no. The doctor did not
know what he was talking about...

625
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,657
Dad, I know all about it.

626
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,159
I have for a long time.

627
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,067
I am so sorry.

628
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,838
It's okay.

629
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,462
Because I'm not gonna be alone.

630
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,128
Grandma's gonna be there, too.

631
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,863
Auntie Arlene.

632
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,433
Uncle Jim, if he figured
out how to stop swearing.

633
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,505
I'll get you some water, buddy.

634
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,894
So, I took Penny for a
walk, just around the block.

635
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,228
And I picked her up some of
those rawhide treats, you know,

636
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,505
the ones that Mom
used to like to give to her.

637
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,371
I miss her, Dad.

638
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,573
Coast is clear?

639
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,644
Yes.

640
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,744
Thank you.

641
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,380
I was wrong.

642
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,849
You tried.

643
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,118
I was wrong.

644
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,389
Your parents hate me.

645
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,522
I know.

646
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,895
I gave you false hope.

647
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:04,469
Yeah. But for a minute
there, it was pretty awesome.

648
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,536
I'm going to ask
you for a favor.

649
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,778
Well, I'm not giving
away my Make-A-Wish.

650
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,372
Would you mind if I
read you something?

651
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,639
It's not long.

652
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,611
That, I can do.

653
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,328
"Atticus was right.

654
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:36,157

Sounds like a good book.
