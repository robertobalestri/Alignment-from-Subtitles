1
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,563
<i>Autism, a mental condition</i>

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,905
characterized by
difficulty in communicating.

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,172
Does it sound like I'm
describing a surgeon?

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,474
You saved his life.

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,139
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,809
Never forget, you're the smart
one. And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

7
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,249
My brother went to heaven...

8
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,118
<i>In front of my eyes.</i>

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,656
He's got a serious deficit.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,422
We hire Shaun, and we give
hope to those people with limitations

11
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,432
that those limitations are
not what they think they are.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,498
That they do have a shot.

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,</i>

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,341
I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

15
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,216
Where to?

16
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,221
San Jose Saint
Bonaventure Hospital.

17
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm a surgical resident.
Today's my first full day.

18
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,528
I meant floor.

19
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,198
Oh. Ground floor.

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,334
I'm taking the bus.

21
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,782
<i>This is Mitchell Brand,</i>

22
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,082
55 years old, post-op day one
from a radical prostatectomy.

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,052
Morning, Mitchell.
I'm Dr. Melendez.

24
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,455
These are my residents,
Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu.

25
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,383
Your surgery went perfectly.

26
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,291
Yeah? Am I ever
gonna walk again?

27
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,623
Yes, of course.

28
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,695
This is Mitchell Brand,
I reviewed his chart.

29
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,896
He's 55 years old, from Chicago,
divorced with two children.

30
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,231
You did a radical
prostatectomy on him yesterday.

31
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,575
There are many possible complications
but none related to motor neurons.

32
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,775
There is no chance you
won't be able to walk.

33
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,247
He... He wasn't
worried about his legs.

34
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,251
Oh, yes.

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,721
There's a significant
chance of impotence.

36
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,458
Dr. Murphy, you're late.

37
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,250
The bus was late.

38
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,725
The schedule was
clear. They post it online.

39
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,107
But the 4 bus was
late, which meant...

40
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,976
- You're late.
- Five minutes. We've all been...

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,595
On your first day, no less. It is
your responsibility to be here.

42
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,900
If you are not, you have
failed in your responsibility,

43
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,805
- which makes it your fault.
- Okay. How can it be my fault?

44
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,499
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

45
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,787
This is gonna work out great.

46
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,406
The board clearly made
the right choice in hiring you.

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,846
Thank you.

48
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,918
Dr. Melendez, we've got an
emergent consult in the ER.

49
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,093
You should be fine if you leave
it alone for a couple of days.

50
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,586
Four days of indigestion,
bloating, constipation, and nausea.

51
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,129
And a lot of pain, apparently.

52
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,026
Did you give her morphine?

53
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,497
Yeah, 10 milligrams. It
hasn't touched her pain.

54
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,041
You have time to get a CT?

55
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,961
Yeah. That's why I called you.

56
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,975
It's very big.

57
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,005
Yes, it is.

58
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,808
What are we looking at?

59
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,813
It's definitely abutting the
aorta and the left kidney.

60
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,683
Renal angiomyolipoma?

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,932
Do you see an
extensive blood supply?

62
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:16,980
No.

63
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,058
Maybe some kind of neurogenic
tumor. Or maybe a lymphoma.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,057
She has a sarcoma,
a malignant tumor.

65
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,321
"Malignant"?

66
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,758
That means it's
killing me, right?

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,166
- Yes.
- Not necessarily.

68
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,555
We're just
speculating right now.

69
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,601
No, it's definitely malignant.
If it weren't malignant...

70
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,005
- Please stop saying "malignant."
- Shall we talk outside?

71
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,840
Give her more morphine.
As much as she wants.

72
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,141
Okay.

73
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,207
Hang in there.

74
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,144
You scared her.

75
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,088
- You didn't need to be so blunt.
- Why?

76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,819
Her prognosis is terminal without
immediate medical intervention.

77
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,527
Isn't that scary?

78
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,593
Well, that fear
does her no good.

79
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,326
Does she have a
malignant sarcoma?

80
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,901
Are we gonna be
doing a laparotomy?

81
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,539
We'd need intra-operative
staging with a biopsy,

82
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,601
extensive dissection
of the retroperitoneum,

83
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,072
and excision of the mass
with wide, clear margins.

84
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,873
I want in.

85
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,060
You do know you're
drooling, right?

86
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,882
About cutting open
a 40-year-old woman.

87
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,393
Real person. Right
behind that door.

88
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,534
It's called bedside manner.

89
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,189
No such thing as
outside-the-door manner.

90
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,017
It is exciting, Claire.

91
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,958
We'd be saving a life.
And we'd be learning.

92
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,293
- See?
- Dr. Browne, you're my number two.

93
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,396
With all due respect, Doctor...

94
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,027
Comments that start that way
rarely come across that way.

95
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,514
I was going to say
that's an excellent call.

96
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,973
Thank you. Jared,
prep the surgical team.

97
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,234
Sir, what do I do?

98
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,578
- Scut work.
- What's scut work?

99
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,383
Today I'm gonna need my
surgeons to have no distractions.

100
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,276
So I'm gonna need you to
handle those distractions.

101
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,049
All the work they do every
day that they hate doing...

102
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,956
You're handling it for them.

103
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,465
Make sure they know we still
need a consent on that one.

104
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,571
- Am I being punished for something?
- No.

105
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,137
Okay.

106
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,081
So that's it?

107
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,016
You just accept my
answer at face value?

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,286
Why?

109
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,918
You're very arrogant.

110
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,993
Arrogant people don't
think they need to lie.

111
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,793
So, you must be
doing this to teach me.

112
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,093
I look forward to
learning from scut work.

113
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,196
Say, "Ah."

114
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,471
- How long will this be?
- Seven minutes.

115
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,035
Without any complications,
it takes seven minutes

116
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,206
to do a discharge
examination properly.

117
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,007
Dr. Dunsmuir has already cleared
him to go and we need the bed.

118
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,219
Okay. Protocol requires that the
surgical department also clears him.

119
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,823
You have an ear infection.

120
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,336
Yes, that's why he's here.

121
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,296
My hearing's been a little
muffled and I've had some ringing.

122
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,194
They gave him amoxicillin,
and we're sending him home.

123
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,493
Which is why you're
here. To send him home.

124
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,964
I'd like an MRI of the head
and internal auditory meatus.

125
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm not being discharged?
What do you think is wrong?

126
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,211
I'll tell you when
I know for sure.

127
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,175
I don't wanna scare you.

128
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,594
Shaun. What are
you doing down here?

129
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,892
I'm waiting for her to fart.

130
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,628
Flatulence. But I'm using the
word "fart" in front of the patient

131
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,968
to be more casual.

132
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,250
But you're the
president of the hospital,

133
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,708
so I'll say "flatulence" to you.

134
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,911
Well, I appreciate that.

135
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,006
Why are you doing that?

136
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,115
She had her deviated septum
repaired. Before we can release her,

137
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,743
we have to be sure she isn't
suffering from postoperative ileus.

138
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,493
This is what Dr. Melendez feels
you'll be most useful doing today?

139
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,119
Waiting for farts?

140
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm not just waiting for farts.

141
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,395
- Thank goodness.
- I'm doing all the scut work.

142
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,968
Well, welcome to
your surgical residency.

143
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,236
Thank you.

144
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,305
There. I think that was it.

145
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,420
I don't think so.

146
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,488
I'll wait a little longer.
This is important.

147
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,594
The procedure is
called a laparotomy.

148
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,758
Yeah, your heart sounds good.

149
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,972
So, we make a long incision
down the middle of your abdomen...

150
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,165
- Expose the tumor...
- Am I going to die?

151
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,211
Dr. Melendez is the best
surgeon I have ever seen...

152
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,475
Can this all wait?

153
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,660
You have a very serious
condition. It's not advisable to...

154
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,984
Just a couple of weeks. My son
is getting married next weekend.

155
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,620
They look very happy.

156
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,020
After the initial incision...

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,426
They've been planning this for
months. If they have to reschedule...

158
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,191
Well, this is complicated
surgery, but if all goes well,

159
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,159
recovery's pretty easy.

160
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,200
No need to reschedule anything.

161
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,607
And if it doesn't?
If it doesn't go well?

162
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,505
My husband died in a car
accident a couple of years ago.

163
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,778
Mark is our only child.

164
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,882
I can't die right before
his wedding. I can't.

165
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,228
You're not gonna die.

166
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,727
You will be at the
wedding. Looking beautiful.

167
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,627
Okay.

168
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,677
You're not supposed to make
promises like that, Dr. Browne.

169
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,509
I told her what
she needed to hear.

170
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,913
Officially, our legal department's
policy is to tell the ugly truth.

171
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,249
The uglier the better.
Is that what you did?

172
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,565
- I don't think that's what you did.
- Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy.

173
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,067
She needs to have the surgery.
Scaring her would change nothing.

174
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,003
Right. Because a much better policy
would be to lie to all of our patients

175
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,371
whenever it makes
you feel better.

176
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,229
No, it doesn't make me feel
better. It makes her feel better.

177
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,726
I'm pathetic.

178
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,272
- What?
- I am pathetic.

179
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,934
And here's my thinking,
so just bear with me

180
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,070
because it kind of
insults both of us.

181
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,743
You met that woman an
hour ago and you lied to her.

182
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,384
A pity lie because you
obviously care about her.

183
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,119
A pity lie that has absolutely
zero upside for you.

184
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,213
But I can't make you,

185
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,418
the world's softest
touch, care about me.

186
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,761
Hey.

187
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,476
I need a consult.

188
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,377
You have a question about this?

189
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,417
This patient's
perfectly healthy.

190
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,195
There's not even any
artifact on these images.

191
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,155
Yeah. Which, in turn, raises
an interesting medical question.

192
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,086
Why the hell did this
patient get an MRI?

193
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,112
I don't know
anything about this.

194
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,925
Yeah. Someone on your team
ordered it. It's your responsibility,

195
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,555
which makes it your fault.

196
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,858
How did you...

197
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,934
It's my department, it's
my job to know everything.

198
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,402
Well, then, since
I work for you,

199
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,311
doesn't that make all
this actually your fault?

200
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,139
Sorry. I stopped listening
after "I work for you."

201
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,816
- Does that hurt?
- Yes.

202
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,584
- Does that hurt?
- Yes.

203
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,499
- Does that hurt?
- How much are we paying for this?

204
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,651
She has a tummy ache.
That's what they do, they ache.

205
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,759
She's just trying to
get out of school. Again.

206
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,405
Where do you think
she learned that from?

207
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,739
You don't think she
hears you calling in sick

208
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,527
to work right before
you go golfing?

209
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,794
I like school.

210
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,963
Me, too. What did you
eat for dinner last night?

211
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,777
- Cereal.
- I thought you made meatloaf.

212
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,952
I did. And it got cold while
we were waiting for you.

213
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,643
I want D-dimer,
lactate, and amylase...

214
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,312
What tests are you ordering?

215
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,514
D-dimer, lactate, and amylase.

216
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,282
- For a tummy ache, hmm?
- Yes.

217
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,812
I'm concerned it may be...

218
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,987
Shall we talk outside?

219
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,361
- Told you something was wrong.
- You're happy she might be sick?

220
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,120
- I'm happy you're wrong.
- Yeah, let's talk outside.

221
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,501
Have they been bickering
like that the whole time?

222
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,629
I didn't notice.
They aren't sick.

223
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,902
Yeah, they're what
we call a vector.

224
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,332
A carrier. A cause of disease.

225
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,435
- You mean the parents?
- Yeah.

226
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,139
That little girl
has a tummy ache

227
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,307
because Mommy and
Daddy won't stop fighting.

228
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,059
This isn't a medical
issue. Send them home.

229
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,019
It could be intestinal malrotation,
which could quickly become fatal.

230
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,273
And every patient in this
hospital could have malaria,

231
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,866
but that doesn't mean
we're gonna go around

232
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,835
testing for every condition
we think they could have.

233
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,920
For example, that MRI you ordered
on the guy with the ear infection?

234
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,221
- Nice call, genius.
- Thank you.

235
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,994
I was being sarcastic.

236
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,665
It's normal. He's healthy.
Send him home, too.

237
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,903
- Why are you smiling?
- Because you're right.

238
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,194
So, you thought he was making
a mistake and didn't say anything?

239
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,504
You just stood by
watching, taking notes,

240
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,342
while he wasted
everybody's time?

241
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,746
Is that your job?

242
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,582
In my experience, doctors
don't listen to nurses.

243
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,195
And they only talk
to us to lecture us

244
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,450
when they figure we
screwed something up.

245
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,518
From now on, you don't run
any tests you don't have to run.

246
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,098
How do I know if a test is
needed until after I run it?

247
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,534
She'll tell you. Today,
she's your boss.

248
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,555
I could never eat
before surgery.

249
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,819
Puke? I could do that.

250
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,758
I get cranky if I don't eat.

251
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,292
I hear Shaun made the call.

252
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,126
He's an excellent diagnostician.

253
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,333
You should get him
a job in radiology.

254
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,565
He doesn't wanna be a
radiologist, he wants to be a surgeon.

255
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,536
That's what we hired him to be.

256
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,701
That's what I worked
damn hard to hire him to be.

257
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,404
Not a glorified orderly.

258
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,345
Every resident does scut work.

259
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,245
So you're treating
him like anybody else?

260
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,246
- Are you?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

261
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,509
He more than earned
the right to be here.

262
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,245
He has had to get
past people like you

263
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,415
and their prejudices
every step of the way.

264
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,651
- "Prejudices"?
- Yeah, prejudices.

265
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,659
Do you have any idea how many
patients he scared the crap out of today?

266
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,593
How many wasted
tests he ordered?

267
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,963
- So teach him.
- I'm doing that.

268
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,935
I'm teaching you both
that he doesn't belong.

269
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,465
Okay.

270
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,304
You're gonna make me
pull rank, I will pull rank.

271
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,977
This is my hospital.

272
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,710
But it's my team.

273
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,542
You can't tell me
how to run my team.

274
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,559
Hey. How are you doing?

275
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,495
What's the point of sarcasm?

276
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,096
Um... Uh, I...

277
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,864
Well, I guess
sometimes it's a way of

278
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,472
critiquing people in a way that's
funny, so they don't feel quite so bad.

279
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,039
Isn't it just lying?

280
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,741
Well, it's not lying, because
people know you're lying.

281
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,075
I'm not good at that.

282
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,681
<i>You may remember
me from last year.</i>

283
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,476
We sell chocolate
bars every year

284
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,580
to pay for our class
trip to Mount Rushmore.

285
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,680
Okay.

286
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,726
But this year we're not
going to Mount Rushmore.

287
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,595
Because Kenny can't
go. He's got cancer.

288
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,326
So, Samantha had the idea that
if he can't go, none of us would go,

289
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,301
and we all thought
that was a great idea.

290
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,162
So we're gonna have a
party at the hospital for him.

291
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,399
There are two
Kennys in your class.

292
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,839
Is it Kenny L or Kenny M?

293
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,336
No one's sick.

294
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,005
You mean you lied?

295
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,820
- You aren't supposed to lie.
- Yeah.

296
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,508
And you and me aren't supposed
to starve. We need money for food.

297
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,054
- Was any of that true?
- Yeah.

298
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,917
We're not going to
Mount Rushmore.

299
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,895
I can't discharge people if I
think they might still be sick.

300
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,730
Of course not. Why would you?

301
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,295
Dr. Melendez made Nurse
Fryday my boss today.

302
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,168
Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?

303
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,710
No.

304
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,542
What did you think this job was?

305
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,911
- To save people's lives.
- No.

306
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,544
I mean, yeah, sometimes
we do save lives.

307
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:04,148
But the job... It's doing
whatever Melendez asks us to do.

308
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,387
<i>Paging Dr. Browne. Paging
Dr. Browne to the OR.</i>

309
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,703
I'm Dr. Claire Browne.
I'm First Assist today,

310
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,299
and I'll be leading the
time out. Patient's name?

311
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,005
Stephanie Willis.

312
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,004
Scheduled surgery?

313
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,399
Excision of an indeterminate
retroperitoneal tumor.

314
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,596
We don't anticipate any
complications with the surgery.

315
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,092
Thank you, Dr. Browne.

316
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,414
- Ten-blade.
- Ten-blade.

317
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,157
Let's remove a tumor.

318
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,439
No.

319
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,677
It might be infected.

320
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,814
- It's not.
- There is some discoloration.

321
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,551
He's 82 years old.
Everything is discolored.

322
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,254
Once we get through the
muscle layer, proceed carefully.

323
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,531
Blood pressure, 120 over 70.

324
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,993
Heart rate, 60.
She's holding steady.

325
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,034
I've opened the fascia.

326
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,404
You kept your puke?

327
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,140
Yeah, I thought
you'd wanna see it.

328
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,909
It looks like puke.

329
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,177
No. No, no. It's not
the regular color.

330
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,011
- Your puke has a regular color?
- Yeah.

331
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,218
It is a bit of an unusual color.

332
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,582
We could order some...

333
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,658
- I'm sending you home.
- You're sure?

334
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,156
It's safe for me to go home?

335
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,446
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

336
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,200
You'll learn. By doing.

337
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,246
Hi.

338
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,437
My brother said there's a kid named
Kenny and he's sick and there might...

339
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,780
You should give us money.

340
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,059
<i>So, am I okay?</i>

341
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,754
Am I okay?

342
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,864
According to all hospital rules and
direct instructions given to me, yes.

343
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:35,898
But...

344
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,569
Whoa.

345
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,808
We need better
exposure of this tumor.

346
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,787
Now, let's get the
deep Balfour in here.

347
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,421
Deep Balfour retractor.

348
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,891
Let's get this thing open. I've
got to see where it's safe to cut.

349
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,597
I can't see anywhere where the
tumor hasn't encased her arteries.

350
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,394
Claire, tell me
you got something.

351
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:06,132
I've got nothing. This tumor is way
bigger than it looked on the scans.

352
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,504
I... I can't even see her aorta.

353
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,419
That's a problem.

354
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,374
Is that the girl with
the bickering parents?

355
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,977
Didn't we send her
home? Four hours ago?

356
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,211
Dr. Murphy? Dr. Melendez
needs you in surgery.

357
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,454
That won't be necessary.

358
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,303
The tumor has entirely encased
the large abdominal arteries.

359
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,903
That's very bad.

360
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,549
If it's in the artery walls,
it's going to be impossible

361
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,041
to cut out without killing her.

362
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,077
You should get a biopsy to
determine where the margins are.

363
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,341
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

364
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,541
I was being sarcastic. Again.

365
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,754
Oh, I see, because you
already know everything I said,

366
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,722
and you already sent
a biopsy to the lab?

367
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,988
Yes. 'Cause I'm a doctor too.

368
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,360
Yes. But you need me?

369
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,827
Yeah. I need you to run down
to the lab and hurry them along.

370
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:57,712
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
I'm a surgical resident.

371
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,076
Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.
When will the results be ready?

372
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,619
When I get to it.

373
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,454
It's very important.

374
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,923
They're all very important.

375
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,618
Let me see the
other test orders.

376
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,373
I'll tell you which ones
are most important

377
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,757
and you can do
them in that order.

378
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,632
I'll be honest and fair.

379
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,264
That is not the
way that it works.

380
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,301
Now go wait your turn.

381
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,536
<i>Do it again.</i>

382
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,574
- Get the hell away from me, you moron.
- Let's get out of here.

383
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,258
Wait, wait, wait.

384
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,959
If you wanna get anything in life,
Shaun, there's one thing you gotta do.

385
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,623
Never be afraid.

386
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,161
You're the moron!

387
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,514
If you don't do
Dr. Melendez's test right now,

388
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,582
I will throw a rock
through your window.

389
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,961
Well, I wouldn't want that.

390
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,267
Go have a seat.

391
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,497
Your results will be
ready in 15 minutes.

392
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,610
You got a minute?

393
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:43,144
I have a patient lying in the
OR waiting for lab results,

394
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,367
and I'm sitting here, trying to figure
out what the hell I'm gonna do next

395
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,587
and I don't like any
of my options. So...

396
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,322
Yeah, unfortunately,
it seems I do.

397
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,454
Okay. We can talk another time.

398
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,725
Glassman talked to you.

399
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,401
I don't have a problem
with an autistic doctor.

400
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,347
No, you just have a problem
with one working for you.

401
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,862
Really? That's how you see me?

402
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,634
- Let's not make this personal.
- You're accusing me of prejudice.

403
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,848
I have a problem with a doctor who
has a problem with communication.

404
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,373
Okay. Let's make this personal.

405
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,013
Who do you respect
at this hospital?

406
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,818
You and Glassman.

407
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,819
And who do you not respect?

408
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,331
It doesn't bother you that it looks
like you're on the wrong team?

409
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,604
If the tumor hasn't invaded
into the arterial walls,

410
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,672
we could create a
plane of dissection.

411
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,201
Well, if it's a
non-invasive liposarcoma,

412
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,869
we can work it off
from the outside.

413
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,209
Blunt section, tissue forceps.
Peel it off, piece by piece.

414
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,285
It's a leiomyosarcoma.

415
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,794
Well, that sucks.

416
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,058
- Yes, it's sad.
- The surgery's impossible.

417
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,797
Well, might as well wake her up.

418
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,030
Let her know she has
three months to live.

419
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,537
Offer palliative care.

420
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,309
The surgery isn't impossible.

421
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,479
Just very, very, very difficult.

422
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,277
Yes. In the sense that
we'll be operating blind.

423
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,889
Yes, because the left
kidney is in the way.

424
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,423
The healthy left kidney.

425
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,052
Both kidneys are healthy,
Jared. She only needs one.

426
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,488
Without the left one,
it's theoretically possible

427
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,963
to access the
tumor and remove it.

428
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,410
You're suggesting we cut
out a perfectly healthy organ

429
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,925
- just to get a better view?
- Yes.

430
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,062
- But she might die anyway?
- Yes, quite probably.

431
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,442
I have to go. I
have a boil to lance.

432
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,180
I mean, that's a brilliant,

433
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,184
very, very, very terrible idea.

434
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,854
Close her up and wake her up.

435
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,354
Who wants to join me when I tell
her she has six weeks left to live?

436
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,295
There is one possibility.

437
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,011
If we remove the left kidney,
we might be able to get

438
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,035
a good enough view to
successfully remove the mass.

439
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,634
Take out a healthy kidney to
get a better view? That's insane.

440
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,172
A good view is half the
battle in any operation.

441
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,947
Most likely outcome is we'd be depriving
her of what little time she has left.

442
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,781
But if we succeed...

443
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,956
You wanna do this 'cause it's
exciting. You wanna be a hero.

444
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,219
But if you fail,
this woman dies.

445
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,055
She misses her son's wedding.

446
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,048
Well, that's the
issue, isn't it?

447
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,467
You promised this
woman she'll be okay.

448
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,240
She had to do the surgery. I
might as well tell her good things.

449
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:56,472
The reason we don't make
patients promises isn't just for legal.

450
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,184
Jared's right, your
judgment is compromised.

451
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,895
- I still think...
- But you're not objective.

452
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,978
Who the hell is?

453
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,555
We should at least wake her up,

454
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,357
explain what we found,
what we're hoping to do,

455
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,259
and get a new consent.

456
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,591
What we're hoping to do is exactly
what you told her we were going to do.

457
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,824
Remove that tumor.

458
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,098
The only thing we'd be explaining
is why you undersold the risks.

459
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,600
We're doing the surgery.

460
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,532
And Jared, you're
my new number two.

461
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,551
- Mayos.
- Mayos.

462
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,856
Going to open the fascia
and expose the kidney.

463
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,964
- You clamp the renal hilum.
- Clamp.

464
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,863
Clamp.

465
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,905
We just cut off the blood supply
to a perfectly healthy kidney.

466
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,588
If we needed color commentary,

467
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,972
I would have hired
Jeff Van Gundy.

468
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,088
Shaun, I believe
you've met Trevor.

469
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,283
Yes, I sent him home.

470
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,226
Yes, well, he didn't go home.

471
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,264
He actually came to the
president of the hospital instead.

472
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,745
He said you sent him home even
though you thought he was sick.

473
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,136
I specifically never said that.
I made sure not to say that.

474
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:29,025
- No. No. What the hell does that mean?
- What does that mean, Shaun?

475
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,742
- Am I healthy?
- Probably.

476
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,174
You're a doctor, you're
supposed to know.

477
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,077
No, we're not. Nobody
knows anything for sure.

478
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,408
Anybody could drop dead
of a heart attack at any time.

479
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,145
Who is this guy? Am I... Am
I gonna have a heart attack?

480
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:45,621
Shaun has some difficulty
with certain social interactions...

481
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,251
- But if he says...
- I don't give a crap what he says.

482
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,159
What do you say? Am I healthy?

483
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,130
I've reviewed your chart and I
can say with complete confidence

484
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,169
that you are in peak
physical condition.

485
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,767
Thank God.

486
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:12,584
Shaun, people need reassurance.

487
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,321
I told him he was safe to
go home. I was very clear.

488
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,852
With your words. Your actions
said something completely different.

489
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,156
No, they didn't. My actions
were completely silent.

490
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:27,131
When you reassure someone,
they have to receive it.

491
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,931
You have to gauge whether
they actually are reassured.

492
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,529
You understand?

493
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,364
When did you
review Trevor's chart?

494
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,610
I didn't.

495
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,378
It's not really a lie. If you
say that he is safe to go home,

496
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,043
then I know for a fact
that he's safe to go home.

497
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,282
I sent a girl home today.

498
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,792
How often do people develop
stomach issues because of their brain?

499
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,456
Based on my personal
experience, every single day.

500
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,696
I want D-dimer, lactate, and
amylase for a 10-year-old girl,

501
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,898
Martine LaDuff.

502
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,372
She might have a tummy
ache caused by stress.

503
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,409
Or she might not.

504
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,542
- Hi, Shaun.
- Hi, Carly.

505
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,809
That's a lot of tests
for an upset stomach.

506
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,812
- You could get in trouble.
- That's definitely true.

507
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,546
Remove the kidney.

508
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,422
Okay.

509
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,913
Let's get in there with
some suction, Claire,

510
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,097
so we can get a better view
of what we're dealing with.

511
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,002
There it is.

512
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,913
It's a mess.

513
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:53,942
Yes, it is.

514
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,620
But now it's a mess we can see.

515
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,581
Everything is
within normal range.

516
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,558
Slightly elevated
lactate and amylase.

517
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,930
And she's very small. Normal should
be lower. Normal should be lower.

518
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,028
What do you think she has?

519
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,368
Thank you.

520
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,867
What the hell? It's after 1:00.

521
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,707
I ran tests. The results
were ambiguous.

522
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,173
I think Martine has
intestinal malrotation

523
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,575
and that a volvulus
has occurred.

524
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,839
"Ambiguous" tests told you this?

525
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,912
It's a genetic condition.

526
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,846
The symptoms are
very similar to stress.

527
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,147
Call us in the morning.

528
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,859
Okay. She may not
be alive in the morning.

529
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,851
Does your boss know you're here?

530
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,762
No, I think he'd be upset
with me for being here.

531
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,564
I am not waking my daughter up

532
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,753
in the middle of a school
night because of some freak.

533
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,246
And you don't need to
call me in the morning,

534
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,190
because I'll be calling
your boss in the morning.

535
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,940
Were you being sarcastic?

536
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,028
- How hard is it to get rid of someone?
- I told him...

537
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,782
You're right, I'm weird.

538
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,156
Part of my weirdness
is that I perseverate.

539
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,317
That means I keep
thinking about things.

540
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,722
So I will keep knocking on your
door until I know Martine is okay.

541
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,795
Martine.

542
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,630
Martine?

543
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,332
- Martine?
- Martine, you need to wake up.

544
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,305
- Honey...
- Martine?

545
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,175
She vomited.

546
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,610
- I can't wake her.
- I'll call 911.

547
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,981
No. There is no time.

548
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,478
- Do you have a car?
- Yeah.

549
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,342
Shaun! What's
wrong? What's wrong?

550
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,871
Hey. Hey! You called
me. What's wrong?

551
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,605
Hey, look at me. Look at me!

552
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,834
What's... You don't have to
say the whole thing, okay?

553
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,043
Just one thing, okay?

554
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,019
- One thing.
- My brother...

555
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,804
Hold on, Shaun.
Hold on now. Hold on.

556
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,173
Her pulse is too weak
to perfuse her organs.

557
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,684
What? What does that...

558
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,854
- Jerry...
- Please hurry.

559
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,361
Patient is a 10-year-old female.

560
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,004
She has bradycardia
with hypovolemic shock.

561
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,541
She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline

562
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,208
and a litre of saline
wide open, please.

563
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,437
Coming through!

564
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,906
Her pulse is better.
She needs an ultrasound.

565
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,954
That is it.

566
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,081
Whoa.

567
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,437
- I think you got it all.
- You "think"?

568
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,226
No, you definitely did, I
just can't quite believe it.

569
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,857
It was your idea. You
should have more confidence.

570
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,530
Nice work, Doctor.

571
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,958
There.

572
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,661
The small bowel is twisted around
the superior mesenteric artery.

573
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,061
Martine needs
surgery immediately.

574
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,903
We need to confirm
with Dr. Melendez.

575
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,266
No, Dr. Melendez is in surgery.

576
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,831
Part of Martine's bowel is
dying and killing her with it.

577
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,104
No. You cannot make
these calls on your own.

578
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,406
Dr. Melendez was very clear.

579
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,609
He was very clear.

580
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,648
It's past midnight, which
means it's tomorrow.

581
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,243
Which means you're
no longer my boss.

582
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,522
Is this the OR scheduler?

583
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,523
Yes, this is Dr. Murphy.

584
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,751
Prepare an OR for surgery.

585
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,601
Ten-blade.

586
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,024
I'll take it from here.

587
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,708
Nice diagnosis. I'll
handle the repair work.

588
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,210
- Is Stephanie okay?
- Yes.

589
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,114
Jared had an excellent
idea and she's gonna be fine.

590
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,282
- Light.
- Light.

591
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,927
Would you like me to assist?

592
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,729
Pretty basic. I think I can
take this one on my own.

593
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,390
Go home. Get some sleep.

594
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,731
<i>Let him stay.</i>

595
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,796
Dr. Andrews,

596
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,572
I believe our opinions on the
wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy...

597
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,972
<i>That battle is lost.</i>

598
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,002
<i>Shaun is here and
we have to accept it</i>

599
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,788
<i>and we will treat him
like any other resident.</i>

600
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,172
- Sir, it's my team.
<i>- And it's my department.</i>

601
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,349
<i>Dr. Murphy.</i>

602
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,696
Back on suction.
Congratulations.

603
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,517
Suction ready.

604
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,103
I am gonna get a drink. I am
way too wound up to sleep.

605
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,733
You care to join me?

606
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,869
- For either?
- Don't think so.

607
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,103
Seriously? We were just
part of something amazing.

608
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,443
We reached into that
woman and we healed her.

609
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,416
And you're what, cranky?

610
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,948
Maybe you could learn
something from me.

611
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,783
Like what? To steal credit?

612
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,350
Make yourself a hero
with Shaun's idea?

613
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,189
No, but I fought for it. I
went out on a limb for it.

614
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,026
I deserve credit for that.

615
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,275
Why didn't you rat me out
as soon as I brought it up?

616
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,666
It seemed beside the point.

617
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,255
No, you didn't rat me out 'cause
you thought the idea was crazy.

618
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,865
You would let me take the fall.

619
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,106
Is that fair?

620
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,475
My idea if it fails, but
Shaun's if it succeeds?

621
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,045
But I'll tell you what,

622
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,245
I'll accept that you're right.

623
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,779
I'll apologize to
the whole team.

624
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,886
If you prove to me that
you're not a hypocrite.

625
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,165
How am I supposed to
prove something like that?

626
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,563
Our patient's about to
come out of anesthesia.

627
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,497
Tell her the truth.

628
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,197
When she wakes up
and hears what we did,

629
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,464
how we miraculously
saved her life,

630
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,298
be honest with
her, about credit.

631
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,270
Tell her you
didn't want to do it.

632
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:09,077
Tell her that you wanted
to send her home to die.

633
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,649
I hear you got Shaun off
scut and back into surgery.

634
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,825
I heard you tried.

635
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:26,792
You're welcome.

636
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,234
Just a friendly warning. I
know you have no interest

637
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,032
in helping Shaun.

638
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,972
You figure you give him a little
authority, he'll screw something up

639
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,670
and then you will be done with
him, and then you'll be done with me.

640
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,872
You're right about
me. I am getting old

641
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,440
and maybe a little emotional.

642
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,116
Maybe I over-committed.

643
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,518
But you're wrong about Shaun.

644
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,023
He's gonna handle
anything you throw at him.

645
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,224
Either way, if he succeeds,

646
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,698
I'm the guy who just
backed him. And if he fails,

647
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,194
I'm the president.

648
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,217
Everything went great.

649
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,790
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

650
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,055
- There were complications.
- But I'm okay?

651
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,224
- Yeah. But the surgery...
- I don't care.

652
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,657
You saved me. Thank you.

653
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,426
My son's going to be here soon.

654
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,367
I told him you said it would
be okay, but he flew in anyway.

655
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:42,935
You saved me.

656
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,245
You're gonna be a beautiful
mother of the groom.

657
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,535
Go on in, take a
bow. You've earned it.

658
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,706
Why does it matter
who gets credit?

659
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,575
It matters because the
people who get credit...

660
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,777
They don't have to do scut work.

661
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,888
Dr. Murphy, thank you so much.

662
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,271
Thank you.
