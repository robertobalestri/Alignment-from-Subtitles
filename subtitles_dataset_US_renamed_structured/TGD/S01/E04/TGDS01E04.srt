1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,847
<i>Previously, on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,682
I'm your neighbor. I'm in
the middle of <i>Uncharted</i>

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,004
and I'm dead.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,474
Can I borrow some triple-As?

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,502
This is kind of silly,
isn't it? Our relationship.

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,807
That we're hiding it.

7
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,815
We don't have a
relationship. We have sex.

8
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,046
- You're late.
- No, the bus was late.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,390
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

10
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,885
Yeah. This is gonna
work out great.

11
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,751
So, you're treating
him like anybody else?

12
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,733
Do you have any idea how
many patients he's scared

13
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,268
- the crap out of today?
- So, teach him.

14
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,124
I'm teaching you both.
That he doesn't belong.

15
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,556
<i>I hear you got Shaun off
scut and back into surgery.</i>

16
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,533
You figure you give him a little
authority, he'll screw something up.

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,536
Either way. If he succeeds,
I'm the guy who just backed him.

18
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,834
And if he fails,
I'm the President.

19
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,541
Hello. I've looked everywhere.

20
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,006
All right, I'm here now.

21
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,483
We'll just keep looking.
Maybe we'll find it.

22
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,544
Why is the furniture in
the middle of the room?

23
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,487
I know I packed it. I made
a list. Star-tip screwdriver.

24
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,654
Look, it's checked.
It's checked.

25
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,108
Maybe you threw it out with
the newspapers you used

26
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,269
to pack the dishes.

27
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,108
I packed with bubble
wrap. It's safer.

28
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,647
And you can see through it.

29
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,912
Of course, you did. Shaun,
there's a hardware store up the road.

30
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,043
You can buy a new one.

31
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,087
I don't want a new screwdriver,
I want my screwdriver!

32
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,213
Stop it!

33
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,328
It's the middle of the... I'm
sorry. I shouldn't have yelled.

34
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,924
Let's just take a
moment. Sit down, please.

35
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,564
You know what? We... You
can use this for now. Okay?

36
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,772
I can't stay here.

37
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,838
Of course, you
can. It'll be fine.

38
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,381
I can't stay here. The
dishwasher doesn't dry,

39
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,679
the shower drain has
someone else's hair in it...

40
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,279
And the crisper drawer
keeps coming off the track.

41
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,558
I assume that's
what you were fixing.

42
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,486
I forgot.

43
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,792
Of course, you forgot.
It's understandable.

44
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,698
You've been working your
ass off. You're exhausted.

45
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,965
You're under a lot of stress.
There's a super in the building.

46
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,302
You can call him anytime.

47
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,902
Just make a list of the
things you need repaired.

48
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,638
Later, Shaun.
Later. Later, Shaun!

49
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,072
Go to bed now.

50
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,440
Go to bed.

51
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,059
Thirty-six years old,
22 weeks pregnant.

52
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,429
Ultrasound at 16 weeks revealed
a tumor on the fetus's tailbone.

53
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,094
Mom's got antiphospholipid
syndrome. It makes surgery high-risk.

54
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,230
It also makes pregnancy high-risk.
She's had three miscarriages.

55
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,337
We need to do an ultrasound and
MRI to measure the tumor's growth rate.

56
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,613
Late bus doesn't explain
why you're showing up tired

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,171
after you just had 12 hours off.

58
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,179
We're all tired. Our
last shift was 36 hours.

59
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,571
I'm not interested in debating
the shift schedule with you.

60
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,484
But I am curious why you always
feel the need to defend him?

61
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,851
We're all on the same team.

62
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,019
Yes, but you're
all quarterbacks.

63
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,025
And when training camp is over,
there's only gonna be one starter.

64
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,203
The crown rump length of
the fetus is 21.5 centimeters.

65
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,838
And the diameter
of the tumor is...

66
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,385
10.6 centimeters. Half
the size of the fetus.

67
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,459
The tumor's grown.
It's not cancer,

68
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,757
but it is monopolizing
the blood supply,

69
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,353
which is weakening
the fetus' heart.

70
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,125
I'm sorry, but there's no chance
it would survive long enough

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,224
to be viable.

72
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,901
The safest course is to
terminate the pregnancy.

73
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,934
If we were interested
in the "safest course,"

74
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,172
we wouldn't be on our
third second opinion.

75
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,640
Please, Dr. Melendez, we
want whatever will save our baby.

76
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,648
Dr. Wright told us
you've done fetal surgery

77
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,482
to remove this
type of tumor before.

78
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,852
And without the tumor,
our baby would be healthy.

79
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,184
Your antiphospholipid syndrome makes
a long surgery extremely dangerous.

80
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,172
There's a high
chance for blood clots

81
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,290
which could have fatal
consequences for you.

82
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,765
We're willing to take that risk.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Saving the fetus doesn't do any
good if the mother dies in the process.

84
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,938
I've had three miscarriages.

85
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,732
If I have to go through that
again, I might as well be dead.

86
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,172
- Barb.
- It's true.

87
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,001
No, it's not.

88
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,504
You're the strongest
woman I've ever met.

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,007
We'll get through this.

90
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,310
We will. And, and
then we'll try again.

91
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,479
We could manage clotting risk
preoperatively with an infusion

92
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,045
of unfractionated heparin.

93
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,556
Never contradict me in
front of a patient again.

94
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,931
I didn't. I agree with your
assessment of the risks.

95
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,866
I suggested a way
we could mitigate them.

96
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,097
Not in front of the patient.

97
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,035
We're not in front
of the patient now.

98
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,909
I was just reading about a new
technique for transesophageal

99
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,640
echocardiography monitoring.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,950
If there is a cardiac issue, it
would give us an early warning.

101
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,385
Let's get her prepped. ASAP.

102
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,895
I want JL on anesthesia.

103
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,067
And let the neonatal
nursing supervisor know

104
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,769
that I wanna do
a full run-through.

105
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,243
Damn it.

106
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,273
Yes? Well, we're a
little busy up here, too.

107
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,616
All right. I'll send someone.

108
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,018
Andrews is covering
for Lim in the ER.

109
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,716
He has a patient who
needs a boil lanced.

110
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,724
A plastic surgeon
can't lance a boil?

111
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,953
Plastic surgeons can.
Chief surgeons don't.

112
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,086
You and Murphy.

113
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:40,263
What? It was our ideas that
convinced you to do the fetal surgery,

114
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,700
and now you're punishing
us with Andrews' scut work?

115
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,696
Well, you're not
getting punished.

116
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,507
He is. For being late. Again.

117
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,739
But I don't trust him
alone with a patient,

118
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,300
and since you like to defend him

119
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,218
and seem to know how
to communicate with him...

120
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,540
Hurry back.

121
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,916
Olivia Hartman?

122
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,686
Yes, ma'am. I mean, Doctor.

123
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,652
- You're 18?
- Yes, ma'am.

124
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,665
- Where's the boil?
- It's, um, it's down there.

125
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,925
Down where?

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,492
Shaun. It's on her labia.

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,164
Hmm. Is it painful?

128
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,037
Like I used a bowling
ball for a tampon.

129
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,735
Okay, well, it shouldn't
hurt that much.

130
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,243
Okay if we take a look?

131
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:31,143
Okay. If you just scoot down
and put your feet in the stirrups.

132
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,816
Right.

133
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,019
The swelling is
fairly localized.

134
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,786
Extreme pain that's out of
proportion to the visible injury

135
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,263
could mean you have
necrotizing flesh-eating bacteria.

136
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,356
What?

137
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,932
I'm gonna use the heparin
preoperatively and a TEE monitor.

138
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,135
Still not enough. The risk of
a heart attack, or a stroke...

139
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,701
Was thoroughly explained. The
patient still wants the surgery.

140
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,208
She wants it? Or you want it?

141
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,844
Yes, saving a fetus's life
would be good news for me.

142
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,517
Any other questions? Or insults?

143
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,118
Relax. I'm not insulting you. Of
course, you wanna do this surgery.

144
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,589
But you do surgeries like this,
some patients are going to die.

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,044
And then our department's
success rate goes down.

146
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,245
And then our funding goes down.

147
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,204
And then you can't
do surgeries like this.

148
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,638
So, if your judgment is
clouded in any way, just...

149
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,800
It's not.

150
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,869
Okay.

151
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,519
I'm sorry, I know this hurts,
but I really do need to insert

152
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,491
the speculum for
this part of the exam.

153
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,424
If I really have what he says,

154
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,938
does that mean you
have to cut off my...

155
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,659
No. No. As I said, the abscess

156
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,826
is most likely the result of an
untreated chlamydia infection.

157
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,629
We'll drain the abscess, give
you antibiotics. You'll be fine.

158
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,505
Ow! I'm sorry.

159
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,577
The inflamed Bartholin gland is
causing the ischiocavernosus muscle

160
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,638
to spasm and pinch
the labial nerve.

161
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,580
You need to start with a
more upward angle. Can I try?

162
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,652
I think it's
better if I do this.

163
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,081
Ow.

164
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,284
Yeah. Okay. Fine.

165
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,898
Should we call your
parents? Let them know...

166
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:30,993
No.

167
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,466
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

168
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,536
Even adults need
emotional support.

169
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,973
Someone to drive
them home after surgery.

170
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,146
I'm gonna take a
taxi. I have money.

171
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,358
There's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

172
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:46,285
Twenty-five percent of college students
contract an STD before graduation.

173
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,951
I'm not embarrassed,
and I know all about STDs.

174
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,118
I get tested every 30 days.

175
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,221
There's no necrosis on
the vaginal wall or cervix.

176
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,423
You got it in already?

177
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,525
Yes. It's definitely not
flesh-eating bacteria.

178
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,066
- I was wrong.
- Thank God.

179
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,804
You do need surgery to drain
the Bartholin gland abscess.

180
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,706
Why do you get an
STD test every 30 days?

181
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,337
I have to. For work.

182
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,711
I do porn.

183
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,517
The umbilical is 19 inches,

184
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,819
which will allow us to remove

185
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,788
the fetus via cesarean
and rest it in its mother's lap

186
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,348
while I excise the tumor.

187
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,394
Now, the hard part will be
reinserting the fetus afterwards.

188
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,596
We can't overstretch
the uterine wall,

189
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,930
and we must be certain that
every suture is tight enough

190
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,871
to handle four more months
of kicks and thrown elbows.

191
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,334
Do you have a minute?

192
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,069
- Can it wait?
- No.

193
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,350
I don't wanna do it.

194
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,420
Have you talked to your wife?

195
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,155
Yes, but she's not
thinking rationally.

196
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,596
You heard her say she'd
rather die than lose this baby.

197
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,060
I'm sorry, but husbands
don't have veto power

198
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,625
over their wife's
medical decisions.

199
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,801
A husband can't stop you
from operating on his wife,

200
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,604
but a father can stop you
from operating on his child.

201
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,081
What kind of porn?

202
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,224
I'm sorry, I was too busy
doing all the labs and imaging

203
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,062
she needed for surgery. I
forgot to ask for her resume.

204
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,758
I just mean, is she
an actual actress,

205
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,665
like in stuff
with a story, or...

206
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,534
Do they even make porn
with stories anymore?

207
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,664
Sometimes.

208
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,273
You watch porn?

209
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,334
Why wouldn't he?

210
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,718
- I don't know, he just seems...
- He's a guy. All guys watch porn.

211
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,625
You finished with
Andrews' patient?

212
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,776
No. It wasn't a boil.

213
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,252
It's a large Bartholin gland abscess
that's pressing on pudendal nerve.

214
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,586
Which apparently does
interest a chief surgeon.

215
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,901
We're gonna assist Andrews
when he drains it in the morning.

216
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,190
We just thought we'd
check back with you.

217
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,354
Go home.

218
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,456
And sleep. Not play video games,
or whatever it is keeping you up.

219
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,772
I don't think it's video games.

220
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,411
You can head out,
too. It's been a long day.

221
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,631
- But what about...
- Fetal surgery's been put on hold.

222
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,400
What? Why?

223
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,496
Go home.

224
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,245
Once the fetus is
removed from the uterus,

225
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,914
one could argue that
it becomes a child.

226
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,042
That's ridiculous.

227
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,480
There are numerous
legal precedents...

228
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,130
That guarantee the
mother's right to choose.

229
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,816
It's her body. It's her control.

230
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,719
I'm completely
comfortable going ahead

231
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,969
- with this surgery.
- As am I.

232
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,586
I never was, and I
certainly am not now.

233
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,290
I'm sorry, until we're certain
there is no liability connected

234
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,855
to parental consent,
neither am I.

235
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,893
Well, the one thing I think
we can all agree on is that

236
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,899
the mother has the
power to do nothing.

237
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,275
And if she doesn't
terminate, or have the surgery

238
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,468
to remove the tumor...

239
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,070
A fetus with a massive tumor
will die inside a patient with APS.

240
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,908
And the mother
would die, too, right?

241
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,176
So, we do nothing
and they both die,

242
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:09,255
or we can do something that's
legally and ethically complicated

243
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,889
and maybe they both live.

244
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,072
The board has
approved the surgery.

245
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,534
Thank you.

246
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,036
- Barb, please...
- Mark, stop.

247
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,186
- If you loved me...
- No. No. Do not say that.

248
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,189
No, it's true. If you
really loved me...

249
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,282
I'm trying to protect
you because I love you.

250
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,918
I don't need your protection.

251
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,358
I need your support.

252
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,233
We'll start prepping you
first thing in the morning.

253
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,732
Try and get some sleep.

254
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,298
Thank you.

255
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,452
I still can't believe it.

256
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,321
That 18-year-old
college students do porn?

257
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,186
She's not the type.

258
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,639
And how do you know
what "type" she is?

259
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,122
You just met her, did one
medical history and pelvic exam.

260
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,229
What?

261
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,564
Nothing.

262
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,765
No, go ahead.

263
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,860
Tell me all the
reasons why I'm wrong.

264
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,210
I volunteered at a
shelter for runaway teens

265
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,740
when I was in high school,
got to know a lot of sex workers.

266
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,853
They're not all the same,

267
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,920
but they do have

268
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,688
the same armor.

269
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,359
I don't believe it.

270
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,024
You think I'm lying?

271
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,933
No. No. I think you
just opened up to me,

272
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,698
actually shared
something personal.

273
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,604
It was high-school community
service. It's not a big deal.

274
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,611
Oh, no, it's a big deal. This is
huge. I am peeling the onion.

275
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,771
Shut up.

276
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,324
Actually it's more like
hacking through a coconut

277
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,341
- with a dull machete, but...
- Dull is right. Very dull.

278
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,817
It feels good, doesn't it?

279
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,283
Should do it more often.

280
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,060
How about you stop
worrying about what I won't do,

281
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,828
and just enjoy what I will.

282
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,668
Do you think she's
of sound mind?

283
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,204
You really wanna talk
about work right now?

284
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,577
She's basically threatening
to commit suicide.

285
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,180
She's not suicidal. She's...

286
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,779
She's just desperate to have a
child. This is probably her last chance.

287
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,016
She could adopt.

288
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,485
- It's not the same.
- Really?

289
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,987
- Don't think there's a difference?
- No, I don't.

290
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,389
Carrying a fetus in your
body for nine months.

291
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,967
You don't think that creates
a unique relationship?

292
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,334
I think every
relationship is unique.

293
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,667
Yeah, of course.

294
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,106
- What are you saying?
- I just think it's selfish.

295
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,720
I mean, for her to
go through so much,

296
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,838
to put your husband
through so much,

297
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,541
just so you can have
a certain experience

298
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,208
when there are other ways.

299
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:26,884
Yeah, okay.

300
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,445
But you want
children though, right?

301
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,047
And we've talked
about this before.

302
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,285
Yes, I want children.

303
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,090
But our children. Like,
from you getting pregnant.

304
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,422
Yes.

305
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,391
But what if that doesn't happen?

306
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,700
What if I couldn't get pregnant,

307
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,071
or if I decided that
I didn't want to?

308
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,899
That I wanted to adopt instead?

309
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,443
Is there something
you're not telling me?

310
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,040
Actually, there is.

311
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:58,113
When we're in meetings together,
don't ever call my ideas ridiculous.

312
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,786
- Come on, I'm being serious.
- So am I.

313
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,781
Okay. You're right, I'm
sorry. It won't happen again.

314
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,083
- Jeez, you scared me.
- What are you reading?

315
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,245
- Nothing.
- Can I read it?

316
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,379
- No.
- Why?

317
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,252
- Because.
- Why?

318
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:38,781
Because.

319
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,482
Why?

320
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:46,663
Because there's nothing
to read. Just pictures.

321
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,927
- Where'd you get this?
- Colleen Myers.

322
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,971
Her dad has so
many in his closet,

323
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,007
he doesn't even notice
when she takes a few.

324
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,802
She's pretty.

325
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,871
She sure is.

326
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,643
It's bedtime. That
means lights out.

327
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,394
I missed my stop.

328
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,765
I missed my stop!

329
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,064
Lynwood Place.

330
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,567
I need to get off
at Lynwood Place.

331
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,283
Then you should've
been paying attention

332
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,900
when I stopped at Lynwood Place.

333
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,378
The next stop's gonna be even
further away, so if I were you...

334
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,225
Shaun? Are you okay?

335
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,425
Yes.

336
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,401
Are you waiting for someone?

337
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,028
No.

338
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,705
I'm horrible at directions, too.

339
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,907
Every time I exit a BART
station, I walk, like, three blocks

340
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,711
before I realize I'm
going the wrong direction.

341
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,910
You're lucky I actually
made it to the gym.

342
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,649
I like to go when
it's not crowded,

343
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,920
but it's so hard to motivate
after work. Half the time I end up...

344
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,119
You stink.

345
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,088
I know, I'm disgusting,
but I can't shower there.

346
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,167
I'm terrified of foot fungus.

347
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,414
Hey, you know, as long as
we're tossing out truth grenades,

348
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,997
you suck at being a neighbor.

349
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,342
First, you take back your
batteries, and then you wake me up

350
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,470
in the middle of the night, stomping
around and banging on pipes.

351
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,942
What the hell's up with that?

352
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,678
My sink drips. I couldn't
sleep, so I tried to fix it.

353
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,653
Then I couldn't find my
screwdriver, which made me anxious.

354
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,820
You kept me up because you
were anxious about a screwdriver?

355
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,255
Yes. I was very anxious.

356
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,018
You're funny.

357
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,093
I stink, you're anxious.

358
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,264
You always say exactly
what's on your mind.

359
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,001
Just the total
opposite of most guys.

360
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,935
It's nice.

361
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,944
Good night.

362
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,184
And don't go fixing
any faucets tonight.

363
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,516
That's Armen's job.

364
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,668
This is a list of repairs I
need for my apartment.

365
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,878
Number 33.

366
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,713
What the hell is your problem?

367
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,312
Sorry. Hello, my name is Shaun
Murphy. It's very nice to meet you.

368
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:32,856
No, it's not nice to
meet me at 12:40 a.m.

369
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,018
Yes.

370
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,058
Dr. Glassman said I can call you
anytime I need something fixed.

371
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,857
Who the hell's Dr. Glassman?

372
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,800
He's the president at San
Jose Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

373
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,200
I'm a surgical resident there.

374
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,899
Well, I don't care if you're
Saint Bonaventure himself.

375
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,065
Unless it's a fire or a flood,
I only work 9:00 to 5:00.

376
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,611
I'll try and come back
tomorrow between those times.

377
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,109
Yeah, you already woke me
up, just give me the damn list.

378
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:07,018
It's my fault. I should've known
you would take what I said literally.

379
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,421
It's okay.

380
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,122
Actually, you know what,
Shaun? It's not my fault.

381
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,796
It's your responsibility.
You're smart.

382
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,198
You should be able to
use your common sense.

383
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,498
When somebody says something,

384
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,302
you should figure out
what they really mean.

385
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,806
And when things don't go
exactly how you expected them,

386
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,243
then navigate that.

387
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,743
There's a thing called a
personal support worker.

388
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,083
Think of it like a
home-help aid...

389
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,284
No, thank you. I can
take care of myself.

390
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,485
Everybody needs a
little help now and then.

391
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,893
I'm thinking of asking
them to give me one.

392
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,362
I've lived by
myself a long time.

393
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,832
In Casper, Wyoming.

394
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,164
Everybody looked
out for you in Casper.

395
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,831
Everybody looks out for everybody
in Casper. This is San Jose.

396
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:56,034
It's a big city. And residency
is a whole lot more demanding

397
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,736
- than medical...
- I don't need an aid.

398
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,938
- We're just talking about...
- I don't need an aid!

399
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,605
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

400
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,414
- Okay.
- Okay.

401
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,449
We'll table it for
some other time.

402
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,122
Let's enjoy our breakfast. Okay?

403
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,526
Mr. Allen.

404
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,833
I'm trying to convince
her to save herself.

405
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,064
I don't wanna roll the
dice with my wife's life.

406
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,267
But she does.

407
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,036
We're gonna start prepping her now
and she goes into the OR in a few hours.

408
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,942
I understand why she's
desperate, but not why you are.

409
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,346
If she dies, it's your fault.

410
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,716
And what if she lives?

411
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,826
You're gonna have a wife
and child who need you,

412
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,532
and you keep driving
her out of your life.

413
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,488
I'm not desperate,
I'm confident.

414
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,191
Which should
make you feel better.

415
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,005
Retraction.

416
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,306
I'll make the incision and I want
you to insert the Word catheter.

417
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,287
Good job on the pelvic
exam, Dr. Murphy.

418
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,031
With all the swelling, it
couldn't have been easy.

419
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,114
Thank you.

420
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,919
How do you know who...

421
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,859
- I have my ways. Like Santa.
- I told him.

422
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,692
Hmm. No presents
for you. Insert the drain.

423
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,762
But I'm curious. How can a guy who
can't even shake a co-worker's hand

424
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,329
be comfortable
doing a pelvic exam?

425
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,771
People squeeze
too hard. It hurts.

426
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,740
Send this to the
lab for culture.

427
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,012
So, I'm guessing
you're not that into hugs.

428
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,415
I don't like to be squeezed.

429
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,277
And what if it's
somebody you like?

430
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,549
Or somebody you love?
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

431
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,584
I almost kissed a girl. Once.

432
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,593
Well, you know what they say,
if at first you don't succeed...

433
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,860
Are you trying to mock
me or encourage me?

434
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,734
I'm trying to get to know you,

435
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,772
so I know when I should mock
and when I should encourage.

436
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,932
When's the right
time to mock you?

437
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,183
Press harder on that abscess.
It should've drained by now.

438
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,446
Something's wrong.

439
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,150
The gland's evacuated, but
the swelling's not going down.

440
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,816
Heart rate and BP are stable.

441
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,411
Can I get a little
more light, please?

442
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,753
- Damn.
- What is it?

443
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,563
The swelling isn't going down because
there's a mass beneath the abscess.

444
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,727
And it's not just pressing
on the pudendal nerve,

445
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,327
it's totally engulfed it.

446
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,100
- That's bad.
- Very bad.

447
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,949
You're done already?

448
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,818
We were able to
drain the abscess.

449
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,352
I already feel better.

450
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,068
That's only because
of the pain meds.

451
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,119
The reason the pain was so severe
was because it wasn't just an abscess.

452
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,255
There's a perineal
myoma underneath.

453
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,788
What's that?

454
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,831
A fibroid tumor.

455
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,799
It's not cancerous, but it is
wrapped around the nerve.

456
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,842
We need to remove
the tumor, but to do that,

457
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,869
we will have to sever the nerve.

458
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,873
You'll lose all feeling
in your genitals.

459
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,216
I'm so sorry.

460
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,946
I knew it.

461
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,086
God's punishing me.

462
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,218
No, absolutely not. This
is just a random growth...

463
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,853
- You're religious?
- Yes.

464
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,155
Or at least I used to be.

465
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:45,069
I haven't thought about
God in a really long time.

466
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,829
But being in here...

467
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,239
Are you sure you don't
want us to call your parents?

468
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,801
No, I couldn't bear to
see the look on their faces.

469
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,580
Especially my dad's.

470
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,515
Well, that's what
parents are for,

471
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,546
so you don't have to
do these things alone.

472
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,388
Could you tell your
father you're a whore?

473
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,053
You made a mistake. That is all.

474
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:17,926
Patient vitals?

475
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,433
- Stable.
- Fetus?

476
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,529
Stable.

477
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,905
Okay. Is everybody ready?

478
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,035
Knife.

479
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,283
Retractor.

480
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,306
Okay, cutting into the uterus.

481
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,579
TEE is showing
anterior-wall hypokinesis.

482
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,584
Systolic pressure,
90. Get me a Swan.

483
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,794
- Cardiac function is decreasing.
- She's having

484
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,363
a heart attack. I need
you to close the incision.

485
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,698
- On it. Needle driver.
- Get a fluoroscope in here!

486
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,247
I'm gonna prep her
for a balloon pump.

487
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,788
Barbara.

488
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,994
There was a complication
during surgery,

489
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,997
a blood clot blocked
an artery in your heart.

490
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,559
We were able
to catch it in time.

491
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,565
- And my baby?
- The fetus is stable.

492
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,000
The MI happened before
we opened the uterus.

493
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,774
So, we're right back
where we started?

494
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,246
You just had a heart attack.

495
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,442
I don't care.

496
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:38,984
There is no other option now.

497
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,613
If we don't terminate
and the fetus dies in utero,

498
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,918
the resulting clots will
overwhelm your heart and brain.

499
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,182
Which is exactly why
we need to try again.

500
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,455
What are you talking about?

501
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,686
You need to remove the tumor.

502
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,761
You begged me not to
do the surgery before.

503
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,633
I thought I could
talk her out of it then.

504
00:28:58,804 --> 00:28:59,999
Now I know I can't.

505
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,442
Either you do it, or she dies.

506
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,547
Before, if we got sued, we'd at
least have one of them on our side.

507
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,576
But now, with
them both aligned...

508
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,620
Can they sue us
for not operating?

509
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,951
They could argue that
we abandoned care.

510
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,753
We're still offering care, just
not the care that they want.

511
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:20,952
Which is your fault.

512
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,458
If you hadn't offered
her hope to begin with,

513
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,243
we might have been
able to reason with her.

514
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,391
- How's the pain around the incision?
- Five out of 10.

515
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,968
I'll up the dosage.
Any chest pain?

516
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,637
No. My heart
actually feels fine.

517
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:36,834
Good.

518
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,993
If she doesn't wanna terminate,
there's nothing we can do.

519
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,028
- So, we just send her home to die?
- It is her decision.

520
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,487
We could tell her we were
going ahead with the fetal surgery,

521
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,647
but when's she under...

522
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,166
I'm gonna pretend
you never said that.

523
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,954
If it's the only chance
to save her life...

524
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,203
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

525
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,492
You wouldn't lie to
convince a suicidal person

526
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,682
to climb down off the ledge?

527
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,199
Knowingly lying to a patient
about a major medical surgery...

528
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,393
Hey, hey, hey!

529
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,626
Lying to a patient is one thing,

530
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,672
performing surgery
without their consent...

531
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,900
- It's unethical and illegal.
- And insane.

532
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,566
I just... I don't wanna do this.

533
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,215
It's not our only option.

534
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,017
You want me to attempt
the fetal surgery again?

535
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,498
If it's the only way
to save her life.

536
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,533
Well, the first time, it was
the only way to save her life,

537
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,550
but a second heart attack one
day after the first will kill her.

538
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:33,930
Maybe not. I am so sorry to
interrupt, but I have an idea.

539
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,694
What if we kill her
before she kills herself?

540
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,037
We'll stop your heart and
put you on a bypass machine

541
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,287
for the duration of the surgery.

542
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,404
You can't have heart attack

543
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,790
if your heart's not
beating to begin with.

544
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,908
It takes the most significant
danger off the table.

545
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,349
But aren't the clots a
danger to her brain as well?

546
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,717
This doesn't completely
eliminate every risk,

547
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,779
but it does reduce
the biggest one.

548
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,319
Thank you.

549
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,021
We'll do it first
thing in the morning.

550
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,292
You fixed my sink.

551
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,753
Do you know how to tell time?

552
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,059
You fixed my sink!

553
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,930
You're welcome. Now go away.

554
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,195
It was not on the list!

555
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,631
The faucet, it was not on the list.
You weren't supposed to touch it.

556
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,637
So, after I fix everything
you woke me up for,

557
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,338
then I go out of my
way to fix something...

558
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,712
It was not on the list
because I'd already fixed it.

559
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,117
Well, you fixed it wrong,
because it was still dripping.

560
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,519
I need it to drip. At the same
rate as my sink in Casper.

561
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,423
It was too slow before. Now I have
to fix it all over again. It's not fair.

562
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:11,258
I'm done. If you
don't like your faucet,

563
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,821
or anything else in
your apartment, move.

564
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,193
If you knock this door
again after 5:00 p.m.,

565
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,993
I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

566
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,591
<i>I wish I was a slave
to an age-old trade</i>

567
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:50,561
<i>Like ridin' around on rail
cars and workin' long days</i>

568
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:58,240
<i>Lord have mercy on my
rough and rowdy ways</i>

569
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,271
<i>Lord have mercy on my
rough and rowdy ways</i>

570
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:09,653
<i>Call it one drink too
many Call it pride of a man</i>

571
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:17,051
<i>But it don't make no
difference if you sit or you stand</i>

572
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,567
<i>'Cause they both end in
trouble and start with a grin</i>

573
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,899
<i>We do it over and
over and over again</i>

574
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:40,281
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

575
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:02,668
<i>I am on my way I am on my way</i>

576
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,005
<i>I am on my way
back to where I started</i>

577
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,874
<i>California, Oklahoma</i>

578
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:16,279
<i>And all of the places
I ain't ever been to but</i>

579
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:20,892
<i>Down in the valley
with Whiskey rivers</i>

580
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,296
<i>These are the places
you will find me hidin'</i>

581
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:29,329
<i>These are the
places I will always go</i>

582
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,936
<i>These are the
places I will always...</i>

583
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,131
Nerves are like pipes.

584
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,617
- Shaun, this isn't...
- We need to sever the pudendal nerve

585
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,008
to excise the myoma, but
if we reconnect the ends...

586
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,171
The tumor is four
centimeters in diameter.

587
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,224
That's way too wide of a
gap to reconnect the ends,

588
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,409
and nerves don't stretch.

589
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,281
We don't need to stretch it,
we can connect the distal end

590
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,083
of the pudendal nerve to the
branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve

591
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,316
from her inner thigh.

592
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,828
Would you rather lose
feeling in your thigh or genitals?

593
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,192
Thigh, definitely.

594
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,258
Is he right? Can we do that?

595
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,332
It probably would've been better
to discuss this prior to meeting

596
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,568
with the patient, but,
yes, I think it could work.

597
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,469
Cut the suture.

598
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,416
The grafted nerve is in place.
Let's see if it will conduct.

599
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,294
Conduction electrodes
are in position.

600
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,594
Send a pulse.

601
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:44,966
Again.

602
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,203
Again.

603
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,474
Again.

604
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,292
Okay, Murphy. We
get it. Your idea worked.

605
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,648
Good job. Both of you.

606
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,117
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

607
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm guessing Melendez
doesn't let you know this enough,

608
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,059
but you both are
doing a great job.

609
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:04,221
And if either of you needs
anything, even just to talk,

610
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,587
my door's always open.

611
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,726
4-0 Vicryl.

612
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,564
Yes, Doctor. Four micra.

613
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,500
She's on bypass.

614
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,468
Cross clamping the aorta.

615
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:25,675
You ready?

616
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,454
- Flush the heart.
- Flushing.

617
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,294
Let's prep her for C-section.

618
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,465
Dr. Andrews?

619
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,373
The operation went perfectly.

620
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,437
But I don't feel
anything down there.

621
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,925
You're still on the
meds, so it's gonna...

622
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,113
It's going to take six months to a
year to regain complete sensation.

623
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,788
It'll take a while for your
brain to figure out what we did,

624
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,015
but the grafted nerve
is fully conducting.

625
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,785
- You're gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

626
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,194
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure.

627
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,029
Call my parents.

628
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,895
Absolutely.

629
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,667
Knife.

630
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,974
Knife.

631
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,095
Bovie.

632
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,596
Bovie.

633
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,287
How are we on bypass?

634
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,194
Dr. Kalu, you still with us?

635
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:21,097
Yeah. Central venous pressure's
good, bypass oxygen tension is 200.

636
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,792
Good. I'm repairing
the fetal sacrum

637
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,894
and then we'll put this
baby back where it belongs.

638
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:27,797
Baby?

639
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,974
That's the first time
you didn't call it a fetus.

640
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:33,709
Just an expression.

641
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,989
I told you.

642
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,154
Yes, you did.

643
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,986
You're gonna need to stay in
bed for the next four months,

644
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,898
but both you and your
son's prognosis is excellent.

645
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,335
Hey, we wanted
it to be a surprise.

646
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,730
Oops.

647
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,804
Rookie mistake.

648
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,639
Yes!

649
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,442
We are definitely
celebrating tonight.

650
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,078
Whoa, whoa. Screw sleep,
Murphy. You are coming with us.

651
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,515
Where are you going?

652
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,557
- Out. We're gonna drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

653
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:19,921
- Don't be an idiot.
- Hey.

654
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,294
I just meant... Come on, mate,

655
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,862
you just saved an
18-year-old girl's sex life,

656
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,959
and I saved two
lives. We are drinking.

657
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:32,997
Come on, Shaun.

658
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,533
- Okay.
- Cool.

659
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,848
<i>There's nothing holding me back</i>

660
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,317
Thanks.

661
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,992
I have to go home now.

662
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,560
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

663
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,058
We won't stay long.

664
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,370
<i>Not really into hesitation</i>

665
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,665
<i>Pulls me in enough
to keep me guessing</i>

666
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:18,416
<i>And maybe I should
stop and start confessing</i>

667
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,416
Hi, Shaun.

668
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,355
Hi, Colleen.

669
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,555
I heard Steve showed
you my dad's magazine.

670
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:35,894
Did you like it?

671
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,838
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

672
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,188
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

673
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,942
All guys like
that kind of stuff.

674
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,008
You wanna know
a secret about me?

675
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,916
I think you're really cute.

676
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,318
You smell like bubblegum.

677
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,857
I know. It's my lip gloss.

678
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,522
Come here.

679
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,097
Come here, silly.

680
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,632
Do you think I'm pretty?

681
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,573
I like you, too.

682
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,471
I'll show you mine, if
you show me yours.

683
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,541
Come on, I'm curious.

684
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:30,153
You must be curious.

685
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,387
Can I have a kiss?

686
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,289
I want to know
what it feels like.

687
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,895
I'll give you a kiss
if you show me.

688
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,690
Show you what?

689
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,632
You know, pull down your pants.

690
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,903
- No.
- Come on, Shaun.

691
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,805
No. I gotta go.

692
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,087
Oh, my God. I can't believe
you were about to pull it out.

693
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,340
No, I wasn't.

694
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,745
Like I'd ever kiss a
creepy weirdo like you.

695
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,650
Leave him alone. Come on.

696
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,518
<i>Baby, there's nothing
holding me back</i>

697
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,787
All right, guys, a toast.

698
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,120
To us. Because we rock.

699
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,029
Nothing else need
be said. Cheers.

700
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,189
Cheers.

701
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:17,424
<i>I feel so free when
you're with me, baby</i>

702
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,127
<i>Baby, there's nothing
holding me back</i>
