1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,602
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,037
Dr. Coyle. He's
a little too friendly.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,717
I'm sure he's just trying
to establish a rapport.

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,061
I give great massages.

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,687
And I'll make a killer
omelette in the morning.

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,340
That's really
inappropriate. I said no.

7
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,813
You're approaching
insubordination.

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,526
<i>You have to file a
complaint with HR.</i>

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,951
They will shift the blame
onto me. Like you did.

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,020
<i>I've just been fired for physically
assaulting an employee.</i>

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,868
So, why do I need to quit
my job to have a family?

12
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,020
Agreed. She can be a great
lawyer and a great mom.

13
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,460
I don't wanna have kids.

14
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,263
<i>I don't need a therapist.</i>

15
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,265
I want to make my own decisions.

16
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,198
I am done talking. Now let's go.

17
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,759
Okay. No. I don't want help!

18
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,014
Where would he go? Is there
a place he likes to hang out?

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,301
No. He's not at the hospital.

20
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,274
And there used to be a picture
here. It means he's not coming back.

21
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,108
Hi. Good morning. I'm Aaron
Glassman, Dr. Glassman.

22
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,581
I work with Shaun.

23
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,279
Hi. Nice to meet you.

24
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,726
It's nice to meet you, too.
May I speak with him, please?

25
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,458
Uh, Shaun isn't here.

26
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,729
I know you've been helping
Shaun, and I appreciate that.

27
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,725
But I really need to speak
with him immediately.

28
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,599
I'll definitely let him
know when I see him next.

29
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,496
- I'm sorry.
- What the hell are you doing?

30
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,939
Come on, I know you're in
here. I just wanna talk. Please.

31
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,642
You are way out of line.

32
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,441
Shaun, you have responsibilities.
We've gotta sort this out.

33
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,325
I'll give you five seconds
to get the hell out of here...

34
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,726
- Shaun?
- Or I'm calling the police.

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,151
Shaun, I just want...

36
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,778
Five...

37
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,181
Shaun?

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,990
Shaun, she's calling the police.

39
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,425
- Is that what you want?
- Four, three...

40
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,823
- Two, one...
- Okay, okay.

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,296
Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

42
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,300
It's just that Shaun has a
tendency to run away from conflict.

43
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,767
And in Casper and medical school

44
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,137
people will give you a
little bit of slack, but he...

45
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,709
Now he's in a very hard-to-get job
in a very competitive environment

46
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,869
where people do not
give you a second chance.

47
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,479
Still. Not cool.

48
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,684
If you speak with him,

49
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,958
will you call me, please?

50
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,317
Out.

51
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,487
Yeah.

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,236
So, what's your plan now?

53
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,841
I don't know.

54
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,189
I gotta say, he seems
like a nebby old jerk.

55
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,322
And a bully.

56
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,764
What's "nebby"?

57
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,095
Nosy. It's a Pittsburgh thing.

58
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,030
I mean, you're a grown man.

59
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,384
If you don't wanna talk to
him, it's none of his business.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,010
San Jose is too big.

61
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,744
I get not liking San Jose.

62
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,336
I'm not the biggest
fan myself, but...

63
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,406
I don't wanna see a therapist.

64
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,407
So, don't.

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,615
I should go back to Casper.

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,951
I have a rule.

67
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,118
Never make an important decision

68
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:18,255
while you are angry, upset, high,
or right before, or after having sex.

69
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,427
Okay? You are overworked,

70
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,230
stressed out and
pissed off at your boss.

71
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,065
Now is not the time to
be making a big decision.

72
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,467
You need to take a
break, clear your head.

73
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,632
You need a vacation.

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,975
I have to work five more
months before I earn a vacation.

75
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,274
So, call in sick.

76
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm not sick.

77
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,948
You're so adorable.

78
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,750
You don't have to
be sick to call in sick.

79
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,286
I have so much to
teach you, Grasshopper.

80
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,486
And I'm gonna start with a
good old-fashioned road trip.

81
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,325
It's the perfect way
to get your mojo back.

82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,399
And when we return,
you're gonna know exactly

83
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:56,436
what to do about San Jose,
therapy, and Glassy the Grouch.

84
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,962
And all you have to do to attain
this superior wisdom and knowledge

85
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,167
is to call

86
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,474
in sick.

87
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,244
Okay. Okay, I will.

88
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,119
Dr. Melendez.
Got a case for you.

89
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,987
My schedule's
pretty packed today.

90
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,586
It's a patient of mine. She
needs a kidney transplant.

91
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,424
You have a donor?

92
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,665
Her identical twin. A
perfect DNA match.

93
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,364
Why is she a patient of yours?

94
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,995
I put balloon tissue expanders
under both girls' scalps

95
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,267
to prepare them for
the separation surgery.

96
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,465
Separation surgery?

97
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,554
It's in six months, after they
recover from the transplant.

98
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,397
Of course, if you're too busy...

99
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,612
No, I'm in.

100
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,282
Where's Murphy?

101
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,882
He's not here yet.

102
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,121
Wrong day to be late.
We're already short-handed.

103
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,040
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about...

104
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,123
I did not fire Kalu.

105
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,332
If you have a problem
with it, talk to Andrews.

106
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,164
Although if you want my advice,
don't have a problem with it.

107
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,872
Andrews is waiting to
brief us on a new case.

108
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,302
It's a kidney transplant
on craniopagus twins.

109
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,173
Conjoined?

110
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,678
They're connected at the skull,

111
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,008
their entire renal-vascular
systems are interdependent.

112
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,711
Cool.

113
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,550
Hey. Have either of
you talked to Shaun?

114
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,815
No. DR. MELENDEZ: No.

115
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,017
Which isn't unusual.

116
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,984
Is anything wrong?

117
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,223
No, no, not with Shaun.
It's a family emergency.

118
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,922
He's gonna be
out for a few days.

119
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,191
He's supposed to get approval

120
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,894
for any personal days
from his attending.

121
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,540
Right. Which is
why I'm checking in.

122
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,868
I think he thought it was
enough just to notify me.

123
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,843
You call in sick?

124
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,185
I'm ready to go.

125
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,285
No, you're not.

126
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,066
You're gonna need more than
a family photo and a toothbrush.

127
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,227
- Go pack.
- Where are we going?

128
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,772
- Wherever the car takes us.
- I don't like the beach.

129
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,466
Okay, I will let the car know.

130
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,271
Even with your
cardiovascular issues,

131
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,075
a kidney transplant is a
relatively safe procedure,

132
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,116
especially since,
with identical twins,

133
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,741
there's no chance
for organ rejection.

134
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,083
Just make sure you keep
straight which one's which.

135
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,453
The charming, pretty
one has the good kidneys.

136
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,483
Don't worry, we
always triple-confirm.

137
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,960
And we put
everything in writing.

138
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,241
- And you're both charming and pretty.
- Mmm-hmm.

139
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,927
It was a joke, Mom.

140
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,729
And smart. They're gonna
be Ivy Leaguers in the fall.

141
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,794
- Yale and Harvard.
- Wow.

142
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,273
Mom, you don't have to tell everyone
you meet where we're going to college.

143
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,470
- Yes, I do.
- That's awesome. Congratulations.

144
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,511
So, who's going where?

145
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,515
What do you think?
She's totally obnoxious

146
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,312
and thinks she's way
funnier than she is.

147
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,678
- Definitely Harvard.
- Mmm-hmm.

148
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,586
Hey. Don't make me
start mocking your tattoo.

149
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,697
I thought you would have your
entire apartment strapped to your back.

150
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,797
- It takes me a long time to pack.
- That's good.

151
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,360
An anal-retentive packer
is the exact type of person

152
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,802
I'd want operating on me.

153
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,966
Lea, this is your car.

154
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,921
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're
gonna take my other one.

155
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,470
Okay. What do you do at work?

156
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,641
Do you really care what I do?

157
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,195
Or do you just wanna
know how someone

158
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,684
with such a crappy
apartment can afford two cars?

159
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,649
I just wanna know how
you can afford two cars.

160
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,014
Hmm.

161
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,220
Yeah, I can't.

162
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,452
My Grandpa Rod died last year

163
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,658
and he left me his
most prized possession.

164
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,561
It's the Striped Tomato.

165
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,503
Oh, my God. You like
<i>Starsky and Hutch?</i>

166
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:54,998
It's okay.

167
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,204
A meticulous packer and
a <i>Starsky and Hutch</i> fan.

168
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,879
Grandpa Rod would've loved you.

169
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:12,484
Okay, this is it. The road.
You sure you wanna do this?

170
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,390
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

171
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,358
I'm sure.

172
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,595
Let's go, Lea.

173
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,728
Here we go!

174
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,541
I hear Murphy's AWOL.

175
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,254
He's taking a few personal days.

176
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,850
- Unapproved personal days.
- I approved them.

177
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,457
It's not your job
to approve them.

178
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,285
Or to say you approved
them to cover up the fact

179
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,559
that Murphy's frequent tardiness
has escalated to absences.

180
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,530
What do you want me
to do? Take a polygraph?

181
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,102
How about we jump into
enhanced interrogation?

182
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,283
Here, how about this? Do
you want me to turn this on?

183
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
When the Board was
reconsidering your hiring of Murphy,

184
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,270
you assured us that if he was
anything less than excellent,

185
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,649
he'd be dismissed
and you would resign.

186
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:10,978
I trust you remember that.

187
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,048
I wouldn't have your movers
pack up your office just yet.

188
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,399
You can't protect
Murphy forever.

189
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,724
At some point, he needs to
succeed or fail on his own.

190
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,110
Okay, that's three hours
on the warm ischemia clock

191
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,966
of the transplanted kidney.

192
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,601
Ureter is attached
to the bladder.

193
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,468
How's the kidney's
placement in the iliac fossa?

194
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,309
No kinking or twisting
of the renal vessel.

195
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,606
Good.

196
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,415
You ready to close?

197
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,745
Yes.

198
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,134
Your best bet is a
continuous suture

199
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,353
along the fascial layer.

200
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,519
Suture.

201
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,462
Donor's pressure's dropping.
Okay, up the oxygen.

202
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,079
Jenny must be
bleeding internally.

203
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,334
We're gonna have to open
her back up. Staple-remover.

204
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,178
I like trees.

205
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,680
Yeah? What else do you like?

206
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,945
Besides reading medical journals
and watching reruns of old cop shows.

207
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,551
I like you.

208
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,054
Well, who wouldn't?
I'm very likeable.

209
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,989
Why don't you like San Jose?

210
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,032
Everyone's so competitive here.

211
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:36,235
You know, if you didn't make a
million by 30, you're a total loser.

212
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,998
I don't need a million dollars.

213
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,869
I don't even think I
need 90,000, but...

214
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,869
You know what we both
need are some tunes.

215
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,417
What's your preferred
driving music?

216
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,542
Music? No. I don't
like music. No...

217
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,345
What? No, no. Not okay.

218
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,420
Okay, I will give you a
pass on not liking the beach

219
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,183
because you're cute
and I might need you

220
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,616
to do brain surgery
on me someday,

221
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,991
but not liking
music, unacceptable.

222
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,495
- I won't have it.
- Are you being sarcastic?

223
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,997
No, I am being...

224
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,925
I actually don't
know the word for it,

225
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,900
but my point stands.
Music is amazing.

226
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,269
You know, I remember
every important thing

227
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,568
that has ever happened to me

228
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,167
based on what song I
was listening to at the time.

229
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,877
I remember smells.

230
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,409
Like our parking garage
smells like fabric-softener.

231
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,043
And when my brother died,
it smelled like burnt food.

232
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,390
Oh, my God. I'm so
sorry. I had no idea.

233
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,754
How did he...

234
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,121
If you don't mind me asking?

235
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,096
My father was mean.

236
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:45,735
He killed my pet, so my
brother and I, we ran away.

237
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,897
Then he fell off a train
we were playing on,

238
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,237
hit his head and died.

239
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,372
I never went back home.

240
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,277
Dr. Glassman has watched
out for me ever since.

241
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,756
Okay, so, maybe he's not
that much of a nebby jerk.

242
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,888
What are you smelling right now?

243
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,795
Pine trees.

244
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,270
I'm never gonna forget
that when you told me

245
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,674
about your brother and your
dad, it smelled like pine trees.

246
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,972
But I don't want
you to ever forget

247
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,447
that right after you told
me, we were listening to...

248
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,916
No. Do not remember that.

249
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,516
- Or that.
- No, thank you.

250
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,285
Nope. Not feeling it.

251
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,819
Ooh.

252
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,488
So good.

253
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,628
This is the one
you will not forget.

254
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,859
- Do not forget this.
- Okay.

255
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,412
<i>I drank the whole moon dry
Because all my friends are metalheads</i>

256
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,132
<i>Swear they'd never catch us dead</i>

257
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,607
<i>Split up when the police come</i>

258
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,043
<i>Yeah, running
used to get me high</i>

259
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,971
<i>Now I only feel tired</i>

260
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,689
Jenny had a post-op
renal vein rupture.

261
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,134
We were able to repair it
before she lost too much blood.

262
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,854
But both your vitals
are stable now.

263
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,792
And Katie's new kidney
is functioning well.

264
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,122
Thank God.

265
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,496
Will her ruptured vein have any
effect on our separation surgery?

266
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,792
It better not.

267
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,046
Katie, I love you, but if I have
to spend one minute more

268
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,006
than I have to watching you
practicing some Mozart song...

269
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,869
They're not songs,
they're concertos.

270
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,179
Don't worry, six
months is still the plan.

271
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,892
Look, what I did was
incredibly unprofessional

272
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,929
and just inexcusable.

273
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,895
But I'm guessing you're
gonna give one anyway.

274
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,261
No.

275
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,365
No, just an explanation,
and a request.

276
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,256
It could help me to convince
Andrews I deserve a second chance.

277
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,273
Okay.

278
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,047
Let's hear the explanation.

279
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,183
Dr. Browne and I
are seeing each other.

280
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,015
Look, if you could just
put yourself in my shoes.

281
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,582
A woman I care about
tells me a guy harassed her.

282
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,585
And even worse, she tells me
it's my fault because I was too...

283
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,464
Too stupidly insensitive to
understand what she was going through.

284
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,196
I felt like crap.

285
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,934
And like an idiot,

286
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,903
I tried to make it up to her.

287
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,308
All I'm asking for is just
a little understanding.

288
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,468
Wouldn't you have
done the same thing?

289
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,488
Not my problem.

290
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,320
- Yeah?
- Jenny's bradycardic and hypotensive.

291
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,592
- What's happening?
- She was fine a minute ago.

292
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,145
We were talking and then she
started to have trouble breathing.

293
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,502
Jenny's heart is failing.

294
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,635
No pulse.

295
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,802
She's in V-tach. Grab
the cart. Page Melendez.

296
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,857
Jenny's stable. I have her on
beta blockers and vasodilators.

297
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,184
It's not gonna be enough.

298
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,737
The renal vein rupture
must've caused her

299
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,354
already weak
heart to deteriorate.

300
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,692
She's in end-stage failure.

301
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,108
I'll get her on the
transplant registry.

302
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,657
What are we talking,
months? Weeks?

303
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,825
Days.

304
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,855
We're not gonna find a
donor heart in a few days.

305
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,540
We could disconnect
her from the other body

306
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,942
her heart is partially
oxygenating the blood for.

307
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,359
It was already
pushing the envelope

308
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,376
to do the separation surgery six
months after a kidney transplant.

309
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,546
You really think they can
handle it one day after?

310
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,718
It may be our only choice.

311
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,018
Yeah.

312
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,813
His calls are an even
bigger buzzkill than this rain.

313
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,701
And defeating the
whole purpose of this trip.

314
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,863
Okay.

315
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,070
Residents are not supposed
to turn off their phones.

316
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,143
How about we make a deal?

317
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,745
If you turn off your
phone, I'll let you drive.

318
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,209
I don't have a driver's license.

319
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,343
I know.

320
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,020
I've always wanted
to learn to drive.

321
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,580
- I know.
- Dr. Glassman,

322
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,717
- he never wanted me to.
- I know.

323
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,187
Actually, I didn't know that,

324
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,889
but that definitely
sounds like Glassy.

325
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,330
- Okay.
- Yeah.

326
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,868
You're doing awesome.
You're a natural.

327
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,746
Thank you. I think so, too.

328
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,510
Blinker.

329
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,548
All right. Now,
make this left turn.

330
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,852
Okay, don't circle this time.
Just keep going straight.

331
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,797
- What are you stopping for?
- You want me to go out on the street?

332
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,637
It's where the car wants to go.

333
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,266
Come on. What's the worst
thing that could happen?

334
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,240
I could run over
someone and kill them.

335
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,111
You have autism, you're not
blind. And I'll be right here with you.

336
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,084
Mmm-hmm.

337
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,722
Half Dome, here we come.
Can I turn on the radio?

338
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,766
- No. No, thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

339
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,244
We believe moving up
the separation surgery

340
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,289
will lighten the load
on Jenny's heart,

341
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,846
maybe allow it to recover a bit

342
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,153
so a transplant won't even
be necessary in the future.

343
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,955
It is higher risk for Katie now,

344
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,662
given that her new kidney
is still not fully functional.

345
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,166
What do you think we should do?

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,432
It's your bodies, your decision.

347
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,595
- Mom, stop it.
- No, I'm serious.

348
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,202
I raised you both to be
strong and independent.

349
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,964
And you are.

350
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,037
So, whatever you
decide, I'll support.

351
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,042
Let's do it.

352
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,679
Go ahead, chop us in half.

353
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,481
Katie?

354
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,181
We obviously need
both your consent.

355
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,383
Okay.

356
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,791
You sure? You wanna talk
more? Have any questions?

357
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,127
No. I'm good, let's do it.

358
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,535
- I want a car.
- So, get one.

359
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,195
You've been driving a half-hour

360
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,317
and you're already better than
half the people in San Jose.

361
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,469
I get distracted when I'm alone.

362
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,176
That's why I miss
my bus sometimes.

363
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,882
Dr. Glassman thinks I'd
do the same thing driving.

364
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,508
He's probably right.

365
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,519
Wanna have some fun?

366
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,585
I'm already having fun.

367
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,182
- Stop the car.
- Why?

368
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,318
Just do it.

369
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,189
Thank you.

370
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,166
Don't worry, we're the only
car on the road right now.

371
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,548
Put your left foot on the brake.

372
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,368
- Okay.
- There we go.

373
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,843
Hold it all the way
down. There you go.

374
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,038
Okay, now floor the
gas with your right foot.

375
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,883
- No, I don't know about this.
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

376
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,545
Now slowly ease your
left foot off the brake.

377
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,894
Until you hear this.

378
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,263
I smell smoke.

379
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,389
Yeah, that's the point,
Shaun. It's burning rubber.

380
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,593
Do it again.

381
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,426
Okay.

382
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,302
Now, this is fun.

383
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,907
Okay, that's enough.

384
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,711
We need some rubber
left to get us home.

385
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,246
I am burning rubber.

386
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,083
- Okay, Shaun, it's time to stop.
- Okay.

387
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,819
Shaun, take your
other foot off the gas!

388
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,218
Shaun, look out!

389
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,061
It's the other foot! Other...

390
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,708
It's the other foot!
It's the other foot!

391
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,791
It's the other foot!

392
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,467
Dr. Ko and I have
been working for months

393
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,506
to map the structure of
Jenny and Katie's brain.

394
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,835
Don't you mean brains?

395
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,419
Actually, while different regions
operate independently for each sister,

396
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,809
there is a single brain mass.

397
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,812
That's why all their
previous neurosurgeons

398
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,643
insisted separation
was impossible.

399
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,975
The real problem won't
be dividing their brains,

400
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,677
but dividing their veins.

401
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:57,248
They share a single
sagittal sinus vein.

402
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,751
Which we'll give to Jenny.

403
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,954
Then we'll create a new one for
Katie using a grafted vein from her leg.

404
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,293
Nice. You've gotten
them up to speed fast.

405
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,526
Well, with six months
of prep to do in 12 hours,

406
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,794
it was our only choice.

407
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,268
So, let's get started.

408
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:11,595
- I crashed.
- We didn't.

409
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,037
Yes, I crashed. I hit something.

410
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,438
I hit something. I
did. I hit something.

411
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,820
- I know I did. I felt it. I crashed.
- Shaun, you didn't crash,

412
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,312
- you just drove off the road.
- No.

413
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,990
- No, you're wrong.
- And it was totally my fault.

414
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,676
- I hit something.
- No, you didn't.

415
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,309
- I felt it. I crashed. I crashed.
- Look at me. Calm down.

416
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,351
- Okay. Okay.
- Calm. Look at me. Look at me.

417
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,380
Breathe. Whatever
happened, whatever you felt,

418
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,685
you did nothing wrong.

419
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,327
It was all my fault. Okay?

420
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,890
Okay. Dr. Glassman,
he was right.

421
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,161
I should not be
allowed to drive.

422
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,234
No, no.

423
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,734
Shaun?

424
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,508
No, I'm not going
to drive, thank you.

425
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,482
Yeah, I know. No one is.

426
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,910
'Cause you were right,
we did hit something.

427
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,094
Everything is
still looking good.

428
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,435
If you need anything
during the night,

429
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,871
just press your call button.

430
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,869
- Is Jenny asleep?
- Yeah.

431
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,743
Where's Dr. Andrews?

432
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:30,349
He is with Dr. Ko
and Dr. Melendez.

433
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,029
They're working to finalize the
surgical protocol for tomorrow.

434
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,553
I need to talk to him.

435
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,753
Is there anything I can do?

436
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,050
I changed my mind.

437
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,619
I don't wanna do the
separation surgery.

438
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,865
I'll go find him right away.

439
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,080
I understand she's scared,
but without this surgery,

440
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,808
there is a good
chance both of them die.

441
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,293
- Have you talked to the mother?
- She refuses to weigh in,

442
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,444
insists it's their decision.

443
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,632
Let me try and talk to her.

444
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,360
I don't think
that's a good idea.

445
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,091
You invented the technique
you're gonna use to separate them.

446
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:13,884
So?

447
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,928
So, she's not even
close to objective.

448
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,561
Okay, now is not the time
to be worrying about lawsuits.

449
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,655
That's my job.

450
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,365
And our job is saving
these girls' lives.

451
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,902
Okay. Take it easy. We're
all on the same team here.

452
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,283
- I'll talk to her.
- You've already talked to her.

453
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,331
I will try again.

454
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,602
Browne should do it.

455
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,271
Me?

456
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,909
We need someone that
an 18-year-old girl trusts.

457
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,255
She's also the best
communicator out of all of us.

458
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:48,951
Okay.

459
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,806
We'll give Katie the
night to think it over.

460
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,141
Browne, you'll talk
to her in the morning,

461
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,690
get her to consent
to this surgery.

462
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,260
And if I'm not able to do that?

463
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,539
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

464
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,477
Cars break. That's why
God makes mechanics.

465
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,872
And booze.

466
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,623
- Two shots of tequila, please.
- You got it.

467
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,639
I'm not thirsty.

468
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:13,151
You don't drink tequila
because you're thirsty.

469
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,287
Have you ever been drunk?

470
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,449
Never?

471
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:23,628
Eight years of college
and not one frat party?

472
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,888
Tailgating?

473
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,696
Your roommate's 21st birthday?

474
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,823
What is your job?

475
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,660
Now you're interested in my job?

476
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,693
Yes.

477
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,869
I'm an automotive engineer.

478
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,840
I work for a start-up that's
developing new designs

479
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,400
for self-driving cars.

480
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,671
Do you like it?

481
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,037
No.

482
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,310
I like to build things.

483
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:49,014
Not sit in endless meetings
talking about building things.

484
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,484
Thank you.

485
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,056
Perfect timing.

486
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,750
We are supposed to
be forgetting about work.

487
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,029
For living happy, because
you're a long time dead.

488
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,380
It's good.

489
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,078
Oh, my God.

490
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,211
You have to be the
first person in history

491
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,256
to actually like their
first tequila shot.

492
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,380
It's good.

493
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,050
- Do you want another?
- Okay.

494
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,726
Tequila. Stat.

495
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,919
Yes.

496
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,465
What?

497
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,369
Sorry, I just zoned out.

498
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:48,945
We should break this off.

499
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,748
There's only so much
studying you can do.

500
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,085
Do you want kids?

501
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,660
Sorry, that's none
of my business.

502
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,430
No, it's...

503
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,233
It's just not a question
I was expecting.

504
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,262
Jessica just told
me she doesn't.

505
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,760
Ever.

506
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,265
- Wow.
- It doesn't make any sense.

507
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,432
She would be such
an amazing mother.

508
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:20,079
I guess she's lucky she
realized before it's too late.

509
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,341
Some women don't.

510
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,081
My mom was
definitely one of those.

511
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,411
- Sorry, I didn't mean to...
- No. It's okay.

512
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,981
Water under the bridge
that nearly drowned me.

513
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,522
It was a long time ago.

514
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,528
I don't know what to do.

515
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,133
I can't imagine
my life without her.

516
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,334
But I also can't
imagine a life without...

517
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:50,968
I'm sorry.

518
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,939
Again, this is not your problem.

519
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,480
- It's okay.
- Go. Goodbye.

520
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,286
Finding someone you
can't imagine a life without,

521
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,656
it's hard.

522
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,354
I know it's a
cliché, but it is true.

523
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,128
Good night.

524
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,832
Good night.

525
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,742
<i>Islands in the stream
That is what we are</i>

526
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,578
<i>No one in between
How can we be wrong?</i>

527
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:35,882
<i>Sail away with me
To another world</i>

528
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,514
<i>And we rely on each other</i>

529
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,161
<i>From one lover to another</i>

530
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:48,157
<i>I can't live without you</i>

531
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:03,939
I love you.

532
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,244
I love you, too.

533
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,911
So, I will volunteer

534
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,922
with foster kids,

535
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,583
coach youth sports.

536
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,095
There are other ways
that I can be a father figure

537
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,788
without actually being a father.

538
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,695
In one day, I taught you
how to play hooky from work,

539
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,934
how to drive, how to drink

540
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,718
and how to totally rock
the house in karaoke.

541
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,941
No. You did not teach
me to drive very well at all.

542
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,575
- At all. I crashed.
- Oh! How dare you?

543
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,451
No, you didn't crash. You hit a
rock that should not have been there.

544
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,991
The whole point of a road
shoulder is to provide a buffer zone.

545
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,558
Who the hell designs a buffer zone
with a huge rock in it? You know?

546
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,892
They should be fired.

547
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,565
Okay. Hold it
right there, partner.

548
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,637
I got one more
thing to teach you.

549
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,465
- What is it?
- The proper way to end a date.

550
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,614
Tell me you hope I
had a good time tonight.

551
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,943
Go ahead.

552
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,353
I hope you had a
good time tonight.

553
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,428
I did. I had a very
nice time tonight.

554
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,963
You're really fun
to sing karaoke with.

555
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,134
Now tell me I'm really fun, too,

556
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,295
and that you hope we
can do it again soon.

557
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,832
You're really fun, too.

558
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,043
- Thank you.
- I hope that we can do it again soon.

559
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,541
Now open the door for me.

560
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,178
Now, if I just walk in,

561
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,848
don't bother trying
for a second date.

562
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,019
It's a swing and a miss. Not a
big deal. Happens to everyone.

563
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,324
But if I don't walk in,

564
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,026
if I just stand
there in front of you

565
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,159
like I don't really
want to go inside,

566
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,828
like I'm doing right now,

567
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,038
then you have to kiss me.

568
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,176
Kiss me, Shaun.

569
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,594
Have you ever done that before?

570
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,835
No. No, no, no.

571
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,433
Well, you're pretty good at
it. You wanna do it again?

572
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,272
Yes, but...

573
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,102
But what?

574
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:05,724
I know it's frightening. You've
already been through so much.

575
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,626
I'm not scared. I just think,

576
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,795
what if this is how
we're meant to be?

577
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,430
Maybe we're better as one.

578
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,914
I grew up in a trailer,

579
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:30,548
with my mom telling me every
day that I was no better than her,

580
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:35,387
and that I would never do
anything, I'd never be anyone.

581
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,723
And I...

582
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,831
I hated being there.

583
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,996
But when I finally left,

584
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:50,302
walking out of the dirty,
disgusting double-wide

585
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,141
was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

586
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,085
Wait, so am I the awful mom

587
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,451
or the disgusting
trailer in this story?

588
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,113
Um...

589
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,998
It's amazing what you've
accomplished so far. It really is.

590
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,604
But you can be so much more.

591
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:26,871
And with the freedom
to just finally be yourself.

592
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,679
Just yourself.

593
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,682
I've never seen it that way.

594
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,187
Katie's back on board.

595
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,387
Told you.

596
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,521
She's very persuasive.

597
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,831
Shaun?

598
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,917
I feel disgusting.

599
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,679
You're just hungover.

600
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,585
You are never gonna want
me to kiss you ever again.

601
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,331
If I had brushed my teeth
before I rushed out here,

602
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,923
I'd ask you to do
it again, right now.

603
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,765
Why are you so hard on yourself?

604
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:32,003
I'm sure you got made fun
of a lot when you were a kid.

605
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,207
And that leaves a mark, I know.

606
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,910
But you gotta shake it
off. Rub some dirt on it.

607
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,282
You're never gonna be happy
if you constantly live in fear.

608
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,011
- We need to talk.
- Look, I have nothing to say to you.

609
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,594
Well, then you can just listen.

610
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,098
You are not a victim.
Not even close.

611
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,606
But you will be unless you
convince Andrews to reinstate Jared.

612
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,467
Are you threatening me?

613
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,138
No, I'm just informing
you that there is no way

614
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,374
that I am the only resident

615
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,576
that you tried to intimidate
into having sex with you.

616
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:16,144
And I will make it my mission
in life to find every single one

617
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,052
and get them to file a
complaint against you,

618
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,648
unless Jared gets his job back.

619
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,061
And what makes you so sure
Andrews cares what I have to say?

620
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,757
I'm not. But either
Jared's career gets saved

621
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,264
or yours gets destroyed.

622
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,324
Either way is a win for me.

623
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,470
Fifteen blade.

624
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,681
Removing the first
balloon tissue expander.

625
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,028
One down. Five to go.

626
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,353
<i>Hi, Shaun.</i>

627
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,847
<i>It's me again. Um...</i>

628
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,520
<i>You know, Dr. Andrews has
never really been in your corner</i>

629
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:36,059
<i>and your absence is
causing a real problem.</i>

630
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,398
<i>Please call me
before it's too late.</i>

631
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,074
<i>Or at least call me and
let me know where you are,</i>

632
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,702
<i>'cause I'm worried.</i>

633
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:55,213
The Cavitron allows us to use
a low-frequency sound wave

634
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,549
to separate them,

635
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,057
so we don't damage the
healthy tissue in the process.

636
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,889
I still can't tell where Katie
starts and Jenny ends.

637
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,489
Imaging is a huge help,

638
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:14,229
but once a patient is opened,
it's kind of like backcountry skiing.

639
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,902
It's never the same on top.

640
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,673
What you want to focus on

641
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,546
is the terrain you
know is underneath.

642
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,364
<i>Here, here we are</i>

643
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,206
<i>And all we got, we
had from the start</i>

644
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:56,444
<i>So get up, get up,
get up and go on...</i>

645
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,572
Cut.

646
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,117
Okay. Grafted
sagittal is in place.

647
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,080
Let's remove the clamps.

648
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:11,953
Hey.

649
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,230
Looks good. No leaks.

650
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:17,996
Now the moment of truth.

651
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,395
Scissors.

652
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,004
Dr. Ko, would you
like to do the honors?

653
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,401
Definitely.

654
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,608
<i>So get up, get up,
get up and go on</i>

655
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,172
Can we get a little more room?

656
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:33,661
Coming right up.

657
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:37,816
<i>Just a little belief to
shake off the doubt</i>

658
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,274
And then there were two.

659
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,029
<i>It's building up</i>

660
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:54,503
<i>It's been building
up for so long</i>

661
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,073
Thanks for taking
me on a road trip.

662
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,981
I feel a lot better.

663
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,677
I think I'm ready to
talk to Dr. Glassman.

664
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,584
Yeah. I feel much better, too.

665
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,486
And ready to talk to my boss.

666
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,853
What do you have to
talk to your boss about?

667
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,261
He offered me a promotion.

668
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,195
Will you be making
a million dollars?

669
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,195
Very funny.

670
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,331
I make 70,000 now, and
the new position pays 90,

671
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,330
but I'm not gonna take it.

672
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,609
Why not? It pays $20,000 more.

673
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,011
Yeah, I get the math,
Shaun. But just taking this trip,

674
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,518
and you, have inspired
me to do something

675
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,496
that I've been thinking
about for a really long time,

676
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,352
but I've just been
too scared to do it.

677
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,855
I'm gonna quit my job.

678
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,756
You're so silly. What would
you do during the day?

679
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,056
Rebuild old cars.

680
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,567
No more conference calls. No
more never-ending meetings.

681
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:01,871
The only thing I'm not
looking forward to is moving.

682
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,305
Why would you move?

683
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,035
Because that's where the
shop that I'm gonna work at is.

684
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,714
I got the Striped Tomato,

685
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,943
my brother Donny got
Grandpa Rod's shop

686
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,418
in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

687
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,955
It's been over a year, but
every time I drive his car,

688
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,994
I keep thinking,

689
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:28,427
you know, I don't need a more
impressive title or a million dollars.

690
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,759
He would take me fishing
in Alaska every summer,

691
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,270
skiing every winter break.

692
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:37,503
I haven't taken more than one day
off in four years because I always work.

693
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,936
It never stops.

694
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,172
And just taking
this trip with you

695
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,245
made me realize I...

696
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,108
I want to enjoy my life,

697
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,078
you know?

698
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,190
Okay, what? Say something.

699
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:08,996
You're...

700
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,518
- Hello?
<i>- Jared,</i>

701
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,265
this is Dr. Andrews.
Do you have a moment?

702
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,885
Yeah, of course.

703
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,861
<i>Dr. Coyle approached me today.</i>

704
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,695
He told me that he feels awful
about the way he treated Dr. Browne

705
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,531
and how it came to affect you.

706
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,532
And he asked me to
reconsider your termination.

707
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,540
You should also know that Dr. Melendez
spoke in support of you as well.

708
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,840
Thank you for letting me know.

709
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,711
I was impressed by the
integrity you demonstrated

710
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,478
by taking full responsibility
for your actions.

711
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,330
And I'm certainly
willing to make that clear

712
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,982
to any administrators
at another hospital

713
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,684
if you'd need me as a reference.

714
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,718
<i>But I won't reinstate you.</i>

715
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:04,822
Physical assault is a line

716
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:07,491
I'm just not willing
to let anyone cross.

717
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,260
I understand.

718
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:10,493
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

719
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,693
<i>Take care.</i>

720
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,507
When will they wake up?

721
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,849
They should've already.

722
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,081
Shaun?

723
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,552
Shaun.

724
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,890
<i>Our sharp teeth
are the only light</i>

725
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:16,457
<i>I drank the whole moon dry</i>

726
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,833
<i>Because all my friends are metalheads
Swear they'd never catch us dead</i>

727
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,907
<i>Split up when the police come</i>

728
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:26,838
<i>Yeah, running
used to get me high</i>

729
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,405
<i>Now I only feel tired</i>
