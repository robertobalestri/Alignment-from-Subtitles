1
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,884
Sorry, did I wake you?

2
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:09,969
Yes.

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,596
The baby's pressing
on my bladder,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,850
so I have to pee approximately
78 times every night.

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:20,438
We can talk about baby names
since we are both awake.

6
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,818
I keep coming back
to one name…Kelly.

7
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,863
It reminds me of a Kelly clamp.

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,948
And I will think about
grasping onto tissue

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,534
or vessels every time
I'm holding our son.

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,162
What about Addison?

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,497
Addison Murphy.

12
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,375
Addison is the
name of a disease.

13
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,755
I'll worry our son is not producing
enough cortisol or aldosterone.

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,969
You can go back to sleep, I
have to go pee again anyway.

15
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,483
Good morning. Pancakes, anyone?

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,277
They are not just
ordinary pancakes.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,488
They are Dutch baby pancakes,

18
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,783
also known as Bismarcks, Dutch
puffs, and even Hootenannies.

19
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,993
- I looked it up.
- That is correct.

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,788
They're baked in the oven
not fried. I was up early.

21
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,874
Sorry if my frequent
bathroom trips kept you up.

22
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,210
Don't be silly.
You're making a human.

23
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,253
Thank you.

24
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:30,341
So, Kelly and Addison are
out, I don't disagree.

25
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,343
How about Munchausen?

26
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,762
- Shaun…
- Or Parkinson?

27
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,265
Our bedroom conversations
are private.

28
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,392
All of them?

29
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,187
It's not like we
were talking about...

30
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,773
Never mind.

31
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,525
Let's eat.

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,488
A friend on the San Jose
schoolboard reached out,

33
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,366
they're looking for someone to
give a series of online talks

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,702
to high schoolers about
careers in medicine.

35
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,121
Specifically to
young women of color.

36
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,290
- That's great.
- I thought you'd be perfect.

37
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,875
Oh.

38
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,378
That wasn't the reaction
I was expecting.

39
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,506
Maybe Dr. Tooks can do it?

40
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,258
Tooks is a mom,

41
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,844
these high schoolkids don't
see themselves in her.

42
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,055
- There's gotta be someone else.
- There isn't.

43
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,641
Only 2% of surgeons
in the U.S. are black.

44
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,310
Don't be afraid to step
into the spotlight.

45
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,313
I'm not afraid,
I'm just very busy.

46
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,358
Okay. It'll only take a
couple hours of your time.

47
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,862
"If you can see it, you
can be it" is a real thing…

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,199
It's not my responsibility
to be the one they see.

49
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,452
Okay.

50
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,213
Nathan hit his head on
the trampoline frame

51
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,715
at his birthday party.

52
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,884
He got a bump, but
he seemed fine…

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,344
Where's daddy?

54
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,349
I told you, he's at work helping people.
He'll be back in a few days, okay.

55
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,060
Is it possible to develop a
concussion two days later?

56
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,938
Let's see if we can find
out what's going on.

57
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,820
Nathan, what's
your puppy's name?

58
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,572
Patches.

59
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,326
Can I look into Patches' eyes with
this light? Make sure he's okay?

60
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,995
Or you can do it?

61
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,622
Just look in here.

62
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,917
Can you pick this up and
give it to the doctor?

63
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,462
I can't. Where's daddy?

64
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,385
Can you give me
a high five, bud.

65
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,305
Good. Now high ten.

66
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,603
What is happening?
Is this a concussion?

67
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,105
It's not a concussion.

68
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,107
Your son is having a stroke.

69
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,212
- You are late.
- No, I'm not.

70
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,923
It's 8:01 am.

71
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,132
It... It is now.

72
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,553
But I'm sure it was still 8:00
when I walked through the door.

73
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,263
Were you getting your hair cut?

74
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,223
No.

75
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,226
Are you using drugs again?

76
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,853
No.

77
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:35,442
You are on probation and
I am responsible for you.

78
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,070
Common signs include
ignoring responsibilities

79
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,947
and secretive behavior.

80
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,407
I promise, I'm clean.

81
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,534
I'll pee in a cup if you want.

82
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,784
Okay.

83
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,413
I'm going to assist Dr. Park.

84
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,165
You can join the case if
your sample comes back clean.

85
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,252
I wasn't even late.

86
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,965
A chance to help
young diverse women

87
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,884
and kiss the hospital
president's ass at the same time?

88
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,803
There's only one answer to that

89
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,180
and it starts with a "y"
and ends with a "yes."

90
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,934
- That didn't work.
- I know. But I stand by my point.

91
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,310
Aren't we busy enough?

92
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,939
Why do I have extra homework
because I have more melanin?

93
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
And why is my
Grandma E texting me?

94
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,402
You shouldn't think
of it as homework

95
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,904
and you shouldn't think
of it as a burden.

96
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,657
You shouldn't think you know
what it's like to be me.

97
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,784
Point taken.

98
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,287
What the…?

99
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,040
Okay, can we just focus
on our patients, please?

100
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,255
Quinque, there you are.

101
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,591
Grandma E? What
are you doing here?

102
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,427
I was told they
have doctors here.

103
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,599
I've got tightness in my chest,
shortness of breath, swollen ankles...

104
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,601
Didn't you see your
doctors in Oakland?

105
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:56,482
Those idiots said my ascites
indicated "cirrhosis of the liver"

106
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,233
like I'm some kind of drunk.

107
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,737
I figured with my
family connections,

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,198
I could get top-shelf care here.

109
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,408
I can't be involved
in any of your...

110
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,743
But I can.

111
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,872
Delighted to meet you
Grandma E, I'm Dr. Wolke.

112
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,794
Okay, Jordan baby, you stay and
keep an eye on little mister here.

113
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,713
He might try to skate
by on his good looks.

114
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,717
Can you lean back for me?

115
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,473
Jordan, you never
mentioned having a sister.

116
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,558
See, I like him.

117
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,479
Distended jugular veins
with increased JVP.

118
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,607
Kussmaul's sign and
Pulsus paradoxus.

119
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,568
Maybe I don't like
you so much now.

120
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,654
She does have a history
of chest radiation.

121
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,121
- Echo-brightness of the pericardium.
- What does that mean?

122
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:56,082
The sac around your heart is inflamed
and there are calcium deposits.

123
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,417
Grandma?

124
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,674
- Faint pulses.
- Let's do something before she arrest.

125
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,843
Set up an O.R. STAT
for a pericardiotomy.

126
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,515
No, Rick, stay. I
promise I've got this.

127
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,226
Sorry to interrupt. We're ready.

128
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,022
Can you please
talk to my husband?

129
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,691
Of course.

130
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,567
This is Doctor Park.

131
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,529
How does a four year old
end up with a stroke?

132
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,614
Head trauma is one
of the main causes.

133
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:31,618
I feel like I should get on a plane
now, but Linda's telling me to stay.

134
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,370
- How far are you?
- Alabama.

135
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,498
We still have people missing
after the tornado ripped through.

136
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,084
I can't tell you
how to prioritize.

137
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,337
I'm hoping to make your son better
well before you could get here.

138
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:43,839
Thank you.

139
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,968
We're okay.

140
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,181
And you'll be back in a few days
anyway. Just stay and keep helping.

141
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,433
Okay.

142
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,649
Evacuating the hematoma.

143
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,110
I saw on the Weather Channel

144
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,405
that the Alabama tornado
was the 15th to reach a four

145
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,033
on the Enhanced Fujita scale
in the last three years.

146
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,620
Together they have
caused 116 fatalities.

147
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,956
Luckily we have people like his
Dad who run towards a crisis.

148
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,543
But he also has a crisis
right here with his son.

149
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,670
He didn't know
that when he left.

150
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,840
I'm not seeing an
active bleeder.

151
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:34,056
There is a hyper-vascularized brain
parenchyma in this resection cavity.

152
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,226
The major named vessels
are all smaller than usual,

153
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,852
and look scarred in.

154
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,149
The hemorrhage was not
from hitting his head.

155
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,071
This boy and his brain are
even sicker than we thought.

156
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,991
Lighting the sternal retractor.

157
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,288
So why does she
call you Queen K?

158
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,790
It's Quinque.

159
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,876
Latin for five because I'm
the fifth child of six.

160
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,003
Does she call your
little brother Sex?

161
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,297
Please focus so you don't
kill my grandmother.

162
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,133
Cauterizing the edges of
the sternal periosteum.

163
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,387
She's so charming.

164
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,931
Why didn't you get
any of those genes?

165
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,102
Charm is one of many layers
of a very complicated woman.

166
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,563
Grandma E drove me like a drill
sergeant from the day I was born.

167
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,985
Ensure the pericardium is free from
both the pleurae and the diaphragm.

168
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,196
15 blade.

169
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,453
I need a new 15 blade…

170
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,206
What's happening?

171
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,963
I can't pierce it. Never seen
constrictive pericarditis this severe.

172
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,051
It's completely calcified.

173
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,054
Your grandma has what's
known as coconut heart.

174
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:07,316
Your son has a rare auto-immune
disorder called Primary CNS vasculitis.

175
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,777
It's causing inflammation of his
blood vessels throughout his brain.

176
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,866
Okay. What are the next steps?

177
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,076
Cyclophosphamide infusions.

178
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,911
That's chemo.

179
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,332
My mother had that when
she had breast cancer

180
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,585
and she lost her hair, threw up,
got sores all over her mouth.

181
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,087
Letting this go
untreated is far worse.

182
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,549
Recurrent brain bleeds, possibly
large territory strokes.

183
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,675
They could be fatal.

184
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,887
Nathan will be on some
form of immunosuppression

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,138
his whole life.

186
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,351
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,479
Thank you, Doctor.

188
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,824
How do you crack a coconut without
puncturing what's underneath?

189
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,035
Constrictive pericarditis.

190
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,039
Please stop saying coconut. It's
my grandmother and it's serious.

191
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,540
Not your case.

192
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,877
I'm just having a snack
and trying to help...

193
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,590
We need ideas.

194
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,636
Left anterior thoracotomy and
partial excision of the pericardium.

195
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,639
Avoid sternal infection and
seems likely the safest route.

196
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,516
It'll require more surgeries.

197
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,767
Please go away.

198
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,061
Wait, what are you
advocating for?

199
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,687
Complete removal.

200
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,439
A median sternotomy gives us

201
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:33,443
clear access to the diseased pericardium
from phrenic nerve to phrenic nerve.

202
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,736
It's way too risky.

203
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,905
Complete decortication
fixes her heart.

204
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,448
Completely.

205
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,203
You're advocating for an
extensive, high-risk surgery.

206
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,288
Meanwhile, partial removal

207
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,999
offers your 70-year-oldgrandmother
a shot at full health

208
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,335
for what likely amount
to the rest of her life.

209
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,546
Shouldn't you let
the patient decide?

210
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,715
No. I don't present something
if it's not a viable option.

211
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,175
I think it is viable.

212
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,510
Her surgeon doesn't.

213
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,304
Jordan, go be a granddaughter.

214
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,565
If I hadn't become a surgeon, I
think I would've been a writer.

215
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,484
You never told me your grandmother
worked at Marcus Books.

216
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,194
Was I supposed to?

217
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,655
I was just a lowly clerk.

218
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,950
It came up when I heard
his name was Marcus.

219
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,869
There is nothing lowly

220
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,830
about being at the center
of a cultural landmark.

221
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,083
My Auntie Winn used to
take me to author readings

222
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,502
by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou…

223
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,296
and you were there everyday.

224
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,007
I probably served
you some cookies.

225
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,217
- Did you ever meet, James Baldwin?
- I did.

226
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,304
Okay. She can probably
use some rest.

227
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,306
Yes, absolutely.

228
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,729
If you need anything at all, Ms.
Evelyn, you know where to find me.

229
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,482
- Thank you, Marcus.
- Yes, ma'am.

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,903
Marcus Books. Wow!

231
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,822
That was weird.

232
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:05,785
Not as weird as you refusing
to do his mentorship program?

233
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,999
Let's talk about you…

234
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,169
and your heart.

235
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:19,382
Your pericardium has become hardened,
likely from your cancer treatments.

236
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,053
So what happens now?

237
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,181
Dr. Lim has decided
on a partial removal.

238
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,642
And you think that's best?

239
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,192
Jordan Jacqueline Allen, you
look at me and you tell me,

240
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,903
if you think it's best.

241
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,165
Wow, it took you guys
a while to get home?

242
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,128
We went out to dinner.
Because Lea thought that...

243
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,090
Why are you on the floor?
What's with the high chairs?

244
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,300
I stopped at Costco
on the way home.

245
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,637
Surprisingly diverse
selection of wines.

246
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,973
There's an open bottle
if you guys want...

247
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,016
Although that might be empty.

248
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,102
Danger!

249
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,063
I remember wine. Are you drunk?

250
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,107
No. Maybe a little.

251
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,317
I'm baby-proofing. Danger!

252
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,819
Are you okay?

253
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,613
Oh, you guys got to get down
here and check this out.

254
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,284
From the baby's perspective, this
place is a fricking death trap…

255
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,578
for Nicholas. Place holder name.

256
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,246
We can call him Nick, Nicky.

257
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,539
I like Nicky.

258
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,915
Why did you buy
three high chairs?

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,420
One's a gift for you, and the
other two I'll take back. Danger!

260
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,921
That could be dangerous.

261
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,048
You don't have to
buy us anything.

262
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,758
I also got you a nanny cam.

263
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,848
It's... It's...
It's a teddy bear,

264
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,517
but you wouldn't believe
there is a camera inside.

265
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,354
That is very
practical… and cute.

266
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:01,651
Okay. We will not need a highchair
or baby proofing for a year.

267
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,529
And we'll not name our son
Nick, Nicholas or Nicky,

268
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,448
or any variation thereof.

269
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,366
Okay.

270
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,911
That's fair enough but
you're going to want this,

271
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,373
it's a book by
Dr. Spock on parenting.

272
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,792
Everyone read this
book back in the day,

273
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,003
he was so popular,
he ran for president.

274
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,087
Danger.

275
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,714
I'm going to bed.

276
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,135
Yeah, but... You're going
to want to read this

277
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,512
before the baby comes
and you get exhausted.

278
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,597
Already there.

279
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,564
Danger!

280
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,569
What were you thinking?

281
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,530
My grandmother deserved
the good muffins?

282
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,824
She'll only agree to
complete decortication,

283
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,618
which she shouldn't know about.

284
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,204
You do not present a
patient with an option

285
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,790
that I've deemed unsafe
and wouldn't even perform.

286
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,458
- It's unacceptable.
- You're right.

287
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,711
I felt like your plan was
a little conservative...

288
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,129
You are a resident,

289
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,300
your feelings about my
decisions are not relevant.

290
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,388
- I'll tell her I was wrong.
- And convince her I'm right.

291
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,056
Or find her another hospital.

292
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,018
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,523
Your muffins are ready.

294
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,246
How's he handling the chemo?

295
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,331
You doing okay, bud?

296
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,254
Nathan, can you answer Doctor
Park, please? Is everything okay?

297
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,713
No.

298
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,387
You're right. It's not okay.

299
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,931
Okay, those aren't toys.

300
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,851
We okay, mom?

301
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,812
He's got dozens of new
toys for his birthday…

302
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,690
he shouldn't have to be building
castles with pill bottles.

303
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,525
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,113
You shouldn't be trying
to do all of this alone.

305
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,617
My husband is saving lives. I
can't pull him away from that.

306
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,869
I can.

307
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,664
Give me your phone.

308
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,636
Hi Rick, Doctor Park.

309
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,435
You okay?

310
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,354
Yeah. I'm fine.

311
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,568
But you are not.

312
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,945
What happened?

313
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,991
I was wrong to question
Dr. Lim's surgical advice.

314
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,827
She is the best.

315
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,996
I hope to be her someday.

316
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,125
And if she thinks the partial
removal of the pericardium

317
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,086
is the best course of action,
then I agree with her.

318
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,589
Okay.

319
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,176
Then that's what I'll do.

320
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:19,974
But why did you go against
her advice in the first place?

321
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,189
I felt like I
needed to do extra.

322
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,024
To be a hero.

323
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,859
Why?

324
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,030
Since I was little, you told
me I had to work twice as hard,

325
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,366
be twice as good
as everybody else.

326
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,079
After all these years,

327
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:45,583
I'm still striving to
be good enough for you.

328
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,379
Now see that's a
lot of pressure.

329
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:57,512
But it's what the world requires from
people that look like you and me.

330
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,394
When is my daddy coming?

331
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,564
Your daddy is getting on a
plane, he's gonna be back soon.

332
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,650
But now, we have to see if
the medicine is working, okay?

333
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,945
If it is, can I stop taking it?

334
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,615
I'm so sorry. You still need it.

335
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,077
I hate it.

336
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,747
I know.

337
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,421
Let's play a game, like
hide and seek, okay?

338
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,923
Here, lie down.

339
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,594
You get to go in the tunnel.

340
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,598
And stay very still so
nobody can find you…

341
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,018
I'll come back and get you when
the coast is clear. Sound good?

342
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,612
You are very good with him.

343
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,822
Starting the imaging.

344
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:58,948
Thanks.

345
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,245
Nathan, you're about to hear some
banging. It's just the machine

346
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,748
but remember to stay
really still, okay?

347
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:07,957
I am.

348
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,545
Try a little harder, okay, bud?

349
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,344
Motion artifact, we
might have to sedate him.

350
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,304
Those are not artifacts.

351
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,352
He does not have CNS Vasculitis,
he has Moyamoya disease.

352
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,315
What the heck is that?

353
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,526
A narrow carotid artery is
reducing blood flow to his brain.

354
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,113
This area here, looks
like a puff of smoke?

355
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,866
That's what moyamoya
means in Japanese,

356
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,661
A bunch of new, tiny
vessels have developed

357
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,454
to circumvent the blockage,

358
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:50,750
but because the vessels are
abnormal, they're prone to bleeds.

359
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,713
We can fix the problem with a
very interesting brain surgery.

360
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,801
So now that you're done poisoning our
son with chemo that he didn't need,

361
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,428
we should trust you to
crack open his skull?

362
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:05,890
We will use a small
craniotomy to access...

363
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,976
I get why you're frustrated.

364
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,438
Moyamoya is rare and
notoriously hard to diagnose.

365
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,733
Many kids get chemo they
don't need for a lot longer.

366
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,405
We're hoping to do Nathan's
first brain surgery tomorrow.

367
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,617
He needs more than one?

368
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,619
What's brain surgery?

369
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:29,913
Hey.

370
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,752
It's how we're going
to make you all better.

371
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,212
No more chemo?

372
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,547
No more chemo.

373
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,215
Are you going to be here?

374
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,801
My plane got cancelled, buddy,

375
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:46,222
but look, I promise I'm going to
be there as soon as I can, okay?

376
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,350
Can Patches get
brain surgery, too?

377
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:55,606
No. Patches is a stuffed animal,
it does not have a brain.

378
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,828
I just peed in our bathtub.

379
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,458
Glassman has to go.

380
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,556
- Hey!
- Sorry!

381
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,594
First years.

382
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,019
You are late again.

383
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,480
C'mon. Like one minute.

384
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,648
Last time…

385
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,484
Your drug test from
yesterday was negative,

386
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:07,613
you are not using. So what
is causing your tardiness?

387
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,242
Look, I'm sorry.

388
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,452
I've been doing really well.

389
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,164
And the reason I'm doing so well

390
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:17,832
is my daily meeting.

391
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,879
Sets my mind right. It's kinda
far. And there's morning traffic.

392
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,092
Support is very important.

393
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,555
And so is punctuality.

394
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:36,809
I'm going to map a complex
double-barrel vascular bypass.

395
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,946
- Dang it.
- That's the 6th time you've killed her.

396
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,824
It wasn't working with the
rongeur, need little more power.

397
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,243
- And the right torque.
- That's reassuring.

398
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,538
Stop hovering and
go visit, visitor.

399
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,250
Convincing Evelyn
Allen to do a surgery,

400
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,253
after convincing her not
to, was a little bumpy.

401
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,173
Details, please.

402
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,800
I took the
opportunity to explain

403
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,969
how much pressure
she's put on me,

404
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,473
and she took that opportunity to
make me feel inadequate once again.

405
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,393
I've never thought of you as
someone who lacks for confidence.

406
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,938
Fake it till you make it.

407
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,442
You're a resident in one of
the top surgical programs.

408
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,902
You've already made it.

409
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,156
All I see is the ground
I've still got to cover.

410
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,916
How's it going?

411
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,252
Not ready for primetime.

412
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,557
This S.T.A. anatomy is ideal as a
donor vessel to bypass the blockage.

413
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,602
So we'll reroute the scalp
vessel into the brain here.

414
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,732
Gonna give you a little
tip. Next time a child asks

415
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,943
if you could do surgery
on his stuffed animal

416
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,821
so that he feels
less scared? Say yes.

417
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,907
I was only telling
him the truth.

418
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:21,914
This branch of the middle cerebral
artery looks like an ideal recipient.

419
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,875
You're about to be a father.
Children are illogical.

420
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,546
We can place temporary
clips for vascular control,

421
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,300
and then anastomose the STA to
the MCA using 10-0 prolenes.

422
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,305
I was very logical as a child.

423
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:41,517
I did not like being
talked to like I was dumb

424
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,353
and I definitely did
not like being lied to.

425
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,522
That child there felt
that if his Dalmatian

426
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,607
went through this
scary thing with him,

427
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,067
he would be less scared.

428
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,240
If you can embrace another
person's thought process,

429
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,242
it can strengthen
the relationship.

430
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:05,166
Lea thinks she should not
have to pee in the tub,

431
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,126
which I understand.

432
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,430
No kidnapping my grandmother.

433
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:25,811
I asked him to do a lap around the
floor, I needed a change of scenery.

434
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,439
Well, you had your lap,
now back to your cell.

435
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,566
Thanks for the tour, Speedy.

436
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,693
Speedy?

437
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,821
I was sprinting through
here this morning.

438
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,698
I was late.

439
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,991
Second time this week.

440
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:42,620
Snooze buttons are
the devil's plaything.

441
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,123
I was actually at a Narcotics
Anonymous meeting this morning.

442
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,500
I go every day.

443
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,920
"Confess your sins to each
other and pray for each other

444
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,047
so that you may be healed."

445
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,591
James 5:15-16.

446
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,301
Amen to that.

447
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,220
Good for you, young man.

448
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,353
- There's got to be a closer meeting.
- I've tried the closer one…

449
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,979
The hardliners who run it think

450
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,274
that wearing a suit and tie
is key to staying sober.

451
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,945
Start your own meeting,
here at the hospital.

452
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,950
Set your own tone, and you're
never late for work again.

453
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:25,329
No, I'm not qualified
to be a leader.

454
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,123
No such thing.

455
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,085
Leaders lead, simple as that.

456
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,553
You are annoying.

457
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,847
Well, nice to see
you too, Shaun.

458
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,849
Not to me, but to Lea,

459
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,268
and I want to keep our
relationship strong.

460
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,438
She feels your presence has
taken over our apartment

461
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,064
and she wants her space back.

462
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,483
I overstepped with
the babyproofing.

463
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,528
- And suggesting names.
- And the Dr. Spock thing.

464
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,238
And there's more, the nanny cam.

465
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,739
Okay, okay. Okay.

466
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:09,832
It's was fun, thinking about
your baby, and the future.

467
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,502
Maybe it has been
a nice distraction.

468
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,005
Yes, it was.

469
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,466
Which you've needed since
your house burned down

470
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,302
and you have no place to live.

471
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,970
Yes, thank you, Shaun.

472
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:28,809
Dr. Glassman, you are
not exactly my family.

473
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,603
I get it. I know, Shaun.

474
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,314
But I consider you to be
the baby's grandfather.

475
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,409
Wow.

476
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,330
Thank you.

477
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,875
I never thought that
would happen for me.

478
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,712
Thank you.

479
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,765
You can stay. I will tell Lea
and she will change her mind.

480
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,017
No, no, no. I'm going to go.

481
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,727
Where?

482
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,731
I don't know.

483
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,985
Can I get you a magazine?

484
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,737
No, thank you.

485
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,074
Are your pillows
positioned okay?

486
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,535
Okay, you're doing it again.

487
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,370
What?

488
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,664
The thing you've doing
since you were little…

489
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,332
just fussing over people…

490
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,795
when it's you that's in need.

491
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,091
Okay, c'mon. Tell me.

492
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,972
You just met Dr. Perez,

493
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,225
and you were so
nice and supportive.

494
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,730
Do you know how long I've
waited for you to say

495
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:00,943
"Good job" to me. Or
"Wow, you're a doctor."

496
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,865
Do you know who
Rebecca Crumpler is?

497
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,577
No.

498
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,913
She was the first
black female doctor.

499
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:17,543
And when I read about her, I
wanted to be just like her.

500
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,547
But unfortunately, I didn't
know who she was either

501
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,301
until you were in med school.

502
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:34,018
Quinque… I've been
impressed by you

503
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,355
since you were in kindergarten.

504
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,067
Grandma.

505
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,528
Grandma.

506
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,325
- What's going on?
- She's having trouble breathing.

507
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,577
She's hypotensive.

508
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,875
Jugular vein distension is
increased, her heart is failing.

509
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,919
Tell me you got
through a practice run.

510
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:04,548
We were postponing the surgery
so we could practice more.

511
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,602
What are you hanging?

512
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,438
It's a…

513
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,816
You can read obviously.

514
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:27,446
Is this okay? I'm sorry, I should
have cleared it with you first.

515
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,739
Yes, you should have.

516
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,577
Because I'd have told you to use
the small conference room up on six.

517
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,038
It's quieter up there,
and the room has blinds,

518
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,624
to help with the
"anonymous" part.

519
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,918
Thanks.

520
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,681
This is Park.

521
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,518
I had to fly to San Francisco,
I'm just grabbing a cab now.

522
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,521
Can you hold the surgery
until I get there?

523
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,440
We can't. If he
hemorrhages again…

524
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,818
Or, can you put
him on the phone?

525
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,611
He's already sedated.

526
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,823
But what if this
was my last chance

527
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,074
to talk to him?

528
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,162
I'll treat Nathan
like my own son.

529
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,872
I promise.

530
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,626
Thank you.

531
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,217
Try to puncture the pericardium

532
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,928
and grab an edge so we can
start to peel the shell.

533
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,097
Apply more pressure.

534
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,892
We may need another
tool to pierce it.

535
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,144
Let's try the rongeur.

536
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,859
Perforation of the myocardium.

537
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,778
Manually tamponading the
hole. Pledgeted sutures.

538
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,824
The pericardium's
just too calcified.

539
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,534
It's adhering to the myocardium.

540
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,952
So what do we do?

541
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,788
Repair the perforation, after
that, I'm open to ideas.

542
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,124
We could put her on bypass.

543
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,462
Gently peel off the calcified
pericardium bit by bit,

544
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:09,965
- and repair damage as we go.
- Poking holes in a bucket

545
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,885
and hoping we can plug them
before the water leaks out.

546
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,261
I have an idea.

547
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,514
- Go ahead.
- It's called the Waffle procedure.

548
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,058
I found a novel study, it said

549
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,021
dense calcified plaques can be scored
into multiple cross hatched sections.

550
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,481
No removal at all?

551
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,440
Exactly. The shell
stays in place,

552
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,694
but the heart has room to
expand and contract as it beats.

553
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,071
Mortality rate?

554
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,489
Under 8%

555
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:39,745
Talk me through it.

556
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,580
Okay. Ultrasonic scalpel.

557
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,293
Start by incising the
calcified pericardium.

558
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,467
ICG angio looks great.

559
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,762
Doctor Perez, you may
do the dural closure,

560
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,514
then replace the skull flap.

561
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,102
Before we close…

562
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,608
We're ahead of schedule. Why
not go ahead with the bypass

563
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,694
- in his other hemisphere?
- That is not the plan.

564
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,864
Simultaneous bi-lateral surgery
risks altering brain flow,

565
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,407
it could cause another bleed.

566
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,993
But maybe there's a way
to reduce that risk.

567
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,790
The wait will be hell on the parents, the
whole time knowing their son's brain...

568
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,084
The parents' stress is
not medically relevant.

569
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,752
I know, Shaun, but please…

570
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,422
Can you think of any other way?

571
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,071
An encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis
of the left side

572
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,698
would be relatively low risk.

573
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,825
We could safely do that now.

574
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,910
Thank you.

575
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,918
Rick, Linda!

576
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,674
The surgery went well.

577
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:43,952
There she is, right on schedule.

578
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,662
How do you feel?

579
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,666
Like I can breathe.

580
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,085
For the first time
in a long time.

581
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,755
Thank Dr. Lim for me.

582
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,258
I will.

583
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,013
Somebody's all puffed up.

584
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,225
You did something…

585
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,439
The surgical team
got a little stuck.

586
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,108
I just gave them a new idea.

587
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,320
Good job.

588
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,575
Wow, you're a doctor.

589
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:27,496
Wow, okay. You're laying
on a little too thick now.

590
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,298
Looking good. How
are you feeling?

591
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,884
Okay.

592
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,929
Can you give me a high five?

593
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,516
High ten?

594
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,394
Good job.

595
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,645
Good boy buddy.

596
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,773
Where is Patches?

597
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,359
He is right here.

598
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,285
You did do the brain
surgery on him.

599
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,915
No. I just put bandages on his
head to make you feel better.

600
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,459
I do.

601
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,940
I'm sorry, there's a meeting.

602
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,443
I know. N.A. right?

603
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,696
Yeah.

604
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,742
Took me a few minutes to
get the courage to come in.

605
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,374
It's just us. Sorry.

606
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,878
Where two or more are gathered…

607
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,343
Have a seat, please.

608
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:23,153
Hi. I'm Danny. And…

609
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,364
I'm an addict.

610
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,877
Almost show time.

611
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,588
Don't say it like that,
you make me nervous.

612
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,049
Be yourself. That's
more than enough.

613
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,347
Hi, everybody.

614
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,934
There's so many of you.

615
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,645
That's so good to see.

616
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,981
I'm Doctor Jordan Allen,

617
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:04,111
and I'm a third year surgical
resident at St. Bonaventure Hospital.

618
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,743
Where's Glassy?

619
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,247
He will not be staying
with us anymore.

620
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,208
- He moved out?
- Yes.

621
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,336
We had a talk and
decided it was best.

622
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,588
Did you tell him I was
complaining about him?

623
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:24,714
Yes.

624
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,384
Shaun, now I feel horrible.

625
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,887
You don't need to.

626
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,473
He found a vacant apartment
just down the hall.

627
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,017
In this building?

628
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,854
- Yes.
- He's our next-door neighbor?

629
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,273
Our next-door neighbor's
next-door neighbor.
