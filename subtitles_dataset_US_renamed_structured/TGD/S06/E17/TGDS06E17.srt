00:00:02,693 --> 00:00:04,627
I made you blueberry pancakes.

Would you prefer cauliflower?

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,792
Nope. Shaun, that's our baby.

4
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:11,401
I'm 36 weeks.

5
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,844
The baby is the size of
a head of cauliflower.

6
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:17,734
Our baby will not be this bumpy.

7
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:24,666
I am very... happy.

8
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,251
Me, too.

9
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:29,128
We're having a baby,
I have an amazing job,

00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,380
you're an attending.

11
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:32,215
We have a new family car.

12
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:34,217
Dr. Glassman has
moved down the hall.

13
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:37,220
Jared is coming back to
work at the hospital.

14
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:39,806
It is great that he's back.

15
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:44,185
But, you know, the dynamic
might be a little different.

16
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,437
Research has shown that
when working with friends,

17
00:00:46,438 --> 00:00:49,858
you get more done in less
time and have fun on the job.

18
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,235
But Jared will be working
<i>for</i> you, not with you.

19
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:55,029
It can be different when
you have to manage a friend.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,575
Lines can get blurred,
and that can be hard.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,827
The lines are not blurred.

22
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,620

or are you getting a
whole-new place together?

28
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,259
Yeah, no. He did not
ask me to move in.

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,510
Then what did he want
to talk to you about?

30
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,638
I... I don't want
to talk about it.

31
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,973
Okay, now I want
to know even more,

will continue until...

You going to the club or work?

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,443
Yeah, these early calls are
gonna take some getting used to.

35
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:35,695
Hmm. A little Kendrick's
the perfect pick-me-up.

36
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,530
Never mad at Kendrick.

37
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,282
Yes. Nice shirt.

Yeah, my good luck charm.

Figured it couldn't hurt
on my first day back.

41
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:48,207
For $700, it should
give you more than luck.

42
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,878

Now, Mr. Grumpy, what's
going on with you?

Goodbye.

48

Dr. Kalu is not your
peer, not your friend.

49
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,105
He is your employee
and you are his boss.

50

I am confident that
Jared will do a good job.

51

That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

He is not "Jared."
He is "Dr. Kalu."

53

I do not always call people
by their professional titles.

54
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,990
Sometimes I call
Dr. Allen... Dr. Murphy.

55
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:24,118
An informal communication
style with Dr. Kalu can create

56
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,287
a perception of special
treatment and favoritism.

57
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:29,374
I do not plan to give
Jared special treatment.

58
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:33,336
That doesn't mean Dr. Kalu
isn't expecting it.

59
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:37,257
And if I see it, it won't
be good for either of you.

60
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,681
She has bruising and pain even
with passive range of motion.

61
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:46,349
Some bullies at
school chased her.

62
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,892
She fell down the stairs
trying to get away.

63
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,227
That's not even how it happened.

64
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:51,145
I knew we should have
stuck with homeschooling.

65
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:53,398
She insisted, and look
what happened.

66
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,566
You need to be still.

67
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,151
Your shoulder is fractured.

the fight at school.

74
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,671
You never let me
speak for myself.

75
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,090
It wasn't a fight.

76
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,260
Some kids thought it would be
funny to point and stare at me,

77
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,846
and I thought it would be
funny to egg their lockers.

78
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:27,890
Then my stupid tics
messed up my getaway.

79
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,267
There's significant
tissue swelling

80
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,437
and massive hematoma at
the proximal humerus.

81
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,065
The fracture has caused an
acute compartment syndrome.

82

electrophysiology study.

breadth of experience,

You know, while I was away,

121
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,675
I learned how to read
emotional energy.

No brown retractor.

that she was taking
Carter to the hospital,

156
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,150
she would trust her more.

165
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,517
L-transposition of
the great arteries.

166
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:42,603
The ventricles are...

167
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:43,522
inverted.

168
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:47,400
His heart is... backward.

169
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,202
Your surgery went well.

170
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,870
We were able to
decompress and release

171

your compartment syndrome

172
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:02,999

humerus fracture.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,834
Great. When can I
go back to school?

174
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:05,960
You'll only be out a few days.

175
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,795
Just be sure to wear your sling.

176
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:10,631
You're not going back to school.

177
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,174
Why not? It's not safe.

178
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:14,051
I'm not sending you back

179
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,762
I'm not a baby. I can
take care of myself.

180
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,306
I just need to take your vitals.

181
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:19,515
If you could take
care of yourself,

182
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,100
we wouldn't have ended
up in the hospital.

183
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,560
Going to school is
literally the only thing

184
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,395
that I do that is normal.

185
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:25,563
I don't want to be...

186
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,526
I don't want to be
stuck at home with you.

187
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,611
You never let me do
anything by mys...

188
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,655
Yara?

189
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:36,198
She's having a seizure.

190
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:39,368
We need 2 milligrams of
lorazepam and MRI, stat!

191
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,716
She's sleeping like a baby.

192
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:01,265
You should've used
propofol instead of Versed

193
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,725
to sedate her.

194
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,060
Versed is old school.

195
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:06,063
Same effects, none
of the overshooting.

196
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:10,191
Why are you changing
my settings?

197
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,776
Peds case.

198
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:13,778
Shorter duration
imaging sequences

199
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,113
cuts the time in half.

200
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,783
It's your first day, remember?

201
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:20,618
You could probably
use a refresher

202
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,703
before trying a shortcut.

203
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:24,163
I'm a little out of practice,

204
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,924
but I've still got a
few tricks up my sleeve.

205
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,669
Says the guy who has
to repeat a year.

206
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,295
Ow. Mm-hmm.

207
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:36,258
Shaun will appreciate getting
Yara's results back faster.

208
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,469
Trust me.

209
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,764
You know him better than me.

210
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:49,355
Was the patient properly sedated
before you began this MRI?

211
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,982
Yeah, of course. I used the standard
pediatric protocol with Versed.

212
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,777
Did Dr. Allen tell
you about our revised

213
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:57,321
Propofol protocol?

214
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:00,157
Yeah. But in my experience,
Versed provides better...

215
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,451
You should have
listened to Dr. Allen.

216
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,286
I know how to perform
an MRI, Shaun.

217
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,456
You apparently do not.

218
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,291
There is too much
motion degradation.

219
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,419
These images are unusable.

220
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,004
Dr. Allen, please
go redo the MRI.

221
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:16,340
Dr. Kalu, we need
to speak privately.

222
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,189
You cannot take shortcuts.

223
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:36,026
You're right. I'm sorry.

224
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:39,113
You cannot expect
special treatment

225
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,615
because you are my friend.

226
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,536
I'm not expecting
special treatment, Shaun.

227
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:49,248
But I don't appreciate being
treated like an intern, either.

228
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,624
I know, technically,
I'm a first year,

229
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,626
but I've been a doctor
for as long as you have.

230
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,044
We are not peers.

231
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,881
I am your boss, and you
have a lot to learn.

232
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,591
Dr. Andrews said he is
judging my performance

233
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:59,717
off of your performance,

234
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:01,887
and your performance
is not good.

235
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:05,765
Okay?

236
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:09,143
Okay.

237
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,394
Good.

238
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:12,188
You need to go
practice basic skills

239
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:14,774
and observe our current
standardized MRI process.

240
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:27,286
Heart block plus
inverted cardiac anatomy.

241
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,621
What's your plan?

242
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,080
Intravenous pacemaker is out,

243
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,333
but we could open him
up, place it surgically.

244
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,376
That doesn't address
the underlying anatomy issue.

245
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,629
The defect could lead to heart
failure as he gets older.

246
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,340
It could, but he might be
fine with just the pacemaker.

247
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:42,968
But if he's already developed
arrhythmia, not a great sign.

248
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,845
I'd recommend the double
switch reconstruction,

249
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,889
redirect blood flow to
the right ventricle.

250
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,974
I have Carter's BMP
and cardiac labs.

251
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,535
Yeah, I already
received them digitally.

252
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,273
But the hard copies
are always appreciated.

253
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,027
Trouble in paradise?
Everything's fine.

254
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:01,862
They've been in this passive-
aggressive fight all day.

255
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,030
We're not fighting.

256
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:04,950
No, that would require
you talking to me.

257
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,205
You don't have to share, but
you do have two divorcees

258
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:14,250
with a sadly ample amount
of experience between us.

259
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,502
Was one of you secretly
in contact with an ex?

260
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,903
Took a job out of state without
including you in the process?

261
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,594
Jerome lied to me, about
something very important.

262
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,721
I didn't lie. A lie of
omission is still a lie.

263
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,098
It's not that simple.
You should have told me.

264
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,516
I wanted to. Yes,
but you didn't.

265
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,477
Because I was afraid
of how you'd react.

266
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,147
But you're right.

267
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,148
It should never
have been a secret,

268
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:40,276
because there's nothing to hide.

269
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,862
I'm HIV positive.

270
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,530
Thanks to my meds, my viral load

271
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,575
has been undetectable for years.

272
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:51,161
I'm poz undetectable.

273
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,080
I can't transmit the virus.

274
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,546
You should go talk to him.

275
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:05,760
I have work to do.

276
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,680
Present the double switch
surgery to the family.

277
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:11,140
If they agree, I'll scrub in.

278
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:12,224
On it.

279
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,690
No. How did we get
from a pacemaker

280
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,442
to reconstructing his heart?

281
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,944
The procedure may sound drastic,
but it will greatly reduce

282
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,654
his risk of developing
heart failure.

283
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,907
Can't we just give
him the pacemaker now,

284
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,075
and do the bigger surgery
if the problem gets worse?

285
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,119
At the point he starts showing
signs of heart failure,

286
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,497
it'll be too late to
do the reconstruction.

287
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:36,749
We should fix it now.

288
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,750
This isn't your decision.

289
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,087
You are still making me
pay for mistakes I made

290
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,380
when I was 17.

291
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:46,216
And 18, 19, 20...

292
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:48,427
I've been back for two years.

293
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,388
How can I be a mother when you
won't even give me a chance?

294
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:52,307
Mama?

295
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:53,390
Mama E?

296
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:54,893
I don't feel good.

297
00:13:58,563 --> 00:13:59,897
It's okay, baby. I'm here.

298
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:01,273
Honey, what's wrong?

299
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,650
My chest hurts.

300
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,360
The heart rate's 40 BPM.

301
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,320
BP 73/45.

302
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:09,156
We need a decision soon before
his condition deteriorates.

303
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,292
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

304
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,293
It was unprofessional.

305
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,842
You have nothing
to apologize for,

306
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:30,928
and no duty to disclose.

307
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:33,430
Undetectable equals
untransmittable.

308
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,767
I appreciate
you saying that.

309
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,396
Give Asher some time.

310
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:42,523
He's a doctor.

311
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:47,194
He knows there was
never any risk to him.

312
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,613
What people know and
how it makes them feel

313
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,574
are often two very
different things.

314
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:57,246
You've had years to
process your status.

315
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:58,623
Allow Asher to process it, too.

316
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,797
Please do not say,
"I told you so."

317
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:07,965
I won't.

318
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:10,843
But I'm gonna think it.

319
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,804
You seem a little spoiled.

320
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,807
You don't know me.

321
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,893
You come from money,

322
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:22,980
and you haven't had to
work hard for <i>anything.</i>

323
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:25,023
You made it through med
school. Bravo to that.

324
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,567
You got kicked out
of this program,

325
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:30,112
but landed on your feet
taking care of a billionaire.

326
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:31,363
And when you got tired of that,

327
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,741
you were welcomed back
here with open arms.

328
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:38,078
You come in with your fancy car
and your old tricks, and think,

329
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,499
"Ta-da, I'm a surgeon,"
but you're not... yet.

330
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,209
You're the new kid.

331
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,588
Shaun is the boss,
and I have seniority.

332
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,883
You should listen to Kendrick.

333
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,342
Be humble.

334
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:04,480
I just want to prove
that I belong here.

335
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:07,274
To Shaun, to everyone.

336
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:10,402
But you're right.

337
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,696
I know.

338
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,163
The image is still not
high enough resolution.

339
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:23,624
Have you finished
redoing the imaging?

340
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,334
Yes, and I followed
all the protocols,

341
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,337
but the image still
doesn't look clear.

342
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,801
The image is clear,

343
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:37,387
but Yara's diagnosis
was incorrect.

344
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,847
She does not have Tourette's.

345
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:40,641
She has a brain tumor.

346
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,612
I <i>don't</i> have Tourette's?

347
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,281
No, you have a
hypothalamic hamartoma.

348
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,491
Your tics aren't tics.

349
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:58,575
They are gelastic seizures

350
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:00,536
caused by the tumor
in your brain.

351
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:02,496
Tumor? Does that mean cancer?

352
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,706
The tumor is not cancerous.

353
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,333
But a Gamma Knife radiosurgery

354
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,752
should stop it from growing
and treat the seizures.

355
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:15,968
Will it stop <i>this?</i>

356
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,970
Not immediately.

357
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,181
And possibly not at all.

358
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:23,183
There are other options you
can consider in the future

359
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:24,643
if you don't see improvement.

360
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,984
Or we could consider them now.

361
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:35,737
A successful resection

362
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,364
could stop the
seizures immediately.

363
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,575
That procedure is very risky.

364
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:42,369
But that means I can
go back to school.

365
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,204
I could learn how to drive.
I could take care of myself.

366
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:46,582
Mommy, please.

367
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,292
I just want to be normal.

368
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:51,837
Tumor resection can cause
stroke, partial paralysis,

369
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,173
learning deficits, meningitis.

370
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,801
The Gamma Knife is much safer.

371
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,139
Yara, I'm sorry. I can't.

372
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,683
You <i>can.</i>

373
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,518
You just won't let me.

374
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,104
Please go ahead

375
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:11,481
and schedule the
Gamma Knife procedure.

376
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:27,206
Have you made a decision?

377
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,126
I'm afraid of exposing
Carter to any more trauma.

378
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,628
What trauma?

379
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:34,630
He was left by his mother.

380
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:35,839
I left him with you.

381
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,841
Expecting me to pick
up all the pieces

382
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:39,343
and fix everything, like always.

383
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:42,137
I knew he was safer
with you than with me.

384
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,389
But I didn't know that.

385
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,351
I gave you too much freedom,
wasn't involved enough,

386
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:48,602
and look what happened.

387
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,897
My mistakes were
mine, not yours.

388
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,611
I was supposed to protect you.

389
00:18:57,612 --> 00:18:59,446
And we lost you.

390
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:03,992
I have to do better for Carter.

391
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:06,245
Well, the surgery is
what's best for Carter,

392
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,913
long-term.

393
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,917
That kid is my heart.

394
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,216
I'm gonna trust you to fix his.

395
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,226
Lunchtime!

396
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:32,312
I'm starved. I am not hungry.

397
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,982
Well, it's not good to deprive
your pregnant wife her lunch.

398
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,317
I thought it would be fun
working with a friend.

399
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:40,112
It is not fun.
It is difficult.

400
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,364
I do not want people to think

401
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,283
I am giving Dr. Kalu
special treatment,

402
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,951
because I am not giving
him special treatment.

403
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,995
In fact, I am being very firm

404
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:49,413
because he has already
made several errors,

405
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:51,164
and I do not understand why.

406
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:55,669
Well, he's a new resident
on his first day.

407
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,963
There has to be a bit
of a learning curve.

408
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:01,091
Mm, he is not acting
like a new resident.

409
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:02,801
Well, he's your friend.

410
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,762
And he knows you
expect a lot of him.

411
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,889
No one can follow the rules

412
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,559
if they don't know
what they are.

413
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:24,948
Atrial septum excised.

414
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:27,242
Starting venous reconstruction.

415
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,036
There may not be enough
tissue for redirection of flow

416
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,495
to the tricuspid valve.

417
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,539
We can use pericardium
to create a baffle.

418
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Metz.

419
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:37,669
You make up with Jerome yet?

420
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,797
He betrayed <i>my</i> trust.

421
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:46,053
Alright, securing
edge to atrial septum.

422
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:48,221
You've never hidden
anything from him?

423
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:50,140
I'd never hide
something like this.

424
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:53,143
Congratulations. You
win the virtue contest.

425
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:56,813
Possible prizes include the
end of your relationship.

426
00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:58,607
Or you could just talk it out.

427
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,276
Dividing the aorta.

428
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,029
<i>He</i> is the one who
changed things.

429
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,989
I mean, why is it
on me to figure out?

430
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,367
The question is, do
you love Jerome enough

431
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:09,826
to change with him?

432
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:12,079
Suturing distal aorta
to pulmonary valve.

433
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,247
Coronary arteries are patent.

434
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:15,582
Anastomosis looks great.

435
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,797
I never met a teenager
who wanted to go to school

436
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:23,048
as much as you.

437
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,845
I hate school.

438
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,013
But I hate not being
able to control

439
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:32,182
anything in my life even more.

440
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,101
Egging those lockers
made you feel in control?

441
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:36,645
Kinda. Hmm.

442
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:38,313
Those bullies messed with
me, I messed with them back.

443
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,607
Like normal kids do.

444
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:49,366
I was bullied a lot
in high school, too.

445
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,701
I was scrawny with
braces, a lisp...

446
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:53,954
Basically a target on my back.

447
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:55,997
But my mom helped me.

448
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,290
Gave me her credit
card to buy them off

449
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,501
with pizza and candy.

450
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:02,421
My mom is too helpful.

451
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,256
She won't even let
me make my own PB&J.

452
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,596
She thinks I'll tic out and
hurt myself with the knife.

453
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,975
When my body isn't
controlling me, she is.

454
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,811
When you said you can cut
this tumor out of my head,

455
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:20,689
for 30 seconds...

456
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,276
I could imagine only laughing
when something was funny.

457
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:42,752
Think I found a solution.

458
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:47,007
Oh. I have found a
solution, as well.

459
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:49,468
I have made a list of
boundaries and rules

460
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,052
to make our working
relationship better.

461
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,138
You need to study them.

462
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:56,183
What have you found
a solution for?

463
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:58,560
I think I found a better
resection technique.

464
00:22:58,561 --> 00:22:59,853
Has a lower risk profile,

465
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:01,646
closer to that of the
Gamma Knife radiation.

466
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,107
And it offers a better
outcome for Yara.

467
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:07,402
I presented the safest
option to the patient,

468
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,029
which she agreed to.

469
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,865
And you should not have
presented the tumor resection

470
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,408
without consulting me.

471
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,285
That is an important boundary.

472
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:16,662
Number two on the list.

473
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:20,540
I thought you'd be happy I
was thinking outside the box,

474
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,375
like you.

475
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,210
You are not me.

476
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,627
You are here to learn. Yes.

477
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:25,045
I'm also here to help
people like Yara.

478
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:27,339
You need to respect that
I am your attending.

479
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,466
Number six on the list. I
don't have to be an attending

480
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,092
to know that she's sad,
lonely, and depressed.

481
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,886
We cannot make medical decisions

482
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:34,304
based off of the
patient's emotions.

483
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:35,680
Well, sometimes the emotions
are just as important

484
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,806
as the medical.

485
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:39,602
You are making my job very hard!

486
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:44,314
Number 10...

487
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:49,236
At work, follow my
instructions precisely.

488
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:54,407
If you cannot comply, you
will be out of the program.

489
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:22,644
I really messed up.

490
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:23,979
I should have trusted you

491
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,939
and been upfront
about everything.

492
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,108
Yeah, you should have.

493
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:32,153
After my diagnosis, it
took a long time for me

494
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:33,655
to feel comfortable dating,

495
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:36,116
or even being around people.

496
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:38,118
I spent so much time alone,

497
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,703
and when I finally put
myself back out there,

498
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:42,247
there was a lot of rejection.

499
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,166
Guys just didn't want
to deal with my status.

500
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:52,215
So, when this adorable,
brilliant doctor

501
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:55,802
popped into my life,

502
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:59,514
and I liked him so much...

503
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,475
I was too scared to
tell him the truth.

504
00:25:03,477 --> 00:25:05,021
I'm sorry.

505
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:11,401
This doctor sounds pretty great.

506
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:13,654
He is.

507
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,493
I made sure we always
used protection,

508
00:25:20,494 --> 00:25:22,370
encouraged you to stay on PrEP.

509
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,665
All to make sure
that you were safe.

510
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:28,878
That was a decision that
you made for the both of us.

511
00:25:31,672 --> 00:25:34,466
You did all those things to
make yourself feel better

512
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,636
while you took away my choice.

513
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:42,432
How could you have
known me and loved me

514
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,184
and think that this

515
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:46,227
is something that
I-I couldn't accept?

516
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,520
When I first had to
make this decision,

517
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:49,731
I didn't love you.

518
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:52,859
I barely knew you.

519
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,320
And I'm not sure I know you now.

520
00:25:58,282 --> 00:25:59,699
I made a mistake.

521
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,493
That doesn't change who I am.

522
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:04,914
No, but maybe it
changes how I feel.

523
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,879
I'm sorry that I put
you through this,

524
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,464
but I'm still the one
living with this disease,

525
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:16,092
and it's not easy.

526
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:22,764
It's Carter.

527
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:23,765
I have to go.

528
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,901
He woke up
from the surgery,

529
00:26:34,902 --> 00:26:36,069
and he was laughing
about his comic book,

530
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,362
then he started to turn blue.

531
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,739
Oxygen saturation
at 80%. 120 BPM.

532
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Blood pressure's dropping.

533
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:42,033
Alright, administering oxygen

534
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,619
and 250cc normal saline bolus.

535
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,287
Why can't he breathe?

536
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,039
I thought the surgery was
supposed to prevent this.

537
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,249
Normal lead impedance.

538
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,710
The pacemaker is
functioning properly.

539
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:52,752
Something else is going on.

540
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,295
We need a cardiac echo, stat.

541
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,680
A kink in Carter's
reconstructed atria

542
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,932
caused the clot in his heart.

543
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:08,309
He's stable, but he
needs another operation

544
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,937
to remove the clot and
repair the conduit.

545
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:12,814
Are there other alternatives?

546
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:14,065
We could use a catheter

547
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,984
to dissolve the blockage
with medication,

548
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:17,152
but that still leaves the risk

549
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,945
of a clot forming
again down the line.

550
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:21,698
I knew doing this was
the wrong decision.

551
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:24,075
We both want what's
best for Carter.

552
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,743
But I'm the one who is
responsible for him.

553
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,830
And I'm sorry I put that on you.

554
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,000
I will never forgive
myself for losing out on

555
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:34,294
those years of Carter's life,

556
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:37,755
but I've realized that I need
to try to let go of that.

557
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:42,010
Let go of my regret and
focus on what I know...

558
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:46,431
That leaving him with you <i>was</i>
the best decision for him.

559
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,892
That will never change.

560
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:55,440
And this surgery is the
right decision for him, too.

561
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,326
You're his mother.

562
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,917
You know what's best for Carter.

563
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,758
I want my son to
have the surgery.

564
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:36,856
You were right.

565
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:38,400
I usually am.

566
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:42,695
What was I right about, exactly?

567
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:46,658
I came out of the gate too hot,

568
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,493
annoyed Shaun,

569
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,204
screwed things up for Yara.

570
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:54,082
Agree.

571
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,834
I gotta figure out my next move.

572
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,671
Listen.

573
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,970
This whole case,

574
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,806
you've been pitching
and shortcutting

575
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:13,434
and trying to be
Mr. Fix-it for everything.

576
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:17,064
Stop flexing and listen.

577
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:31,578
Mom, let me try the
tumor resection surgery.

578
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:33,956
Please. I'm sorry. No.

579
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:36,916
We're ready for you.

580
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:39,586
Alright, baby.

581
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:45,091
But first, I, um...

582
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:47,969
want you to tell your
mom what you told me,

583
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,554
about what you're dealing with.

584
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,972
What this surgery means to you.

585
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,098
I know what she's dealing with.

586
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,516
I see it every day.

587
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,277
But have you listened
to how it feels to her?

588
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:59,397
She doesn't care.

589
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,940
Of course I do.

590
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,984
You just want to boss me around.

591
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:08,573
I'm just trying to help,
but no matter what I do,

592
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,116
you're always so angry at me.

593
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:11,784
I'm angry...

594
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:17,707
I'm angry at everything.

595
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,877
I'm angry at my body for not
doing what I want it to do.

596
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,713
I'm angry at other
kids for being jerks.

597
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:26,299
And I'm angry at you...

598
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,885
for acting like the only way
for me to survive in this world

599
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:30,345
is by you protecting me.

600
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:33,264
I feel like I'm a puppet

601
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,516
and somebody else is
constantly pulling the strings,

602
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:37,393
yanking me all around.

603
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:39,354
Getting this tumor removed

604
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:41,649
is the only way for
me to cut the strings.

605
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:51,367
Okay, don't... don't...
Don't take her yet.

606
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:55,078
We need to talk.

607
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,805
I need you to scrub in

608
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:16,557
on a hypothalamic
hamartoma surgery.

609
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:18,893
Okay. I had planned to
use Gamma Knife radiation,

610
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,895
but Dr. Kalu violated
rule number two,

611
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,314
and now we have to do
his tumor resection.

612
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,649
You're upset with Jared

613
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,109
because he changed
your surgical plan?

614
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,277
He overstepped with me

615
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:30,947
and the patient and her mother.

616
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:34,033
Well, a tumor resection seems
like a pretty good idea.

617
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:36,285
Are you planning on
letting Jared scrub in?

618
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:39,247
Yes, he will be on suction.

619
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,665
That's an insult.

620
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,793
He has to learn to follow rules.

621
00:31:43,794 --> 00:31:45,920
He has made my job
very difficult.

622
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:47,464
Shaun, sit down.

623
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:53,094
When you were a resident,

624
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:56,639
you did things
completely your own way.

625
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,558
You still do.

626
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,268
You rubbed everybody
the wrong way.

627
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:03,020
You made everybody's job more
difficult, especially mine.

628
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,940
You were a pain in the ass.

629
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,859
But we gave you
the space to learn,

630
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,902
and we learned from you.

631
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:11,821
And you turned
yourself into an asset.

632
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:13,865
Give Jared the same opportunity.

633
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,491
Okay, he overstepped.

634
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:17,744
Give him a chance to learn

635
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:21,038
and to prove himself
to be an asset.

636
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,584
Even if you think he's
a pain in the ass.

637
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,838
I will take it
into consideration.

638
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,923
Okay.

639
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:34,010
Please scrub in
for that surgery.

640
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,857
Advance the catheter
and endoscope

641
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:51,402
gently into the ventricle.

642
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,362
Suction and irrigate
more aggressively

643
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:55,323
so she can see
what she is doing.

644
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,661
Proceed along the midline
posteroinferior floor

645
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:02,872
of the third ventricle.

646
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,999
Oh, there's the tumor.

647
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,334
We can begin excision.

648
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:07,335
Bipolar scissors.

649
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,093
Micro forceps.

650
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,401
I'll take the
specimen to pathology.

651
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:33,570
No.

652
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:38,492
You are going to close.

653
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,203
Are you sure?

654
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,417
This was your surgical plan.

655
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,169
You will become a better surgeon

656
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,630
by getting a fair
shot to be an asset.

657
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,257
I will take the specimen.

658
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:55,758
Dr. Glassman will supervise.

659
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:11,274
I'm hungry.

660
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:15,653
That's a very good sign.

661
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,864
I'll run down to the café
and grab him some food.

662
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:21,284
Any restrictions? He can have as
many chicken nuggets as he wants.

663
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:23,077
I'll go down.

664
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:24,620
I'll get something
for you to eat, too.

665
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:28,082
You haven't left his
side since we got here.

666
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,376
Comes with being a good mom.

667
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:33,254
I had a great teacher.

668
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,132
You know, a little birdie
told me that the gift shop

669
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:39,969
just got in the latest
volume of Wonder Woman.

670
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,054
Really? Can we get it?

671
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:44,348
If your mom is okay with it.

672
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,434
Of course.

673
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:49,395
But no twirling just yet, okay?

674
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,615
Dr. Murphy was able to
remove all of the tumor.

675
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,911
Yara?

676
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:06,538
Dr. Kalu.

677
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,123
Memory is intact.

678
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:20,134
The light didn't
provoke a seizure.

679
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:22,887
And your tics are gone.

680
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,348
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

681
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,558
Thank you, Yara.

682
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:49,456
Dr. Andrews.

683
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:53,167
I heard about your work
on the Fields case.

684
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:56,420
Good job. Thank you.

685
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,048
I just came in to
ask you for a favor.

686
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,261
Please judge me for my
work, and not Shaun.

687
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:04,762
Shaun's part of the
reason you're back here.

688
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,931
And I appreciate him for that.

689
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,058
But I want to stand on my own.

690
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:12,436
And if I sink, I don't want to
take my friend down with me.

691
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,856
I'm ready to prove myself as
an asset to this hospital.

692
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,901
I'll be watching.

693
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:20,611
Thank you.

694
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,017
I'm sorry for being such a jerk.

695
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,734
You opened yourself
up, and I shut down.

696
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:03,070
And I should've trusted you

697
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,989
that we could figure
this out together.

698
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,408
Yesterday, you said
you didn't know me.

699
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:10,037
That adorable doctor can be
kind of an ass sometimes.

700
00:37:25,302 --> 00:37:26,887
I've never been in
love before you.

701
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:38,981
When I was 16, I'm pretty
sure I ran over a raccoon,

702
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:40,608
but I didn't stop to check
because I was running late

703
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,652
to a baseball game.

704
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:47,448
Also...

705
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:48,908
I love a pumpkin spice latte.

706
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,117
Agh.

707
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:51,787
Even though I know it's basic.

708
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:56,707
You know those cufflinks I wore
to Shaun and Lea's wedding?

709
00:37:56,708 --> 00:38:00,086
Yeah.

710
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:01,379
I bought them for you,
but I liked them so much,

711
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,422
I kept them for myself.

712
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,884
That explains so much.

713
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,470
But you can totally
borrow them...

714
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:12,264
sometime, probably
not.

715
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:17,312
I love you.

716
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,191
I need you to believe that.

717
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:50,719
Just, uh, came to say goodnight.

718
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,430
And thank you.

719
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,933
Why are you thanking me?

720
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:58,686
For not going easy on me.

721
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:01,731
I was wrong to expect that,
even if we are friends.

722
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,611
You are a good doctor.

723
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,324
And I would like to
continue to be your friend

724
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:14,326
and your boss...

725
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:16,871
with boundaries.

726
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:18,247
You're right.

727
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:19,623
And I'm studying your list.

728
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,752
Oh, there is one rule
that is not on the list.

729
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,593
It is a rule for me.

730
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:39,894
I will refer to
you as "Dr. Kalu"

731
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:41,896
when I am being your boss

732
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:46,609
and as "Jared" when
we are in friend mode.

733
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,028
Yeah, that works for me, Shaun.

734
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:51,238
Good.

735
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,574
Jared, I would like to
take you out for drinks

736
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,201
to celebrate you being
back at St. Bon's,

737
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:57,077
but Dr. Kalu,

738
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:58,954
when I checked on
Yara postoperatively,

739
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:00,789
I noticed you only used
eight sutures when you closed

740
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,750
and she had a small bleed.

741
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:03,209
You should have used 10.

742
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,462
You need to go work on
your suturing technique.

743
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:09,673
Happy to... to practice,

744
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:13,052
but I only replaced
the small bone flap.

745
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:15,639
Dr. Glassman closed
the galea and skin.

746
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:21,144
Dr. Glassman
skipped two sutures?

747
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,898
I guess so.

748
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:28,984
Um, meet you for
drinks in an hour?

749
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:30,069
Okay. Okay.
