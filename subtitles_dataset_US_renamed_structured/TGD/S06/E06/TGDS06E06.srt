1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,182
- A
- brutal heat wave...

2
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:04,002
Barely 7:00, and
it's already...

3
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:05,487
breaking all records. The
extreme temperatures...

4
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:06,681
What are you wearing?

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:10,988
A rechargeable cooling vest.

6
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:14,181
Kevin says it's going
to be 109 degrees today,

7
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,649
and this will maintain
my core temperature

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,109
for up to eight hours.

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,925
I also have a neck fan,

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,949
personal hydration pack, and...

11
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:27,987
cooling hoodie.

12
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:31,705
You, uh, really went for it.

13
00:00:31,843 --> 00:00:34,094
It's an investment
in our future.

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,704
We will need these
many, many more times.

15
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:37,605
Mm.

16
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:39,227
To keep all pets indoors,

17
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:41,086
and make sure they
have plenty of water.

18
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,909
If you need to...

19
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,553
you can borrow my hoodie.

20
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:46,806
Stay hydrated,

21
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,875
especially if you're elderly
or have special needs.

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,154
During this high heat advisory,
please, please stay inside.

23
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,969
Out of the frying
pan, into the fire.

24
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,743
Seriously.

25
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,569
Is the A/C even on?

26
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:09,386
It's working fine
at the V. A. gym.

27
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,496
My wheelchair basketball
team's taking refuge over there

28
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,729
later today.

29
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:15,173
We could use a shooting guard.

30
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:18,867
Not sure I'm quite ready to
drain threes in this thing.

31
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,310
An iced cap, though.

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,260
You're with me
today, Dr. Powell.

33
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:27,804
Sweet.

34
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:29,472
Do I get matching gear?

35
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:32,141
Like a Team Murphy uniform?

36
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:33,560
No.

37
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,816
Spinal cord injuries disrupt
autonomic homeostasis,

38
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:42,652
so patients are more
susceptible to the heat.

39
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:45,446
If she'd had the
surgery I proposed,

40
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:49,075
Dr. Lim would be better able
to regulate that temperature.

41
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,494
It was too early for her
to make that decision. No.

42
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:55,374
The longer she waits, the higher
her risk of irreversible edema.

43
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,418
There's many
factors to consider.

44
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,838
That's why I told her
not to rush into it.

45
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,840
Excuse me.

46
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:07,510
Y-You are a first-year resident.

47
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:10,930
I have much more surgical
experience than you.

48
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,892
And I have much more physical
disability experience than you.

49
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,106
It's the E. R.

50
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,322
Blackout hit
a senior residence.

51
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:31,200
Their entire population
has been evacuated to us.

52
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,870
That makes 32 new patients.

53
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,289
And one cake.

54
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,916
Blackout shmackout.

55
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:42,253
We gotta celebrate Art's 100th.

56
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,716
Captions by VITAC...

57
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,766
Evaluate them all
for heat stroke.

58
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,603
Also, any pre-existing
condition could be exacerbated.

59
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:00,188
The rest are yours.

60
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:01,439
All of them non-surgical.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,610
Some will need IVs
and cooling blankets.

62
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:06,987
And wander bracelets.

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,868
You want Fred and Ginger
or Stanley Kowalski?

64
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,455
Your heart's running
fast, Mrs. Hamilton.

65
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:18,998
The heat's made
your V-tach worse.

66
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,834
My heart's kept
me going 90 years,

67
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,628
so don't be too hard on it.

68
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:25,379
And call me Edna.

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,298
90? Come on. I don't buy it.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,178
You remind me of
Jerry at the home.

71
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,807
Although you're
easier on the eyes.

72
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,479
Let's give Edna
five of metoprolol.

73
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,651
Lost her pulse. Need
a defibrillator.

74
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,205
Got her pulse back.

75
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,630
Nice work, Doc.

76
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:09,840
Other than cracking her ribs.

77
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,802
We better get a chest CT,
see how bad the damage is.

78
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,976
You're not old.

79
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:22,478
This is Brooks Mosey, 41.

80
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,356
He collapsed during his
daily 60-mile bike ride.

81
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:26,607
Yeah, the heat
caught me off-guard.

82
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,109
I'm just dehydrated.

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,902
You should watch
The Weather Channel.

84
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,446
Start an IV.

85
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,909
Oh. We need to
start an I. O. line.

86
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,703
I can't find a good vein.

87
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:41,289
That's because you didn't tap
the vein to make it dilate.

88
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,373
He's dehydrated.

89
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:43,624
He needs an I. O. line.

90
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,669
No, he needs a doctor
with more experience.

91
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,505
Please change that
patient's catheter bag.

92
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:01,517
Her core temp's
106. She's critical.

93
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,644
Axilla's packed. Two
cooling blankets.

94
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:04,521
None of it's helping.

95
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,064
BP's tanking.

96
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,566
This heat's frying her organs.

97
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,860
That's the smoke detector.

98
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,194
You leave the stove on, Marty?

99
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,615
She needs cold
nasogastric lavage.

100
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,702
I'm scared, Marty.

101
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:21,871
May, my name is Dr. Perez.

102
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:23,205
You're at a hospital.

103
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,166
We're gonna take
good care of you.

104
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,669
We've got you.

105
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,509
Ah.

106
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,846
Gracias, seÃ±orita.

107
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:41,349
Oh, it's, uh, Tango Tuesday.

108
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,810
We do all things Argentinian.

109
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,979
That explains...

110
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,608
That guy takes
three dance lessons,

111
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:52,860
and she's all over him.

112
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:53,861
Mm.

113
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,490
Fred and Ginger?

114
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,700
Every bit as adorable
as they look.

115
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,161
Like two dancing prunes.

116
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,537
A couple in their twilight years

117
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,706
displaying affection
makes you pissy?

118
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,584
It's Tinder, isn't it?

119
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,878
I saw your profile.

120
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,463
What are you doing on Tinder?

121
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:13,924
Spying on my coworkers.

122
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,511
I don't blame you
for being cranky.

123
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,720
There's nothing more depressing

124
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:21,305
than a few laps around
the dating pool.

125
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:22,765
Amor.

126
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,106
Arthur Abbott?

127
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,440
Art?

128
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,943
Okay, well, he couldn't
have gotten far. He's...

129
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:38,030
100 years old, as of today.

130
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,450
Oh, Art's one spry
son of a bitch.

131
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,961
I hear you saved my life today.

132
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,339
And fractured some ribs
in the process. Mm.

133
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,466
Which led to us doing a
CT that showed a tumor

134
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:01,138
running from your right
lung to your belly.

135
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,307
Can you remove it?

136
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,101
Yes, but at your age,

137
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:10,271
I'm not sure your body could
handle such a big surgery.

138
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,523
I'd recommend you leave it.

139
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,818
You'd have several good months.

140
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,695
Months?

141
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:19,281
Six, maybe seven.

142
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,702
You saved my life once today.

143
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:26,121
I'm sure you can do it again.

144
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,375
Edna, I'm just not
comfortable doing the surgery.

145
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:34,170
Then I want another opinion.

146
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,963
And another
butterscotch pudding.

147
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:38,007
Hmm? If it's not
too much trouble.

148
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:45,973
Hmm.

149
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,688
Dr. Powell's not your
favorite employee?

150
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,982
We are not allowed
to have favorites,

151
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:58,611
but if we were, she
would not be mine.

152
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,529
She is very
annoying.

153
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,366
I've got 68 employees,
7 of whom are annoying,

154
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,661
and of those 7, 4 are
my best employees.

155
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:11,332
They consistently challenge me
with opposing points of view.

156
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,416
Hmm.

157
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,963
I can't br-breathe.

158
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,089
Aah!

159
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,341
Code Blue!

160
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:21,967
Oh! Heart rate is 32!

161
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,093
I need a crash cart!

162
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,436
It's a structural issue
causing cardiac ischemia.

163
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,396
Then we would've heard a murmur.

164
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:36,857
What about a coronary
vasospasm? N-No.

165
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:39,193
Brooks' troponins are
only mildly elevated.

166
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,737
Hi, Lea.

167
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,074
His electrolytes were off.

168
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,617
Could've been a
vasovagal response

169
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,494
to dehydration. You're wrong.

170
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,704
And your opposing points
of view are not useful.

171
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:52,790
It is structural.

172
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,501
We came here because it's 10
degrees cooler than everywhere else.

173
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,462
Dr. Powell did not come to
work prepared for the heat.

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,674
Go set up a coronary angio.

175
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,019
It's 108 out here.

176
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,646
Why would Art
leave the hospital?

177
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:17,773
It's called dementia.

178
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:20,442
Spry or not, he couldn't
have hobbled this far.

179
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:23,529
Put a wander bracelet on him
like Andrews told you to,

180
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,072
we wouldn't be on this
hunt for the Walking Dead.

181
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:29,285
Andrews was looking
at you, not me.

182
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,206
Should we talk about what's
really bothering you?

183
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,707
You look on over there
for the old guy you lost,

184
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,125
and I'll look over here.

185
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:43,299
It's up to 77 degrees in here.

186
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,760
Anything over 82 will
compromise the servers.

187
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:51,265
What's with Mr. Grumpy?

188
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,270
I'm not Mr. Grumpy.

189
00:09:56,271 --> 00:10:00,024
Mm. You were with Powell.

190
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:03,110
I don't like her.

191
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,946
'Cause she's a bad resident?

192
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:09,575
She... makes a
lot of mistakes,

193
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,619
but no more than the others.

194
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,246
So it's her personality?

195
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,206
She's annoying.

196
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,207
How is she annoying?

197
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,208
She's...

198
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,755
contrary.

199
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:26,300
Oh. Kind of sounds
like someone we know?

200
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:29,387
Yes. But I like Morgan.

201
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,600
The first step to getting
past your issues with her

202
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,518
is identifying them.

203
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,021
And why do I need to
get past my issues?

204
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,609
And there's the blackout.

205
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,111
Oh.

206
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,530
That didn't last long.

207
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:51,075
That's just the backup
generators kicking in.

208
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:54,036
And how long they will
last, I have no idea.

209
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,333
We got your labs
and imaging back.

210
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:02,045
Heat has caused damage
to your heart and lungs.

211
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,924
It's permanent.

212
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:09,344
And, um...

213
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,933
You're dying, May.

214
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,644
Very soon.

215
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,313
A matter of hours.

216
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,111
But we'll make sure
you're not in any pain

217
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:28,822
and keep you comfortable.

218
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,867
Do you have any
family we can call?

219
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,287
No.

220
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,457
My husband passed last year.

221
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,458
Didn't he?

222
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:48,717
Is there anyone you want
to be here with you?

223
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,806
Marty was always the social one.

224
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,270
We talked about
seeing the world.

225
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:05,983
Marty and I finally
booked a-a trip

226
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:09,695
to celebrate our 60th
wedding anniversary.

227
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,405
To Paris.

228
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:15,701
But he got cancer.

229
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:22,291
He still wanted to
go, but... I said no,

230
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,668
we needed to get
him better first.

231
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,813
Hi, Edna.

232
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,608
I'm Dr. Aaron Glassman.

233
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:50,027
I understand you wanted
a second set of eyes.

234
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,529
Thank you for coming so quickly.

235
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,864
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

236
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:55,948
How you handling the heat?

237
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,620
Well, I brought you this.

238
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,831
In case you want
to use it later.

239
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,459
Any shortness of breath?

240
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,504
I've had that for ages. It
doesn't really bother me.

241
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:12,049
At the home,
everything's right there.

242
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,300
Well, that's convenient.

243
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,469
It is.

244
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,971
I do like to go
to the courtyard.

245
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:20,350
They have a beautiful
eucalyptus tree there.

246
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,521
When my granddaughter visited
from Eugene last summer,

247
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:30,651
we sat out there and just
watched the leaves rustle.

248
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:33,028
Well, that sounds just lovely.

249
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,322
It was.

250
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:36,323
May I?

251
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,453
Does it hurt when I press here?

252
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:45,290
Okay, okay. I'll
take that as a yes.

253
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,336
Any problems with memory,
forgetfulness, confusion?

254
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,713
I am 90.

255
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:58,846
But I just won all three matches
at last week's cribbage game.

256
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,597
So I guess it could be worse.

257
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:01,890
Card shark, huh?

258
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,767
Mm-hmm.

259
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:07,062
Edna, this tumor's a monster.

260
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,690
To take it out
would be very risky.

261
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:13,111
You might not survive
the procedure, or worse.

262
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:19,283
Ventilator, chronic
pain, immobilization.

263
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,368
Dr. Park went through
all of this with you?

264
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:23,288
Yes, he did.

265
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,958
I want the surgery.

266
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,837
And another
butterscotch pudding.

267
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,007
When you have a moment.

268
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,842
I'll see what I can do.

269
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:46,018
We're doing the surgery.

270
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,978
You know Edna's
heart stopped, right?

271
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,938
And restarted without
a defibrillator.

272
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,982
This is a huge surgery
for a 20-year-old.

273
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:54,443
And? Age isn't the only issue.

274
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,570
Okay, she has no idea what
she's getting herself into.

275
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:58,488
I think she does. Well,
she's blindly optimistic.

276
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,449
Or is it blind faith?
What's the difference?

277
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,159
She wants to have the surgery.

278
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,744
That faith could destroy

279
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:06,830
what little quality
of life she has left.

280
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:08,374
Her call.

281
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,128
W-We need to radically
slash power consumption.

282
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,796
Your servers are
pulling more energy

283
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:15,715
than any other department.

284
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:16,840
For good reason.

285
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:17,925
If all of our servers go down,

286
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:19,843
that'll take out
the SmartEnergy Hub.

287
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:21,261
What's a SmartEnergy Hub?

288
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,971
It directs power to areas
that need it the most

289
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,765
and reduces it to
areas that don't.

290
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:27,392
Without it, I can't guarantee
the generators won't overload.

291
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,728
Our backup system
needs a backup?

292
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,730
If we didn't have the Hub, we'd
be working in the dark already.

293
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,231
We need to act now...

294
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,900
Shut down the top two floors,
relocate the patients.

295
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,402
And compromise the medical
care of over 80 people?

296
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:41,031
I'll look after the patients,
you look after that Hub.

297
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:48,163
We need to talk about
why I don't like you.

298
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,247
Sounds fun.

299
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,625
Your hand lotion smells
strongly of almonds.

300
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,043
Injecting contrast.

301
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:54,461
You are stubborn
and intractable,

302
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,964
as demonstrated by refusing
to transplant a pig's heart,

303
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:59,508
ignoring proper procedure
for inserting an IV...

304
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,969
I didn't back you
up on Lim's surgery.

305
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,972
You were wrong about that too.

306
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:06,556
The feeling's mutual.

307
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:09,643
Very stubborn.

308
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,854
And... almonds.

309
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,108
I've seen you get distracted

310
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,276
when something irritates
your sensibilities.

311
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,362
Never seen that
make you a jackass.

312
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,868
The coronary artery
is coming off

313
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,578
the pulmonary, not the aorta.

314
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:29,997
This is very rare

315
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:32,541
and will require a very
complicated surgery.

316
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,792
He could drop dead
at any minute.

317
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,295
Yes, he could.

318
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,844
Okay. How about a
coronary artery bypass?

319
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,475
Swamp cooler.

320
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,479
Okay, Brooks' anatomy is far
too complex for a bypass.

321
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,148
We won't have all the
necessary information

322
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,317
until we open him up.

323
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,445
Why don't we do a
cardiac MRI first?

324
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:02,612
That would be useless.

325
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:05,032
His arteries are too
tortuous and dilated.

326
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:08,702
It'd make interpretation
of images impossible.

327
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:11,329
Okay, so your plan
is to have no plan?

328
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,833
My plan is to open him up,
observe, and improvise.

329
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,293
You can't improvise
the most complicated...

330
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:17,502
Stop contradicting me.

331
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,963
I have more surgical
experience than you.

332
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:22,299
Yes, and it's your
job to teach me.

333
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,801
Then why do you act like
you know as much as I do?

334
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,848
Knowing why I don't like
her isn't going to help

335
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,350
because she won't change.

336
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:35,854
You're off the case.

337
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,787
We just
lost our first server.

338
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:55,624
How about ECMO and CRRT?

339
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,043
That could bridge May to multi-organ
transplant and we could even...

340
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:02,756
Danny, she won't even
tolerate anticoagulation.

341
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:04,007
Right.

342
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:28,990
How you holding up, Chief?

343
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,202
My office is a sauna,
the Wi-Fi died,

344
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:35,038
and I just lost my
last two hours of work.

345
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,998
Well, Andrews just
put the hospital

346
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,375
and the E. R. On
full divert status,

347
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:42,212
so we both have the
next couple hours free.

348
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:44,923
The A/C at the V.
A. Is still working.

349
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,426
Oh, I have physical
therapy in 20.

350
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,804
You go to therapy to get
better when you're injured.

351
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,223
I am injured.

352
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:56,101
You were. You're not anymore.

353
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,353
Living with a
physical disability

354
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,149
is not like living
with, like, cancer.

355
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,277
You're not dying.
You're not sick.

356
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,614
I see a healthy, fully capable
woman sitting across from me.

357
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,700
At some point,

358
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,618
you need to start seeing
yourself like that, too.

359
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,254
You were right.

360
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,756
About the wander bracelet.

361
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:30,260
Andrews was looking at me.

362
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,012
Are you just saying that
to make me feel better?

363
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:33,931
Did it work? No.

364
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:41,480
When I was a junior
in high school,

365
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,064
I made this vision board.

366
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:46,651
Two horses, Olympic
medal in archery,

367
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,361
tour with NSYNC.

368
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,573
All goals that I'm okay with
not accomplishing, but...

369
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:55,368
Being a surgeon,
getting married,

370
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,871
having kids?

371
00:19:57,872 --> 00:19:59,789
One of those is
already off the table,

372
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,377
and the others feel like
they're sliding out of reach.

373
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:08,090
I just... I feel like there's
this huge hole in my life.

374
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,014
You had a vision board?

375
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,184
There he is.

376
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,774
Mr. Abbott! Art! Hi.

377
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,235
We're doctors from the hospital.

378
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,736
Let's get you out
of this heat, okay?

379
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,208
He's all yours, Starsky.

380
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:49,005
Mr. Abbott!

381
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:51,384
Art!

382
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,773
I was nervous my
first time, too.

383
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,776
Shouldn't they lower the hoops?

384
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,654
You've been pushing that
chair around for months.

385
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,406
I'm sure your arms are up to it.

386
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,492
Today is about fun, remember?

387
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:18,785
Ooh, you're tall.

388
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:20,787
Good reach too.

389
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:23,373
Audrey, this is Clay.

390
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:25,000
He's captain of the losing team.

391
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,252
Mm, love your optimism, Powell.

392
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,337
You're 0 for 6 against us.

393
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,965
Right, which is why I
call dibs on the newb.

394
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:34,509
She who brings the
long-armed newb

395
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,635
plays the long-armed newb.

396
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:38,138
I think I'll just watch.

397
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,349
Oh, come on. You will love it.

398
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,863
You're gonna improvise?

399
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:58,783
Based on my visual assessment
of your anomalous anatomy.

400
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,035
So you're going to have to make

401
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:01,995
a lot of decisions
in the moment?

402
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:03,622
Oh, at least six.

403
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,081
Where's Dr. Powell?

404
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:08,877
Off the case. But
she will be replaced.

405
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:10,962
I want her back,

406
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:14,049
challenging every
decision you make.

407
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,552
Her challenges have
not been useful.

408
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:25,226
Israeli Intelligence refuses
to make any major decisions

409
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:28,813
until they are thoroughly
challenged by the Tenth Man,

410
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:32,692
a person assigned to raise
every possible pitfall

411
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:34,069
before proceeding.

412
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,519
I have a successful
business because of it.

413
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,078
If you can't work
with a Tenth Man,

414
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,329
I'll find a surgeon who can.

415
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:52,796
We're gonna get you cooled down.

416
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,339
Jerome! Jerome!

417
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,757
We found Art!

418
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:59,344
No. I found him.

419
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,680
In the hospital laundry room.

420
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,060
So who did you kidnap?

421
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,738
Hey! Whoa! You
leave it out there,

422
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,323
I'm picking your pocket, newb.

423
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,827
Yeah, I'm open!

424
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:30,166
Yeah! Nice shot.

425
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,001
Alright, get back on D!

426
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,134
Go to the low post.

427
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,636
Let's go! Come on!

428
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,722
Stay out of my lane.

429
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,515
Pass it!

430
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:51,354
Open!

431
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:56,317
No, don't leave her open.

432
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,166
- Whoo!
- Yes!

433
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:19,340
Nice shot, newb.

434
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,009
Oh.

435
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,052
Ow.

436
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,906
She doesn't have much longer.

437
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,291
We're taking May to Paris.

438
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,843
I kicked Powell off my case,

439
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:06,221
but the patient said I can't do
his surgery without a Tenth Man,

440
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,597
but I don't want
to work with Powell

441
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,516
as a Tenth Man because
I don't like her.

442
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,392
I work with people I
don't like all the time.

443
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:14,687
Carol.

444
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:16,981
Focus on the good,
forget the bad.

445
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,317
There is nothing
good about Powell.

446
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,819
Really?

447
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,905
If there is, I don't
know how to find it.

448
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:26,324
Common ground.

449
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,785
Find the... the...
The common ground.

450
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:30,328
My father-in-law, for instance.

451
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,706
We were like frozen Popsicles
in a... in a freezer.

452
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:35,667
Popsicles? Metaphor.

453
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,418
We were so uncomfortable
around each other.

454
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:40,213
He didn't like me,
I didn't like him.

455
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:42,715
And then, on Maddie's
fifth birthday party,

456
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:45,301
my father-in-law pulled
out a deck of cards

457
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:49,806
and performs, to perfection,
this magic card trick.

458
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,892
I'd been fumbling over that
same card trick for years.

459
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,019
I used to have a magic show.

460
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,565
Amazing Aaron's... Magic Show.

461
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:02,569
And from that point on,
we thawed out, you know?

462
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,195
And we were never close,

463
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:07,657
but we were okay
around each other.

464
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:10,660
Common ground.

465
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,207
Simile.

466
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,363
It was two months before
I scored in a game.

467
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:48,489
Ugh, I won't be able to
move my arms tomorrow.

468
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,617
Not good for a surgeon.

469
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:52,201
0 for 7, Doc. Mm-hmm.

470
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:54,037
You're a doctor? Pediatrician.

471
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,122
I play much better
against the kids.

472
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:57,916
Just
for the record,

473
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,042
I did not love that.

474
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,419
No? Then why are you smiling?

475
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
It's more of a grimace.

476
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,588
Oh? Maybe.

477
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,257
Or maybe it's nice.

478
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,843
You know, being treated
like a normal person again.

479
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,012
That patronizing politeness

480
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:12,555
accorded to the helpless,
vulnerable invalid?

481
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:14,265
That crap gets old fast.

482
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,310
Same time next week?

483
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,270
Not a chance in hell.

484
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,231
Okay.

485
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,361
And I'm back on the case.

486
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:27,904
I didn't know you were off it.

487
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,584
Figure you can use these
more now than I can.

488
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:44,087
Already lost one generator, and
the other is on its last legs.

489
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:46,297
ICU and O. R. are the only
places with working A/C.

490
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,841
The whole hospital could
go dark at any time.

491
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:51,511
You're gonna fire
me, aren't you?

492
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,638
Not if the board fires me first.

493
00:27:57,351 --> 00:27:59,394
I got to make some calls.

494
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:00,687
Number six.

495
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:08,111
Lung is
clear. Moving on.

496
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:09,987
Give her a bump of Dilt.

497
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,656
We don't want her
heart going haywire

498
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,701
while we're trying to
pull this thing off of it.

499
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,037
Renal parenchyma isn't clear.

500
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:20,415
I can't resect this
aspect of the tumor

501
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,459
without sacrificing the kidney.

502
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:26,088
Take the kidney.

503
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,383
Well, she'll need
full-on dialysis.

504
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:32,719
She'll be looking at
blood-pressure volatility,

505
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,262
fainting spells,
electrolyte imbalances...

506
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:36,473
She can live with
it. Take the kidney.

507
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:46,190
When my grandfather
got pancreatic cancer,

508
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,943
my grandmother pushed
his doctors to operate.

509
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,987
And complications from surgery

510
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:53,906
cost him everything that
made his life worth living.

511
00:28:53,907 --> 00:28:56,075
Now, he could have spent
his last few months

512
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:58,202
in palliative care
with his family.

513
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,539
Instead, he got three
years of pain and misery.

514
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,294
Now, we stop now, she'll
have a few more good months.

515
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Butterscotch pudding.

516
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,303
Life is hard.

517
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:20,224
Sometimes the pain of loss
or whatever is so acute,

518
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,393
you don't know how you're
gonna go on or why.

519
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:26,939
And then you find a reason
or a reason finds you.

520
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,816
Someone needs you.

521
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:32,361
You find love, a purpose.

522
00:29:32,362 --> 00:29:35,490
Dialysis isn't going to
stop Edna from the joy

523
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:40,536
of seeing her granddaughter
or the rustling of the leaves,

524
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,038
or butterscotch pudding.

525
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:50,671
I'll take the kidney.

526
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,435
Brooks' unstable
angina has worsened.

527
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,896
The surgery can't wait.

528
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:18,825
Do you watch The
Weather Channel?

529
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:21,953
This is San Jose.
There is no weather.

530
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,114
Other than today.

531
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:27,750
Helsinki has a lot of weather.

532
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:30,378
You watch Finnish
weather reports?

533
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:37,051
I find using science as a
predictive tool very reassuring.

534
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:39,011
I've seen some good
weather movies.

535
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,013
"Twister," "The Day
After Tomorrow"...

536
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:42,849
Those movies are
very unrealistic.

537
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,059
"Sharknado." Pancakes.
Do you like pancakes?

538
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,145
Not much of a carb person.

539
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:49,939
I do love bÃ¡nh xÃ¨o.

540
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,691
Vietnamese crepes,

541
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:52,692
stuffed with pickled
daikon radish...

542
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:55,152
No, those are not pancakes.

543
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:59,991
We have no common ground.

544
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,826
Dr. Glassman's
advice is not useful,

545
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,452
nor Lea's advice.

546
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:04,829
I still do not like you.

547
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,298
That's every senior
care facility

548
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,884
within a five-mile radius.

549
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:23,973
Alamitos?

550
00:31:23,974 --> 00:31:25,933
Vista Park?

551
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,644
Edenvale?

552
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,981
Any of those places ring a bell?

553
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:36,278
Where's my Emma?

554
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,202
I'm gonna end up in
Edenvale, aren't I?

555
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,955
With no one to
report me missing.

556
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:50,583
No, you're not.

557
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:52,085
Edenvale's far too exclusive.

558
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,616
Come on. You know you're gonna
get back together with Park.

559
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:00,968
Sam?

560
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:06,515
Someone just called our E. R.

561
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,726
Looking for a 91-year-old
Samuel McIntyre

562
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:12,063
of 378 Meadow Drive.

563
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,857
We
really did kidnap him.

564
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:17,735
His grandson Kyle is
coming to pick him up.

565
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,113
As in Kyle McIntyre,
Attorney at Law.

566
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:30,957
Solar energy company's
delivering a battery truck ASAP,

567
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,625
which would give us
all the power we need.

568
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:33,668
That's fantastic.

569
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:35,252
Except we can't access it.

570
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,588
It's D. C. power, and they
don't have an inverter.

571
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:41,509
MRIs run on D. C. They
must have inverters.

572
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,387
I'm not sure they can
integrate it into our grid.

573
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:45,721
Well, we're gonna find out.

574
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:47,473
Have engineering take an
inverter to the electrical room.

575
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:48,724
Okay.

576
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,814
What's happening?

577
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:57,274
We're taking you on
a little trip, May.

578
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,944
Just sit back and enjoy.

579
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:04,281
Welcome to Paris.

580
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:10,204
Oh.

581
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:13,290
Oh, my...

582
00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:20,715
It's... It's Notre Dame.

583
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:31,892
Ah.

584
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:35,396
And... the Eiffel Tower.

585
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:40,026
We made it after all.

586
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:45,865
Isn't it beautiful, Marty?

587
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,503
Yes, it is, May.

588
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:09,722
Oh.

589
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:13,476
Brooks' coronary anatomy
is very, very unusual.

590
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:16,812
Yes, it is.

591
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,606
I was hoping to implant
the coronary artery

592
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:20,608
directly onto the
aorta. It won't reach.

593
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:23,110
I know. I was
about to say that.

594
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,404
Sorry.

595
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:26,782
Sorry.

596
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,661
We could do a bypass with
a homograft, although...

597
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,914
The graft would clot.
I was getting to that.

598
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:36,832
I don't need your bad ideas.

599
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:39,085
I was hoping you'd hear it
and make it a better idea.

600
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,753
Stop talking. No!

601
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,552
I'm fine with you not liking me,

602
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,055
but that doesn't mean you
get to disregard my ideas.

603
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,890
And I would've thought
that you'd understand

604
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,476
exactly what it's like to
be treated as the other.

605
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:58,312
You want to find common ground?
That's our common ground.

606
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:07,696
We can use a modified
Takeuchi procedure

607
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,075
to tunnel the RCA
using TEE guidance.

608
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:14,829
Great plan. I'll
cross clamp the aorta.

609
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:30,053
It was a great plan.

610
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,184
We need to do an
off-pump modification

611
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,145
of the trap door technique.
Number 15 scalpel.

612
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:41,564
Without electrocautery, there's
a huge risk he'll bleed out.

613
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:44,191
We need to improvise.

614
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:46,068
What about adjustable
ligature technique

615
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,112
to cinch down bleeding vessels?

616
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,281
That is from the Civil War.

617
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,534
I'm a little bit of a
surgical history geek.

618
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:56,370
55 over 32. He's critical.

619
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,914
That ligature technique

620
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,708
could permanently
damage the vasculature.

621
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,918
We will do the
off-pump modification.

622
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:15,139
In the Civil War, they
also used heat on metal.

623
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
To cauterize.

624
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,852
I'm sure somebody has a lighter.

625
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:26,692
I'll cut, you cauterize.

626
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,869
Is this gonna work?

627
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,498
It's not rated for
this energy load.

628
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,797
B. P. is 48 over palp.

629
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:50,341
We're losing him.

630
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:53,720
Okay.

631
00:37:14,574 --> 00:37:16,450
Anastomosis complete.

632
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,994
Unclamping the aorta.

633
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,544
Heart is perfusing.

634
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:30,673
61 over 40. He's stabilizing.

635
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:50,234
Wonder if Jerome
will wait for me.

636
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,570
Till we get out of jail.

637
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:02,956
Grandpa Sam!

638
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,210
There's my Emma.

639
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,554
He just recently
started to wander.

640
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:19,680
Mwah! I don't know
where you found him,

641
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:21,307
but with the heat today...

642
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,311
you probably saved his life.

643
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,785
Thank you.

644
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:51,462
We're heroes.

645
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,755
Who knew?

646
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,737
Thank you.

647
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:25,704
What?

648
00:39:25,705 --> 00:39:28,415
You're, uh...

649
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,754
You're an amazing person.

650
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,405
How's our Edna doing?

651
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,242
Pretty good,
actually. Considering.

652
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:04,744
Butterscotch pudding?

653
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,001
Mmm, this is good.

654
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:35,108
We're back to 80% capacity.

655
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,279
Nice job.

656
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,197
Back at you.

657
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,373
Maybe you can meet a
guy in a tango class.

658
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,589
That hole in my life?

659
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,632
It's not that I
want a boyfriend.

660
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:06,847
I want a child.

661
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,278
Brooks' EKG is perfect.

662
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:25,657
Hmm.

663
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:29,536
The first brain surgery was
performed in ancient Egypt.

664
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:31,997
The patient died.

665
00:41:31,998 --> 00:41:34,124
I heard they found surgical
tools in a pharaoh's tomb.

666
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,961
They were made of bronze.

667
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:40,798
There's a great surgical
museum in Chicago.

668
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,466
You should check
it out sometime.

669
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,223
Well, what happened there?

670
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:55,103
She changed her hand lotion.

671
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:03,188
How do you feel about tennis?

672
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:08,534
I play every Saturday. Unless
you're too busy with P. T.

673
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,998
I think I might be
ready to graduate.
