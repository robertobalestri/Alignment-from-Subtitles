1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,214
Previously on
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,939
I feel something. A crush.

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,342
Shaun, did
you change the surgical plan?

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:11,011
The parameters it
was based on changed.

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,013
I adjusted accordingly.

6
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,815
And ignored my instructions?

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,218
Your bedside manner
is impressive.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,820
I spent two years
in Afghanistan.

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,989
- You okay?
- No, I am not okay.

10
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,357
I'm so sick of this chair.

11
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,760
And I hate that my body
won't do what I want.

12
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,529
And I hate Shaun Murphy.

13
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,466
What exactly do
you want from me?

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,035
I am sitting in this chair
because of that surgery.

15
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,571
And everybody here seems
completely fine with it.

16
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:38,939
I'm not fine with it.

17
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,584
I don't want you to ask
me about my personal life,

18
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,143
and I don't want to
hear about yours.

19
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,946
From now on, our relationship
is medicine only.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,805
Weather,
San Francisco Bay Area.

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,564
Monday, 66.

22
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,200
Tuesday, partly cloudy, 67.

23
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,403
Wednesday,
72, sunny. 61 low.

24
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,907
Good morning.

25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,043
- You had the volume up very loud.
- Sorry.

26
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,546
I was watching Hairspray
before you got home last night.

27
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,749
At those decibels, damage to
the inner ear is very possible.

28
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,602
Daddy, chill. It was
only for the last song.

29
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,318
Hm.

30
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,924
- Couldn't sleep again?
- I needed to read these.

31
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,730
If you're feeling
anxious or upset,

32
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:37,974
you know you can talk to me.

33
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,433
I'm not anxious or upset.

34
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,469
You've already read all those.

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,890
Information retention
is increased

36
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,439
by multiple exposures over time.

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,679
I'm sure Lim just
needs some time.

38
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,548
She's struggling to adjust,
which is understandable.

39
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,717
Yes, it's okay.

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,453
I still have Dr. Glassman
and Dr. Andrews

41
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,922
as mentors and other friends

42
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,992
I can go to for advice.

43
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,263
Steve always said that if someone
didn't want to be my friend,

44
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:10,431
it's their problem.

45
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,865
So I shouldn't worry about it.

46
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,002
Your brother was pretty smart.

47
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,769
Oh. Yes, he was.

48
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:19,707
Oh, I have to go.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,575
I'm meeting Dr. Glassman
for pancakes.

50
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,988
Good morning.

51
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,266
I haven't seen
you around lately.

52
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,791
Yeah, I've been
really busy at work.

53
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,960
- Oh, I know the feeling.
- Mm.

54
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,973
That Murphy guy still
making your life miserable?

55
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,130
Actually, no.

56
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,000
We had a very...
honest discussion.

57
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,202
I set some boundaries,
feel good about it.

58
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,437
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,805
I bet that's a relief.

60
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,342
Sorry I was such a mess
in the garage last week.

61
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,210
Oh. It was nothing.

62
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,513
Not true, but thank you.

63
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,647
I owe you.

64
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,451
Actually, I could use a ride
to the airport tomorrow.

65
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:38,625
I have a 6:00 a.m. flight.

66
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,655
- Okay. Um...
- I'm kidding.

67
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,557
I was happy to help.

68
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,026
- Have a good one.
- You too.

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,676
That was nice.

70
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,646
For once, my complete
clumsiness actually paid off.

71
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,899
Might change your mind when
you get the cleaning bill.

72
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,883
It was worth every penny.

73
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,453
I'd gladly sacrifice another
shirt to do it all again.

74
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,687
Hopefully soon?

75
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,890
Or not.

76
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,024
Sorry. I was only in town to finalize
the sale of our West Coast distributor.

77
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,130
And now that it's done...

78
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,275
Well, I've been looking for
an excuse to visit New York.

79
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,801
I would love that,

80
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,304
but I'm pretty sure
my husband wouldn't.

81
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,242
Don't hate me.

82
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,210
We had fun.

83
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,778
We've got some powder burns

84
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,580
and a penetrating
shrapnel wound.

85
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,115
Ooh. From playing airsoft?

86
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,118
I'm in a historical
battle reenactment club.

87
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,122
I thought some explosions would
make it more realistic and fun.

88
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,691
One of the fireworks went
off when I was setting it up.

89
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:58,592
It doesn't look too bad.

90
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,293
It was gushing blood.

91
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,329
It's bleeding.
It's not gushing.

92
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,632
I spent a year as a Navy
corpsman in Afghanistan,

93
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,435
treated hundreds of shrapnel
wounds that actually were gushing.

94
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,568
You're gonna be fine.

95
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,804
- Can you move your arm?
- Oh.

96
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,304
Yeah.

97
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,608
Aah! Yeah.

98
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,910
A little.

99
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,779
No step-offs, good
range of motion.

100
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,032
The humerus isn't fractured,

101
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,449
which means
Dr. Powell is right.

102
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,383
You're going to be fine.

103
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,129
Irrigate with antibiotic saline and
get a CT to locate the fragments.

104
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,797
Page me to the OR when
he's prepped for surgery.

105
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,189
Yes. Will do.

106
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,491
Need help over here.

107
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,026
He's in and out
of consciousness.

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,028
BP's in the toilet from
massive blood loss.

109
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,229
Damn.

110
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,998
Fluid resuscitation
initiated en route.

111
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,000
- Shark bite?
- Speedboat.

112
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,969
Got run over on a
predawn skinny-dip.

113
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,837
Luckily his girlfriend's
a former lifeguard,

114
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,539
got him to shore,
applied a tourniquet.

115
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,008
What do we got?

116
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,243
An attending who's 20 minutes
late to his call shift.

117
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,180
Total amputation of the left lower
extremity at the tibiotalar joint.

118
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,782
- Speedboat propeller.
- Thank you.

119
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,355
See how easy and
productive that was?

120
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,952
Oh, grumpy as well as late.
Must've been a rough night.

121
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,421
It was a great night, and
an even better morning,

122
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,899
not that it's any
of your business.

123
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,843
- Oh, then why tell me?
- Because it bothers you.

124
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,695
What's weird is, this isn't much
different than when they were dating.

125
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,997
One of the many reasons
we're not anymore.

126
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,708
Transfuse four units
PRBC and stay four ahead.

127
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,233
- On it.
- It's a clean cut.

128
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,769
We got six to eight hours
max of ischemic time.

129
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,237
You're gonna try to reattach it?

130
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,450
I'm gonna do more than try.

131
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,240
And the proper
term is "replant."

132
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,643
Call it whatever you want,
it's still a bad idea.

133
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,177
Lack of a sensate
plantar surface

134
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,379
would make it likely no
better than a prosthetic.

135
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,582
I disagree, and seeing
as I'm the only attending

136
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,784
who's an actual surgeon,
I'll take it from here.

137
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,097
- Where's the foot?
- I assume at the bottom of the lake.

138
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,489
You mean the top.

139
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,200
Not unless he was skinny-dipping
with his shoes on.

140
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,392
- Bodies float.
- Severed feet sink.

141
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,327
Okay, wherever it is,
we need to find it fast.

142
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,572
Get police search and
rescue out there ASAP.

143
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,596
Good luck.

144
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:45,932
I'll call.

145
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,437
Increase fluid and
blood resuscitation.

146
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,906
If we don't get his BP up,
finding his foot won't matter.

147
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,057
Vitals
have stabilized.

148
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,790
He's opening his eyes.

149
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,094
I'm Dr. Park.

150
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,629
You're at St.
Bonaventure Hospital.

151
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:16,803
Can you tell me your name?

152
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,566
Uh, Andy.

153
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,900
You know what city you're in?

154
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,101
San Jose.

155
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,369
Is Brittany here?

156
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,280
Your girlfriend couldn't
ride in the ambulance,

157
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,306
but the EMT said she was
gonna follow in her car.

158
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,675
She's not my girlfriend.

159
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,942
It was our first date.

160
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,444
She saved your life.
Sounds like a keeper.

161
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,480
How many stitches did I need?

162
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,115
She said the cut was pretty bad.

163
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,689
Andy, I'm sorry,
but your left foot

164
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,222
was completely
severed at the ankle.

165
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,659
What?

166
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,861
It didn't even hurt that much.

167
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,763
You were in hypovolemic shock,

168
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,331
nearly died from the blood loss.

169
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,743
We need to get you into an OR
to clean and debride the wound.

170
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,068
We'll leave it open for now,

171
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,937
and if we can find the foot,

172
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,606
we'll attempt to replant it.

173
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,741
What do you mean,
if you can find it?

174
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,077
It's in the lake?

175
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,354
Search and rescue
headed to the lake.

176
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,989
I want you guys
out there, as well.

177
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,925
You need to start
antibiotic irrigation

178
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,693
with pulse lavage as
soon as it's found,

179
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,470
and then get it in an
organ transplant unit

180
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,896
and perfuse during transport.

181
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,510
We're on a clock.
Every second counts.

182
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,134
That lake's huge.

183
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,311
You really think
they're gonna find it?

184
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,478
Well, police divers find weapons

185
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,238
perps toss in the
ocean all the time.

186
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,171
With metal detectors,
which obviously won't...

187
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,206
Go.

188
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,712
He's lucky.

189
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,682
Not even any occult fractures.

190
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,019
It still blows my mind
you fought in a war.

191
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,589
I wish that we could
get a better view

192
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,824
of the recon images

193
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,501
at the level of the
mid to distal humerus.

194
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,593
Oh, we can.

195
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,029
Watch and learn, young Padawan.

196
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,034
Thanks.

197
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,537
That's... a big one.

198
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,311
What made you decide to enlist?

199
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,356
- Did you have family in the...
- I didn't enlist.

200
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,748
I went to the Naval Academy

201
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,802
and got an officer's
commission after graduation.

202
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,556
There's a brachial
artery pseudoaneurysm.

203
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,893
Looks like the only thing
stopping it from rupturing

204
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,061
is the shrapnel wedged
against the vessel wall.

205
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,963
That's... not good.

206
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:30,931
We have to get him to the OR.

207
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,800
- I'll page Dr. Murphy.
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,716
What're you doing?

209
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,820
This lamp was in
the wrong place.

210
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,621
It seemed fine to me.

211
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,624
You're not as easily distracted
by the environment as I am.

212
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,935
Well, I understand,
but next time,

213
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,127
you mind checking with me

214
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,780
before you start
rearranging furniture?

215
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,664
I think you'll like
the lamps here.

216
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:05,999
That's not the point.

217
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,801
I have to get to the OR.

218
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,418
Park has more confidence
in the cops than I do.

219
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,510
There's no way they're
gonna find it in time.

220
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,380
I had a cousin who lost her engagement
ring in a Halloween corn maze.

221
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,283
A year later, the farmer found
it inside an ear of corn.

222
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,519
If you believe that, there's a Nigerian
prince I'd love to introduce you to.

223
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,989
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

224
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,659
The farmer found it the same day she
lost it, probably in the bathroom.

225
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,438
He figured he'd let the commotion
die down before he tried to sell it.

226
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:40,433
Then someone in his family got cancer or
something else he needed the Lord's help with.

227
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,669
He couldn't very well pray
for divine intervention

228
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,283
with a hot diamond
in his sock drawer.

229
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,008
You have a very fertile
and cynical imagination.

230
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,643
Thank you.

231
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,756
I've been listening to that
Ten Percent Happier podcast,

232
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,180
so I'm all about
the positive vibes.

233
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:55,949
Our foot will be found.

234
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,597
I got 20 bucks
says you're wrong.

235
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh, come on, Mr. Positive,
you can't lose.

236
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,027
- It's a bet.
- Okay.

237
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,871
Stop being so dramatic.

238
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,172
You stop being so dramatic.

239
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,908
The next one is...
Is the top one.

240
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,675
Stop second dealing.

241
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,244
I don't want a pilonidal cyst.

242
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,617
I just had a guy with jock-itch

243
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,380
that was up to his belly button.

244
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,026
And I just had a guy with a plantar
wart infection who hasn't changed socks

245
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,194
since the Carter Administration.

246
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,953
The next one is the top one.

247
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,086
Take it.

248
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,690
Do you have a minute?

249
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,692
Yes.

250
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,832
I was just curious about how
your breakfast with Shaun went.

251
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,833
I canceled.

252
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,105
Uh, I'm worried about him.

253
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,575
He won't admit it, but I can tell what
Lim said is still really bothering him.

254
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,520
If you're worried about him,
then you should talk to Shaun.

255
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,946
I tried that. He
says he's fine.

256
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,614
It's not just about Shaun.
You know that, right?

257
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,228
No, it's not. Lim
is shutting him out.

258
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,717
'Cause Lim is hurting.

259
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,052
Shaun's gotta take some kind
of responsibility for that.

260
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,288
Why? He didn't hurt her.

261
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,026
It's not so cut and dried,
certainly not to Lim.

262
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,663
- Well, what about for you?
- What about for me?

263
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,566
If Shaun's got a problem with
Lim, then he's gotta deal with it.

264
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,375
A medial longitudinal incision

265
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,411
is used to extend the
wound above and below.

266
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,446
Next steps, Dr. Powell?

267
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,416
Place clamps both proximal and
distal, locate the foreign bodies,

268
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,385
and remove and suture
with a 6-0 running.

269
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,518
That's exactly right.

270
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,955
Place the vascular clamps.

271
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,266
The Navy
definitely gave you

272
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,058
some good training
in trauma care.

273
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,535
Is that why you
went to the Academy?

274
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,962
Thought it would help
you get into med school?

275
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,564
Can we get a little
bit more irrigation, please?

276
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,618
Did you ever want
work on a fishing boat?

277
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,638
At my high school, the people who
talked about joining the military

278
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,840
also wanted to work on
fishing boats in Alaska.

279
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,543
I hate fishing. It's
both cruel and boring.

280
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,676
Hm.

281
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,417
I'm guessing the
shrapnel in Afghanistan

282
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,719
didn't have clown
faces printed on it?

283
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,853
Nope.

284
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,061
Wait, can I see that?

285
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,663
That looks like it's from a
propulsive charge, not a shell.

286
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,608
- What's the difference?
- Shut off the electrocautery.

287
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,476
- There's still some bleeding...
- No, no, no, don't!

288
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Aah!

289
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,870
What the hell was that?

290
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,040
Firework mortar the
electrocautery detonated.

291
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,146
His brachial artery's shredded.

292
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,880
We stopped the bleeding and
restored blood flow to your arm,

293
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,630
but it's only a partial fix.

294
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,342
You'll need more tests and then
surgery to do a tissue flap

295
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,886
and to stabilize the
shattered humerus.

296
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,671
How could it explode again?

297
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,706
Aerial fireworks have
two explosive charges.

298
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,042
The shrapnel from
the propulsive charge

299
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,979
obstructed the CT view of
the undetonated mortar.

300
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,847
You're very lucky. If it
had exploded in the field,

301
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,084
you would've bled to
death in under 90 seconds.

302
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,152
Ah, I don't feel very lucky.

303
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,554
We can increase
your hydromorphone.

304
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,124
You can pretend that you're
in a combat support hospital.

305
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,817
Make it all part of
the "realistic fun."

306
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,930
Mm.

307
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,034
I doubt that will
help, but you can try.

308
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,576
Ah, it feels like it's on fire.

309
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,545
Almost done. For now.

310
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,190
We'll need to repeat
this every two hours

311
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,025
to make sure you're ready to
go the moment the foot arrives.

312
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,555
Can you check my phone again?

313
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,026
Nothing yet. Sorry.

314
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,335
I know it was just a first date,

315
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,804
but... I thought it
was going really well.

316
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,042
I always think that,

317
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:19,279
and then find out I talked
too much or not enough,

318
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,567
or she actually did like me,

319
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,350
but she's heading
off to grad school

320
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,253
or doesn't want
anything exclusive.

321
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,288
She's probably stuck in traffic.

322
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:37,430
Maybe... Maybe some people
are just meant to be alone.

323
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,805
Yeah, I met a great
woman last night.

324
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,007
Found out this morning
she was married.

325
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,742
That's in the wake of a divorce

326
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:53,646
and a serious relationship that
crashed and burned a few months ago.

327
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:58,485
You know, finding the right
person, it's pretty damn hard.

328
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,653
You gotta keep trying.

329
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,464
Dr. Park and I are
very different.

330
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,109
You can't have your
own office, Murphy.

331
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,667
But prior attendings...

332
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,969
Were hired when we had
different budgetary constraints.

333
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:20,039
Okay, Dr. Park and I have
different work methods.

334
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,442
Neither of us can perform at
our best in a shared office.

335
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,844
There are no other
offices available,

336
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,847
and I'm quite confident you
and Park can make it work.

337
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,458
You're just gonna have to
make a few compromises.

338
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,802
- Mm. But...
- And if I know Park,

339
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,486
I'm guessing he's already
made a few, which means...

340
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,556
it's your turn.

341
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,637
Officer Baxter?

342
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,205
That's me.

343
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,499
Dr. Perez, this is Dr. Allen.

344
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,875
No foot yet.

345
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,410
Just a bunch of old ball caps,

346
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,746
beer bottles, and dirty diapers.

347
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,914
Some people just don't
deserve nice things.

348
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,616
- Was that on the bottom?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,518
Actually got us
excited for a minute.

350
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,887
I'd find some shade.

351
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,389
We're gonna be here a while.

352
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,467
It's really important that we
find it as soon as possible.

353
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,692
We'll find it when we find it.

354
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,530
Okay.

355
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,567
All right, well,
I'll be right back.

356
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,269
I got a beach towel in my trunk.

357
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,003
You going for a swim?

358
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,614
No, just want to be able to sit
down without getting my pants dirty.

359
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,274
Oh. Look at you, all prepared.

360
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,575
- Yep.
- Such a Boy Scout!

361
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,278
What about me?

362
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,745
It's big enough for both of us.

363
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,555
Severe trauma to
the distal subclavian.

364
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,124
We can do the bypass more
proximally than we'd planned.

365
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,960
I've seen it done in a
Role 3 field hospital.

366
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,329
It'll work.

367
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,398
Surprised you're so invested.

368
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,542
You certainly didn't seem
that sympathetic in the room.

369
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,646
I shouldn't have said that.

370
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,081
I can see how it would be
upsetting to deal with a guy

371
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,665
who thinks combat is
a fun game to play.

372
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,577
- Were you ever in actual...
- I was wrong.

373
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,646
Well, it's okay. We
all let our personal...

374
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,948
No, I mean about the bypass.

375
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,260
There's avulsion of multiple
nerves just beyond the plexus.

376
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,620
So even if we can
restore blood flow,

377
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,489
the arm would still be
immobile and without sensation.

378
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,861
We're gonna have to amputate.

379
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,850
We're not going to do that.

380
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,442
We can use external fixation
to stabilize the fracture,

381
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,810
thoracotomy for the
subclavian artery bypass,

382
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,289
and repair the peripheral nerves
with sural grafts from his leg.

383
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,415
There are multiple
nerves damaged.

384
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,251
Then we will find
multiple solutions.

385
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,618
We are not going to amputate.

386
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,021
Dr. Murphy, we need to talk.

387
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,156
I'm busy.

388
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,624
So am I, so I'll make it fast.

389
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,797
Keep looking for a solution
to those nerve injuries.

390
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,198
I will be right back.

391
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,636
Really? Uh...

392
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,739
And my desk is facing a window?

393
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,609
I also moved my
desk several inches.

394
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,782
Dr. Andrews said we both
needed to make compromises.

395
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,813
Okay, Shaun, I told
you this morning...

396
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,548
Yes, now neither of
us will be bothered

397
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,593
because we won't be facing
each other as we work.

398
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,027
I'm not bothered by
that, and if you are,

399
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,396
then you should turn
your desk around.

400
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,655
No, no, no, no, no. I
can't work facing a window.

401
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,057
People constantly
walking by outside...

402
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,236
You're not the only person who
needs a comfortable environment

403
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,961
to do their job.

404
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,895
Now, I don't care what
you do with your stuff,

405
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,366
but do not move or touch anything
that belongs to me again.

406
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,851
Page me if you find
a surgical solution.

407
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,323
Murphy wants his own office.

408
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,225
- Is that surprising?
- No.

409
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,429
What was surprising was him coming
to me instead of his supervisor.

410
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,865
Okay. I'm not sure why
you're sharing that with me.

411
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,344
Is there a problem between Murphy
and Lim I should be aware of?

412
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,603
Maybe.

413
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,606
Care to elaborate?

414
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,043
If there's a problem between Lim
and Shaun, why are you asking me?

415
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,445
Because I value your insight,

416
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,279
and I'm under the impression

417
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,990
that they're both
close friends of yours.

418
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,318
Okay, so it's definitely my
responsibility to sort that out.

419
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,392
Mm...

420
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,263
Not a bad spot for a
post-date skinny-dip.

421
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,041
As long as you stay out
of the speedboat lane.

422
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,400
Mm-hmm.

423
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,301
You're not a skinny-dipper?

424
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,436
Definitely not.

425
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:48,641
Ooh. A strong
aversion. Interesting.

426
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,011
Ahh. Is it the... uh, the cold water,
the nudity, or you just hate swimming?

427
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,981
All of the above.

428
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,249
I don't do outdoor naked
or outdoor hookups.

429
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,485
Mm.

430
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:01,821
Same goes for cars,
airplanes, elevators.

431
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,290
Mm.

432
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,626
I'm more of a comfortable,
private spot type of girl.

433
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,094
Good to know.

434
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,800
I definitely agree on
the planes and elevators,

435
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,568
and I'm not a big
fan of cars myself,

436
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,737
but, uh, tractor combines...

437
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,239
phew, they're a
whole 'nother story.

438
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,677
- Tractor combines?
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,522
I don't know. Just something
about being high up,

440
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:30,182
looking out over a few hundred acres
of alfalfa blowing in the breeze.

441
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,122
- What?
- You are a strange dude.

442
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,135
And why do you keep a
beach towel in your trunk?

443
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,227
I do yoga in the
park after work.

444
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,995
Ah, yes, the yoga.

445
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,164
- You should try it sometime.
- Mm.

446
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,166
Might help soften up
some of that cynicism.

447
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,700
I'd rather be cynical
than gullible.

448
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,772
Found a diamond ring
in an ear of corn.

449
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,007
Oh, God. It's true, all
right? You can ask my dad.

450
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,143
He's known that farmer
his entire life.

451
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,811
And now I know where
you got it from.

452
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,180
The apple doesn't fall
far from the alfalfa.

453
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,383
Okay.

454
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,440
There's an active bleed
at the debridement site.

455
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,666
- BP's plummeting.
- Damn it.

456
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,167
We have to get the stump closed.

457
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,011
No, that'll make it impossible
to replant his foot.

458
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,555
There's still time
for them to find it.

459
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,106
I just need to stop the bleed.

460
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,876
I can't get the
bleeding under control.

461
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,420
If I ligate, it'll
clot, but if I don't,

462
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,954
the reduced flow will destroy
everything we've already fixed.

463
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,257
Still no word?

464
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,662
I just got off the
phone with Dr. Allen.

465
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:50,916
They still haven't found it.

466
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,842
Let's get him to the OR. We
need to fully close the wound.

467
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,093
You tried your best.

468
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:10,756
What're you doing, Murphy?

469
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,819
Oh. Setting up my new office.

470
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,387
No, you're not. I told you
there was no extra space.

471
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,089
But you were wrong.

472
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,691
Nurse Hawks told me this room

473
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,593
has not been used
by anyone in months.

474
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,197
Because we need it for storage.

475
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,233
We can still use it for storage.

476
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:30,603
There's room for my new desk
and all this other stuff,

477
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:33,806
which won't distract me by sharpening
pencils, doing back stretches,

478
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,142
looking at me, or breathing.

479
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,648
Fine. For now.

480
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,559
But as soon as someone needs
it, I'm kicking you out.

481
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,117
Thank you, Dr. Andrews!

482
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:55,761
Yeah.

483
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:57,763
Okay.

484
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,533
Got it.

485
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,701
You owe me 20 bucks.

486
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,915
We still have another hour.

487
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,471
Park couldn't
control the bleeding.

488
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,282
He's moving the guy to
the OR to close the wound.

489
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:08,906
We can still scrub in
if we beat traffic.

490
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,112
Hey! Where are you going?

491
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,183
I got five little piggies
that need to go home.

492
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,619
Page Park.

493
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,953
Already am.

494
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,695
We need to repair the left
subclavian artery first.

495
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,573
But we still need a way
to get distal control.

496
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,331
Couldn't we just
extend the incision

497
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,867
to the supraclavicular one?

498
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,436
No. That risks transection
of the phrenic nerve.

499
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:44,343
So, why did you want
to join the Navy?

500
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,405
Couldn't afford to
pay for college?

501
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,682
You wanted to see the world?

502
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,318
Why are you so
obsessed with this?

503
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,387
I'm just... curious. I'm
trying to get to know you.

504
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,790
Clearly, you have some
sort of judgmental notion

505
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,859
about the type of people
that join the military.

506
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,731
I'm not judging you.
I'm genuinely impressed.

507
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:08,034
Because I know how to treat a
puncture wound and read a CT?

508
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:15,574
Do you have such low expectations of
all veterans or just the amputees?

509
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:20,780
Hello. I have
resolved the issue.

510
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,350
We use biopolymer grafts
to repair multiple nerves.

511
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:27,887
Oh. I can definitely think
more clearly in my new office.

512
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:29,721
Great.

513
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:39,731
Forceps.

514
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,845
Some of the tissues
edges look necrotic.

515
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,046
You gonna be able
to remove it all?

516
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,437
Hope so. Grab the
DeBakey scissors

517
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:46,849
and cut off the
non-viable tissue.

518
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,248
You mind keeping your
eyes on the road?

519
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,918
Sorry. It's just...
that's pretty cool.

520
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,292
6-0 on a prolene castro.

521
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,764
Get the transplant
unit open and ready.

522
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,618
It's been seven hours
of cold ischemia time.

523
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,067
We gotta get it perfused ASAP.

524
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,268
All right.

525
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,566
It's
nearing the eight-hour mark.

526
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,940
They got off the
freeway four minutes ago.

527
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,174
Could be traffic.

528
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,758
No, they're in a squad
car with a siren.

529
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,411
Which you'd think would
make people get out of the way,

530
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,435
but apparently not.

531
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,576
Nice color. Healthy edges.

532
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,680
Great work. Scrub in,
and let's do this.

533
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:09,288
Biopolymer grafts
aren't going to work.

534
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,957
The gap's too wide.

535
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,292
Nerve defects from
the explosion are too big.

536
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,294
Even if we
bridge the nerves,

537
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,907
what do we do about
all this bleeding?

538
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:19,999
We have to amputate.

539
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,001
We have no choice.

540
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,206
Dr. Murphy?

541
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,320
We can do an
end-to-side neurorrhaphy

542
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,813
with coaptation of
the distal stump

543
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,833
of the transected nerves
to adjacent donor nerves.

544
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,401
But what do we
do about the bleeding?

545
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,970
- If we can't stop it...
- We can facilitate anastomosis

546
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,295
by using the
parachute technique.

547
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,163
- We're running out of time.
- I can do it.

548
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,207
Stabilizing
the ankle joint.

549
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,911
Matching the ends of the posterior
tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries.

550
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,078
His date ever show up?

551
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,689
- Nope.
- Use 7-0 prolenes.

552
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,615
I sort of feel bad for the guy.

553
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,459
In all fairness, was it right
for him to expect her to?

554
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,352
Well, seems like the
decent thing to do.

555
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,687
Repairing the vena comitans
and saphenous vein.

556
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,089
Saving his life wasn't enough?

557
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,858
Ah, she still could show up,

558
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,003
and this could be a crazy story
they tell their kids one day.

559
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,229
Sorry, Mr. Positive, but that
will definitely not happen.

560
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,031
You never know. Most
of the people I know

561
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,766
who are in great relationships
had super rocky starts.

562
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,853
I can't
get any pulse on the foot.

563
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,421
The anastomosis
sites are hemostatic.

564
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,023
Hey, check
Doppler at the femoral,

565
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,927
then work your way down
to where the flow stops.

566
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,217
Good in the groin.

567
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,619
No flow here.

568
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,464
He's thrombosed all the
way to his popliteal.

569
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,488
We may have just saved his
foot, but killed his leg.

570
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,667
Shaun?

571
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,737
I just saved my patient's arm.

572
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,240
I heard that. That...
That's good... good work.

573
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,143
Do you like my new office?

574
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,747
No, I don't. I don't like it.

575
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,417
Mm. I've already
talked to Dr. Andrews.

576
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,886
- He agreed...
- It's a bad idea.

577
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,421
No. Dr. Park and I distract
and annoy each other.

578
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,866
We will both do
better work if...

579
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,092
- That's the reason? Really?
- Yes, it is.

580
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,629
Why are you isolating yourself?

581
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,565
I'm not.

582
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,834
You're the one who
canceled our breakfast.

583
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,337
Because I don't want to have
to deal with this, Shaun.

584
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,405
I'm a...

585
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,275
I'm angry with you.

586
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:45,743
Oh.

587
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,680
- Why?
- "Why?"

588
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,728
Because of Lim's surgery. Because
I told you exactly what to do...

589
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,621
- No. No.
- and you didn't listen to me.

590
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,432
- The parameters changed.
- You went ahead and you...

591
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,725
And you did the procedure
you wanted to do all along.

592
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,018
Yes, the parameters changed.
I made the right decision.

593
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:06,098
Shaun, Lim is paralyzed.

594
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:09,768
You're the surgeon. You have to take
some kind of responsibility for that.

595
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,173
You shouldn't be angry with me.

596
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,310
- Dr. Lim shouldn't be angry with me.
- She...

597
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,314
She is paralyzed, Shaun.

598
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,219
Mm. I saved her life. I
made the right choice.

599
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:28,433
You're acting like a child.

600
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,721
No. No. I'm not.

601
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,433
You're acting like you
did back in high school,

602
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,168
like you did at... At the
beginning of med school.

603
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,127
You're a grown man, Shaun.

604
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,862
You're... You're
a married man now.

605
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,299
You got to take some kind of
responsibility, accountability.

606
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,876
You're running away.
You're... You're...

607
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,112
You're... You're... You're
shrinking your world around you.

608
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,671
You're... You're retreating.

609
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:53,811
You're wrong.

610
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,516
You are being mean and
calling me a child.

611
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,227
- Shaun...
- And you are taking Dr. Lim's side...

612
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,531
Shaun, you can't shrug this off.

613
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,388
I do not want you in my office.

614
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,825
Leave now!

615
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,225
We successfully
repaired your shoulder.

616
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:40,725
Thank you.

617
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,239
Please don't play with
any more fireworks.

618
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,223
You are lucky to have
survived your own ignorance.

619
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,400
Yeah.

620
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,003
At the very least, stick
to the non-explosive ones.

621
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,405
I'll just, uh, stick to watching
them on the 4th of July.

622
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,574
Probably for the best.

623
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,243
Mm.

624
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,579
With lots of rehab, you should
regain full function of your arm.

625
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,712
Mm.

626
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,922
Feel that?

627
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,425
Just a small pinch.

628
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,995
Well, that's exactly
what we want.

629
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,931
Six months of PT, and you should
be up on your feet walking again.

630
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:26,238
Thanks, Doc, for holding out
and not giving up on me...

631
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,274
and my foot.

632
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,279
Do me a favor?

633
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,052
Take a picture of me
and that gnarly scar.

634
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,816
- This for Brittany?
- Nah.

635
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,352
My new profile pic.

636
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,194
You will stand out.

637
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,490
I'm sorry I offended you.

638
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,395
I grew up very... sheltered.

639
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:31,537
I'm still trying to figure
things out and play catch-up

640
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:35,974
and get past my limited
sense of imagination...

641
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,786
which is just a long
way of saying that yes,

642
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,213
I was being ignorant
and judgy and...

643
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,217
I hope you can forgive me.

644
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:56,094
I, um, tore my ACL.

645
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,529
Um...

646
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,370
growing up, my dream was
to play Division 1 soccer,

647
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,539
and I was pretty good.

648
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,444
Junior year of high school, I had
a dozen offers for a full ride.

649
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,515
That's impressive.

650
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:20,186
The first game of senior year, I tore my
ACL trying to slide tackle a midfielder.

651
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,257
And just like that, every
D-1 school rescinded.

652
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:27,631
The only place that still
wanted me was the Naval Academy.

653
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,573
I never really had much
interest in the military,

654
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:34,065
but, hey, the tuition was free.

655
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,934
I was promised a roster spot.

656
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,804
I played all four
years on varsity,

657
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,377
and we even won the Patriot League
championship my senior year.

658
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,579
Nine months later, I was
deployed to Afghanistan.

659
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,985
That sounds horrible.

660
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,923
Not at all.

661
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,016
Joining the Navy was the
best decision I ever made.

662
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:18,786
I enjoyed
our field trip.

663
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,346
I had a good time, too.

664
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:23,615
Being away from the
hospital and all that. Yeah.

665
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:25,229
It's definitely
nice out here.

666
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,186
I might even have to
come back for a swim.

667
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,621
You could bring a date.

668
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,123
Not a bad idea.

669
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:33,892
Just need to find
the right person.

670
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:36,494
Hm.

671
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,096
The bet.

672
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,100
Yes. The bet.

673
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:06,658
I'm sorry. I just...

674
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:11,996
I can't.

675
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,950
Need some help?

676
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,621
Although, it's after 5:00, so I'd
have to charge you time and a half.

677
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,590
Sweet of you to offer,
but I think I got this.

678
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,561
- Ohh!
- You sure?

679
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,734
It'd be a shame if this...

680
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,833
$70 bottle of olive
oil hit the ground.

681
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,601
Well, I had a good
day. I splurged a bit.

682
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:50,869
Good idea.

683
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,170
I'm sure you deserve it.

684
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,373
You do, too.

685
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,173
For saving me twice.

686
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,109
Can I offer you a taste?

687
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,879
I got a baguette at
Listo's, a Brie, a Gouda.

688
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,348
It's a deal.

689
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,950
Thanks.

690
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,455
This is nice.

691
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:47,058
Talking to someone I don't have
to supervise or be serious with.

692
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,192
I agree.

693
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:53,064
I just realized I
don't know what you do.

694
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,766
I'm a professional
hockey player.

695
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,168
Okay, I know that's a joke.

696
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,902
Now I just have to decide if that
means you love hockey or hate it.

697
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,507
Now I'm curious
what you'll decide.

698
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,841
Hmm. Let's see.

699
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,845
- You grew up in Michigan.
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,680
You appear to have
all your teeth.

701
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,315
Oh, but they're also perfect,

702
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,384
which means they
could be veneers.

703
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,286
I'm gonna say you're a
Pistons fan that hates hockey.

704
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,501
It's like you can see right through me.

705
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,958
And my job?

706
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,703
Clearly, you're the parking garage attendant.

707
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:22,861
Or you're just stalking me.

708
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,275
I'm a marketing exec at Greenzy.

709
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,798
Mm.

710
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,143
I have no idea what you guys
do, but I know your building.

711
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,278
There's an amazing Chilean
restaurant right across the street.

712
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,138
- Valeska's.
- Oh, I love that place.

713
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,806
I've been craving
their sopapillas.

714
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,542
We should take care
of that craving.

715
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:37,835
Dinner at Valeska's sometime?

716
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,210
Definitely.

717
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:42,847
Mm, yeah.

718
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:50,889
- You okay?
- Yes.

719
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:52,991
Thinking about work.

720
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,828
I saved my patient's arm today.

721
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:57,996
I should be happy.

722
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,097
So why aren't you?

723
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,011
If this is about your
fight with Glassman...

724
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,071
I'm thinking about my
patient's shoulder.

725
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,728
I have to go.

726
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:44,442
- Dr. Glassman!
- Okay! Okay!

727
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,444
Okay! Okay. What?

728
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,847
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

729
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,980
I know how to fix it.

730
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,283
I know how to fix everything.

731
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,255
There's a surgery that
will cure Lim's paralysis.

732
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,594
Oh.

733
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,664
Okay.
