00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:01,717
<i>Previously on</i>
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:05,040
I've been thinking, and I
need a break from our coffees.

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,275
If you don't value
what the nurses do,

4
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:09,185
how much can you care about me?

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,988
- This is my patient.
- And I'm your boss.

6
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,012
You can either do this with me,
or I'll find someone who will.

7
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:19,395
If you don't trust me, fire me.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,066
And if you do, then
stay out of my way.

9
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,867
Are you trying to
pick your embryo?

10
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:27,730
I'm leaning towards a girl. I
have a playbook to work from.

11
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:30,641
I didn't OD because
of you. Or us.

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,901
Jordan, if I let myself
get close to you,

13
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,369
I will fall for you.

14
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,538
I can't risk that.

15
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:38,849
You deserve somebody who's
ready to fully commit,

16
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:40,475
somebody who makes you happy.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,412
Your brain cancer
may have returned.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,222
The crib needs to be assembled.

19
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,684
Go. I got this.

20
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:51,987
There are two screws missing.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,757
<i>Dr. Glassman doesn't
have brain cancer,</i>

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,592
but there is something
wrong with his brain.

23
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,798
Lea forgot to add
the blueberries,

24
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:04,708
but we can still
put them on top.

25
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,834
Sorry.

26
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,268
Not a problem.

27
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:09,128
Underneath, on top, on the side.

28
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,754
I can eat them here.
I can eat them there.

29
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,145
I can eat them anywhere.

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,945
Not Dr. Seuss fans.

31
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:18,583
We need to discuss
something very important.

32
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:20,743
After we eat.

33
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,625
Don't worry, I'm
fine, the baby's fine.

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,045
Shaun just wanted to have
a bit of a discussion...

35
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,556
You forgot two screws
when you built the crib.

36
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:30,926
- Okay.
- Okay, Shaun, slow down.

37
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,661
Let's all at least
take a seat first.

38
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:35,103
We're gonna have a
discussion about a crib?

39
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:38,478
Your CSF DNA test showed your
brain cancer has not returned,

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,035
but there is clearly something

41
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,837
impacting your
neurological function.

42
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:47,375
Shaun, the crib has
like 100 different parts

43
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:49,524
and instructions
without any words.

44
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,951
Just pictures with arrows going
in every possible direction.

45
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:55,349
Okay. Thankfully, I was there
to correct your mistake,

46
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:57,544
but that won't always
be possible in the O.R.

47
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,032
The O.R.?

48
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:04,292
Yes.

49
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,795
- I would like to do more tests.
- That's not gonna happen.

50
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,773
- That's not gonna happen.
- And... And Dr. Lim should be notified.

51
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,866
That's absolutely
not gonna happen!

52
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,901
If your executive
function has deteriorated

53
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,637
- even a small percentage...
- Shaun, just one second.

54
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,631
Just stop for a second.

55
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,841
Two screws?

56
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,809
There's nothing
wrong with my brain.

57
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,519
There's nothing wrong
with any part of my body,

58
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,880
for that matter, not
that that concerns you.

59
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:28,249
You go to Lim, and you're
gonna look ridiculous.

60
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,222
- Doctor...
- That's the end of the discussion!

61
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,809
And breakfast.

62
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:43,598
He's right.

63
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,399
It's okay. You
were just trying...

64
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,716
I can't go to Dr. Lim

65
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:50,986
without conclusive
medical evidence.

66
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,218
Or maybe he was right.

67
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,754
It is just a crib,
and he was in a rush.

68
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:59,915
Everyone forgets things.
I-I forgot the blueberries.

69
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:02,025
Instead of tests,

70
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,220
I can gather data through
direct observation.

71
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,688
What does that mean?

72
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:08,397
Are you gonna spy on him?

73
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,558
Please put my pancakes
in the fridge.

74
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,334
I will eat them for dinner.

75
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,734
Good morning.

76
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,920
Mind if I join you?

77
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,958
Sure.

78
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,744
How are things in surgical?

79
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:34,158
- Great.
- Great, as in, actually great?

80
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:36,584
Or great, as in, "I'm
saying the right thing

81
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,535
because he's the president
of the hospital"?

82
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,322
Both.

83
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,733
Well, any feedback you have,

84
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,631
you can always come to me.

85
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,174
Sorry to interrupt. I
have a clinic patient

86
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:50,999
who needs a surgical consult.

87
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,676
It's a former patient
of yours, Eddie Richter.

88
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:54,769
Eddie?

89
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:56,939
I haven't seen him in years.

90
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:59,033
He came in with GI
pain and acid reflux.

91
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:01,694
Ultrasound reveals a small
mass on his duodenum.

92
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,946
He'll need surgery to remove it.

93
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,422
I think I can fit
that in. Join me.

94
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,845
Dr. Lim scheduled us
with Dr. Park today.

95
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,485
Doctors Park and
Lim will understand.

96
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,969
This is a unique case.

97
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:16,700
A small duodenal mass?

98
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,060
I don't know.

99
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:23,799
Eddie!

100
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,136
Long time no see.

101
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:29,972
I wish it were
longer. No offense.

102
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:32,103
I wasn't planning on
seeing a surgeon today.

103
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,471
Yeah, yeah, fair
enough. I've brought along with me

104
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:36,937
Doctors Allen and
Wolke to assist.

105
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:39,022
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

106
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,616
Judging by the astonishment

107
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,093
they are both desperately
trying to hide,

108
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:43,852
you did not tell them
about my condition.

109
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,587
I did not. Very few
residents get to see

110
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:50,058
Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis
outside of a textbook,

111
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:53,061
and I figured this would be an
important learning opportunity.

112
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,156
They definitely failed
the bedside manner part.

113
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,410
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,907
Eh, heartthrobs like me and
Brad Pitt are used to it.

115
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:07,325
<font color="#ff65b4"><i>Resync By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

116
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,750
Any deep pain or
tenderness here?

117
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,018
A little.

118
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,311
How's business?

119
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:19,420
Oh, fantastic. Thank the Lord.

120
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,023
Eddie is an amazing carpenter.

121
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,324
He built Isabel and I

122
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:26,361
this stunning mahogany
live edge dining table.

123
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:30,933
I have no idea what that is,
but it sounds delightful.

124
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,935
Yeah. Not much
good for guitar,

125
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,037
but I can still
wield a power tool.

126
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,681
You'll need to use a
carotid pulse monitor

127
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,006
and upper thigh for BP.

128
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,375
Got it.

129
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,244
How painful are the growths?

130
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:44,780
I mean, that depends. They're
basically just huge warts,

131
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:46,580
so face, not much.

132
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:47,983
Hands, a little.

133
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,284
Feet, a lot.

134
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,154
I'm blessed.

135
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,563
The Lord knows
that a pretty face

136
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,589
can only get a
handyman in trouble.

137
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:59,460
Dr. Reznick gave us a really
good view with her ultrasound,

138
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,631
but I'd like an MRI and a biopsy
to better assess the lesion.

139
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,866
Ah, might as well get
my money's worth, huh?

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,567
It's good seeing you, Eddie.

141
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:14,276
The team doc's playing it safe.

142
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:15,677
It was a damn curveball.

143
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,813
Well, even a damn
double-A curveball

144
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,982
comes in at, what, 80, 85?

145
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,351
It can still do some
damage, helmet or no.

146
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,753
Two weeks isn't a long time
to be in concussion protocol.

147
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,689
Okay, well, I-I didn't
have a concussion.

148
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,725
I mean, I barely even
had a headache, so...

149
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,561
Can I help you, Dr. Murphy?

150
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,298
I came to observe.
Please continue.

151
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,637
Your ImPACT scores are a
bit worse than baseline.

152
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:43,805
Okay, that's one test.

153
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,975
I mean, I-I passed
all the others,

154
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,977
but the doc still
won't clear me.

155
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:50,831
It's not a bad idea to
play it safe, though.

156
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,513
It is your brain
we're talking about.

157
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:55,217
I mean, you're an outfielder, so
you don't need one just now...

158
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,519
but you
are gonna retire someday.

159
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,455
Look, if I don't get
back on the field ASAP,

160
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,124
I won't have a career
to retire from.

161
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:07,146
I wouldn't have come to the best
brain doctor in town otherwise.

162
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:09,965
Alright. We'll take a look.

163
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,669
Do a neuro and get me an MRI.

164
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:17,172
An MRI? For a concussion?

165
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:19,540
Well, he's got some
dilation of his left pupil.

166
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:22,010
Probably not significant,

167
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:24,545
but if we're gonna
override the team doctor,

168
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,681
we better be sure, hmm?

169
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:28,984
- On it.
- The MRI is a good idea.

170
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,886
I did not notice
the dilated pupil.

171
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,054
Well, thank you.

172
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:33,989
Not a problem since
it's not your case.

173
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,724
But it is an interesting case,

174
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:37,926
even if I did not know
that when I came here.

175
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,828
Since I've cleared my schedule,

176
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,329
I would like to
continue observing.

177
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:44,066
You cleared your schedule of
people with actual ailments?

178
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,934
Mmm.

179
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,536
Okay, fine. Observe
all you want.

180
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,204
I will.

181
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:50,705
Both you and the case.

182
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:56,545
Oh, there's no bleeding
or hematoma in your groin,

183
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,514
which means you're
doing fantastic.

184
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:03,085
Her color looks better.

185
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:06,121
Everything looks better.

186
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,924
I just got off the phone
with Eden's social worker.

187
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,026
She's having trouble
finding foster parents

188
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,319
who are willing to take a
newborn with Turner Syndrome.

189
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:14,696
Well, it's not that difficult.

190
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,065
Her long-term symptoms might
not even be that severe.

191
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,535
Still, Eden will always
need special care.

192
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:31,346
It'll take a minute for the
lidocaine to take effect.

193
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,014
You may feel some discomfort

194
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,716
when the scope goes
down your throat.

195
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,152
Got it.

196
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:40,088
I assume you've discussed
surgical removal

197
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,390
of your EV growths
with Dr. Andrews?

198
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,892
Yeah. No, he wanted to try,

199
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,927
but obviously, there's
the risk of nerve damage,

200
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,430
plus they would just grow back.

201
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:50,899
This is how I was meant to be.

202
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,634
Lord works in mysterious ways.

203
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,069
But surgeons don't.

204
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,973
The risk of nerve damage
is actually quite small,

205
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:01,143
and I'd imagine easier to
live with than the pain

206
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,044
and lack of mobility and...

207
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:04,479
Repulsiveness?

208
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:06,982
No, no. I-I was...

209
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,950
It's alright.

210
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:10,085
I know how I look.

211
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:14,356
I see the frightened
kids, people laughing,

212
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:15,790
staring.

213
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:18,736
I just try my best to
keep my eyes and arms open

214
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,495
to all of God's gifts.

215
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:28,103
Cannot imagine taking an
80-mile-an-hour baseball to the dome.

216
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,747
Some guys in the
majors throw over 100.

217
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:30,939
Phew.

218
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,110
I don't see any edema or
evidence of a hematoma.

219
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,279
Neither do I.

220
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,514
The anisocoria's
probably harmless.

221
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,449
Twenty percent of people actually
have one pupil larger than the other.

222
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:45,687
You play any sports?

223
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,557
I played football and
baseball in high school. Why?

224
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,027
I have a friend who runs a
sports program for at-risk teens.

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,671
I've been helping coaching
some indoor football,

226
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:56,131
I mean soccer.

227
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,464
She's always looking for help
from positive role models.

228
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,469
Yeah, I've... I've never
coached kids before.

229
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:04,084
Mainly just making sure they have
fun and stay off the streets.

230
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,608
And my friend's super cool.

231
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,375
She's cute, too.

232
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,314
Well, helping kids sounds great,

233
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:13,925
but I'm trying to get
a year in recovery

234
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,283
before I start dating.

235
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,484
Damn, my bad.

236
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,119
Oh, it's no big
deal. I just...

237
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,155
No, I mean the...
The anisocoria.

238
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:26,161
Definitely not harmless.

239
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,063
Or a concussion.

240
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,304
You have multiple
cerebral aneurysms,

241
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:36,278
which puts you in danger
of a brain hemorrhage.

242
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,110
So, what now?

243
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:42,312
Well, we're gonna map the
precise vessels involved,

244
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:44,649
take some pictures of
the inside of your brain.

245
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,883
It's called a...

246
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:49,920
Cerebral angiogram.

247
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,431
We'll feed a catheter
into your brain

248
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:52,666
through an artery in your wrist.

249
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,124
You'll be sedated.
It's harmless.

250
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:56,760
As soon as we get the results,
we'll map out a surgical plan.

251
00:10:58,696 --> 00:10:59,731
B-Brain surgery?

252
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:02,766
Hey. Best brain
doc in town, right?

253
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,184
<i>It just
keeps getting worse.</i>

254
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,543
The tumor has significantly
damaged the bile duct.

255
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:15,279
Eddie's gonna need
a surgical resection

256
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,715
or possibly a major
GI reconstruction.

257
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,449
The poor guy.

258
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,918
As if one rare and devastating
disease wasn't enough.

259
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,756
Well, the surgery is manageable.

260
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,700
I've known Eddie for years.
He's always been the embodiment

261
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:28,859
of, "What doesn't kill
you makes you stronger."

262
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,160
Who needs strength

263
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:32,094
when you're cradled in
the Lord's loving arms?

264
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:35,065
Given his situation,
don't you think his,

265
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:38,802
"I'm just thankful for all God's
gifts" attitude's just a bit crazy?

266
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,405
I find the strength he draws
from his faith very inspiring.

267
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:42,949
Except that his faith
has inspired him

268
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:45,093
to not do the only thing
that would actually help him.

269
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,646
Get an octreoscan to confirm
that his liver, pancreas,

270
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,247
and lymph nodes aren't involved.

271
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,716
On it.

272
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:55,052
- You should probably go and...
- Referee?

273
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,853
Assist.

274
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,593
The radiolabeled tracer
will light up any areas

275
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:05,862
infiltrated by the tumor.

276
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,098
Will I get spidey strength, too?

277
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,267
Can I get you flat on
your back for the scan?

278
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,760
That won't be too
painful, will it?

279
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:13,503
No. Sure, I'll be alright.

280
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,573
Is there any family
you'd like to contact?

281
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,476
No, it's just
me. I live alone.

282
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,979
If you don't mind my asking,
E.V. is genetically inherited.

283
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:25,582
I'd assume at least one of
your parents suffered from it?

284
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:26,950
Yeah, they both did.

285
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,687
Did they both also decide
against surgical treatment?

286
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:32,657
Well, my parents were
circus performers,

287
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,558
made a living off
their appearance,

288
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,627
so I doubt they
wanted any treatment.

289
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:37,937
Can't say that for sure, though.

290
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:41,198
They gave me up, uh,
right after I was born.

291
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,851
I'm sure they were trying to
protect you from the life they had.

292
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,269
Heh. No, from
what I found out,

293
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:48,673
they thought a family
act would be too sad

294
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,708
and ruin the gig, so they
didn't want me around.

295
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,576
That's horrible.

296
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,444
Not at all.

297
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:55,646
I grew up in foster homes.

298
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,816
I had one mom who
was a minister,

299
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:00,884
introduced me to the
power of the Lord.

300
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:05,122
And then, when I was older, I
had a dad who was a carpenter.

301
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:06,590
Taught me everything I know.

302
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:10,360
I've always been blessed.

303
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,736
Advancing the catheter to
assess posterior circulation.

304
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,341
Dr. Murphy, do
you mind if I ask,

305
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:25,474
qhy are you observing us?

306
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,178
I don't mind.

307
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,281
Why are you observing us?

308
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:32,617
I am not observing you.

309
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,686
I observing this case
because it is interesting.

310
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,421
Also, because it
is Dr. Glassman's,

311
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:38,732
and he may display
additional symptoms

312
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:39,796
that will help me diagnose

313
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:42,660
his deteriorating
executive function.

314
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:44,261
So you're worried
because he forgot

315
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:46,363
- a couple of stitches on a routine close?
- Stop.

316
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:54,271
The third aneurysm is low
lying at the basilar trunk.

317
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:56,641
That will be very
difficult to clip.

318
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:58,743
And dangerous.

319
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,945
Definitely a very
interesting case.

320
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:12,022
<i>♪♪ Hush, little baby
Don't say a word ♪♪</i>

321
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:15,726
<i>♪♪ Mama's gonna buy
you A mockingbird ♪♪</i>

322
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,394
You sure you should
be doing that?

323
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:19,396
Changing bandages or singing?

324
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,097
Both.

325
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,838
She's gonna be leaving soon.

326
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,405
I'll be fine.

327
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:39,082
<i>No, I'm
not overreacting.</i>

328
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:42,419
He is covered in these tree-like
growths but refuses surgery.

329
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,922
But everyone acts as
if he's so inspiring.

330
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:46,135
It's a pretty brave choice.

331
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:47,825
No, it's a stupid choice.

332
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,427
Living in isolation
and unnecessary pain,

333
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,796
all because of his belief

334
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,397
in the Magical Mystery
Tour that is religion.

335
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,811
Well, given your family history,

336
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,878
I see why this patient is a
little triggering for you.

337
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,336
Okay, I'm not triggered.

338
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:02,607
This has nothing to
do with my family.

339
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,776
Religion is the
opiate of the masses.

340
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,830
You know, Marx got a lot
wrong, but not that one.

341
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:09,465
Why don't we talk
about something else?

342
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:12,282
I mean, look at terrorism,
the countless wars,

343
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:15,620
the KKK, al-Qaeda,
bombed abortion clinics,

344
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,587
the assault on women's
rights, not to mention

345
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:20,892
the rampant persecution
of the LGBTQIA community.

346
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,769
I mean, you either have to
have your head in the sand

347
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,929
or be a complete
moron not to see that.

348
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:26,495
Mmm.

349
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,867
This is done. Will
you grab the salad?

350
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,818
Sorry. I was looking
for a place to meditate.

351
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:49,620
It's okay.

352
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:53,658
I came here to decompress
before I head home.

353
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,263
Jordan.

354
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,467
The other night at karaoke,

355
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:07,103
I shouldn't have tried to
give you relationship advice.

356
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:09,339
I mean, you don't
need me for that...

357
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,910
or anything else, really.

358
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,982
You're everything.

359
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Thanks.

360
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,694
Sorry, I gotta go.

361
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,675
He started vomiting blood
and then lost consciousness.

362
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,059
Get two units PRBC,
stay two ahead,

363
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,735
- and place an NG tube.
- On it.

364
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:40,437
Eddie, can you hear me? Eddie?

365
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:43,985
The tumor's caused a
severe duodenal ulcer

366
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,546
and major hemorrhaging
in his upper GI tract.

367
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,719
Yeah. We can't excise it
if we can't stop the bleed.

368
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,183
We could do it in two steps,
endoscopy to stop the bleed

369
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:53,553
and a partial duodenectomy
to remove the tumor.

370
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:56,388
But it'd be safer to debulk
the tumor after the scope

371
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,691
and follow up with
aggressive chemotherapy.

372
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:00,335
Chemo would increase the
pace of the E.V. growths.

373
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,728
Which he doesn't
seem bothered by.

374
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:03,301
Doesn't mean we
should make it worse.

375
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:04,840
Well, it's better than
bleeding out in the OR.

376
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:06,900
He's not going to bleed out.

377
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,768
We can solve both the GI bleed

378
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,572
and totally excise the tumor
with a pancreaticoduodenectomy.

379
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,608
A Whipple while the
patient is hemorrhaging?

380
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,787
That's even more risky than
combining the scope and...

381
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:21,313
I'm aware of that, but
unlike your department chief,

382
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:22,591
I'm not interested
in whether residents

383
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,082
approve of my decisions.

384
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,619
Get him prepped.

385
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,029
<i>We'll
approach all three aneurysms</i>

386
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:29,756
from a left-sided craniotomy.

387
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,892
Even though the ICA aneurysm
is on the right side?

388
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,393
Yes.

389
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:37,430
We'll go after
the basilar first,

390
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:38,932
as that is the most challenging.

391
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:41,133
What about the ipsilateral PCOM?

392
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,503
It's pressing the third
nerve and may rupture soon.

393
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,262
If you'd let me finish,

394
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:48,073
step two will be the PCOM,

395
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,443
and after that,

396
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:52,745
we'll cut across the infield
and go after the ICA.

397
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,254
Have you considered...

398
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,315
Shaun, will you stop?
Will you just please stop?

399
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,083
I'm fine. I know
what I'm doing.

400
00:17:58,217 --> 00:17:59,953
My memory is intact.

401
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,154
Does anyone have an
actual objection to the surgical plan?

402
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,732
- No.
- Nope.

403
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,868
Thank you. It is extensive

404
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:11,096
and could put Ricky at
risk for future seizures.

405
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,550
And your outburst could indicate
a lack of impulse control,

406
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,006
which is a symptom of
executive dysfunction.

407
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:19,672
I am exhibiting extraordinary
impulse control as we speak.

408
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:22,942
As to the risks, I have
clipped over 2,000 aneurysms.

409
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:25,809
Tomorrow morning, I'm
going to clip three more.

410
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:31,149
Put Ricky on the schedule.

411
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:32,919
Go home. Get some sleep.

412
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:39,626
It's not milk and cookies,
but it'll have to do for now.

413
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,997
Oh, sorry. I was gonna
take care of that.

414
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,633
Why? Did Park tell you to?

415
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,635
Dr. Park? No. I just
got off my break,

416
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:50,970
- and I was going to...
- Great news.

417
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:53,473
I just got off the phone
with her social worker.

418
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:55,040
She found a foster family.

419
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:00,077
Lucky girl. You've got a home.

420
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,857
I know you were hoping
for a pancake dinner,

421
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:13,338
but I was thinking maybe we
could go to Barone's instead.

422
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:15,732
I'm really craving a meatball.

423
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,631
Yes, Dr. Glassman is not
only highly experienced.

424
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:21,199
He has above average
intelligence.

425
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,455
I don't know. He
is an A's fan.

426
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:26,514
I have not noticed any symptoms

427
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,708
significant enough
to alert Dr. Lim,

428
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,343
but even with a decline
in executive function,

429
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:33,646
he might not show
serious deficits.

430
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,156
I think we should definitely
discuss it further,

431
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,849
over sauteed artichokes.

432
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:39,318
I am not hungry, but I will
come and keep you company

433
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,178
while I continue to work.

434
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,426
If Glassy can still
do brain surgery

435
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,928
and you haven't seen
any serious deficits...

436
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,765
There is definitely something
wrong with his brain.

437
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,167
He's getting older. It
happens to everyone.

438
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,484
This is not just aging.

439
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:58,944
I know Dr. Glassman.

440
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:03,333
Do you think Glassman is
a danger to his patients?

441
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:08,414
No.

442
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:10,690
Not yet.

443
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:15,588
Then let's go to Barone's
and eat some meatballs

444
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:18,491
and chicken wings that I will
enjoy for a few glorious hours

445
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:20,743
until the indigestion kicks in.

446
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,062
You are right.

447
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,535
Meatball, stat.

448
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,843
That's the last
anastomosis. Remove the clamp.

449
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,689
Looks like the
sutures are holding.

450
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,921
I can't believe we did
a Whipple in under six hours.

451
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,614
That's gotta be a record.

452
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:51,042
More importantly, no more
tumor, no more bleeding ulcer.

453
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,704
Went even better than I'd hoped.

454
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:55,163
Gotta give
the good Lord his due.

455
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:57,593
Eddie is truly blessed.

456
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,609
We need a few more 4-0
prolenes on a Castro

457
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,898
and two surgical drains.

458
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,723
Hey. You got your
gear for tonight?

459
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,016
Yep.

460
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,518
Dug out the old football cleats.

461
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,128
Awesome.

462
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,993
Samira's really looking
forward to meeting you.

463
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,484
Don't worry. I
respect your recovery.

464
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,539
- I'm not trying to set you up.
- Thank you.

465
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:29,774
Jordan also told
me she'd kill me

466
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,600
if I did anything to
tempt you off your path.

467
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:36,089
You and Dr. Allen
were talking about me?

468
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:38,674
Yeah. She was just making sure I
knew what you were dealing with.

469
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:41,315
She's definitely
looking out for you.

470
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:54,921
My head. It's gonna explode.

471
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:58,390
He has a thunderclap
headache and double vision.

472
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:01,044
His left eyelid's droopy, looks
like complete third nerve palsy.

473
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,562
Left pupil
non-reactive to light.

474
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,135
The PCOM aneurysm
must have ruptured.

475
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:06,499
We need to get him
to the OR, stat.

476
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:08,045
Page Dr. Glassman.

477
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:10,595
Scalpel.

478
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,685
Intracranial
pressure is dropping.

479
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,339
We've bought him some
temporary relief.

480
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:27,511
Can we see the CT scans,
the new ones, please?

481
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,494
Given the
subarachnoid hemorrhage,

482
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,895
the risk of the previous
surgical plan has increased.

483
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,832
I can still clip the
two smaller aneurysms,

484
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:38,434
then ligate and bypass
the ruptured one.

485
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,036
We should consider
coil embolization

486
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:41,637
of the ruptured aneurysm.

487
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:43,549
We treat that now and then
come back for the other two

488
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,007
once Ricky has recovered.

489
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:47,577
Then he has to come in every
six months for an angiogram,

490
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,755
weakening his muscles,
damaging his coordination,

491
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,490
effectively ending
his pro career.

492
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,179
That's your recommendation?

493
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:58,688
The treatment
is a much safer option.

494
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,356
He's 19.

495
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,592
He has lots of life to
consider after baseball.

496
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:04,503
I'm confident
in what I promised.

497
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,362
I'm confident that
I can deliver it.

498
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,632
Your experience mitigates
the increased risks

499
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:11,734
of the craniotomy, but it
does not eliminate them.

500
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,603
The patient should decide.

501
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:16,804
Fine.

502
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,940
Let's wake him up and
present both plans.

503
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:26,349
The surgery went better
than we could have hoped.

504
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,484
We removed the tumor,

505
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:30,919
and your liver and
pancreas are working great.

506
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:35,358
So when do I get to go home?

507
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:37,536
Well, we need to keep an eye
on you for a couple days.

508
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,171
I took the liberty of
getting you a few things

509
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:40,863
to help pass the time.

510
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,000
Thank you.

511
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:51,474
I'm so grateful to you all.

512
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,186
I've spent so much time on my own,
I can forget how wonderful it is

513
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,010
to have other people
there who care about you.

514
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:09,459
Hey. Sorry. I got a
little aggro last night.

515
00:24:09,592 --> 00:24:11,294
My family was big on
dinner debate time.

516
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:13,029
Okay.

517
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:16,132
That's all you have to say?

518
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:19,060
I have a blood draw to do, so...

519
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:21,846
It was just a
philosophical discussion.

520
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:23,881
It's not like we got
into a fight, right?

521
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,641
No, we didn't.

522
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:36,118
- It was awful.
- Terrible.

523
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,689
Somebody's in a good mood.

524
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:41,023
Indeed I am.

525
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,500
It's the Eddie effect.

526
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,594
Our patient radiates positivity.

527
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:46,162
It's oddly contagious.

528
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:48,573
It's got me wondering
why I'm always so focused

529
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:51,200
on choosing the right
path instead of...

530
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,003
just being open to God's gifts.

531
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:56,115
Sorry.

532
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:00,276
My gift is using my
stomach as a speedbag.

533
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:07,383
I don't know what's worse...

534
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:09,018
that I might not
walk out of here,

535
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:11,579
or walking out knowing that
I'll never play ball again.

536
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:16,200
Yes. That is the question
you need to answer.

537
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,607
Don't get stuck on
worst-case scenarios.

538
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,671
I worked real hard to
get here, you know?

539
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:23,341
And I... And I got
people counting on me...

540
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:24,867
Hey, hey, hey.

541
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,203
Shut out the noise.

542
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:28,547
Other people are
gonna have opinions,

543
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,114
whether you swing 3-0,

544
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:32,208
whether you don't
take the extra base.

545
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,437
Whatever decision you make,

546
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,643
that's gonna be
the right decision.

547
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,291
You know, uh, there's
a... There's a saying

548
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,660
back in the DR...

549
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,896
"You can't walk
off the island."

550
00:25:58,467 --> 00:25:59,856
You gotta take big swings.

551
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,585
Let's fix all the aneurysms now.

552
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:09,948
Good call.

553
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,824
You'll need to keep the
wound site clean and dry.

554
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,260
And be sure to monitor her
caloric intake closely.

555
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:26,338
Babies with Turner Syndrome
have difficulty swallowing

556
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:28,031
and tongue dysfunction.

557
00:26:28,164 --> 00:26:29,265
Turner Syndrome?

558
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,251
Will she need
additional surgeries?

559
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:34,255
Yes, but not for a few years.

560
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,683
With things like this, it's best
to take it one step at a time.

561
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:40,810
We were hoping to
foster to adopt.

562
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:44,081
And these long-term
medical issues...

563
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:45,748
they're significant.

564
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:48,731
When it comes to medicine,
Google is not your friend.

565
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:54,244
Patrick, Annie, I know
it all sounds scary,

566
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:56,838
and you have every
right to be nervous.

567
00:26:57,793 --> 00:26:59,328
But you can do this.

568
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:02,264
Eden needs you.

569
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,279
Wouldn't it be best for Eden

570
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,473
if you found someone
more qualified?

571
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:25,575
I'll let Social Services know.

572
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:39,691
What's the score?

573
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,283
How am I doing? My
executive function.

574
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:44,951
What's the score?

575
00:27:44,976 --> 00:27:47,345
It is not a score, it is data,

576
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,614
and I am not ready to
draw my conclusions.

577
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:51,049
Well, you're wasting your time.

578
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:53,794
You should focus on people
who actually need you.

579
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,842
I'm fine.

580
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:59,864
I am focused on you...

581
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:02,961
because for most of my life,
you've watched out for me.

582
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,659
No one asked you to do it.

583
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:09,302
You chose to.

584
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,410
Sometimes when I
didn't want you to.

585
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,331
I'm very glad you did.

586
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,604
So no matter what anyone,
including you, says,

587
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:28,251
I am going to watch out for you.

588
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:37,495
What are you talking
about? It's fantastic.

589
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,637
These are incredible, seriously.

590
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:42,946
I didn't mean to interrupt.

591
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,707
No, Dalisay was just showing
me her watercolor landscapes.

592
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,407
She's a wonderful painter.

593
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,400
Really?
I had no idea.

594
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:52,626
There's increased output
in his J.P. drains.

595
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,853
That's not surprising,
considering your EV.

596
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,719
Send a sample to the
lab and add meropenem

597
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,576
to his antibiotic
regimen, just to be safe.

598
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,649
Your recovery looks
to be on track.

599
00:29:04,857 --> 00:29:06,700
And we've made
significant advances

600
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:09,027
in plastic surgery techniques
since your last consult.

601
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:10,822
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

602
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,538
But we both know it
would still be painful,

603
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:15,701
and they'd just
grow back anyway.

604
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:19,262
There's one thing I've learned
from the home reno business,

605
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:21,122
"If it ain't broke,
don't fix it."

606
00:29:24,268 --> 00:29:25,569
A proverb for the ages.

607
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,921
I wanted to say goodbye.

608
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,743
The foster parents backed out.

609
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:40,016
She's scrambling to
find someone else.

610
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,013
I don't have another
family lined up.

611
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:52,179
Can you give me more time?

612
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:55,809
N-No.

613
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:01,081
Eden needs a home, and I know
the perfect person to foster her.

614
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:03,360
Me.

615
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,197
One
down, two to go.

616
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:25,469
It's been five
hours. Do you need a break?

617
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,438
Not when I have a
30-year-old Macallan

618
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:30,032
waiting for me at
the finish line.

619
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:31,877
Fenestrated aneurysm clip.

620
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,189
We've got
an intra-op rupture.

621
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:36,314
Bleed is massive.

622
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,708
Suction. Both of you, suction.

623
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,233
Let's keep this field clear.

624
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:40,598
Should we try balloon occlusion?

625
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,295
- Or a flow diverting stent?
- No.

626
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,764
We should adjust the clips

627
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:45,366
to get better proximal
and distal control

628
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,413
and pivot
to a Muslin wrapping.

629
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:50,874
Push
6 mg bolus adenosine.

630
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:55,166
We're gonna stop the heart.

631
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:57,017
Push it, please. Push it.

632
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,507
Aneurysm clips.

633
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:07,487
Oh. That is very innovative.

634
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,814
Inducing a brief cardiac arrest

635
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:11,440
reduces blood flow
to the aneurysm.

636
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:13,886
Gives us time to
apply the clips.

637
00:31:23,627 --> 00:31:27,920
Okay. Let us proceed with the
parent vessel reconstruction.

638
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:31,315
One more time,
fenestrated aneurysm clip.

639
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,775
Thank you.

640
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:35,814
That was exciting.

641
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,896
He's in Vfib,

642
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:45,698
not responding to chest
compressions or epi...

643
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,284
We need to shock
him. Charge to 200,

644
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:48,586
and push another
milligram of epi.

645
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,982
He must
have thrown a clot.

646
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,108
Clear!

647
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:19,279
Time of death, 7:34.

648
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:26,761
His underlying illness
weakened his immune system

649
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:30,765
and made his blood more
susceptible to clots.

650
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,366
There's nothing we
could have done.

651
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,411
Do you know what
hospital you're in?

652
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,881
St. Bonaventure.

653
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,448
And why are you here?

654
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:50,986
Aneurysms, which you
were supposed to fix.

655
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,788
Which we did. And
we did quite well.

656
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:55,857
In fact, if you
stick to your rehab,

657
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:58,292
you might be back on
the field by mid-season.

658
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,730
Thank you, Dr. Glassman.

659
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,302
You got a surgery that can
help me hit a curveball?

660
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:10,704
Try
hitting a knuckleball.

661
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,707
You don't know what it is
until, pfft, it's too late.

662
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:14,976
That's old school.

663
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,397
I haven't even
seen one in a game.

664
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:19,164
Oh, I used to throw a
knuckleball, actually,

665
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:20,481
back in the day.

666
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:22,683
I tried
to be a pitcher.

667
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,752
But I didn't have a fastball...

668
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,571
And then you
have no idea where it's gonna go

669
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,997
'cause it had just a...

670
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:39,968
Just a slight amount of spin.

671
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:46,340
You heard?

672
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,079
Thank you for checking on me.

673
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:53,681
Andrews was right.

674
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:55,375
There's nothing more
we could have done.

675
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,353
I'm really sorry
about your patient,

676
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,555
but I actually came to tell you

677
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,792
that I'm meeting up with
some friends tonight.

678
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:06,794
I'm gonna go back
to my place after.

679
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:09,797
Okay.

680
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,969
But what's wrong?

681
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:16,137
Nothing.

682
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:19,975
I've been meaning to see these
folks for a while, and...

683
00:34:20,108 --> 00:34:21,977
we're meeting near my
place. No big deal.

684
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,045
Well, it's starting
to feel like one.

685
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,883
Clearly, you're mad.
Please tell me what I did.

686
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,555
Sometimes having a
conversation with you

687
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:36,657
feels like combat.

688
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,759
Well, I was
just stating my opinion.

689
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:41,930
No, you were obliterating all
other opinions, including mine.

690
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,903
And calling me a complete
moron in the process.

691
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,508
I have never said
that you were a moron.

692
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:47,768
- I said...
- Ash, I didn't grow up discussing religion

693
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,603
or quoting Marx at
the dinner table.

694
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,448
That doesn't mean I
don't value your opinion.

695
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:53,450
It doesn't seem like it
when you take a sledgehammer

696
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:54,608
to my every argument.

697
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,254
I can give you 100
examples of times when...

698
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:58,046
This is not another
argument for you to win.

699
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:03,919
I have to get to dinner.

700
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,868
I'm so sorry.

701
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,039
If you want some company
or someone to talk to...

702
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:27,876
It's alright. I'll be okay.

703
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,945
I know.

704
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:32,013
But...

705
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:35,050
if you change your mind,
I've got your back.

706
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,184
Like you've had mine.

707
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,719
Thank you.

708
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:43,158
You...

709
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,162
really see me.

710
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:54,601
I think maybe you and I
could be gifts to each other.

711
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,808
And we should be open to that.

712
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:06,747
I have no idea what it looks
like for us to move forward.

713
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:11,485
We'll figure it out.

714
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:31,739
Dalisay.

715
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:33,574
Dr. Andrews.

716
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:36,945
Your landscapes you
showed Eddie before he...

717
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,318
I think you shared them with him
because he was so open-hearted.

718
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,058
See, my whole
life, I've believed

719
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:54,963
that success only came
from constant striving,

720
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:58,033
constant dissatisfaction
with where I was

721
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,101
or what I'd accomplished.

722
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:03,304
Contentment was a
sign of complacency.

723
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,373
That's no way to
go through life.

724
00:37:05,507 --> 00:37:07,375
I know.

725
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:12,480
And I know I didn't
show you enough respect,

726
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,382
and I didn't make enough effort

727
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:17,986
to see things from
your point of view.

728
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:22,123
But I want to change.

729
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:25,927
I want to value the
people I care about

730
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,795
and who might care about me.

731
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,538
And if I haven't screwed up
too badly, then maybe one day,

732
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,209
I'll be worthy enough
to see those landscapes.

733
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,016
How about dinner?

734
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,218
You pick me up at
7:30, Saturday.

735
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,287
We can try that Filipino place.

736
00:37:58,093 --> 00:38:00,829
Why would you say that?

737
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,163
- You know...
- Oh, man.

738
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,332
Hey, what else do you
say in that situation?

739
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,101
I think I agree with the guy.

740
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:08,036
I mean, I think
he's... I think...

741
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,940
You were right.

742
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:15,776
I have a tendency to go
scorched earth in a debate

743
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,644
because I just want to win.

744
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:21,249
I lose sight of what's
important because I'm...

745
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,817
I-I'm a moron.

746
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:24,419
But today, I realized

747
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,256
I shouldn't take anything
or anyone for granted.

748
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:36,064
You showed me what it
truly means to belong,

749
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:39,067
to not be an island.

750
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:45,240
And I just feel so blessed
to be in your life.

751
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:52,412
Uh, and you should order
the salmon carpaccio.

752
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,983
It's delightful here.
It's like butter.

753
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:01,365
Is your boyfriend
really that passionate,

754
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:02,924
or is he a little insane?

755
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,594
Both.

756
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,903
Hi.

757
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:18,006
I thought I'd stop by, see how
you and Eden are settling in.

758
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,340
We're fine, so far.

759
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:20,808
I think.

760
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,711
I'm fairly sure I have
everything Eden needs,

761
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:27,015
though peds might find
a few things missing

762
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:29,384
from their inventory this month.

763
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:31,619
I don't see one of these.

764
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,889
Oh.

765
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:36,324
Oh, Eden will love it.

766
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,625
Thank you.

767
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,199
Toys.

768
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:46,434
Onesies. I need to
get a stroller...

769
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:48,427
Hey, you'll handle it.

770
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,954
It's the perfect practice run
for when your own comes along.

771
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,903
I'm going off my IVF meds.

772
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:58,141
I'm not doing another cycle.

773
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,015
Eden,

774
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,352
she's what I've
been waiting for.

775
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,394
She's my daughter.

This is a
knuckleball, and it fooled me.

780
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,776
I thought it was Dr. Glassman's
cancer returning,

781
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:31,854
but it is damage to
Dr. Glassman's brain

782
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,780
as a result of a mini-stroke.

783
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,866
If that were the case, the
area would have smooth edges.

784
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,926
Mmm, usually, yes.
But rare presentations

785
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:46,987
can show abnormalities
like these rough edges,

786
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,265
particularly when the patient
has had radiation treatment.

787
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:55,370
It explains why his
memory has been impacted,

788
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:57,313
especially during
periods of intense focus

789
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:00,016
involving many sequential steps.

790
00:41:02,363 --> 00:41:04,517
It is permanent.
