1
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:04,004
She's smart. She's tough.
She'll fight for ya.

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,740
I've been impressed
with her every time.

3
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:07,509
How many times
have you been sued?

4
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,109
Twice, just twice.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,622
But when you run a hospital,
it's good to know a good lawyer.

6
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,947
Aaron!

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,448
Janet, hi.

8
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,116
Oh, my gosh. Did it happen?

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,819
Did you play Pebble Beach?

10
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,530
I did, and it was the
worst mistake of my life.

11
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:20,555
Hello.

12
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,322
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy

13
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:24,024
of San Jose St.
Bonaventure Hospital.

14
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,434
- Your client.
- Yes.

15
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,829
Aaron has told me
a lot about you.

16
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,072
Congratulations on all you...

17
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,520
Is this billable time?

18
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:32,713
It is.

19
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:35,052
But it will be paid for
by your insurance company.

20
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,562
And I have good news.

21
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,644
$300,000 that will be paid by
your malpractice insurance.

22
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,546
All you have to do is
sign some documents

23
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,115
and agree to a six-month
supervisory period.

24
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,416
You can still practice medicine.

25
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,785
It just means another doctor

26
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,170
would have to sign off
on all your decisions.

27
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,930
Excuse me.

28
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,522
That is not good news.

29
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,599
Can it be anyone?

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,028
Anyone qualified.

31
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,667
So Park, M-Morgan.

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,410
It could be anyone you
trust. Could be me.

33
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,605
I have worked very
hard to be an attending

34
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,458
to prove that I don't
need anyone's approval

35
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,876
to do what I think
should be done.

36
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,954
Which is often different from
what Dr. Park, or Morgan,

37
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:19,047
or you think should be done.

38
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,990
Also... it is
very humiliating.

39
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,590
- What if he says no?
- We go to trial.

40
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,692
And if he loses at trial?

41
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,528
The money will still be paid
by the insurance company.

42
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,496
But the bigger issue is that a
report, and the court's decision,

43
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:38,432
will be sent to the
California Medical Board,

44
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,076
and they will make a
decision about whether...

45
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,200
you have a future as a doctor.

46
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,777
I'll settle.

47
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,550
I need to go to the bathroom.

48
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,950
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

49
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:10,765
You're Dr. Shaun Murphy,

50
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,450
- Miss Stewart's 10:00 a.m.?
- Yes, hello.

51
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,678
My name is Joni DeGroot.

52
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:19,574
Um... I'm curious
about cancer patients

53
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,441
whose exposure came
from formaldehyde

54
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,868
in pressed wood
office furniture.

55
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,678
Have you had a case like that?

56
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:28,348
No. Nor have I
read about that.

57
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,618
If you have a case
where that is alleged,

58
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,830
- I would not be a good consultant.
- It's not for a case.

59
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,123
It's...

60
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,625
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, Dr. Murphy.

61
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,927
Tell Miss Stewart
to review my update

62
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:43,131
<i>on Carter v. Willis</i> before
finalizing your NDA.

63
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,908
The Idaho District Court made
the stare decisis vulnerable.

64
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,884
Are you working on my case?

65
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,687
You should not be in here.

66
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,621
This is my office.

67
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,834
No one is supposed to
come into my office.

68
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,625
Okay.

69
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,533
I'm not officially on your case.

70
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,802
But I read the file.

71
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,680
It was amazing how you
created arterial clamps

72
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:23,947
out of pieces of
an aluminum can.

73
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,691
Yes. Why is everything
covered in plastic?

74
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,484
They're getting ready to paint.

75
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,919
Oh, I thought it was because

76
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,105
of your obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

77
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,151
I used to have a
closet for an office.

78
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,554
Did you choose this instead
of sharing an office?

79
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,873
- It's not a closet. It's an office.
- It is very small.

80
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,866
Even smaller than my closet.

81
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,194
This is all I need. I
don't meet with clients.

82
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,838
And it's very private,
so I'm not disturbed

83
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:48,972
while I'm doing my research...

84
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,302
Or your rituals.

85
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,539
Nice to meet you, Joni DeGroot.

86
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,368
You're settling your case?

87
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,005
Yes.

88
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,009
Miss Stewart and Dr. Glassman
say it is for the best.

89
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,078
Your settlement includes
a supervisory period?

90
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,147
Mm... yes. Six months.

91
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,279
Hmm.

92
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,284
It doesn't seem
right. Does it?

93
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,488
That... That you
should be punished

94
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,289
for saving a man's life?

95
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,094
You've overcome a lot.

96
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,296
To have that kind of
mark on your record...

97
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,600
seems very humiliating.

98
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:32,840
- I see you're still in the big office.
- Ah.

99
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:35,243
The partner uprising wasn't
as bad as you feared, huh?

100
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,111
It's an ongoing battle.

101
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,838
Joni, I'm with a client.

102
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,080
No, she is.

103
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,420
Joni is my lawyer now.

104
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,271
She will be representing
me at trial.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,091
<font color="#ff65b4"><i>Resync By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

106
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,815
I have a new lawyer.

107
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,952
I have a new client.

108
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,030
<i>How did you get the partners
to change their minds?</i>

109
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,156
The client insisted
that I represent him

110
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,558
instead of Janet Stewart.

111
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,459
<i>What?</i>

112
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,461

113
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,700
<i>♪♪ Now I do not recall ♪♪</i>

114
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,367
You stole your boss's client?

115
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,403
<i>♪♪ If we go ♪♪</i>

116
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,881
And what does Glassman
think about this?

117
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,875
He said it was my decision.

118
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,679
Did he say that in a
neutral way or an angry way?

119
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,149
<i>♪♪ Then I am gonna fall down ♪♪</i>

120
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,784
Angry.

121
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,621
He is worried about
Joni's lack of experience.

122
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,157
But she's smart, and
because of her OCD,

123
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,909
she is very thorough and
understands my situation.

124
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,269
OCD.

125
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,362
You mean she's really
neat and organized?

126
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,764
No, that is not OCD.

127
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,533
She has repetitive
intrusive thoughts

128
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,968
that cause excessive anxiety

129
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,570
which she manages
with ritual behavior.

130
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,875
And when you say
lack of experience?

131
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,744
This will be her first trial.

132
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,613
<i>♪♪ Really and truly, maybe ♪♪</i>

133
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,782
I get to go to court. I
get to be a real lawyer.

134
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,552
Which is great, very exciting,

135
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,387
but it's also... court.

136
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,225
All those people... the judge,
the jury, the other lawyers,

137
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,661
and everyone looking at you...

138
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,732
watching while you do that.

139
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,601
I'm practicing exposure to
contaminants and noises.

140
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,205
I can adapt. I can hide it.

141
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,941
But that's the upside
of your current setup.

142
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,175
You don't have to hide it.

143
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:49,685
Because they're hiding <i>me.</i>

144
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,884
Mm.

145
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:00,087

00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:02,223
<i>♪♪ Really and truly,

147
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,058
Pockets.

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,360
Your outfits for court
will need pockets.

149
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,596
When you need to tap,
put your hand in there,

150
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,596
no one will know.

151
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,505
Just... don't be late.

152
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,740
You're late.

153
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,246
I thought you had
this worked out.

154
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:26,974
I know, I know, I know. Sorry.

155
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,817
The... The bus stalled right
in the middle of Hastings.

156
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,625
Do you want me to call the
VTA and check if that's true?

157
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,089
No.

158
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,872
Sorry. It won't happen again.

159
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:46,052
The night of the accident,
you were coming from where?

160
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:48,311
I was giving Shaun a lift home.

161
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,876
We had grabbed dinner
together after work.

162
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,045
Did either of you have
alcohol with dinner?

163
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,110
I, uh... had a beer,

164
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,112
and, um, Shaun didn't.

165
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:02,081
Joni, your tapping is
distracting Dr. Park.

166
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:03,903
I'm okay.

167
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,855
<i>Tap three times or bad
things will happen.</i>

168
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,758
Your shift that day,
how long was it?

169
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,194
Did you or Dr. Murphy have
any difficult surgeries?

170
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,829
Uh, nothing unusual.

171
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,664
I had an appendectomy,

172
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,918
22-year-old patient, no issues.

173
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,849
<i>Tap three times or bad
things will happen.</i>

174
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,318
Shaun performed a
bowel resection.

175
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:24,263
<i>Tap three times or bad
things will happen.</i>

176
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,435
<i>Tap three times or bad
things will happen.</i>

177
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:29,189
Joni...

178
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:31,216
<i>Tap three times or bad
things will happen.</i>

179
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,909
Joni.

180
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,618
I'm sure you have more
questions for Dr. Park.

181
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,693
You and Dr. Murphy left the
restaurant around what time?

182
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,571
Uh, a little after 10:30 p.m.

183
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,164
We were on Hellyer,

184
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,942
coming through the wooded
section of the park...

185
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,443
and between the
rain and the turns,

186
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,343
I was driving pretty slowly.

187
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,378
<i>Good thing... There
was a car in the road.</i>

188
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,925
I'm a doctor. My
name is Alex Park.

189
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,894
- I need to examine...
- Where is Bob?

190
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,410
I need you to hold
still. Scalp laceration.

191
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,008
Was there anyone
else in the car?

192
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,277
Yes. My brother, Bob.

193
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,542
He was driving.

194
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,642
Hello?

195
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,006
He was thrown out.

196
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,460
Bob?

197
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,739
Bob!

198
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:10,211
I found Bob!

199
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,060
He is bleeding from
his radial artery.

200
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,051
We need to move him!

201
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,724
I can't leave her!

202
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,108
Okay, Bob.

203
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,661
That's wrong.

204
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,929
What?

205
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,940
You didn't bring him that way.

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,462
Oh. Yes, I did.

207
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:09,322
No, you didn't.

208
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,804
Yes, he did.

209
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:13,396
No, he didn't. You couldn't
have. There was a log there.

210
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,028
Most people's brains
prioritize details,

211
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,938
weed out what seems unimportant.

212
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:39,300
My brain doesn't.

213
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,714
Why does it matter what route
Shaun took out of the woods?

214
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,246
- The case is ab...
- It matters

215
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,040
because if that way was blocked,

216
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,941
I must have taken him this way.

217
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:51,412
I would've had to
angle the spinal board,

218
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,314
which could've caused
neurological injury,

219
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,350
which could mean my neuro exam
was off, which could mean...

220
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,632
I didn't need to
amputate his hand.

221
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,829
This seems like a
good time for a break.

222
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:27,116
Tell me about your decision to
amputate the plaintiff's hand.

223
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:32,412
His breathing became labored,
and his pulse was thready.

224
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,327
<i>He had no capillary refill.</i>

225
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,063
<i>His hand was irreversibly
damaged from lack of blood flow.</i>

226
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,467
<i>It was leaking toxins
that would stop his heart</i>

227
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,134
<i>before he reached the hospital.</i>

228
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,094
I need to amputate his hand.

229
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,898
The ambulance is
two minutes away.

230
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:51,115
<i>But ambulances do not
carry amputation kits.</i>

231
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,630
There is no time.

232
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,941
<i>Once I removed the hand...</i>

233
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,944
we traveled safely
to the hospital.

234
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,585
That's... not quite
how I remember it.

235
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:41,456
The ambulance is
two minutes away!

236
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,406
I need to amputate his hand.

237
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:45,013
There's no time.

238
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:51,066
Shaun! It could
be a vasospasm!

239
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,271
The ambulance is here!

240
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,139
They'll have a calcium
channel blocker

241
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:56,871
that might restore
the blood flow!

242
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:04,013
Shaun, are you sure?

243
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,773
Interesting.

244
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,714
This is a disaster.

245
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:22,274
He has to settle.

246
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,751
You have to talk him into
accepting the settlement.

247
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,912
No, it doesn't change
the underlying merits...

248
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:28,138
It changes the testimony.

249
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,972
It changes <i>our</i> testimony.

250
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:33,726
One of our witnesses is going to
testify that our client screwed up.

251
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:37,489
His view of the accident is almost
exactly what their expert...

252
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,981
What are you doing?

253
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,891
I'll talk to Dr. Park
and counsel him...

254
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,327
No. I mean to my books.

255
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:45,409
I straightened one. Or two.

256
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,976
Listen to me.

257
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:51,194
Taking this case to
trial, with <i>that</i> client

258
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,862
and you as counsel,
is a terrible idea.

259
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,831
<i>Fix this or bad
things will happen.</i>

260
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:58,768
You cannot win a case if
the jury doesn't like you...

261
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,670
if you make them uncomfortable.

262
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:03,236
- <i>Fix this or bad things will happen.</i>
- Cases are stories.

263
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,616
<i>Fix this or bad
things will happen.</i>

264
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,951
And we write it all.
Except the ending.

265
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,615
<i>Fix this or bad
things will happen.</i>

266
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,842
<i>Fix this or bad
things will happen.</i>

267
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,253
You can't control
yourself in my office.

268
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:19,361
How are you gonna control
yourself in court?

269
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,428
<i>Texas v. Marquez.</i>

270
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,761
What?

271
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,432
425 Federal Digest, page 734.

272
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,867
Um, you're gonna have to
give me a little more...

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,638
Owen Marquez was caught entering his
high school carrying a Swiss army knife.

274
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:38,575
He was charged with being on
school property with a weapon.

275
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,271
But they'd set up
the metal detectors

276
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:43,518
<i>outside</i> the front door.

277
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:46,283
The case was dismissed.

278
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,117
Interesting.

279
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:51,863
But different state, different
court, different law.

280
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:54,766
- Same principle.
- I don't think I can convince a judge that that is...

281
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:55,959
Let me try.

282
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:02,142
Oh, I have to go.

283
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,848
Stop. Stop. Stop.

284
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:13,477
I'm about to test the
lactate levels in Bob's hand.

285
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,045
This will prove definitively
if I was right to amputate.

286
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,332
No. This will
tell you nothing.

287
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:18,848
Medically, it will.

288
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:20,750
Legally, morally,
this'll tell you nothing.

289
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:23,129
This test will
tell me the truth.

290
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:28,254
Was... that a laugh?

291
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,447
It was a scoff.

292
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,775
Why would you
scoff at the truth?

293
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,801
What truth?

294
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,332
There's only one.

295
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,900
There's a single correct
answer to any question.

296
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,314
But there are a
lot of questions.

297
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,746
You're asking, "What was
the right thing to do then,

298
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,071
given what you know now?"

299
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,507
Which is a stupid question.

300
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,442
I don't like to use
the word "stupid."

301
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,877
"Desperate" then.
For an answer.

302
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,454
But whatever that test says,

303
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,281
we have to share it
with the other side.

304
00:16:51,415 --> 00:16:53,792
If it goes the way you want, we
will definitely win your case.

305
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,786
If it goes the other way, we
will definitely lose your case.

306
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,870
But neither result will tell
you if you did the right thing,

307
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,786
given what you knew at the time.

308
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:05,127
So the real question here is...

309
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:07,830
Do you believe in that test
more than you believe in me?

310
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Why?

311
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,119
Why am I doing what you
just asked me to do?

312
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:33,088
Why do you have so
much confidence in me?

313
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:38,928
I'm a lawyer with OCD.

314
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,182
I work out of a closet.

315
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,243
I was late to the only
meeting you had with me.

316
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,609
Why do you trust me
more than the test?

317
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:54,946
Because the test doesn't care.

318
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,860
That's a good answer.

319
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:02,606
Hm.

320
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:07,832
We're gonna have a motion to
dismiss tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

321
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:09,553
Don't be late.

322
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,539
One, two, three.

323
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:22,707
One, two, three.

324
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,845
One, two, three.

325
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,034
One, two...

326
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:29,428
We'll be okay.

327
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,806
Only if I do this right.

328
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,392
Now I have to start over.

329
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:42,802
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

330
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:44,791
Mom will be okay.

331
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,500
One, two, three.

332
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,735
<i>One, two, three.</i>

333
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,538
Joni DeGroot for the
defense, Your Honor.

334
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:55,407
Yes, I can see your name right
here on top of your brief.

335
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,017
Excellent. May I say
what a privilege it is...

336
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,687
No. No, you may not.

337
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:02,055
You are just here to
argue this motion,

338
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,751
which... is a novel argument.

339
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,320
Thank you, Your Honor.

340
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,459
It wasn't completely
a compliment.

341
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,365
Dr. Murphy cannot
be held liable

342
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,533
for professional misconduct
because Dr. Murphy

343
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,169
was not acting in a
professional capacity.

344
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:25,613
He was a Good Samaritan.

345
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,358
And you're taking the position

346
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,575
that The Good Samaritan
exception stayed in effect

347
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,577
even after the
ambulance arrived?

348
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,747
Yes, because he didn't do the
amputation <i>in</i> the ambulance.

349
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,141
He was <i>outside</i> the ambulance.

350
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,161
He <i>chose</i> not to do the
amputation in the ambulance.

351
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:39,827
To save your client's
life. He had no time.

352
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:40,961
The ambulance was right there.

353
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,962
Right there? What
does that mean?

354
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:45,532
Would it have been "right
there" if he was 10 feet away?

355
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,851
100 feet? Or a half a mile?

356
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:49,777
All interesting questions
for another case.

357
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:51,168
He was five feet away.

358
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,694
Outside is outside.

359
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:55,213
The statute specifies
protection if the care happens

360
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:56,934
<i>at</i> the scene of an emergency.

361
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,213
Counsel is using a technical
distinction that...

362
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:00,913
Counsel is using the law.

363
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:03,442
Statutory interpretation
rules require, Your Honor,

364
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:05,484
to "give effect, if
possible, to every clause

365
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:08,046
and word of a statute,
avoiding, if it may be,

366
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,558
any construction which implies
that the legislature..."

367
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:11,617
<i>Two more squeaks.</i>

368
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,620
<i>Two more squeaks.</i>

369
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:17,132
<i>Two more squeaks.
Two more squeaks.</i>

370
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,632
You just stopped?

371
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:28,534
I lost my train of thought.

372
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,245
You said you didn't think
you could win this motion...

373
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:32,289
I would've finished it.

374
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:36,275
I...

375
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,500
I heard a squeak.

376
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,652
I needed two more squeaks
to complete the set.

377
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,383
They pulled the
settlement offer.

378
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,236
And... the partners met.

379
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,864
You're off the case.

380
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,891
- They told you...
- Mm. The vote was unanimous.

381
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,729
You are a good researcher.

382
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:12,180
You are a database that thinks.

383
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:16,088
But you need to accept
that you are not,

384
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:19,313
and you are never going
to be, a good lawyer.

385
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:23,537
<i>No, no, no.</i>

386
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,431
Joni is my lawyer.

387
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,459
It is my case, my choice.

388
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:30,385
And your <i>career</i>
that's riding on this.

389
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:34,666
Joni's deficits are
more significant

390
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,368
than you think they are.

391
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,379
Everybody said that about
me. Everybody was wr...

392
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:40,087
Do you know why her
office is a closet?

393
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:43,040
Joni has had issues
since she started here.

394
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:45,744
She was late a lot.

395
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:49,223
Her first assignment, her
first motion, she missed it.

396
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:52,117
She must have had a good reason.

397
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:53,285
She saw someone drowning.

398
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:54,887
Oh.

399
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:56,321
She was on her way to court,

400
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,157
driving by the bay,
and she saw something.

401
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,392
She stopped, called the police.

402
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,528
They shut down the road,
searched the water.

403
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:04,962
Joni knew she saw...

404
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:07,956
a log, a wave... nothing.

405
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,156
But her mind wouldn't let her
accept that it was nothing.

406
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:16,045
We found out this had
happened twice before.

407
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:18,485
Why didn't you fire her?

408
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,521
Because she
threatened to sue us,

409
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,714
arguing that firing her
would be a violation

410
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:25,551
of the American's
With Disabilities Act.

411
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,861
- Was it?
- I'm not sure. I don't think so.

412
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:30,212
But this brief that she wrote...

413
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,500
most impressive
thing I've ever read.

414
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:36,728
So she doesn't need an office,

415
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:41,366
because she doesn't need to meet with
clients because she does research.

416
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,699
Just research.

417
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,692
She cannot be your
trial attorney.

418
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,946
- I hate her.
- I don't.

419
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:56,114
She stuffed you in a
closet. Set you up to fail.

420
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:57,382
You know she's done more.

421
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:58,917
She hired me. She saved...

422
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,385
She sent you to
court on your own.

423
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,733
What was she expecting?

424
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,791
She expected me to
do the job. So did I.

425
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:06,733
She could've been there...

426
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:10,327
It was my idea, my
argument, my case...

427
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:12,946
my failure.

428
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:35,721
Why do you want to be a lawyer?

429
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:47,671
Why did you threaten to sue?

430
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:50,538
Why do you want to be there?

431
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:53,039
They're a very good firm...

432
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:56,010
I-interesting files,
important cases,

433
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,136
and it's not like I
have huge options...

434
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:00,281
No. I meant...

435
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,869
why do you want to be a lawyer?

436
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,752
A lawyer saved our family.

437
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:14,862
Our father died in a car
accident when I was 8.

438
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,398
That's when my OCD started.

439
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:19,175
I was very worried that
my mother would die, too.

440
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:22,571
So you developed rituals
meant to prevent it?

441
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:23,730
Mm.

442
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,674
And she didn't die.

443
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:29,033
But she did drink.

444
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:33,881
Bad things happened.

445
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,518
A lot of people made
a lot of mistakes...

446
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:42,856
Our mother, some
overworked social workers,

447
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,023
some foster parents, a judge.

448
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:54,005
But one person made
it all right again...

449
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:56,427
A lawyer.

450
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,545
Joni...

451
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,449
I still want you as my lawyer.

452
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:11,552
Dr. Murphy, I made
a huge mistake.

453
00:25:13,354 --> 00:25:15,255
Because...

454
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,907
I have a problem.

455
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:20,089
We all have problems.

456
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:24,891
I'll talk to Janet.

457
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,275
Dr. Murphy wants you as first
chair. So you're first chair.

458
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,753
- I'm first chair?
- You are not first chair.

459
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,187
I'm not first chair.

460
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:39,813
You are a figurehead.

461
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,791
You will sit in your first chair
and you will not say a word.

462
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:43,959
You will not stand up.
You will not object.

463
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:46,061
If you have to tap,
you will tap quietly...

464
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,988
on your leg.

465
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:49,293
Now wish me luck.

466
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,159
Good luck.

467
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,638
In your expert opinion,
when Dr. Murphy

468
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:55,929
concluded that my client's hand

469
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,807
was irreversibly damaged and
needed to be amputated...

470
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:00,334
He was wrong.

471
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,044
The lack of blood
flow was caused

472
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:04,605
by a temporary condition
known as vasospasm,

473
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:07,741
which can occur after a
trauma such as a car accident.

474
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:11,945
Vessels temporarily clamp down,
cutting off the flow of blood.

475
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,565
In this case, Mr. Patton's
ulnar artery spasmed.

476
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,058
And this condition is treatable?

477
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,586
Yes... with an injection
of calcium channel blocker,

478
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,356
which was available in
the ambulance that night.

479
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,149
Hm.

480
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,692
Thank you.

481
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,290
Your witness.

482
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,828
Any last minute ideas?

483
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,831
Anything we can challenge
him on medically?

484
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,353
It wasn't vasospasm.

485
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,111
Anything we could prove?

486
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,137
No.

487
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,876
Dr. Rutenberg,
are you being paid

488
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,746
- by the Plaintiff's attorney for your testimony today?
- I am.

489
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:48,391
Then you can hardly consider
yourself unbiased, can you?

490
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,959
It's routine for
experts to be paid.

491
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,285
You're being paid.

492
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:53,154
And I admit, I am biased...

493
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:54,655
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

494
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:59,359
Traumatic vasospasm doesn't
occur in isolated vessels,

495
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,537
but rather the entire
affected limb, right?

496
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:02,830
Yes, of course.

497
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,274
Can you visually identify

498
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,803
a damaged or occluded vessel
versus one in vasospasm?

499
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:09,029
Yes.

500
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,671
So...

501
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,378
this one?

502
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,414
Occluded.

503
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:21,749
Vasospasm.

504
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,585
Vasospasm.

505
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,454
Occluded.

506
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:28,969
Not vasospasm?

507
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,625
- No.
- Objection, Your Honor.

508
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,093
Is this testimony or the MCAT?

509
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:34,862
Goes to the witness' expertise.

510
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:36,697
Oh, he's definitely an expert.

511
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,396
That last photo, which
did not show vasospasm,

512
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:44,805
that was a pathology image of
Mr. Patton's radial artery.

513
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,750
And if his radial
artery didn't vasospasm,

514
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:48,418
then according to
your expert testimony,

515
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:49,486
his ulnar artery didn't either.

516
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,911
Is that correct?

517
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,521
It's possible.

518
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:58,331
But we'd only know for sure if Dr. Murphy
had given the calcium channel blocker.

519
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:12,474
- I'm sorry.
- You're not great at taking direction, are you?

520
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,208
- No, I shouldn't...
- And you only still have a job

521
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:16,693
- because you threatened to sue us.
- I'm sorry!

522
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,283
I'm not wanted in
a lot of places.

523
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:22,710
I make people feel
uncomfortable.

524
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,172
If I let that stop me,
I wouldn't be anywhere.

525
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,202
At my first job, I was
the only female associate.

526
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,703
Tomorrow...

527
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:36,476
you're first chair.

528
00:28:37,158 --> 00:28:39,092
Actual first chair.

529
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,497
Good luck.

530
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:52,527
Nice work. This is good stuff.

531
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:55,978
- Thank you.
- The carpal tunnel research is really interesting.

532
00:28:56,112 --> 00:28:57,968
A pre-existing condition
mitigates our client's respon...

533
00:28:57,992 --> 00:28:59,413
I'm not gonna use that.

534
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,660
It could help reduce damages.

535
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:05,588
If damages are even $1, it
means Dr. Murphy was negligent,

536
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:07,532
which means his medical
license would be at risk.

537
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:09,626
We need total victory.

538
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:11,760
Okay. So what's
your theory on this?

539
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,088
How are you going to
approach this witness?

540
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,215
I'm going to establish
that he's a dick.

541
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,256
I can't do my job.

542
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:25,890
I can't even hold my niece.

543
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:32,681
Thank you.

544
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,718
No more questions, Your Honor.

545
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:48,998
Dr. Murphy saved your life.

546
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,866
Is that a question?

547
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,534
Not really. Seems
pretty obvious.

548
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,870
- I meant...
- I know what you meant. I'll rephrase.

549
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:58,073
What kind of person sues a
person who saved their life?

550
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,943
Do you sue people who buy
you Christmas presents

551
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:02,355
you don't want, or
only the weird ones

552
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:03,779
you figure the jury won't like?

553
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,116
Objection... compound
and argumentative.

554
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,716
Sustained.

555
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,386
I'm the victim here.

556
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,019
You were driving, right?

557
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:13,385
- Yes.
- Over the speed limit?

558
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:15,364
I'm not sure.

559
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:17,824
According to police analysis
of your skid marks...

560
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:22,031
- Yes. A little.
- You were going at least 70 in 40 zone.

561
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,566
- You were ejected out the car window?
- Yes.

562
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:25,951
So you weren't
wearing a seat belt?

563
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:28,405
- I'm not sure.
- It was fastened behind you.

564
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:30,514
Yes.

565
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,830
So all things considered,

566
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:35,789
maybe a better adjective than
"victim" would be "lucky".

567
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:37,446
Withdrawn.

568
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,949
Do you feel any guilt
over any of this?

569
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:42,252
You're asking me
if I feel guilty

570
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:44,696
- about wanting to be compensated for losing...
- No.

571
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,622
I am asking you
if you feel guilty

572
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:49,033
about driving recklessly,
flipping your car,

573
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:50,338
and almost killing
your sister...

574
00:30:50,793 --> 00:30:52,262
the mother of your niece?

575
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,505
Yeah, a little.

576
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:57,752
Is she suing you f...

577
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,996
<i>Two more squeaks.</i>

578
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:03,198
<i>Two more squeaks.</i>

579
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,761
<i>Two more squeaks.
Two more squeaks.</i>

580
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,885
Counsel, do we have a problem?

581
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:18,514
Again?

582
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:27,171
Uh, one moment.

583
00:31:30,396 --> 00:31:32,345
Don't win cheap. You're
better than this...

584
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:33,902
I am fighting for my client.

585
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,938
If she can't handle
a little adversity,

586
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,568
then she shouldn't be here.

587
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:45,159
Don't let that dick prove
people like me right.

588
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:54,357
Hey, hey, hey.

589
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,271
Miss Stewart, I will
hold you in contempt.

590
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,301
If Dr. Murphy had
been a not nice person

591
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:07,761
and just driven
on, you'd be dead.

592
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:09,527
And his career wouldn't
hang in the balance.

593
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,553
Uh, objection.

594
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,233
- Calls for speculation.
- Not a lot.

595
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:13,471
The objection is sustained.

596
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,820
Miss Stewart, I am
finding you in contempt.

597
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:19,090
That stunt just cost you $5,000.

598
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:20,624
You're lucky it's not assault.

599
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:23,508
Now, Miss DeGroot...

600
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,373
you may continue.

601
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:31,127
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

602
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:33,440
Mr. Patton, the night
of the accident...

603
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,636
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

604
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:41,421
- I know that it happened again...
- Shut up.

605
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:43,038
You're doing fantastic.

606
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:44,807
But you still have
Murphy's testimony.

607
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,309
We need the jury to like him.

608
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,702
They need to think
he did nothing wrong.

609
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:51,113
Have you given thought to
how you're gonna do that?

610
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,916
Yes. I have.

611
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:58,054
Did you do anything wrong at
the scene of the accident?

612
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,543
Objection. Leading.

613
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:00,568
Yes.

614
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,024
Withdrawn.

615
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:11,234
I did four things wrong.

616
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,802
I applied the tourniquet
at the brachial artery

617
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,495
instead of mid-forearm.

618
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:18,374
I laid out the clamps <i>after</i>
the makeshift vascular clips.

619
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,543
I only did two wipe downs
of the surgical field,

620
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:22,945
and I angled the spinal
board as I moved Mr. Patton

621
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:25,948
out of the woods because
a log was in the way.

622
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:28,218
Were any of those
mistakes relevant?

623
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,855
They were to me.

624
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:34,756
But I don't believe they
affected the patient's outcome.

625
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,917
Given where you sit
today, right now,

626
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:42,579
do you think one of the things that you
and Dr. Park did wrong... was stopping?

627
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:45,602
No. Then Mr. Patton
would be dead.

628
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,350
And the amputation, was
that the right thing to do?

629
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,910
I don't know.

630
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:58,406
But I know that if I had
to do it all over again...

631
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,385
I would stop,

632
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,024
I would help,

633
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:07,456
and I would amputate.

634
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:12,248
Dr. Murphy, you're different.

635
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,062
Tell me about yourself.

636
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,310
Objection. Vague
and irrelevant.

637
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:22,382
Your challenges, the
obstacles you've overcome...

638
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,616
Marginally less vague,
still completely irrelevant.

639
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,830
And yet, I will allow.

640
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,867
I have autism spectrum disorder.

641
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:42,024
I have always had autism
spectrum disorder.

642
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:48,464
I have also always
wanted to be a doctor.

643
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:51,401
Many people thought that
couldn't happen, but I saved...

644
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
Hi.

645
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:08,644
I think I'm better at asking
questions than giving speeches.

646
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,388
Closings are tricky.

647
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:13,258
It helps to actually
say the words,

648
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:14,771
not just mutter them.

649
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:16,027
Can I say them now?

650
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,965
You want my feedback?

651
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:26,010
If I don't like it, I'm going to tell
you, bluntly. You know that, right?

652
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,665
'Cause you've been so
tactful with me up till now?

653
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:45,198
My mentor told me that
criminal law is about justice,

654
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:50,528
whereas civil law is about one
thing and one thing only...

655
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,030
Money.

656
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,733
You can't undo what's been done.

657
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,985
The best you can do is
compensate, financially.

658
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:02,940
But that's wrong.

659
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:06,648
Everything we do in this
room is about justice.

660
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,667
We can't change what's happened,

661
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:15,132
but maybe, just maybe, we
can change what will happen.

662
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:19,296
We can encourage people to care,
to care about strangers, to care...

663
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,692
That's not your closing.

664
00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:23,093
- It's a good closing.
- It's a very good closing.

665
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:25,705
It was your closing.
A long time ago.

666
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,366
My mentor said that to me.

667
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:30,009
I developed it into
an effective clos...

668
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,407
Did you believe it?

669
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:36,254
About justice? That we
can change the future?

670
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:38,343
I did.

671
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:41,217
But not anymore?

672
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:49,863
Maybe if <i>my</i> mentor
gave me advice,

673
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:52,671
I could turn it into
something effective.

674
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:55,433
You consider me a mentor?

675
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,734
You did inspire me.

676
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:06,914
I will give you one
piece of advice.

677
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,508
You're not me.

678
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,599
Not once in this
trial have you done

679
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:17,268
what I would've done.

680
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,532
Or what I wanted you to do.

681
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,200
So far, it's worked.

682
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,671
I see no reason to change now.

683
00:37:42,945 --> 00:37:44,409
My mentor told me...

684
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,013
My mentor told me...

685
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,712
My mentor told me...

686
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:55,058
that people don't like me.

687
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:59,055
That I make them uncomfortable.

688
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:00,425
She's right.

689
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:04,606
And people don't like
my client either.

690
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:08,999
We're different.

691
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,570
But we're all different.

692
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,261
You... You've worn purple
every day of this trial.

693
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:18,422
I assume because you love it.

694
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:21,379
And 'cause you want
it to be your "thing."

695
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:23,815
You've got those mutton chops.

696
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,650
They're great. They're fun.

697
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:28,445
They make you... you.

698
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,631
But when we start to get judged
based on our differences,

699
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:32,099
it's not fun anymore.

700
00:38:33,636 --> 00:38:36,026
And fair enough,
this is a courtroom.

701
00:38:36,051 --> 00:38:39,878
You are literally here
to judge my client.

702
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:44,042
But please don't judge him
based on the way that he talks,

703
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:46,885
or on how he
doesn't look at you,

704
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:49,482
or on his awkward mannerisms.

705
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:51,297
Judge him...

706
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:53,010
on who he is.

707
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,483
At every moment of his life, he
has tried to make a difference,

708
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,239
tried to make things
a little better.

709
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:02,980
Please don't punish
him for that.

710
00:39:06,149 --> 00:39:07,852
Please...

711
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:10,498

should've done.

She was brilliant.

00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:18,912
I think you need to seriously
consider picking a new favorite child.
