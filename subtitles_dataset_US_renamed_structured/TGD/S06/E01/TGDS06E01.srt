Previously on "The
Good Doctor..."

2
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:13,330
Shaun Robert Murphy,

3
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:14,831
do you take Lea
Abigail Dilallo...

4
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:16,500
I do.

5
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:18,668
To Shaun and Lea!

6
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,537
How'd the interview go?

7
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:21,772
I want the job.

8
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,807
I understand.

9
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,976
Your father's
prognosis was wrong.

10
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,189
He only has a few weeks to live.

11
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:28,545
I love you, son.

12
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:30,281
Goodbye, Dad.

13
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,150
- Dalisay?
- My...

14
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:36,721
Aah!

15
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:52,069
Shaun.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,983
Look at me. Hey.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Look at me!

18
00:00:58,105 --> 00:00:59,738
Shaun, it's okay. I'm here.

19
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:01,003
Look at me.

20
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:07,942
_

21
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,167
I feel... married.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,593
Do you feel married?

23
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:14,897
What does married feel like?

24
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:18,864
I don't know.

25
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:20,898
Different?

26
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:22,274
Amazing?

27
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:25,210
More to-have-and-to-hold-y?

28
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:28,538
I feel like...

29
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:31,308
I love you more than I
have ever loved anybody.

30
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,118
And I'm very happy.

31
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,645
So, the same as before.

32
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:40,334
Me, too.

33
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,371
Dalisay?

34
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:22,692
Oh!

35
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:25,194
Ooh.

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,939
Dalisay?

37
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,823
- Hey.
- I'm hurt.

38
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:55,657
- I'm stabbed.
- I'm sorry.

39
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,137
I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

40
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,494
In the break room.

41
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,529
Ah!

42
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,369
Lim?

43
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,067
Lim?

44
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:18,646
Your call has been
forwarded to an automa...

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,850
You're bleeding.

46
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,153
What?

47
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,315
Your neck.

48
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,493
I was putting a psych patient
in physical restraints.

49
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,561
It got rough. Thanks
for the heads up.

50
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,329
Where's your badge?

51
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,249
Must've fallen off
when he grabbed me.

52
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,342
Glad you're okay.

53
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:25,582
Code Silver! We're in lockdown!

Code Silver in lobby

59
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,887
Get him to trauma bay two.

60
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:54,385
I recognized the guy
who attacked him.

61
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,609
He's Villanueva's ex-boyfriend.

62
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,821
She's not answering her phone.

63
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,814
He got on on the
fifth floor, right?

64
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,813
Yeah.

65
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,593
That's where Lim was
heading to, the break room.

66
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:04,584
We gotta get trauma bags.

67
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,623
The shooter is still loose.
We're supposed to st...

68
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,209
I'm coming with you.

69
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:12,657
Last time,

70
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:14,004
it was just a guy
with a box cutter.

71
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:15,493
No one was hurt.

72
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,166
Hey. Where are you?

73
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,723
I'm out front. Are you okay?

74
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,558
You bailed on me?

75
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,505
I wasn't in the best mood.

76
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,937
You said you understood.

77
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,481
Doesn't mean I'm happy about it.

78
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,812
Oh, my God.

79
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,861
Jerome says there's
an active shooter.

80
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:38,650
Lim and Villanueva
might be hurt.

81
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:41,687
I gotta go.

82
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:48,293
Dr. Glassman says Dr. Lim and
Nurse Villanueva may be hurt.

83
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:50,462
- On the fifth floor.
- Lim went to the break room.

84
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:51,796
I told her we needed glasses.

85
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:55,366
Okay. Okay. I need
to get down there.

86
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,215
Shaun, you can't. We
just have to stay here.

87
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,116
Shaun, you cannot go down there.

88
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,806
Dr. Lim may need my help.

89
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:02,718
Then I'm going, too.

90
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,575
No. You're not a doctor.

91
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,977
They don't need you.

92
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,476
I will see you soon.

93
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,151
I'm a doctor, too.

94
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:14,858
Well, I'm not
staying here alone.

95
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:20,825
Hello? Is anyone
here? I'm really sick.

96
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,260
I don't know. Could
be the shooter.

97
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:24,528
Or a sick guy,

98
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:26,097
seeing as we're in a hospital.

99
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,199
Hello?

100
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,707
Shh, shh.

101
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:38,442
I was waiting in the ER.

102
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,577
I tried to make my way to
the pharmacy for antacids.

103
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,413
I'm Dr. Reznick.
This is Dr. Wolke.

104
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:43,747
Ezra.

105
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:44,826
How bad is your stomach pain?

106
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,016
I have Crohn's disease.

107
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:48,183
The last time this
happened, I needed surgery.

108
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,166
We should get out
of the hallway.

109
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,479
It's not safe.

110
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,725
Ready? One, two, three.

111
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,092
Thank you.

112
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,366
Oh, my God.

113
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,504
Lea, look in the cabinets

114
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,500
for scalpels, sutures,
gauze, syringes, needles.

115
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,648
Large neck wound, anterior
triangle, maybe more,

116
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,616
defensive wrist lac with
possible radial artery injury.

117
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,820
At least two deep thoracoabdominal
penetrating wounds.

118
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,155
She's lost a lot of blood.

119
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:26,862
Use this.

120
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:31,017
Weak and thready carotid pulse.

121
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:34,930
Tourniquet's on forearm.

122
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,256
- I found the gauze.
- Muffled heart sounds.

123
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,801
She has a cardiac tamponade.

124
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:39,780
Did you find needles?

125
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,171
Yeah. Yeah. And the syringes.

126
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,907
Put firm pressure on Dr. Lim's
wounds with the gauze.

127
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,615
Add more when they're saturated.

128
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,812
Two stretchers, now.

129
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:51,888
Backboards, blood, and
saline, if you can find them.

130
00:07:58,523 --> 00:07:59,523
Mm.

131
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I'll get the door.

132
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:05,794
What now?

133
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,196
We stay quiet and we wait

134
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:08,722
for them to lift the lockdown.

135
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:18,440
Distant heart sounds.

136
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,875
- Is she dying?
- Yes.

137
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:22,944
Her blood's being choked
off by blood buildup.

138
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:26,148
Okay. Palpating the
xiphoid process.

139
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:27,699
Point to the left shoulder.

140
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,412
I'm in.

141
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,964
Jugular distention

142
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,716
and tachycardia improving.

143
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:48,069
Let's get them to the OR.

144
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,508
Dr. Andrews.

145
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:12,675
Who's on the floor?

146
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,176
Me and a couple
anesthesiologists.

147
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,305
That's it?

148
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,024
How we doing on
blood and supplies?

149
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:18,547
Low on all.

150
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,984
We had three transplants
and two GSWs today.

151
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,886
You're on one with Lim.

152
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,989
Jerome, you're with
Villanueva in two.

153
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,190
Cop's on the line.

154
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,558
This is Dr. Andrews.

155
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:30,693
This is Captain Holland.

156
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,061
We're taking
operational control.

157
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,162
Understood.

158
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,475
Already diverted
incoming ambulances.

159
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:35,598
Copy that.

160
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:37,645
Is there... Is there
anything I can do?

161
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:40,103
You can be our
circulating nurse.

162
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:44,774
I, I meant more like get
people coffee, but, um...

163
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,164
Okay, yeah, what do I do?

164
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,721
Find the supplies we ask for

165
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:50,480
and hand them to the surgical
field, like you did just now.

166
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:51,615
Okay.

167
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,127
Shaun, start with the abdomen.

168
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,769
Sternum saw.

169
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,193
Cooley retractor.

170
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,861
Lacerations to the
pulmonary hilum.

171
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:29,380
Left ventricle is nicked.

172
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,098
That's what caused
the tamponade.

173
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,615
It's not very wide, though.

174
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,807
Pledgeted prolene
sutures, please.

175
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:40,466
She has a grade four
liver laceration

176
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,625
with active bleeding
into the peritoneum.

177
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:44,960
Lea, d-do you know
what a lap sponge is?

178
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:48,383
It's like a hand towel
with two blue handles.

179
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,374
- How many do you need?
- As many as you can find.

180
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,986
There's a third
drawer down there.

181
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,701
Safest bet is to remove
the damaged lobe.

182
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:01,704
That's half her liver.

183
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:05,224
We can do an
angio-embolization instead.

184
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:08,150
If that goes south, she'd
need a major transfusion.

185
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,742
That can't happen.
We're in a lockdown.

186
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,100
A hemi-hepatectomy
would decrease

187
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,092
her life expectancy
by ten years.

188
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,250
Life expectancy, Shaun?

189
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,608
She has 20 minutes, maybe,

190
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,900
unless we can stop
his hemorrhage.

191
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,891
You are being shortsighted.

192
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,049
I'm very shortsighted. I
want to keep her alive.

193
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,776
Dr. Glassman?

194
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:26,268
Dr. Andrews needs your
help with Villanueva.

195
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:27,814
Ventricle is sewn up.

196
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,286
Shaun, you are going to cut out the
damaged lobe, do you understand?

197
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,274
Yes.

198
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:35,874
Okay.

199
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:43,648
Full thickness tracheal
laceration with sub-q emphysema

200
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,839
and a nick in her jugular
below the facial branch.

201
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,530
And the left
carotid is shredded.

202
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:49,227
We're gonna have to
patch that up first.

203
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,685
I'm thinking closed stent.

204
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,277
If we have to anti-coagulate
her, she'll bleed out.

205
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,458
We got to stop the flow,
tie off the artery upstream.

206
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:57,764
She's unconscious.

207
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,920
There's no way to test
the collateral circulation

208
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,712
to see if there's enough
to perfuse her brain.

209
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:03,435
She's young. I'm willing
to take that bet.

210
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,094
You're willing to
risk a massive stroke?

211
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,520
As opposed to letting
her bleed to death? Yeah.

212
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,525
Vascular clamp and a silk tie.

213
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:14,577
Oh!

214
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,677
No, no, please, please. Ow!

215
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,203
Tender with guarding
and rigidity.

216
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:25,371
His bowel's perforated.

217
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:29,125
Okay, well...

218
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:31,502
I'll look for supplies in case
we need to operate in here.

219
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,838
Just lock the door behind me.

220
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,059
Dr. Murphy?

221
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:53,351
The bleeding is confined
to an aberrant vessel.

222
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,785
We do not need to
take half her liver.

223
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,996
We can do the
angio-embolization safely.

224
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,799
But you told Dr. Glassman you were
gonna do the hemi-hepatectomy.

225
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,359
Parameters have changed.

226
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,179
The angio-embolization
is the proper choice.

227
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:07,804
Should someone let
Dr. Glassman know?

228
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,445
Inform him if you like.

229
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,404
I need to proceed to avoid
further hemorrhaging.

230
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,919
Argon beam coagulator.

231
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:34,877
Morgan?

232
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,069
Stay where you are.

233
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,936
Don't move.

234
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,544
- What's going on?
- Shh!

235
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:00,758
What's the tray for?

236
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,346
Where were you going?

237
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,223
I'm sorry. I just...

238
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,986
There's a kid in there
with a perforated bowel.

239
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,772
If we don't do surgery,
he's going to die.

240
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,520
Shaun, did you change
the surgical plan?

241
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:10,121
The parameters it
was based on changed.

242
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,980
I adjusted accordingly.

243
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,138
And ignored my instructions

244
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:16,000
in favor of what
you wanted to do?

245
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,363
Yes.

246
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,054
Why didn't you ask me?
Why didn't anybody ask me?

247
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,612
It seemed like a
reasonable call.

248
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:25,903
That's not your call to make.

249
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,553
Nor is it yours.

250
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,275
How far into this are we?

251
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,210
I located the site of
contrast extravasation

252
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,446
and the catheter is in position.

253
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:36,548
Well, that's just great.

254
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,450
We're locked in. Gimme a coil.

255
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,921
There was a skyway,
bridge-type thing.

256
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:45,756
I went there for a smoke once.

257
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,615
Not that far off the ground.

258
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:50,595
What are you gonna do?
Jump? It would kill you.

259
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,130
- Where is it?
- I-I-It's two floors down.

260
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:54,966
All the stairs and
elevators are locked off.

261
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,767
There's really... There's
no way out of here.

262
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,170
No!

263
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:01,672
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

264
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:05,610
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

265
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,247
Open the door! Open
up! I have a gun.

266
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm gonna shoot this doctor in the
head if you don't open the door!

267
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:13,317
Morgan, don't!

268
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,593
I have three hostages!

269
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,528
You stay back or
I start shooting!

270
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,634
One area of
extravasation remaining.

271
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,769
Deploying my coil.

272
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:40,610
Heart rate 168.

273
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:42,012
Big drop in BP.

274
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,088
Coils are fine.
Where's the bleeding?

275
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:47,651
Large collateral
vessel must be damaged.

276
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:49,786
We can inject gel foam particles

277
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,095
for distal embolization.

278
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,523
BP's critical.

279
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,026
- I'm gonna pivot back.
- I'm almost there.

280
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:58,627
We're going to resect the liver.

281
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:00,206
Don't touch her. I am
injecting contrast...

282
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,959
I am removing the
packing, Shaun.

283
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:05,233
No. I see how to stop the
bleed. Injecting particles.

284
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:18,539
Complete embolization
with no residual bleeding.

285
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,151
BP's rising.

286
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:30,825
Okay.

287
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,012
Let's close her up.

288
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,998
It was a reasonable call.

289
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,070
Nice work with
the needle driver.

290
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,606
Thanks.

291
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:56,785
Jerome.

292
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,188
There's a hostage standoff
on the fifth floor.

293
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,464
Everyone's fine.

294
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:05,177
But it's Dr. Reznick and Asher.

295
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:12,767
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:17,974
Let's finish this.

297
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,453
You guys stay back or you
won't like what happens.

298
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:38,959
How is she?

299
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,915
- Who?
- Dalisay.

300
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,878
Now you're concerned
for her well-being?

301
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,840
I love her.

302
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:55,819
Ezra?

303
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:57,276
Ezra.

304
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,348
He needs surgery or he'll die.

305
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:03,561
Do it in here.

306
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:12,623
I need to make a call.

307
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:16,020
Do you have a ten-blade?

308
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,700
No, just a fifteen.

309
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:21,253
Okay. How many GIA staplers?

310
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:25,916
None, but we can
hand-sew or anastomosis.

311
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:29,420
As long as he doesn't have
a history of bowel surgery.

312
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:32,750
He does.

313
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:40,090
I love you.

314
00:20:45,764 --> 00:20:48,439
If we open him up
here, we'll kill him.

315
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:54,904
I spoke to the OR earlier.

316
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,573
Your ex, Lim, that guard,

317
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:00,143
they're all expected to
make full recoveries.

318
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:03,454
So, right now, all they have
you on is attempted murder.

319
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:05,873
But if this kid dies...

320
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,461
You... You didn't
talk to the OR.

321
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:11,956
I did.

322
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,226
You, take him out of here.
You're staying with me.

323
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,519
I have blood on my sleeve.

324
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:46,995
You okay?

325
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:50,042
It's not my blood.

326
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:53,694
Okay. I just...

327
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,719
I don't know. I was
concerned about you.

328
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,598
You shouldn't be.

329
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:00,761
I made the right call,
and Dr. Lim's recovering.

330
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:03,889
Dr. Lim's waking up.

331
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,308
I have to go.

332
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,395
Oh. I'm here if you need me.

333
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,846
Thank you. I don't.

334
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:36,964
My dad beat up my mom.

335
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,677
Put her in the hospital
a couple times.

336
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,472
I hated his guts.

337
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:53,439
Spent my childhood saying I'd...
I'd be different than him.

338
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,361
My dad's dying.

339
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,117
He has a couple weeks...

340
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,787
at most.

341
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,837
Cancer.

342
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:15,377
I just put him on a
plane back to New York.

343
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,090
What went wrong between us...

344
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:25,971
will never get fixed.

345
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,018
We're out of time.

346
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,429
There's still time for you.

347
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:49,774
It's okay.

348
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:02,153
Yeah, she's recovering.

349
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,956
She had trauma to her
carotid, trachea, and jugular,

350
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:06,470
but we were able
to repair it all.

351
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:10,867
You had pulmonary
hilum injuries,

352
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,249
a nicked ventricle,

353
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:15,020
a grade four liver laceration.

354
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,399
It was a tough call,
but Dr. Murphy here

355
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,838
opted for an angio-embolization

356
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:24,071
and managed to preserve
your entire liver.

357
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:33,789
You're welcome.

358
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,786
A security guard was stabbed,

359
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,752
but he's expected to
make a full recovery.

360
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:41,958
Oh.

361
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:43,625
- Abdominal pain?
- Oh!

362
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:45,661
- Right upper quadrant?
- Mm.

363
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,629
Higher?

364
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:51,200
Her heart.

365
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:58,522
Well, you'll serve
your sentence,

366
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,941
make amends, and then...

367
00:25:02,113 --> 00:25:03,527
and then start again.

368
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,323
There's only two
ways out of this.

369
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,885
You either turn yourself in,

370
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:11,076
or you die.

371
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,375
Thank you.

372
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,994
Is Dalisay really still alive?

373
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:10,010
I have no idea.

374
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:38,104
Drop the gun!

375
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:53,819
There.

376
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:57,123
A traumatic VSD in the
inferior portion of the septum.

377
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,057
The cut went deeper
than we thought.

378
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:01,560
The defect can be repaired
with a GORE-TEX patch.

379
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,496
I need help.

380
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:13,138
SWAT got him. Multiple
GSWs to the arm and chest.

381
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,240
Was in PEA, but we got
him back. BP 60 over palp.

382
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:16,475
Dr. Glassman!

383
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,079
Ash. You okay?

384
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:23,848
OR two, set up for bypass with
whatever O-Neg we have left.

385
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,351
Aaron, you handle
this with Dr. Wolke.

386
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,320
- Shaun, we'll fix Lim's heart.
- Okay.

387
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,856
Wait. Does Lim need bypass, too?

388
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:34,336
We've only got enough tubing and
cannulas to operate one machine.

389
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,430
Resupply doesn't come
in until 5:00 a.m.

390
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:43,800
Are we pretending
that there's a debate?

391
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,482
We're not risking Lim's
life for this man.

392
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:53,342
We do have another option.

393
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,992
We can repair Lim's heart with an
occluder device. She won't need bypass.

394
00:27:57,016 --> 00:27:59,316
No. No. That is a terrible idea.

395
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:01,152
Percutaneous closure
is too risky.

396
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:04,188
Open heart surgery is the optimal
procedure for traumatic VSD.

397
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:08,170
I, I know, but he will
die without bypass.

398
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,427
Lim's surgery will just be
harder without it, but doable.

399
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:12,841
Do you agree?

400
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:18,514
I agree with Dr. Andrews.

401
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:22,337
No. This is not fair.

402
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,139
Dr. Lim didn't hurt
anyone. He did.

403
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,475
And now we need to help her.

404
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,273
She needs the bypass machine.

405
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,610
I've made my decision.

406
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:46,125
I've deployed the
occluder device.

407
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,420
Slipped through.

408
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:52,214
Placing again.

409
00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:56,271
Looks good on the frontal.

410
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:59,555
No. Still not seating. We
should have used bypass.

411
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,432
Repositioning.

412
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,508
Cardiac output's dropping.

413
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:13,735
- She's in fulminant heart failure.
- No. No.

414
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:17,604
- Murphy.
- No.

415
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,963
- Shaun.
- I-I can't.

416
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:21,087
No!

417
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,023
I can't. I said it wouldn't...

418
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,290
Shaun, it's okay.

419
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:26,159
No, it's not. It's not okay.

420
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,261
No!

421
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:30,913
- No, it's not okay.
- Lea, get him out of here.

422
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:33,598
- Shaun, let's go on a break.
- No, it is not okay!

423
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,268
- I-I can't leave!
- Take a break.

424
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:37,015
- Jerome, get him out of here, now.
- I-I will not leave!

425
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,604
- And get Glassman.
- I have to... to...

426
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,317
- Dr. Murphy, let's go. Come on.
- No, no, don't touch me!

427
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:42,041
- Let's go.
- Shaun! Shaun!

428
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:45,434
No, don't touch me! Don't touch
me, okay? Don't... Don't touch me!

429
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,426
Don't touch me,
okay? Don't touch me!

430
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:53,966
Okay.

431
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:54,991
No.

432
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:01,326
Okay.

433
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,897
Okay. Okay. Okay.

434
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:06,205
Hey. You know what?

435
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,429
No!

436
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,032
Shaun.

437
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:28,769
I'm here.

438
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,439
Shaun, can you...

439
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,691
can you look at me?

440
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,396
Shaun?

441
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:39,765
Shaun?

442
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:43,408
Shaun?

443
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:46,495
Dr. Glassman, please.

444
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:48,607
Shaun?

445
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,102
Dr. Glassman, please,
we need you in there.

446
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:53,227
If they're placing a device,
they need Shaun, not me.

447
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:56,614
Shaun?

448
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:58,382
Shaun, please.

449
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:00,717
Look at me.

450
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,787
Shaun? Shaun?

451
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:05,013
Shaun?

452
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:06,691
Shaun.

453
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,480
It's a hell of a
wedding day, Shaun.

454
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:20,529
I couldn't save you.

455
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:23,490
You were a kid.

456
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:28,745
You died because of me.

457
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,959
I was walking backwards
on top of a train.

458
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:41,216
You only left home
because of me.

459
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:45,895
Shaun?

460
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,222
Shaun?

461
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:50,892
I gotta go.

462
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:55,304
Maybe we should show
him the surgery?

463
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:57,005
You said they needed Shaun.

464
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,901
Video-call me from the inside
and we'll show him the problem.

465
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:02,912
Okay.

466
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:10,925
Maybe there's not
enough uninjured tissue.

467
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:11,920
It's not that.

468
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:14,490
SVT. Push adenosine.

469
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:16,043
Shaun?

470
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,869
Shaun, I'm gonna show you
the front and lateral views.

471
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,472
Can you see why the
device isn't seating?

472
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:28,217
Shaun?

473
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:30,891
Please focus.

474
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:33,087
You're right.

475
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,146
I left home 'cause I
wanted to protect you.

476
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:41,068
My big brother who I loved.

477
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,393
Nothing could've changed that.

478
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,908
Nothing could've changed
where I was that day.

479
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,289
None of it is your fault.

480
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,940
You remember what I said to you

481
00:32:57,967 --> 00:32:59,367
when I gave you
the scalpel, right?

482
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,465
Never forget. You
can do anything.

483
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:09,429
You can do this. You
can save your friend.

484
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:17,104
You just need to look.

485
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,149
Okay.

486
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,059
Shaun?

487
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,285
Shaun, can you see that?

488
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,054
I know what to do.

489
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,062
- We need more pressors.
- We're maxed out.

490
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,401
There's a second VSD.

491
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,502
We would have seen it.

492
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:06,703
Here.

493
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,639
We assumed it was
ventricular turbulence.

494
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,116
It's oblong.

495
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:15,545
Deploy a second device
and angle it posteriorly.

496
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,486
Loading device.

497
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:33,847
Angling.

498
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:51,323
It's holding.

499
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:05,337
Thank you, Shaun.

500
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:23,445
Code Silver, all clear.

501
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,116
Code Silver, all clear.

502
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,985
I love you, too.

503
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:44,191
Hi.

504
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,160
Hello. I have to wait
for Dr. Lim to wake up.

505
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:49,962
You should go home and sleep.

506
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:55,408
I'm not spending my wedding
night across town from you.

507
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:57,324
I'll take a nap in
the residents' lounge.

508
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:02,621
I saw Steve earlier.

509
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:05,579
Oh.

510
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:12,672
He told me it wasn't
my fault he died.

511
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:16,423
Do you believe him?

512
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:21,806
I'm... trying.

513
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:29,606
Tonight was very hard.

514
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,957
I would not have been
able to help Dr. Lim

515
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,816
if you hadn't shown
me the surgery.

516
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:49,000
As much as I loved you before...

517
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:54,214
I love you even more now.

518
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,263
I am so happy you are my wife.

519
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:15,360
Do you feel married now?

520
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,768
I think I do.

521
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,563
I thought I was gonna die today.

522
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,983
And I didn't think
about that job.

523
00:38:56,688 --> 00:38:57,944
I thought about you.

524
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,577
I just e-mailed New
York Medical Center.

525
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:08,580
I turned them down.

526
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:12,917
You need to e-mail them back.

527
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,880
Tell them you made a mistake.

528
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,684
When you decided
to take the job...

529
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,601
you chose your career over us.

530
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:38,818
And, uh...

531
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,030
I finally had to face it.

532
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:46,232
That's who you are.

533
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:54,417
And you're not gonna change.

534
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,170
But I did change.

535
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,413
Today.

536
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:04,427
For the moment.

537
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:29,109
Morning.

538
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:30,245
Welcome back.

539
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:34,106
I might need a
couple personal days.

540
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,530
Okay, but don't go overboard.

541
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,683
The boss is right here.

542
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,387
Mm.

543
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,302
I'm having trouble with my legs.

544
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:50,268
Probably some
post-surgical myopathy.

545
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:02,039
Push against my hands.

546
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,878
I am.

547
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:10,660
Try again.

548
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,632
You're paralyzed.
