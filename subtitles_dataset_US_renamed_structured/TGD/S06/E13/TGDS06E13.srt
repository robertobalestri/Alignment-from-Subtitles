1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,277
Good morning.

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:05,920
Admissions percentages
at top colleges

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,728
have dropped to record lows.

4
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:09,084
You thinking about
going back to school?

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,308
No. No.

6
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,485
I'm thinking about
our son's future.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,298
As in starting a college
fund for the Peanut?

8
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:18,394
No, I have put the
Peanut on a waitlist

9
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,613
for pre-kindergarten
at McLelland Hall.

10
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:22,999
Isn't McLelland Hall that
snobby private school

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:23,862
in Menlo Park?

12
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,225
It is one of the top
three feeder schools

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,724
for Stanford University.

14
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,299
So, you've not only decided
he's going to college,

15
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,934
you've also picked
out which one.

16
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,572
Given our son's genetic makeup,

17
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,669
he will probably
be very intelligent

18
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:39,926
and will require a challenging
academic curriculum.

19
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,383
Or he may not even
enjoy academics.

20
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,691
Whatever he ends up doing
will be his call, not ours.

21
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:47,496
Whatever pre-kindergarten
he ends up attending

22
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,321
will be our call, not his.

23
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,346
Hmm.

24
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,105
Oh. No coffee.

25
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,303
Glassy still in his room?

26
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,788
No, I heard him leave at 6:14.

27
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,783
He's been so sad about
losing his house.

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,069
How can you tell he's sad?

29
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,795
Have you noticed
how quiet he's been?

30
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,975
Yes. It's been nice.

31
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:10,468
Guess he's just throwing
himself into his work.

32
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:12,976
Hmm.

33
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:28,026
Dr. Murphy, little help here?

34
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,409
Hmm.

35
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,377
Give tetanus booster,
clean the wound

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,518
- with Betadine, administer...
- No, we got that. It's...

37
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,175
We wanted a second opinion.

38
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,901
Uh, Victor did.

39
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,731
Before these young pups take
a saw to our son's foot,

40
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:45,250
I'd like to talk
to a supervisor.

41
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:46,561
The nail's bent.

42
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,460
I am their supervisor,

43
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:51,912
and we need the saw to cut
the nail, not his foot.

44
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:57,400
Are you good, Ricky?

45
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,626
You all know my angel
for the past 11 years,

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,007
- Dr. Lim.
- Oh.

47
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,768
Hey, Roses. And this is my
resident, Dr. Jordan Allen.

48
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:23,460
Hi! Roses?

49
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:26,084
My website's called
"More than 65 Roses."

50
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:29,156
It's what I called it when
I was diagnosed at five.

51
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,434
Sixty-five roses,
cystic fibrosis.

52
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:32,953
Okay.

53
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,128
And welcome to vlog number 458,

54
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:38,510
going out all around the world.

55
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:40,788
And what does DLT stand for?

56
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:42,628
Oh, that
would be "double lung transplant."

57
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,068
Whoo! Whoo!

58
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:48,244
Your new
lungs just arrived.

59
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,111
Oh.

60
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:11,888
I never should've
agreed to let him go.

61
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:15,028
You didn't. You just stopped
fighting with me about it.

62
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,964
He's running a
mild fever, 100.4.

63
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,276
Go where?

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,692
Church camping trip,
less than an hour away.

65
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:25,108
Camping can be very dangerous.

66
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:26,558
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,285
You know, I had my first
fire-roasted s'more last summer,

68
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,390
so camping can also be very fun.

69
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:34,014
Thank you, Dr. Wolke.

70
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,808
Be careful, please.

71
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,706
Victor, he's a doctor.

72
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:38,846
Just try to trust...

73
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,986
Trust that things
will work out, yep.

74
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,575
I know.

75
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,370
You're a Warriors fan, huh?

76
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:46,405
You like Steph Curry?

77
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,545
I like Draymond.

78
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,996
A rebel. I like it.

79
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,242
Huh. Look at this beast.

80
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,247
Nice job, Ricky.

81
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,257
His temperature just
jumped two degrees.

82
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,844
Let's get a CBC, blood cultures,

83
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,167
and a CT of his foot
to check for damage

84
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:14,191
to the bones and muscles.

85
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,411
Dr. Park, how kind
of you to join me.

86
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:27,584
You paged me.

87
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:31,036
Have a seat. And, yes,
they're Herman Miller.

88
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,350
Cappuccino, mochaccino,
espresso, latte?

89
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:35,765
None of those are for you.

90
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,941
Okay, I was wrong.

91
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:41,978
This is the perfect job for you.

92
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:44,739
Your first study has,
what, 800 patients?

93
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:47,225
But since you've had
four whole days to hire

94
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,089
all the clinical trial
nurses you'll need,

95
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,056
should be easy.

96
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:54,473
I may be a little behind
and may already have

97
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,382
thirteen patients waiting,
but I will handle it.

98
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:57,787
With a lot of cappuccinos.

99
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,100
Thanks for your support.

100
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:04,828
Do you want me to
give you a hand?

101
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:08,177
I have 90 minutes
before my next surgery.

102
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:11,145
In exchange for unlimited
use of your espresso machine.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,942
We'll see.

104
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,230
Poor Ricky.

105
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:30,440
He probably just has
a minor infection.

106
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,201
I meant the parents.

107
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,169
They went to two very different
schools of thought on child rearing.

108
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,517
It's hard on the marriage
but harder on the kid.

109
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:41,348
Everyone has different
opinions, Dr. Wolke.

110
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,177
Yeah, which they
really need to sort out

111
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,627
before having kids.

112
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:47,457
My college roommate,
who was Jewish,

113
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,976
married a wonderful
Catholic woman.

114
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,151
They had three children
in quick succession,

115
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,774
started fighting about how
to parent them non-stop.

116
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,373
See, my parents
never fought about us

117
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,881
because my dad didn't care,

118
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,952
as long as my mom got me
and my brother dressed

119
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:01,816
and out in time for chores.

120
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,060
Well...

121
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:06,718
No hematoma or abscess.

122
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:08,478
No explanation for the fever.

123
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,344
My neck, it really hurts.

124
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,139
Okay.

125
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,526
Hey. I got you.

126
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,566
He has tick bites on his back.

127
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,680
Pink, plump, and spongy.

128
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:38,819
What's that?

129
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,170
Pneumonia?

130
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,103
In both lungs.

131
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:03,326
She's lucky if she
has another week.

132
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:08,538
Ex vivo lung perfusion.

133
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:12,301
Maybe we can make the
lungs heal themselves.

134
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,200
That's usually used in cases
involving pulmonary edema.

135
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,723
Get the lungs. Meet me
in the Procedure Room.

136
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,729
Tick bites?

137
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,765
His fever, vomiting,
and sore neck...

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,423
- which could be neurological...
- It's in his brain?

139
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,943
Possibly, but the blood
tests were inconclusive,

140
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,265
so we'd like to do
a lumbar puncture

141
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,980
to check Ricky's
cerebrospinal fluid.

142
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:39,949
This camp just keeps
getting better and better.

143
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:41,985
Can we not do this right now?

144
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,618
I just want to make sure
this never happens again.

145
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,265
And I don't?

146
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,888
I care about our son every
bit as much as you do.

147
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,787
And yet, you keep
prioritizing fun over safety.

148
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,996
Yes, I care about fun,

149
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,905
and socialization,
self-esteem, self-expression...

150
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,622
Yeah, none of which are as
important as his safety.

151
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,867
I can't do this anymore.

152
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,490
Wh...

153
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,448
Got through six so far. Only
one with a minor reaction.

154
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:21,818
- You?
- Me, too.

155
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:25,097
So, we are 12 down, one to go.

156
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,584
Mr. Riggs?

157
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,171
Mr. Riggs?

158
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:35,280
Sorry.

159
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,178
I just drifted off.

160
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:40,630
My fault for
keeping you waiting so long.

161
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:43,150
So, how are you feeling?

162
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:44,772
Aside from tired.

163
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,843
Uh, just a bit achy.

164
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:49,605
Especially my knees
and elbows, hips.

165
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,365
And some mild jaundice.

166
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,472
Other than that, I
feel pretty good.

167
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:01,651
- Hello.
- Oh.

168
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,204
We should sort out
our differences

169
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,827
about child raising.

170
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,183
If this is about
McLelland Hall, Shaun,

171
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,047
- it's not a big deal.
- Oh, no, I have made a list

172
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,866
of 37 other potential
differences.

173
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,730
And I'd love to
discuss them all,

174
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,008
but Andrews just
approved new EMR software

175
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,839
and wants me to run a beta test
on it in the next 24 hours.

176
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,323
- Have you talked to Glassy?
- No.

177
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,808
He didn't come to work
today, but I got a text.

178
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,052
He says that he is okay.

179
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:24,087
So where is he?

180
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:10,030
It is not over yet.

181
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:13,689
Lungs are remarkably
resilient organs

182
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,932
when they are in a body.

183
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:19,246
Which is why we have to
convince them they still are.

184
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,455
We give them a blood
supply by hooking them up

185
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,284
to a perfusion machine,

186
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:27,047
an air supply by hooking
them up to a ventilator,

187
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,498
IV drips to feed
them antibiotics,

188
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:32,708
and we might just be able to
con them back into viability.

189
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:34,295
The next six hours are crucial.

190
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,713
How will you know
if they're viable?

191
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:40,957
Our main indicator is a
calculation called the P/F ratio.

192
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:43,960
When that reaches at least
400 millimeters of mercury,

193
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,583
those lungs are good to go.

194
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,002
Mom, relax, it's Dr. L.

195
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:10,366
Palpate to find the
L3-4 interspace.

196
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,680
Maybe Lea and I will not be
able to sort out our differences

197
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,855
about child raising and become
angry like Victor and Shelley.

198
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,617
You and Lea are nothing
like Victor and Shelley.

199
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,249
They come from completely
different worlds,

200
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,759
have vastly
different outlooks...

201
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:26,002
Lea and I are very
different, too.

202
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:28,004
Insert the spinal needle.

203
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,637
And who knows how
much they love each other.

204
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,146
You and Lea, on the other
hand, I know you do. A lot.

205
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,838
And that's all that matters.

206
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,702
At least, according to
the Hallmark Channel.

207
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,842
I'm in.

208
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,193
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

209
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:47,472
The infection has elevated
his intracranial pressure.

210
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,726
Intubate and load him with
levetiracetam and dexamethasone

211
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,372
before his brain herniates.

212
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,383
CSF confirmed a
very rare infection

213
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:03,902
called Naegleria fowleri.

214
00:12:03,937 --> 00:12:07,009
It's a brain-eating amoeba that's
caused serious cerebral swelling.

215
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,598
We need to put Ricky in a
barbiturate-induced coma

216
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:12,808
and surgically place a port
into the center of his brain.

217
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:14,337
Then we will flood
it with antibiotics,

218
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:16,501
which will hopefully
reduce the edema.

219
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,365
And he contracted
this from a tick?

220
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,542
Oh, no, it's contracted via
contaminated water through the nose.

221
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,165
So... So he got it from
the swimming hole at camp?

222
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,407
That's a good guess.

223
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:28,237
But Ricky's way too
anxious around water

224
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,861
to ever put his head under, let
alone get water up his nose.

225
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:33,760
Naegleria Fowleri
has also been found

226
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,106
in untreated swimming pools,

227
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,608
- nasal rinses, water heaters...
- Nasal rinses?

228
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:40,560
If unboiled tap water is used.

229
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:45,185
I gave him a nasal rinse the
morning he left for camp.

230
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,463
He had a runny nose.

231
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,553
That is a better guess.

232
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,888
Excuse me.

233
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,932
Riggs has fatigue, joint pain,

234
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,450
impaired mental acuity,

235
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:12,315
tachycardia, and
mild liver failure.

236
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,732
- Thanks.
- Maybe he has a pre-existing condition.

237
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,330
In which case he
should've been eliminated

238
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,494
by any remotely competent
screening process.

239
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,393
Those protocols were in place
before you came on board.

240
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:24,707
I'll remind the CRO of that when
I tell them, on my first day...

241
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:27,089
That their $4 million
trial needs to be trashed.

242
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,653
How about you save the
doomsday predictions

243
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,639
until after the
blood panel results?

244
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,680
Lab is on the way to the OR.

245
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,300
It hasn't been six
hours yet, has it?

246
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,932
Six and a quarter.

247
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,789
You want company?

248
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:15,723
Thanks.

249
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,469
Hello. Where is Victor?

250
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:38,709
Beating himself up somewhere.

251
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:44,591
I just wish that
made a difference.

252
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,073
Do you love each other?

253
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,985
Yeah. Of course.

254
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,249
We've always been oil and water.

255
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,389
That's how my dad describes us.

256
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:03,737
Victor grew up in Belgrade,
I grew up in Berkeley.

257
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,015
Different religions, politics,

258
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,581
socio-economic status.

259
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:10,364
But when I got pregnant,

260
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,023
we knew we had a lot
of issues to work out.

261
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:16,543
And we did.

262
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:19,511
And then Ricky was born, and...

263
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,550
we suddenly started
arguing over...

264
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:25,587
when can he safely
eat tree nuts?

265
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:28,762
How high should he
climb on the jungle gym?

266
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,902
When can he stay
with a babysitter?

267
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:33,594
Those little things
were the ones

268
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:35,079
we could never work out.

269
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,314
But, yes, we still
love each other.

270
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,548
It's just that...

271
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,639
I'm not sure love
is enough anymore.

272
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,826
Still
waiting, still hoping.

273
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,651
That's kinda what we
do, isn't it, Roses?

274
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,035
And the wait is over.

275
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,393
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,641
We've put you back on the list.

277
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,680
You're at the very top.

278
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:30,893
I deserved this.

279
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:34,759
I wanted those lungs.

280
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,005
I wanted someone to die.

281
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,800
Brecka.

282
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,279
Honey, should we...
Should we finish?

283
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:00,820
No.

284
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,760
- Hello, Dr. Glassman.
- Geez! Man!

285
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:25,947
Shaun, you might try
knocking next time,

286
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:28,679
although, you know, that
might be a little tough.

287
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,820
What are you looking for?

288
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,822
Oh, you know...

289
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,652
my life.

290
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,344
Just my life.

291
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:00,914
Not yet.

292
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,309
I think I'm gonna
keep at it for a bit.

293
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:08,888
Okay.

294
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,614
No. This is on me.
You can head home.

295
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,272
Thanks.

296
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:27,044
I will miss your
big-screen LED TV.

297
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:28,390
It was old.

298
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:31,255
It had a pixel line
down the right side.

299
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,222
Did you love Ilana?

300
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,846
What? Did I love Ilana?

301
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,227
Yeah, of course.

302
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:40,782
Did you love Debbie?

303
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:44,993
Yeah, I loved Debbie.
Where is this going, Shaun?

304
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:48,203
That wasn't enough for you
to get over your differences.

305
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:51,206
How do I know if
love will be enough

306
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,036
for me and Lea to get
over our differences?

307
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,658
Well, you won't know.

308
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,937
I mean, how can you
know? You can't know.

309
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,768
I do not like
worrying about this.

310
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:03,425
Well, look, I mean,

311
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,634
Lea had some doubts a
little while ago, right?

312
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:07,118
And you both got over that.

313
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,431
Yes, because I was
very supportive.

314
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,915
Okay, well, there you go.

315
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,814
But differences about child
raising seem to be bigger

316
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,885
- than normal differences.
- Well, yeah.

317
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,818
I mean, having a child,
I mean, that's big.

318
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:18,958
That's huge. That's a shift.

319
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,339
It shifts everything,
marriage, everything.

320
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:24,618
I do not want a shift
in our marriage.

321
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,638
Well, maybe it'll
shift for the better.

322
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:35,450
Aardy's eye.

323
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,504
The first thing I
ever bought Maddie

324
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,668
was a stuffed aardvark.

325
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,298
Back in the day, I
performed a 21-hour surgery.

326
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,955
I removed an astrocytoma

327
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,715
from the medulla
of the brainstem.

328
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,855
It was heroic. It
put me on the map.

329
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,799
My elective surgeries were
booked out for a year.

330
00:19:56,823 --> 00:20:00,827
I was in a zone, like
playing scratch golf.

331
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:03,692
And then Ilana got pregnant.

332
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:07,040
She didn't want to stop working.

333
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,490
She had a real-estate thing.

334
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,330
She was doing very well. I
didn't want to stop working.

335
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,011
I wanted to stay on the map.

336
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,806
And then we brought Maddie home.

337
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,360
That first night...

338
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,216
everything changed.

339
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:25,439
Hmm.

340
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:28,303
Go talk to Lea.

341
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,753
I tried.

342
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,723
She had to run a beta
test on new EMR software.

343
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:37,467
Well, then, you'll have
to wait until she's done.

344
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:07,100
All I had on my DVR was
a marathon of Shark Tank.

345
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,733
Can't say I was in
the mood to be staring

346
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:10,345
at Mr. Wonderful's bald head,

347
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,519
so why not entertain myself

348
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,522
by watching some hot
lung perfusion action?

349
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,421
I'm not one to kink shame.

350
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:20,389
Coffee and cronuts
from Chaz's Bakery.

351
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,219
I'm happy for the company.

352
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:25,049
Noomie's not much of
a conversationalist.

353
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,982
-N-Noomie?
-My pet name for them.

354
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,949
From the Greek word
for lungs, pneumonas.

355
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:31,435
I thought it was
better than Lung-ie.

356
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:33,057
Yeah, I may be losing it.

357
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,128
Cronut.

358
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:39,788
- Mmm.
- Any progress?

359
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:41,790
Negligible.

360
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:43,457
I keep doing the same
thing over and over,

361
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,070
hoping for a different outcome.

362
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,728
Yeah, I'm definitely losing it.

363
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:50,287
Then do something different.

364
00:21:58,427 --> 00:21:59,911
Okay.

365
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,094
Doubling up on antibiotics,
and we can add steroids.

366
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,270
This will either hammer
out the infection...

367
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,184
or the lungs.

368
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:25,730
How's Glassy?

369
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:28,630
Very sore and very sooty.

370
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,183
Mmm.

371
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:37,190
We need to talk.

372
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:38,950
About our 37 differences?

373
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:40,504
I thought of two more.

374
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,164
Shaun, as you know, I'm
kinda busy right now,

375
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,969
so you'll have to settle
for me agreeing that,

376
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:48,995
yes, we'll have many,
many differences,

377
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,791
but in time, we'll be able
to work them out and...

378
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:53,448
That's what Victor
and Shelley thought,

379
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:55,726
and now they are talking
about separating.

380
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,971
I don't know who
Victor and Shelley are.

381
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:03,147
But in any event, I have at least
two more hours of work to do tonight.

382
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,633
Okay.

383
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,782
- You're waiting, aren't you?
- Yes.

384
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,853
I am very patient.

385
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:21,717
You arevery patient

386
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,063
and very understanding.

387
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:24,996
And you were so good
with me on our babymoon.

388
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:27,033
If you could just
channel some of that...

389
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:30,070
On our babymoon, I
thought love was enough.

390
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:37,319
That's... kind of a big thing

391
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:40,080
to drop on me this
late at night.

392
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:42,151
You were too busy to
discuss it in the morning,

393
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,050
so I talked to
Dr. Glassman about it,

394
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:47,122
and he said having a child
will shift our dynamics.

395
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:49,573
And if it does, we can
talk about it then.

396
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:51,920
So if we can't talk
about our dynamics now,

397
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,335
how about our differences?

398
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,785
Apparently we have 39 of them,

399
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,176
so we're gonna need a
serious chunk of time,

400
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,684
and I'm pretty
sure they'll keep,

401
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,697
because we're kinda committed
to having a kid together,

402
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,964
whether love is enough or not.

403
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,210
Shaun, I'm just... I'm
way too tired to have

404
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,903
a productive conversation
about this right now, okay?

405
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:11,664
Okay.

406
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:42,591
It's time to call it.

407
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,123
I had a half an
hour left on my call

408
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:49,633
when she first came to the ER,

409
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,842
coughing blood,
vitals on the floor.

410
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:55,408
When we opened her up,
her lungs looked like

411
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:57,088
they belonged to a 70-year-old.

412
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,332
Didn't think she'd make
it through the night.

413
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,644
She was eight.

414
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,407
I couldn't go home.

415
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:07,306
I stayed with her that night.

416
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:11,965
And then, the next
morning, she just...

417
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,691
opened her eyes, looked at me,

418
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,624
and told me she liked
my French braid.

419
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,249
Once I call it...

420
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:25,634
I have to go up there and
tell her I failed her.

421
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,714
Got Riggs' latest test results.

422
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:39,614
Turns out he did have a
pre-existing condition...

423
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:41,685
Hemochromatosis.

424
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:43,599
So the jerk lied about
it to get into the study.

425
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,552
That's your assumption?

426
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,450
He got $3,500 to participate.

427
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,383
I think it's a pretty
sound assumption.

428
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,833
But whether he lied or not,

429
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,007
it means the screeners
are incompetent.

430
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:55,500
That's gotta take a toll.

431
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:58,357
Expecting the
worst of everybody.

432
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,143
I'd rather be pleasantly surprised
than bitterly disappointed.

433
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:05,985
And that's the worldview you want
to impart to your future child,

434
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:09,051
"Assume the worst of everyone"?

435
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,067
Help!

436
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,069
We need help in here!

437
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,692
What's happening?

438
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:26,557
Add a milligram of
lorazepam. He's seizing.

439
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,152
Because his
ICPs are in the 40s.

440
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:29,767
Cerebral edema's gotten worse.

441
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:31,838
If we don't open up
Ricky's skull immediately,

442
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,357
he will die.

443
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:43,781
Removing large
hemicrani skull flap.

444
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:46,128
Performing wide dural opening.

445
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:53,515
Look at the monitor.

446
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,759
EEG's all over the place.
He's still seizing.

447
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:59,556
Place an additional EVD and
increase propofol to burst suppress.

448
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,109
Eh, but he's maxed out.

449
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:03,214
If we give him any more
propofol, we could kill him.

450
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:05,684
If we don't, the seizures
will definitely kill him.

451
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,399
Oh. We can
remove the damaged cortex

452
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,332
in the left anterior
temporal lobe

453
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:20,300
using ECoG and pre-op
imaging to guide us.

454
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:22,589
Cut out part of his
brain? That's a little extreme.

455
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:25,305
It is the area
that's causing the seizures.

456
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,180
It'll just be a
tough sell to his parents.

457
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:28,654
Which is
why you will help.

458
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,451
Okay, please keep him stabilized
with iced LR to the cortical surface.

459
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:34,487
Uh...

460
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:42,012
"The country flew past
as if they were seeing it

461
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:44,739
from the windows of
an express train.

462
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:46,948
Faster and faster they raced,

463
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:49,675
but no one got tired
or out of breath."

464
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,301
We can save the last
chapter for later.

465
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,157
There is no later.

466
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,005
Where's Dr. L?

467
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:14,872
She wasn't ready to
give up on your lungs.

468
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:17,323
There's still a chance?

469
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:22,811
Dr. Lim thinks so.

470
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:27,920
♪ Your glass is on your side ♪

471
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,214
Let's finish.

472
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:35,030
♪ And tell someone you love

473
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:39,000

475
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,523
"Chapter 16.

476
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,425
Farewell to the Shadowlands."

477
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,841
We would cut out a
small piece of his cortex.

478
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:54,163
It's already been
damaged by the infection.

479
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:58,226
Removing it may be the
only way to keep him alive.

480
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:01,678
But how would that affect him?

481
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:03,403
There are areas of the brain

482
00:29:03,438 --> 00:29:06,096
that are significantly
less essential than others.

483
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,064
This part only impacts
his speech and memory,

484
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:11,377
probably not long-term.

485
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:15,864
So he might not be able to
talk or know who we are?

486
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:18,413
We wouldn't be able to fully
assess him until he wakes up.

487
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:30,885
Ricky's skull is open.

488
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:37,403
We should do it.

489
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:42,408
Uh, th-this is a
very good hospital,

490
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:44,099
these are very smart doctors.

491
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:49,864
And someone very wise
once told me that, uh,

492
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:52,258
"Sometimes you just have to
trust that things will work out."

493
00:29:58,769 --> 00:29:59,805
Okay.

494
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,313
Hmm.

495
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:28,143
Hemochromatosis?

496
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:30,180
You never noticed the
symptoms until now?

497
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:32,458
Joint pain, fatigue,
mental fuzziness?

498
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,184
Well, I turn 58 next week.

499
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:36,324
I mean, I haven't felt
a day over 30 until now.

500
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,502
It is very unlikely
your hemochromatosis

501
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:43,952
went from 0 to 60 in a week.

502
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:50,375
Is it possible you gave the
screeners someone else's blood?

503
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:54,031
You think I cheated?
For the money?

504
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,206
No, Mr. Riggs, I'm
just trying to...

505
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:02,591
You're a blood donor
in the 20-gallon club?

506
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,870
Yeah, regular donor,
last 30 years.

507
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,630
When was the last
time you donated?

508
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,737
Two months ago, just before
I started this trial.

509
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:12,222
And you're not allowed to donate
while you're in the trial.

510
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:13,982
Well, see, that's the downside.

511
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:15,328
I actually enjoy those cookies.

512
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,057
I'll make sure you get all the
cookies you want, Mr. Riggs.

513
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:33,035
Don't you think it's
time to come home?

514
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,383
No.

515
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,628
Well, in that case...

516
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,389
I wanted to make you
something delicious

517
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:42,735
like you've made us,

518
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,842
but I'm not a very good cook,
and everything's closed.

519
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:48,741
So, I hope you like

520
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,985
hot-dog-flavored potato chips

521
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,533
and Nutty Buddies.

522
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:55,265
Mmm.

523
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:57,358
Yeah.

524
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:01,302
Nail polish?

525
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,101
Father-daughter time.

526
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:07,001
Maddie insisted that
she paint my fingernails

527
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,416
a sparkly rainbow color.

528
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:15,872
The next day, my first patient
was very uncomfortable.

529
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:18,357
That's when I realized I forgot
to remove the nail polish.

530
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:21,947
That's a nice memory.

531
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:24,950
Oh, sit. No, sit, sit, sit.

532
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:33,855
So many memories.

533
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:38,308
The Halloween Maddie
wanted to go as a ham

534
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:41,932
because we'd just seen
To Kill a Mockingbird.

535
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:46,419
But she wanted the ham to be
made out of an actual ham.

536
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:50,113
And then, one night, the
wind was blowing so hard,

537
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,943
it blew her bedroom door shut.

538
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:54,911
She was convinced that
her grandmother's ghost

539
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:56,762
had come back to visit her.

540
00:32:58,086 --> 00:33:00,675
Wanted to sleep in our bed
for the next two weeks.

541
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:08,153
You didn't come here just to
feed me junk food, did you?

542
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:12,031
I thought you might
need someone to talk to.

543
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:13,274
I'm fine.

544
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:16,173
Hmm.

545
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,692
I know someone you
should talk to.

546
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:24,285
I know.

547
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,253
But this was easier.

548
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:36,124
Mmm.

549
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:40,045
Hot dogs should not be a flavor.

550
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:44,995
"All their life in this world

551
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,825
and all their
adventures in Narnia

552
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,620
had only been the cover
and the title page.

553
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:52,589
Now, at last, they were
beginning chapter one

554
00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:54,384
of the great story

555
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:57,525
which no one on earth has read,

556
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,804
which goes on forever,

557
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:06,292
in which every chapter is
better than the one before."

I'm back.

573
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:59,311
The DLT didn't really work out,

574
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:02,003
so...

575
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:05,351
this is gonna be my last update.

576
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:09,769
I wasn't even gonna do this.

577
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,702
I was gonna flip
off Dylan Thomas

578
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,222
and go gently into

579
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:17,536
But...

580
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,331
I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

581
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:25,026
And that...

582
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:28,098
it's okay to be hurt...

583

that my life's been cut short.

But the upside to all of this

586
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:42,319
is that I feel something
I never thought I would.

587
00:35:42,354 --> 00:35:43,700
It's gratitude.

588
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,658
I'm grateful to my sweet mother

Noomie hit 402. Get
Brecka to the OR.

598
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:17,518
The lungs are good.

599
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,176
We should intubate.

600
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:22,074
Yes.

601
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,405

Ricky, can you hear us?

603
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:50,785
Hello.

604
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,904
Do you know where you are?

605
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:06,561
Do you know your name?

606
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,917
I'm Ricky Pavlovic.

607
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,964
I'm in the hospital

608
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:32,157
because I stepped on a
rusty nail at church camp.

609
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:38,802
But I would still like to
go back there next year.

610
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,011
Welcome home, Noomie.

611
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,814
So Riggs is a
lifelong blood donor.

612
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,335
Which totally
eliminated his symptoms.

613
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,061
Until he started this trial.

614
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:29,615
He's not allowed to
donate till it's over,

615
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,617
so there was nothing
wrong with the protocols,

616
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:33,136
nobody was incompetent,

617
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,656
and Riggs isn't a big fat liar.

618
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,304
In fact, he's a legit hero.

619
00:39:40,592 --> 00:39:43,181
Maybe my worldview does
need a little adjustment.

620
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:46,712
I prefer Italian roast.

621
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,254
