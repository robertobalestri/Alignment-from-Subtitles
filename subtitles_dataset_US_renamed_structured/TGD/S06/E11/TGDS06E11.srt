1
00:00:00,679 --> 00:00:03,552
Mm, I love this so much.

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:07,748
The lake, the fir
trees, the fresh air...

3
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:10,776
Good. You have 14
minutes to enjoy it.

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,203
We are 4 hours and 10
minutes away from the resort,

5
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:16,377
and your Prenatal Massage and
Aura Cleansing begins at 5:45,

6
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:18,977
given six rest stops at
eight minutes apiece.

7
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:20,892
Wait, you've timed
my pee breaks?

8
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:22,184
Generously.

9
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:23,856
Shaun, we're supposed
to be relaxing.

10
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,752
Schedules are not relaxing.

11
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:28,971
I find them... very soothing.

12
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,076
Okay.

13
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,930
- 14 minutes it is.
- 13.

14
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:38,083
14 is fine.

15
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,787
Oh, that poor dog.

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,012
47-year-old male,
multi-impalement, disoriented,

17
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:58,476
significant blood loss.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,620
Ultrasound and surgical tape.

19
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:00,828
These spikes...

20
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,176
Wood and metal?

21
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:04,710
We... We were
trimming trees and...

22
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:06,460
And a shovel got sucked
into the wood chipper.

23
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,086
- You work with him?
- Sometimes. I'm... I'm his son.

24
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,725
I count 20 pieces. Airway's
patent, and he's got good pulses.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,685
Lalo? He's one of my patients.

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,687
No significant free
fluid in the abdomen.

27
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:18,844
No bronchospasms or wheezing.

28
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:21,412
No. Fluid's accumulating
in the pericardium.

29
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:23,226
You jostle that spike,
he could bleed out.

30
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:24,589
We'll have to do
it in the O.R.

31
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:26,886
Dad? Dad, can you hear me?

32
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,892
- Aah!
- No.

33
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,265
- No, no, no, Dad!
- Oh!

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,291
- No!
- Aah!

35
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:31,465
Let's get him to the O.R.!

36
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,375
He couldn't have gotten far.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,750
We don't know that,

38
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:38,723
and that ground is very uneven,

39
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:39,860
and we know from experience,

40
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:41,712
- the woods can be dangerous.
- Shh.

41
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,499
Hey, there, buddy.

42
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,175
We're here to help.

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,147
It is having trouble breathing.

44
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,834
Leg and multiple rib fractures.

45
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,445
Poor little guy.

46
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,056
I need to reduce
the rib fractures.

47
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,295
- Hold it steady.
- Uh, okay.

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,992
Hang on, buddy. It'll be okay.

49
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,527
We need to get it to
a veterinary hospital.

50
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:19,165
Vince?

51
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,858
<font color="#ff65b4"><i>Resync By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

52
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,158
I gotta get you to St. Bon's.

53
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:38,402
I need you to do it here.

54
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,813
I'm a first-year resident.

55
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:41,424
That's unsupervised surgery.

56
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:42,928
I can't go to the hospital.

57
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:45,017
There was a gang
member at that party.

58
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,130
Me being there was a patrol violation.

59
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,171
Cops get that bullet,
I'm going back to prison.

60
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:51,110
Just go to your P.O.
Tell him the truth.

61
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:53,218
'Cause the criminal justice
system is always fair,

62
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,843
especially to guys
who look like me.

63
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,718
I finally got my
life back on track.

64
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,689
I have a good job.

65
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:07,300
I'm trying to work
things out with Viva.

66
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm watching my
baby twice a week.

67
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:11,696
I go back inside, I
could lose everything.

68
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:18,181
Danni... please.

69
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:27,929
All right, the bullet's
close to the surface.

70
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,984
It's more of a procedure
than a surgery.

71
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,894
Thank you.

72
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,284
All right, I gotta
get some stuff first.

73
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,789
What's the strategy?

74
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,355
We should start

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,879
with the most
life-threatening spikes...

76
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,228
These two in the chest,
maybe the abdomen...

77
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:48,205
We can't risk a major
hemorrhage so soon.

78
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,492
Do the easier ones,

79
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,126
buy time for the
transfusions to work.

80
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:52,650
Oh.

81
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:54,522
Dr. Reznick's right.

82
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,869
We start with the distal
extremities. I'll take his leg.

83
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:59,153
You get the pieces in his
right arm. I'll take his left.

84
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,194
Now that there's an
adult in the room...

85
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:02,560
Always a pleasure.

86
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,595
You leaving, I mean.

87
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:13,931
Hey.

88
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,546
So, after basketball
on Wednesday,

89
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,715
I'm introducing Clay to
the wonders of Su Cai Bao.

90
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,002
You in?

91
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,091
Assuming that's food, sure.

92
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,485
Great. It's a date.
8:00 p.m. my place.

93
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:40,524
Didn't you just
finish a night shift?

94
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,222
Too much caffeine.

95
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,224
I'm building a trauma simulator

96
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:46,798
to practice removing
foreign bodies.

97
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,122
You're weird.

98
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,548
You'll probably be
my boss someday.

99
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,887
First grade, I begged
my parents for a puppy.

100
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:09,924
Tessa... chocolate Lab,
sweetest little face.

101
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,115
Next morning, Tessa peed
on my dad's briefcase.

102
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,436
He returned her that night.

103
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,963
That doesn't sound
like good parenting.

104
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,511
It wasn't.

105
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,668
The dog's got a damaged
spleen, broken ribs,

106
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:25,010
and a fractured radius,
and skin lacerations.

107
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,410
- He'll need...
- An ex-lap and thoracotomy.

108
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:30,470
I'm a surgeon at San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

109
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,671
We should go.

110
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,160
When are you planning to do it?

111
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,491
I'm not.

112
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,145
I don't work without
up-front payment,

113
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,879
and since we don't know
the dog's owners...

114
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,297
Well, we'll pay.

115
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,517
That... could be expensive.

116
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,778
Quite.

117
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,733
I could slot him in
tomorrow morning.

118
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,595
Well, I guess we
could stay in a motel?

119
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,352
I mean, we should really
be here for Buddy.

120
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,739
I've named him Buddy.

121
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:59,317
Whatever its real name is,

122
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,518
it is a dog and not our dog.

123
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:04,407
And we are going to miss
your Prenatal Massage.

124
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,632
Buddy needs us more than I
need my aura cleansed, Shaun.

125
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:10,266
Okay.

126
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,938
It is your babymoon.

127
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,583
Ready?

128
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:32,680
It's just a fragment.

129
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,094
The bullet must have shattered.

130
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,680
- It's still in me?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,389
There's damage
deeper in your leg.

132
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,013
I can't locate the
rest of the bullet

133
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,779
unless I cut further
in your muscle.

134
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,126
So cut.

135
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:50,654
I need a second opinion.

136
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,133
Hey.

137
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,744
Question... if a bullet's stuck

138
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:55,286
behind the vastus medialis...

139
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:56,878
This for your simulator?

140
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,768
Yeah, it's a scenario
I'm practicing.

141
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,709
Um, how do you decide
if you leave it in?

142
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,170
Well, it depends on the imaging.

143
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,930
What if you're going in blind?

144
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,237
Well, it depends on
the angle of entry,

145
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,823
caliber of the bullet,
exact location.

146
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,598
Okay. I'll figure it out.

147
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:14,722
Danni...

148
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,760
how about you tell me
what's actually going on?

149
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:24,414
Removing the
left lateral mid-thigh spike.

150
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,274
Irrigating the
spike near the sternum.

151
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:27,865
No signs of pneumothorax.

152
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,290
Starting
on the shoulder.

153
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,542
- Lost the pulse. He's in V-tach.
- Get the internal paddles.

154
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,060
Setting up the internal paddles.

155
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,086
He's coding. Where
are those paddles?

156
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,070
Almost ready.

157
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,633
There's no time.
Starting cardiac massage.

158
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,714
Push 1 milligram epi.

159
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,916
We've got sinus rhythm.

160
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,100
Blood pressure's normalizing.

161
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,514
Good job, Dr. Park.

162
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,162
I'll do more sharp dissection.

163
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,034
His body can't take any more.

164
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,514
We'll get a panscan
CT, CTA, transfuse him,

165
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,579
and resume in the morning.

166
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,590
Nine spikes down, 11 to go.

167
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:19,014
Definitely landed
in the medial compartment.

168
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:20,640
Blood flow?

169
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,374
Good pulses. Intact nerve
function in the leg.

170
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,662
If he was in the O.R.,
we'd leave the bullet in.

171
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,446
Got it. Thank you.

172
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,130
I'll pack the wound
and send him home.

173
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:30,882
Hold on. Can you
take me off video?

174
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,717
Yeah, I'm not a big
fan of being lied to.

175
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,284
It won't happen again.

176
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,040
Thanks, Asher.

177
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:47,484
There's... a stain
on the floor.

178
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,236
Mmm.

179
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,553
Now there's a
pillow on the floor.

180
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,547
Yeah, they should really
clean that carpet.

181
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,688
Let me call the front desk.

182
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:04,701
Ugh, it's sticky!

183
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,796
Okay, maybe...
Maybe I overreacted.

184
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,300
You did.

185
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,763
I... I thought
you loved animals.

186
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,411
I love rabbits and fish.

187
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,673
They don't slobber or jump
on you or make messes.

188
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:16,906
Well, you know, Shaun,

189
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,173
someone's about to
come into our life

190
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:21,407
who's going to slobber and
jump on us and make messes.

191
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,627
If you are talking
about our son...

192
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,776
Yes, of course, I'm
talking about our son.

193
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,373
Sorry.

194
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,965
Clearly, we are both stressed.

195
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,296
I don't think I'm stressed.

196
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,776
Fine.

197
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,039
Only I am.

198
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:39,719
And tired.

199
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:42,934
And... I'm gonna
get ready for bed.

200
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:46,961
Ew!

201
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,024
Something's wrong.

202
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,860
That's infected.

203
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,181
If I don't get the rest of the
bullet out, you're gonna go septic.

204
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,363
So you can do it here, right?

205
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:25,147
I shouldn't.

206
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,222
You got me this far.

207
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:29,810
Please.

208
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,879
Okay. I'm gonna
need some help.

209
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:39,509
During the surgery,
we discovered

210
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,145
sacral and lumbar fractures.

211
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,538
What does that mean?

212
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:44,540
The dog will have
trouble walking

213
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,929
and will be incontinent.

214
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,588
So...

215
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,068
a second surgery?

216
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:52,678
Unlikely to be effective.

217
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:56,334
The dog would still be at
risk for infections, UTIs,

218
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,989
and will require constant care.

219
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,383
Euthanasia would be more humane.

220
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:03,288
We brought this dog
here to save him,

221
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,473
not have him put down.

222
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,905
I'm gonna find his family.

223
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,064
And if I can't, I will
find him a new family.

224
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:16,281
And you're gonna find a surgery
to fix his incontinence.

225
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,105
Dr. Sinclair is the expert
in veterinary medicine.

226
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,176
If he cannot think of
an effective surgery

227
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:25,425
for incontinence, there
probably isn't one.

228
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,253
In which case,
it's very unlikely

229
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,081
the dog will be adopted.

230
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,430
Then we'll adopt him.

231
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,503
I will find a surgery.

232
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:42,685
Hey. Where are the supplies?

233
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:44,357
I didn't bring them.

234
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:45,577
Danni, you shouldn't
be doing this.

235
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,665
This is straight-up surgery.

236
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:47,961
Go home.

237
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,147
Let me help you take him
back to the hospital.

238
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:51,694
- That's not happening.
- Why not?

239
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,585
If you weren't gonna do
this, why'd you even come?

240
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,715
Because I... I didn't
want to desert you.

241
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,179
So don't.

242
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,119
I'll go get the supplies myself.

243
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:01,994
I just need you to
talk me through it.

244
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:05,291
You won't even
have to touch him.

245
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:09,849
If this ever gets out,
I'll take the fall.

246
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:15,866
This is why he went into V-tach.

247
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,459
The spike in his
shoulder damaged

248
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,365
every critical
structure in the area.

249
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,141
We need to do a carotid to subclavian
bypass before we pull it out.

250
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,492
Risks sending him
into V-tach again.

251
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:24,920
Well, we need to
remove the spike.

252
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,596
Unless we remove his arm.

253
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,202
In his current condition,
it's a less risky surgery.

254
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,055
Comes down to what
Lalo's willing to risk.

255
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,212
And we can't ask him
because he's too unstable

256
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,065
to take him off the ventilator.

257
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:38,817
We could ask his son.

258
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,570
He's 16.

259
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,356
He's not authorized to
make medical decisions.

260
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,983
Sure, but he'd have
a better idea than us

261
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,255
what his father would want.

262
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,554
Talk to him.

263
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,460
Oh, Buddy.

264
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:04,288
It's okay.

265
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:06,508
We're gonna find your humans.

266
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:09,834
Are you okay?

267
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,357
Yep. All good.

268
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,062
Were you trying to pet the dog?

269
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:17,002
No. Mmm-mmm.

270
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:20,217
You should never touch an
injured animal near its wound.

271
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:22,393
I know.

272
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,721
I'm gonna start putting
up lost dog fliers.

273
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,051
Making the incision.

274
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,741
Dissecting at the muscle
to free up the purulence.

275
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,659
What's her name?

276
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:48,332
Lila.

277
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:49,631
What's she like?

278
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:55,189
The first time she saw
snow, she ran outside...

279
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,853
No gloves, no hat.

280
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,518
I-I had to drag her
back in before she...

281
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:01,905
Before she turned blue.

282
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:08,797
She's like me... Never
listens to anyone.

283
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,572
Mmm.

284
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,220
Sounds like Powell, actually.

285
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:21,062
I know I can be... a bit much.

286
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:25,413
My parents were really tough.

287
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:28,198
I learned at a young age
that if I didn't push back,

288
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:31,199
hard, that I'd be pushed around.

289
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,791
So it helped me,

290
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,685
especially after I lost my leg.

291
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,601
My med school advisor told me
that I shouldn't be a surgeon

292
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,955
because I wouldn't be able to
stand for hours in the O.R.

293
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,127
But I can.

294
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,608
And I am.

295
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:50,742
Danni, are you okay?

296
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,726
It's Audrey.

297
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:55,049
I called out
of my shift this morning.

298
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:57,693
I just told her it was
a family emergency.

299
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,665
Oh, she's been
calling and texting.

300
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,798
This is not
good. This is not good.

301
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,147
I know.

302
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,376
Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you...

303
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,792
Just, shh. Just...

304
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:13,816
- Hey.
- Hey, is everything okay?

305
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:17,192
Yeah, yeah, a good friend's
having some issues.

306
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:18,995
We're still in the middle of it.

307
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,075
Oh.

308
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,199
After what happened with
Perez, I was worried.

309
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:23,965
Just wanted to check on you.

310
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:26,952
Thanks. I totally get it.

311
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,469
- You'll be in tomorrow?
- Yeah.

312
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,406
What was that?

313
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:41,141
Hey.

314
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,234
If we remove the spike
from your dad's shoulder,

315
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,553
it could cause complications
that would kill him.

316
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,180
How likely?

317
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:56,199
Maybe a 5% to 10% chance.

318
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,775
The safer option would
be to amputate the arm.

319
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,835
So you're asking me to decide

320
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,618
whether to cut off my dad's arm?

321
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,977
No, we're not.

322
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,210
We just want to figure out
what your dad would want

323
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,541
if he was awake.

324
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,915
Do you have any
other support system?

325
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:18,848
Family, friends who help out?

326
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,499
Not really.

327
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:25,937
Mom died, and the rest of
the family's in El Salvador.

328
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,190
Has he ever worked
with other gardeners?

329
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:31,697
I mean, me. I help out most
mornings before school.

330
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:35,195
Um, he fell off a
roof last winter.

331
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,327
Got a concussion.

332
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,677
I picked up some
slack, and it was fine.

333
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,647
I-I know this is different,

334
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,246
but he always says, "We stick
together, we'll find a way."

335
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,778
If cutting off his arm
means he'll live...

336
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:55,998
then do it.

337
00:16:58,136 --> 00:16:59,268
That's what he'd want.

338
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:08,270
Why are you talking to me
about operating on a dog?

339
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,943
Lea asked me to.

340
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,442
She is very stressed,
and I don't know why.

341
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:15,021
Well, considering what she's
been through, you know?

342
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:18,046
But she knows her
pregnancy is safe now.

343
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,495
Well, you don't get over something
like that in... in a week.

344
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:24,719
Okay, s-so how much
time will she need?

345
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,448
I don't know, Shaun.

346
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:29,157
Maybe this isn't even
the main issue, you know?

347
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:31,251
Mmm.

348
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:35,665
Maybe Lea is worried
about being a mom?

349
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,970
Well, she wouldn't be the first.

350
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,070
Aren't you a little bit
worried about being a dad?

351
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,966
A little.

352
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,480
Crying babies can be very loud,

353
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,094
and their bowel
movements and spit-up

354
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,470
can be very
disgusting and smelly.

355
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:50,182
But I have
noise-reducing earplugs

356
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,973
and peppermint oil
for under my nose.

357
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,696
And I will keep a supply
of surgical smocks at home.

358
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,189
You've certainly
gamed that out, huh?

359
00:17:57,364 --> 00:18:00,367
Yes. How do I help
Lea be less worried?

360
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,543
I don't know, Shaun.

361
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,241
You don't know what
the issue is, right?

362
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,025
So I would talk to her

363
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,853
and tell her that you've noticed

364
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,309
she's been a little
bit stressed lately,

365
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,441
and ask her what's going on.

366
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,057
And send me the doggy imaging.

367
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,304
He's
stable, for now.

368
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:33,126
- I'm so sorry.
- You should be.

369
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,812
If you're gonna blame
anybody, blame me.

370
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:37,621
Oh, I do. This was
unethical, stupid,

371
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,983
and if he dies,
possibly criminal.

372
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:43,410
Vince would've died of sepsis.

373
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:44,984
- So call an ambulance.
- Then what?

374
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:46,848
EMTs can't force him
to go to the hospital.

375
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:48,649
They can if he's unconscious.

376
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:49,834
But he could be dead by then.

377
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:54,203
The only way to make
sure that he lives

378
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,031
is to operate here.

379
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:59,320
You're a trauma surgeon. It
would be simple and ethical.

380
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,471
- Who is this guy?
- I told you.

381
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,343
He's a friend of
mine from the Navy.

382
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,758
Who's on parole... for what?

383
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:10,171
- That doesn't matter.
- Does to me.

384
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:17,661
Vince was the first
one to the accident.

385
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,402
He tourniqueted my leg.

386
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:23,816
He held my hand.
He comforted me.

387
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,843
He was the only person that day

388
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:27,671
that looked me
straight in the eyes.

389
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,673
Everybody else was
just too scared,

390
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:32,467
too freaked out...
too disgusted.

391
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,745
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,466
Will you give us a second?

393
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,759
If I hadn't warned you
off of that surgery

394
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:54,892
four months ago,

395
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,896
you could've ended up worse
off or dead on the table.

396
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,766
And whether you knew it or not,

397
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,279
you needed me.

398
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:07,128
Right now, Audrey, I need you.

399
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,804
I will help you
with your friend.

400
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,719
And then we'll deal
with what you did.

401
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,315
I put up tons of fliers,

402
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,620
called around to
all the shelters

403
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,432
and vet hospitals and...

404
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,435
- Did Glassman have ideas at least?
- Yes.

405
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,428
That I should talk to you.

406
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:39,065
I've noticed you are stressed,

407
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,831
and I don't know exactly why,

408
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:43,391
but maybe it is because you
are worried about motherhood.

409
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:48,036
I meant about the
surgery for the dog.

410
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:53,074
But... I am worried, yeah.

411
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:57,718
You shouldn't be.

412
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:59,676
You'll be great.

413
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,375
Thanks.

414
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,813
And I know you'll be a
great dad to our son,

415
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:10,357
but what if we're
incompatible as parents?

416
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:13,081
We can't even agree
how to wash dishes.

417
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:14,952
And look at us with this dog.

418
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,364
We're arguing. Buddy hates me.

419
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,218
I lied.

420
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,484
He snapped at me after I petted
too close to his stitches.

421
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:25,155
I thought so.

422
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,346
We will work as a team
and figure it out.

423
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:37,000
But... what if we
don't know how?

424
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:40,380
We've both had pretty
lousy parental role models.

425
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,459
I don't think I'm like
my parents at all.

426
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:45,548
And I don't plan to
treat our children

427
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,637
like they did me and Steve.

428
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:51,075
I can see my parents in me
in ways I really don't like.

429
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:55,515
I can be stubborn like my
dad and flaky like my mom.

430
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,865
I can't tell you how many times

431
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,431
I was the last kid
at after-school

432
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,126
because she forgot
to pick me up.

433
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:05,446
What if I mess up like they did?

434
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:12,914
You probably will
mess up sometimes,

435
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:17,188
in those ways...
other ways, too.

436
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:20,129
I probably will as well.

437
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:25,093
But we will support
each other and each...

438
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:41,207
I know how to help the dog.

439
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,351
I'm gonna
inject more lidocaine.

440
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,711
Turn on the ultrasound probe.

441
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,864
How'd you end up in prison?

442
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,292
When I got back from
Afghanistan, I couldn't sleep.

443
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,386
I would lie in bed just
staring at the door

444
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,151
waiting for someone
to come at me and...

445
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:11,978
I-I was in a bar,

446
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:14,079
and I thought some guy
looked at me wrong.

447
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,226
Are you getting help?

448
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,288
I'm on meds, in therapy.

449
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:27,389
I don't want to be what I was.

450
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:30,750
I want to be a good
man for my family.

451
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:34,605
I don't see the bullet.

452
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,479
It must have migrated.

453
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,926
Three centimeters deep
and medial to the femur

454
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,188
in the adductor magnus.

455
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:45,755
And what does that mean?

456
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,392
It's harder to get to now.

457
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:52,108
We can do it.

458
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:57,462
This'll hurt.

459
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:00,693
Aah!

460
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:01,981
Let's amputate. Book the O.R.

461
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,217
On it.

462
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,904
I think we should save the arm.

463
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,921
Did you not hear
what Dylan just said?

464
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:11,644
I heard a son who'll do anything
to make sure his dad lives.

465
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,075
But that's not necessarily
what the dad would want.

466
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:17,004
Lalo's a poor, undocumented
manual laborer.

467
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:18,745
No support system.

468
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,410
If he can't work as a
gardener, then what?

469
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:23,307
Dylan told us what.
They'll find a way.

470
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:25,180
And Dylan will drop out of
school to take care of him.

471
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:27,534
He just told us how he works
for his dad most mornings.

472
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,519
Already took care of him
when he had a concussion.

473
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:33,020
The future Lalo spent building
his son would disappear.

474
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:35,433
You know what else
would ruin his future?

475
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,230
Having a dead dad.

476
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,228
Lalo would take the risk.

477
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:46,537
Morgan heard everything you did

478
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:47,792
and came away with a
different impression.

479
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:48,891
She's not a parent.

480
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:51,637
That's very patronizing.

481
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:56,328
But that doesn't
mean he's wrong.

482
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:00,799
- You're confident you can save his arm?
- Very.

483
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,074
Then let's do it.

484
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,173
What a dick move.

485
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,396
I am so sick of being
told that childless people

486
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:18,743
can't understand what it
means to love someone.

487
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,205
There's love and then
there's being a parent.

488
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,816
In nine months or
so, you'll get it.

489
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:29,293
After drilling the
lamina from L4 to S1,

490
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,364
we will use a Kerrison punch

491
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,794
to remove fragments 2
millimeters at a time,

492
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,493
then support the spine
with screws and rods.

493
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,408
And that is how we will fix

494
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:41,074
the incontinence
and leg weakness.

495
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,623
And by we, I mean you.

496
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:46,136
A little outside my wheelhouse.

497
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,790
That's why they
called in the bullpen.

498
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,875
Ah, yes. You're an
expert... on humans.

499
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,294
I'm still very unsure.

500
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,787
Why can't you just
do the surgery?

501
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:01,325
Buddy is an innocent little
guy who really needs our help.

502
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,503
And I've put in a ton of work
with Shaun and Dr. Glassman

503
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,181
to find a way that
could save him.

504
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:07,769
And... And I recognize
you have valid questions.

505
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:10,614
And I know, my hormones are
probably playing a role right now,

506
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,641
and my attachment to
a dog I met yesterday

507
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,089
probably doesn't make sense
to you, but it is real.

508
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,190
And I really need
Buddy to be okay.

509
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:20,649
So I'm asking you to please
set aside your concerns

510
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,367
and please help us help Buddy.

511
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,309
Who's paying for this?

512
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,564
Um...

513
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:36,708
Seriously?

514
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,058
Gah!

515
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,799
I need longer forceps.

516
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,236
- God.
- We're almost there.

517
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,107
No.

518
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:46,984
Vince? Vince!

519
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,375
It's cold.

520
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:56,946
Poor pulses.

521
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:58,651
The fragment must have
caused a thrombosis.

522
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,881
I'm calling it.
Push more fluids.

523
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:10,713
I need an ambulance at 302 West
Holden Drive, Apartment 2A.

524
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:15,732
We're gonna try to
save your dad's arm.

525
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:19,801
- Did... Did something get better?
- No.

526
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,547
But we decided it's
worth the risk.

527
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,761
Why did you even ask me then?

528
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:32,547
So I could screw up and
make the wrong decision?

529
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:34,661
You didn't screw up.

530
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:37,987
He hasn't taken a
weekend off in six years.

531
00:27:39,382 --> 00:27:43,179
He... He wears old clothes so
I can have new ones for school.

532
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:49,731
He's given up his whole
life t-to make sure I'm...

533
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:54,054
I'm happy and healthy and safe.

534
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,595
- I'm just trying to help him and...
- You did.

535
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:04,125
You gave us the
information we needed.

536
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:07,279
Right.

537
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:14,371
Ten-blade.

538
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:16,243
Twenty's better.

539
00:28:16,268 --> 00:28:18,336
You worried about
a scar? It's a dog.

540
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,309
Dogs like scars, actually.

541
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,572
They think it makes
them look cool.

542
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:24,773
A Veterinary Medical
Review longitudinal study

543
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:26,862
showed that post-op
recovery outcomes...

544
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,038
Shaun, the man knows
how to cut into a dog.

545
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:31,631
But he may not have
read the study, which...

546
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:33,629
I've already made
the incision...

547
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:35,946
with a ten-blade.

548
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:39,183
Preparing to place the 3
millimeter pedicle screw.

549
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,360
A 5 millimeter screw's better.

550
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,873
Removing the bullet.

551
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:54,699
Slowly release
the proximal clamp

552
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:56,139
and let's look for flow.

553
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,334
It's good flow.

554
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,467
Vascular repair's hemostatic.

555
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:09,861
Let's finish this up and
get him off to recovery.

556
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:11,926
Bag the bullet for
forensic evidence.

557
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:32,238
Hey.

558
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:34,861
How'd it go?

559
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:37,432
We won't know until he wakes up.

560
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,308
It meant a lot that you came.

561
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,976
How can you say no to a dog?

562
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,186
Yeah.

563
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:54,558
You know, when Maddie
was a newborn...

564
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:57,344
we were worried
that she wasn't...

565
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:59,272
latching on, you know?

566
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,725
But she did.

567
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,823
And then we were worried
that she wasn't crawling,

568
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:06,502
and she did.

569
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:09,024
And then we were worried
she wasn't talking,

570
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:10,049
and...

571
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:13,229
You're gonna be a mom.

572
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:16,176
You're gonna worry,
that goes with the gig.

573
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:19,587
99% of the time, everything
works out just fine.

574
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,760
What was Maddie like?

575
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,594
Maddie...

576
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,586
She never walked
anywhere, she always ran.

577
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,877
She was angry... a lot.

578
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:50,945
That was her default.

579
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:56,322
But she loved so deeply.

580
00:30:58,318 --> 00:31:00,575
It was like you were the
only one in the world.

581
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:04,942
I wish I'd known her.

582
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,223
Why'd you ask me about Maddie?

583
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:13,351
I just can't imagine

584
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:15,565
going through what
you went through.

585
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:21,345
And I am... so scared...

586
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:24,051
of that 1%.

587
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:35,489
After Maddie died, I didn't
think that I was gonna make it.

588
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,025
There were times that I
hoped that I wouldn't.

589
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,097
But I did.

590
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:46,627
And then I met Shaun.
And then I met you.

591
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:48,150
And I'm grateful
every single day

592
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,388
because I love you both so much.

593
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:54,939
You and Shaun have love,

594
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:57,725
and you have faith
in each other.

595
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,684
If I was a betting man...

596
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:03,769
I would bet the house
on the both of you.

597
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,377
We're on full flow.
Removing the spike.

598
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,714
Low blood flow to the brain.

599
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:31,864
How's the NIRS?

600
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:33,108
61%.

601
00:32:33,282 --> 00:32:34,762
Graft must have
caused an obstruction.

602
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,044
I can fix it. Clamps.

603
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,481
11-blade and 6-0 prolene.

604
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,640
NIRS?

605
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,400
56%. Dropping fast.

606
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,296
Below 50, he risks brain damage.

607
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,621
We should call this off
and ligate the subclavian.

608
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:52,171
No. We're this close
to saving his arm.

609
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,694
- More sutures.
- 52%.

610
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:56,697
Dr. Park?

611
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,264
Dr. Park.

612
00:32:58,438 --> 00:32:59,700
Get ready to flush and unclamp.

613
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,441
Go.

614
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:04,058
- Starting flush.
- Unclamping.

615
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,320
Arm's pink.

616
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:12,822
NIRS at 70% and climbing.

617
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,647
10 spikes to go.

618
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,994
If the surgery fails and
he is still incontinent...

619
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:34,693
I found a waterproof
dog bed he might like.

620
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:37,452
For our place?

621
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,995
Buddy is...

622
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:44,012
very calming to pet.

623
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:48,114
Oh.

624
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:49,445
I think he needs to pee.

625
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,963
We need to get him to the pad.

626
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,814
Hey, Buddy, you gotta hold it in

627
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,469
until we get you over there.

628
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:56,407
- Okay, not yet, Buddy.
- Almost there, Buddy.

629
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:57,603
-No pee pee.-Keep holding it in.

630
00:33:57,627 --> 00:34:00,083
Not yet, no pee pee.

631
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:02,371
Almost there. Keep
holding it in.

632
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:03,545
There we go. All right.

633
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,325
Time for urination.

634
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,047
Go pee pee.

635
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:08,613
- Okay, oh.
- Oh, oh!

636
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:11,112
He did it.

637
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:13,356
Oh, we did it.

638
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:15,403
- We got him to pee.
- We did it.

639
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,865
Oh, oh.

640
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,624
Oh, good boy.

641
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:26,526
I'm thinking letters
in their records,

642
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,210
remediation plans,

643
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:31,113
and a two-month probationary
direct supervision.

644
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,767
One more misstep, they're out.

645
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,468
That's appropriate...

646
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:36,512
for Asher.

647
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,651
It's not easy to draw a
line between what they did.

648
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:41,038
Asher never picked
up an instrument

649
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:42,629
until you were supervising him.

650
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:45,744
And Powell has shown a
pattern of disobedience

651
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,391
even from her first surgery.

652
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,841
Wolke's made
mistakes of his own.

653
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,173
And he knows that.

654
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,876
Does Powell?

655
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,864
Listen, your
department, your call.

656
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:03,044
But you almost lost Shaun
as a friend this year.

657
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:05,898
And I'm worried you're acting
out of fear of losing another.

658
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,059
Color looks good.

659
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,739
Strong radial pulse.

660
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,520
Now I want you to try
to move your fingers,

661
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:23,010
very slow, just a little.

662
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:24,602
Okay.

663
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:31,932
Is that good?

664
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:33,952
It's great.

665
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:36,043
Muchas gracias, Doctor.

666
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,355
You saved my life.

667
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:43,919
What's wrong?

668
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,552
Um, they... they asked
me what you would...

669
00:35:50,577 --> 00:35:51,934
You know, about your arm.

670
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:00,979
I told them to amputate.

671
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,304
I made the wrong choice.

672
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,524
Mijo, whatever you did,

673
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:09,985
you were there for me.

674
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:14,527
I've never been so proud of you.

675
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:28,790
I love you, too.

676
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,878
So, I started
looking for dog walkers.

677
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:35,698
They're not cheap,
but what is, so...

678
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:38,745

We will, of course, pay

683
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:52,598
Good. It's $22,563.

684
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:56,197

Guess you were right.

689
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,527
Or I was lucky.

690
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:19,766
I almost lost him.

691
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:23,077
Well, you didn't.

692
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:34,107
Yeah, I think I pushed
too hard on this surgery.

693
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,288
And I definitely said things
to you that weren't fair.

694
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:48,006
Last week Kellan told me

695
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,859
he wasn't coming home
for the holidays.

696
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:52,664
Going on a trip
with his roommates.

697
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,662
Feels like I'm losing him.

698
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,708
Like I've been a crappy father.

699
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:03,364
You're not.

700
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:10,208
Anyway... I'm sorry.

701
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:17,068
My implantation failed.

702
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:20,760
It's been, what, nine days?

703
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:22,613
Blood tests wouldn't
be fully accurate.

704
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:26,592
I could feel I was pregnant...

705
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,789
and...

706
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:31,138
then I wasn't.

707
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:33,081
I'll be here.

708
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:35,929
Anytime you need a friend.

709
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,520
I just might.

710
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,523
Probation.

711
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,175
I'm sorry.

712
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:06,893
We're letting you
go from the program.

713
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:14,944
What about Vince?

714
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:17,077
If you have any leeway
not to report him...

715
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:18,436
The bullet was misplaced.

716
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,037
Misplaced?

717
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:24,369
So I don't see the point
in alerting the police.

718
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:28,378
Thank you.

719
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:36,499
Danni, this wasn't an easy call.

720
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:41,928
You gotta learn to
compromise sometimes.

721
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:43,422
If you don't, it's
gonna hurt you,

722
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,694
not just as a
doctor, but in life.

723
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:51,367
I'm sorry it worked
out this way.

724
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:54,741
I'm not.

725
00:39:57,151 --> 00:39:58,761
If I'd done anything else,

726
00:39:58,786 --> 00:40:01,311
Vince would be dead or
headed back to prison.

727
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:04,613
And either way, his
family would be destroyed.

728
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:08,041
So I did the right thing.

729
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,117
I'll live with the consequences.

730
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,395
Good luck.

731
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,312
You, too.

732
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,326
I'm gonna miss you, Buddy.

733
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,893
Cooper.

734
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:35,634
But I'll write you every week.

735
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:38,836
- He won't get it.
- I was kidding.

736
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:40,850
You're a good boy.

737
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:43,990
Look, I know everyone
says this to you,

738
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:46,383

it.
