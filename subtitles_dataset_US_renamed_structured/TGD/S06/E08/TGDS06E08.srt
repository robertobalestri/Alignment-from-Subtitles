1
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:42,342
Time to get up already?

2
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,634
Mm, for me.

3
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:46,179
Early department meeting.

4
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,306
You should stay in
bed a while longer.

5
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:49,724
So should you.

6
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,517
Mm.

7
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,895
How about I put a
call in to Rosalia's,

8
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:57,440
breakfast burrito, latte
for pickup.

9
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,734
20 minutes saved.

10
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,944
If I get back in that bed,

11
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,238
it's gonna be for
more than 20 minutes.

12
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,574
Oh.

13
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:07,868
I can be late.

14
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,373
I told you
to put on a jacket.

15
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,376
And I told you I'd be fine.

16
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,753
Are you fine?

17
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,338
No. I'm freezing.

18
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,840
It's San Jose.

19
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:23,966
"Winter" is a relative term.

20
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:24,967
Eh.

21
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,639
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:34,394
Weren't you wearing
that yesterday?

23
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,978
I crashed at her place.

24
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,147
We were working on a research
project and finished late,

25
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:39,816
and he slept on the couch.

26
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,692
Didn't you have a date?

27
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:44,862
I rescheduled it.

28
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:47,323
I gotta get inside and shower
or I'll be late for my call.

29
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:48,366
See you.

30
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,367
Alright. See ya.

31
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:52,578
He's bread crumbing you.

32
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,579
Excuse me?

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,957
He's flirtatious, non-committal.

34
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:56,792
He's giving you just
enough attention

35
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,709
to keep you on the hook.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,002
He's dropping crumbs.

37
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,546
You'll never get the full slice.

38
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:02,713
We're just friends.

39
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,173
I'm fine with that.

40
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:07,845
Hm. Or maybe you're settling
for whatever he'll give you.

41
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:14,058
When did the stomach pain begin?

42
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,352
A couple weeks ago.

43
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:19,856
I'm on my tenth day of Lupron,
so it could be the side effects.

44
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:20,982
We're hoping for
an embryo transfer

45
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:22,775
at the end of the month.

46
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,735
Gotta take care of this mama.

47
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:26,779
Other than the
pain, any other...

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,323
Emesis, fever, sweats.

49
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,204
Some tenderness and distension.

50
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,124
A scar on the right
lower quadrant.

51
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,126
That's a first date souvenir.

52
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,919
<i>Unofficial</i> first date.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,296
A McBurney's incision.

54
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,131
You had an open appendectomy.

55
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,632
She had a ruptured appendix.

56
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,925
I'm an RN.

57
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,386
Oh, it was a medical meet-cute.

58
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:53,514
I'm okay.

59
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:54,932
You are not.

60
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,059
There is an
irregularly shaped mass

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,519
in the right-side pelvic region.

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,229
You need a CT, stat.

63
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,865
Can I help you?

64
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,409
Are you okay?

65
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,623
Um, I fell and hit my head.

66
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:19,957
Come here.

67
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,837
Possible head trauma.

68
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,013
Can you give me your
name and date of birth?

69
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,599
Um, Toni Rhodes,

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,560
Aug... August 7, 1995.

71
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,895
Slowly reactive pupils.

72
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,188
Any drugs or alcohol use?

73
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,440
No. No.

74
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,983
Uh, yes.

75
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:49,528
I... I had a couple
drinks last night.

76
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,155
How did I get here?

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,120
And we need a head CT

78
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,790
to check for brain bleed
or skull fractures.

79
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,709
Oh, my stomach is...

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,420
How did you get this?

81
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,548
Okay, her abdomen is
rigid and distended.

82
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,722
Significant
intraperitoneal hemorrhage

83
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,099
at left upper quadrant.

84
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,892
You're bleeding
from your spleen.

85
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,309
We need to get you into surgery.

86
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,441
Captions by VITAC...

87
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,411
I reviewed your
patient's ultrasound.

88
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,163
The appearance of that
mixed-echogenic mass is unusual.

89
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,498
Yes.

90
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,875
We... Keep me posted.

91
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:46,711
Ooh, you went to Rosalia's?

92
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:49,255
The breakfast burrito
with the spicy chorizo...

93
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,756
Try <i>molten</i> chorizo.

94
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,800
Totally worth the ulcer
I'm probably getting.

95
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,093
Hard stan.

96
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,513
I have never been to Rosalia's.

97
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,807
I recommend it.

98
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,268
Your images are
ready, Dr. Murphy.

99
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,482
There is the mass.

100
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,152
There's a ton of free fluid
surrounding the lesion.

101
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:15,364
Possible active bleeding and
invasion into adjacent organs.

102
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,785
She needs surgery immediately
for resection of the lesion.

103
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:21,912
How long have you had these?

104
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,372
My monster horns?

105
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,957
A few years.

106
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:30,087
But now they're making it hard
for my glasses to stay on.

107
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:33,674
I keep them hidden with my hair.

108
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:36,969
You are beautiful, and
you have nothing to hide.

109
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,638
But those glasses
do need to stay put,

110
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,681
so I think we should
remove these growths.

111
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:43,601
Without shaving my hair
or leaving big scars?

112
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,811
Those are the only options
other doctors have given me.

113
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,522
Those doctors don't
know my technique.

114
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:54,403
I'll make a tiny incision here.

115
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:58,950
It minimizes scars, and
it'll leave your hair intact.

116
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,911
Okay. Okay?

117
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,913
Put Gwendolyn on my
schedule in the morning.

118
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:04,914
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

119
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:07,124
Yes.

120
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,044
Toni's CT came back clean.

121
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:11,837
No fractures or
intracranial bleeding,

122
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,297
so she's clear for surgery.

123
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,924
Hm.

124
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,342
We need to finish our
research for tomorrow?

125
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,886
I'll spring for pizza.

126
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,516
Have you ever heard
of bread crumbing?

127
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,768
Does it involve pigeons?

128
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,853
No.

129
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:32,983
It's when two people
hang out a lot.

130
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:34,402
One wants to be
more than friends,

131
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:37,072
and the other isn't clear.

132
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,991
Question is, what should
the first person do...

133
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:44,412
Be patient or move on?

134
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:46,789
Asking for a friend.

135
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,543
I'd say real personal connection
can be rare, invaluable,

136
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:54,089
whether the context is
romantic or platonic.

137
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,134
I'll see you inside.

138
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,766
There are
tentacles of scar tissue

139
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,102
reaching into every organ.

140
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:10,980
Multiple abscesses
and infection burden.

141
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,065
We will need several drains.

142
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,819
100 cc already. This
infection is crazy.

143
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:23,492
So, things with you and Lim
are still sorta awkward?

144
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,328
Dr. Lim and I have a
professional relationship

145
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,289
centered on medicine.

146
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,292
The mass is adherent
to the pelvic wall,

147
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:34,420
colon, bladder, uterus.

148
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,504
But you guys used to be closer.

149
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:36,881
Do you miss that?

150
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,966
Cutting through more tissue.

151
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,886
Dr. Lim is Chief of Surgery,

152
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,721
I am an attending.

153
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:49,894
A medical focus is
logical and productive.

154
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,270
We've reached the mass.

155
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,938
Cutting into the capsule.

156
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,899
Wait.

157
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,150
Oh, my God, is that...?

158
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,820
A surgical towel.

159
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,743
Have my special
ex lap tray ready.

160
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:07,411
Transfuse two units
and stay two ahead.

161
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,997
Place a Foley catheter now.

162
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:11,790
Her hematocrit's in the toilet.

163
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,126
A fall shouldn't have
caused this much damage.

164
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,211
She was high
when she came in.

165
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:17,004
No telling what
could've happened.

166
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:18,881
How about we hold that judgment
till her tox results come back?

167
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:20,716
Placing arterial line now.

168
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:24,136
Sluggish pupils, memory loss,
confusion... she's using.

169
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,223
Not judgment, just recognize
certain behavior when I see it.

170
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,350
She's hemodynamically
unstable. Debate later.

171
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:32,436
Right now, we need
to stop this bleed.

172
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:36,273
Dr. Allen, why aren't
you placing the catheter?

173
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,692
There's severe bruising
and signs of major trauma

174
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:39,693
in her pelvic region.

175
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,448
I think she was raped.

176
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,662
We were able to
save your spleen,

177
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,955
but you bled a lot
during the surgery

178
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:52,790
for reasons we don't
understand yet.

179
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,334
We need to run more tests.

180
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,546
When we were placing
your catheter,

181
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:00,798
we discovered some bruising
and signs of trauma

182
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,716
in your pelvic region.

183
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,928
We're worried you may have
been sexually assaulted.

184
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,270
No, that's...
just not possible.

185
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:17,773
Your urine testing also came
back positive for Rohypnol.

186
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,400
It's often associated
with date rape.

187
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:22,361
No, I-I...

188
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,613
I went out for drinks
with my friend.

189
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:28,242
We were celebrating his new job.

190
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:31,287
I watched the bartender
mix my drinks.

191
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,915
I was tipsy, but I wasn't drunk.

192
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:39,545
The bruises must be
from when I tripped.

193
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,131
I would remember if what
you're saying happened.

194
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,885
Rohypnol can cause
short-term amnesia.

195
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:51,974
I'm sure this
information is a shock.

196
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,518
We're here to support you.

197
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,564
The best way to gather evidence

198
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,818
as to what happened
is to do a rape kit.

199
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:07,364
No, I... I don't need that.

200
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:10,075
I was with my friend.

201
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,161
He wouldn't let
anything happen to me.

202
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:15,664
You don't have to
decide right now.

203
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,499
Get some rest.

204
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,501
We'll let you know when
your latest labs come back.

205
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,553
A retained surgical item?

206
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:32,473
It's a towel that was left
in you after a procedure.

207
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:34,850
It is adherent to
several vital organs.

208
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,436
We could not remove it without
irreversibly damaging...

209
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,604
Left behind by who?

210
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,189
My doctor?

211
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,899
Let's focus on getting it
out first, and then we can...

212
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,443
Who performed my appendectomy?

213
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,611
Broder, I think. But...

214
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,321
The count of sponges
and other items

215
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:49,949
inside the surgical cavity is
done by the lead scrub nurse.

216
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,200
But you may discuss this later.

217
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,826
Okay. So who was the
lead scrub nurse?

218
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,245
Gomez, maybe, or Kraus.

219
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:56,580
I really don't remember.

220
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,749
But <i>you</i> were definitely there.

221
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you blaming this on me?

222
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,502
You were one of the nurses.

223
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,045
I mean, shouldn't
you have noticed?

224
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,005
I was circulating, not scrub.

225
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,674
No way I was the
one who did this.

226
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:08,175
A minute ago you can't remember,

227
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,969
but now you're sure
you didn't do it.

228
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,471
Maybe we should move on to...
Why are you attacking me?

229
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,099
I just found out I have an
infected towel in my gut

230
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,976
that will require major surgery,

231
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,894
and you're making
this about you.

232
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,062
You're acting like
this was my fault.

233
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,232
It doesn't matter
whose fault it was.

234
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,363
We will approach the
towel like a sarcoma...

235
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,906
Perform an en bloc resection,

236
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,784
bypass any intertwined
vital arterial structures,

237
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:36,620
and finish with a
thorough debridement.

238
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:38,163
I think that's a
reasonable option.

239
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,500
Well, right now, your
opinion doesn't mean a lot.

240
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,920
I just need a minute.

241
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:48,507
I'll be out in the hall.

242
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:55,723
She's... not conscious.

243
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:56,932
She's syncopal.

244
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,517
She fainted?

245
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,852
Naveen. BP spiking.

246
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,895
Oh, my God. Heart rate's up.

247
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,064
Possible bleed or septic shock.

248
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,733
Crash airway tray!

249
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,569
An additional abscess cavity
in the towel may have ruptured.

250
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,987
We need to get her
back to the O. R.

251
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,117
You wanted to see me? Hey.

252
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,369
Yeah, I'm double
booked tomorrow.

253
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,954
You'll be scrubbing
in with Dr. Annanian

254
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,581
for Gwendolyn's surgery.

255
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:22,708
But she was so
impressed with you.

256
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,002
She's really excited to
have you as her surgeon.

257
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,087
Well, it's a meeting
I can't miss.

258
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:29,465
But Dr. Annanian has
my surgical plan.

259
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:30,466
I'll check in afterwards.

260
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,554
The rupture caused
widespread peritonitis.

261
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,057
This infection is way
worse than before.

262
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:42,436
Aggressively irrigate,
debride, and suction.

263
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:45,147
We need to control
the infection.

264
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,107
Send tissue and fluid
to the micro lab

265
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:49,318
so we can focus her antibiotics.

266
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,529
Big drop in BP.

267
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,614
Heart rate spiking.

268
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,115
She isn't tolerating surgery.

269
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,034
We need to close her again.

270
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,035
Sutures.

271
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,456
Wait, what about the towel?

272
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,459
We can't operate until her BP
and O2 sats are under control.

273
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,461
She'll need to remain
sedated and intubated

274
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,880
until she stabilizes.

275
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,217
And we need to find a new
approach to removing the towel.

276
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:14,938
Once she's closed, I
can dive into research.

277
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:19,556
I will consult with Dr. Lim.

278
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,936
I would like a surgical consult.

279
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,312
The Mukherjee case?

280
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:28,440
The mass on the CT was a
retained surgical towel.

281
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,318
And is acutely infected and
adherent to vital organs.

282
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,987
The patient blames her wife,
who was a surgical nurse

283
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:36,115
during the appendectomy...
Circulating, not scrub.

284
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,282
If we could stick
to the medical...

285
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,034
The patient didn't understand

286
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,661
the count was not her
wife's responsibility.

287
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,037
They argued quite a...

288
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,039
The most pressing
issue is the towel

289
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,834
poisoning her from the inside.

290
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,544
What is your plan to remove it?

291
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,088
That...

292
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,592
is what I am here to discuss.

293
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:58,053
You are an attending,
Dr. Murphy.

294
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,221
And your patient has a few hours

295
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:02,099
before she's stable
enough for any procedure.

296
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,936
Research RSIs and brainstorm
possible solutions with your team.

297
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,730
Then, if you still need a
consult, my door is open.

298
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,491
How's Toni's platelet count?

299
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,617
Still dropping.

300
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,411
Did you do an
anti-platelet antibody?

301
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,079
Waiting on results.

302
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,541
Order another PRBC transfusion
to get her hematocrit up.

303
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,918
Any progress on the rape kit?

304
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,214
She doesn't want
to talk about it.

305
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,133
I can't blame her.

306
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:38,594
It's an invasive process
that only serves to prove

307
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,305
something horrible happened
that she doesn't remember.

308
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,224
Her brain may not be able to
remember, but her body does.

309
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:46,935
And chances are, eventually,
it will all come back.

310
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,104
Shouldn't we respect her wishes?

311
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,230
I mean, we don't
want her to feel like

312
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,273
she's being assaulted
all over again.

313
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:52,649
Denying what happened
doesn't change the fact

314
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,192
that it happened.

315
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,989
It's Toni... Code Gray.

316
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,785
No,
please, please, stop!

317
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,038
She woke up screaming,
and she pulled out her IV.

318
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,873
Just stay away from me!

319
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,541
We just want to help you.

320
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,669
Toni, you're okay.

321
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,171
We're here with you.

322
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:16,048
It's not real.

323
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,758
Can you breathe with me?

324
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,390
You're okay.

325
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:29,854
You're not in danger anymore.

326
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,107
I...

327
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,693
had a nightmare.

328
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:39,739
Her gown.

329
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,242
I need to take a look at that.

330
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,994
Okay?

331
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,879
The spleen repair didn't work.

332
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,429
Over
the course of your long career,

333
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,264
you have removed five
retained sponges.

334
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,892
That is statistically higher
than any surgeon in the region.

335
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:12,020
Special skill on my résumé
right under juggling.

336
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,772
My patient has a retained towel

337
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,316
that has caused sepsis with
multi-organ involvement.

338
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:18,276
I would like a surgical consult.

339
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,903
Perfect request for
your department head.

340
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:25,200
Dr. Lim said I should tackle
the problem on my own.

341
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,493
Well, that's interesting.

342
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:27,995
She is right.

343
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:29,497
I am an attending.

344
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,878
But your RSI experience would
be very helpful on this case.

345
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,588
Alright, I'll take a look.

346
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,637
Thank you.

347
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,888
Nurse Villanueva,

348
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,891
why is Gwen's surgery
still on my schedule?

349
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,144
She panicked when I told
her it'd be another surgeon.

350
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,437
She really wants you.
Assure the patient

351
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,022
she's in great hands
with Dr. Annanian,

352
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,732
and take her off my rotation.

353
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,733
No.

354
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,737
You told her you'd
do the surgery.

355
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,823
You can tell her that
you're not going to do it.

356
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,912
What about a minimally
invasive surgery...

357
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,497
Cutting up the towel,
removing it piece by piece

358
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,498
through a single port?

359
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,583
That won't work.

360
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,792
Where it's stitched
to the organs,

361
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,794
the infected tissue
puts her at high risk.

362
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:20,881
An aggressive gross total
resection of all organs invaded

363
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:23,175
by the towel plus all
infected and necrotic tissue

364
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,343
is the best option for
long-term survival.

365
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,262
That procedure
risks major bleeds,

366
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,806
and we'd have to
remove her uterus.

367
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,224
They're planning a family,

368
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,601
and Naveen is supposed
to carry the baby.

369
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:36,521
That will also be
impossible if she is dead.

370
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,107
That's elegantly put.

371
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,777
The wife of the
patient is here, right?

372
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,112
Explain the options to her,

373
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,365
and see how she
wants us to proceed.

374
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:50,494
They had an argument
before her last surgery.

375
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:53,747
She will not be pleased with
her wife making that decision.

376
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:55,332
Just go talk to her.

377
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,466
We figured out why
you've been bleeding.

378
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,177
You have a condition
known as ITP.

379
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:10,514
Your immune system is
destroying your platelets.

380
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:12,182
Can you fix it?

381
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,601
There is medication
that can help.

382
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:17,270
And we need to
remove your spleen.

383
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:19,856
Why didn't you just do that
during my earlier surgery?

384
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:21,733
We weren't aware of your ITP.

385
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,819
It's a condition that can
be triggered by trauma.

386
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,155
The ITP complicates
our approach.

387
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,825
Usually, we'd remove your
spleen through your abdomen,

388
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:33,829
but that risks a
catastrophic bleed.

389
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,455
We <i>can</i> remove your
spleen vaginally

390
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,124
with minimal incisions.

391
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,542
There's less risk of bleeding.

392
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,046
Okay, let's do it.

393
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:47,300
I'm hoping you'll let us do a
rape kit before the procedure.

394
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,594
I already told you, no.

395
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:53,181
The transvaginal
approach will destroy

396
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:54,641
all evidence of
the sexual assault.

397
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:57,060
No.

398
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,103
I don't care.

399
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,857
Without the kit,
you'll have no proof.

400
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:09,156
You're right.

401
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:14,411
I believe that something
terrible happened to me.

402
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:18,373
But that is true whether or not
I go chase down the boogeyman.

403
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,458
But it could help.

404
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,419
Nothing will help.

405
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,921
Don't let whoever did this
to you get away with it.

406
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:28,049
He already has.

407
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,803
Doing a rape kit is
not going to unrape me.

408
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,730
Go ahead with the surgery.

409
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,570
We need your decision.

410
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,283
Is there any way to
do the total resection

411
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:56,077
without removing
Naveen's uterus?

412
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,329
No.

413
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,165
She's dreamed of being
pregnant her whole life.

414
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,416
I can't choose this for her.

415
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,085
You can.

416
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:07,047
We understand how
difficult this is.

417
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:09,049
She'll never forgive
me. She will.

418
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,009
I mean, it's obvious
Naveen loves you.

419
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,221
She already blames me
for what's happening.

420
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:17,391
If I'm the one that takes away
her chance to carry a child...

421
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,604
You are right.

422
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:23,939
If you choose the
gross resection

423
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,357
and your wife loses her uterus,

424
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,651
it is likely she will
never forgive you.

425
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:29,027
But that is irrelevant.

426
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,613
This is your decision.

427
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:35,867
You have to make it.

428
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,869
Whatever happens next.

429
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,918
Do the total resection.

430
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,894
I haven't seen you around
here for a while, huh?

431
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:06,022
Forgot how relationships can
eat into discretionary time.

432
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:09,317
Doesn't exactly sound
like a complaint.

433
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,027
It's not.

434
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,739
Shaun came to me with
a surgical consult.

435
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,409
Your RSI record. Smart.

436
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,452
He did it because
you sent him away.

437
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,163
Well, part of the Chief's job

438
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:26,334
is to empower their attendings
to find their own solutions.

439
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:27,377
Sounds like Shaun did.

440
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,838
A lot of ways to
empower an attending.

441
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,339
And I chose one.

442
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,092
Because you're still
angry with Shaun?

443
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,176
Okay.

444
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,206
How long are you
gonna keep that up?

445
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,596
How about as long as I want?

446
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:41,141
Okay, you be as mad at Shaun
for as long as you need to be.

447
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,601
Thanks for the permission.

448
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,769
Just so you know, it's toxic.

449
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,229
And not just for Shaun.

450
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,731
Spare me.

451
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:49,859
You're not concerned for
anyone other than Shaun.

452
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:54,279
I have to get back to work.

453
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,291
Dr. Andrews.

454
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:13,673
I rescheduled my
finance meeting.

455
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:14,924
But in the future,

456
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:17,552
I'm requesting a scrub
nurse who respects my role

457
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,640
as surgeon and
hospital president.

458
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:34,778
When I was in the hospital,
you sat at my bedside.

459
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,531
You helped me recover when
I wasn't sure I wanted to.

460
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:41,534
That meant a lot.

461
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:43,370
Personal attention with
patients is important

462
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:44,871
even when you're president.

463
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,342
The laparoscopic splenectomy

464
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,469
is a great alternative
to the transvaginal...

465
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,806
Toni's surgery is already
scheduled for this evening.

466
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:05,225
And she asked that you
be removed from her case.

467
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,976
She may regret not
taking action on this

468
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:10,021
for the rest of her life.

469
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:13,693
That's her decision, not yours.

470
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,447
I got your message, Shaun.

471
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:20,573
What's so urgent?

472
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,659
I have added you to
Naveen's surgical team.

473
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,453
Please get ready to
scrub in in 30 minutes.

474
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:28,081
You have a surgical
plan in place, Shaun.

475
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:30,792
You're perfectly capable
of executing that plan.

476
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:34,587
It is my responsibility
as attending to create

477
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:37,382
the conditions most likely to
result in a positive outcome.

478
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,925
Which you've done.

479
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:42,095
Which include the presence of
a surgeon with RSI experience.

480
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,805
Shaun, you're... you've
always been confident

481
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:46,224
in... in the O. R.

482
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,601
What is this about?

483
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:51,438
Having a surgeon with
relevant experience present

484
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:54,023
in case I need advice.

485
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:55,775
Well, what if I'm
busy? You're not.

486
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:57,777
What exactly about this
case is so concerning...

487
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,613
You have more RSI experience

488
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,240
than any surgeon
in this hospital.

489
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,201
That is why I would like
you in this surgery.

490
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,204
Please?

491
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,831
Alright, fine. I'll be there.

492
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:11,333
Please get changed.

493
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,800
I can't reach the
highest point from here.

494
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:23,121
Best way to hide the scars is
to go in above her hair line.

495
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,122
We'll need to shave
some of her hair.

496
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:32,896
Maybe not.

497
00:24:32,897 --> 00:24:34,565
Someone get me a comb.

498
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:39,736
Moving on to the hysterectomy.

499
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:42,947
Please clamp the uterine horns.

500
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,828
Grasping round ligament,

501
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:54,667
midway to the inter...
Internal inguinal...

502
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,294
Infection of the muscular layer

503
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,172
of the uterine wall has reduced.

504
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:02,383
Maybe we can save her uterus.

505
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:20,569
Shaun?

506
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,364
Come on.

507
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:27,575
Shaun.

508
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,411
Stick to the plan.

509
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,121
You cannot save the uterus.

510
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:36,877
Okay.

511
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:40,297
You are right.

512
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:44,926
Necrosis is too advanced.

513
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:48,179
Transfixion sutures
and hemoclip.

514
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,903
Hey.

515
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:08,449
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

516
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,077
Naveen is recovering well.

517
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:13,788
The surgery turned
out as expected.

518
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,582
You hesitated in the O. R.

519
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,125
What was that about?

520
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:20,712
I wanted to save her uterus.

521
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,464
Why'd you get stuck on not
doing the hysterectomy?

522
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,592
The patient wants
to carry a child.

523
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:27,927
Well, that's very empathetic.

524
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:30,264
I guess you... you developed
a personal connection?

525
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:38,187
Luna made the right decision

526
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:41,733
even if her wife will
never forgive her.

527
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,861
Are you worried that this
will hurt their marriage?

528
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:46,863
It doesn't matter,
okay? It doesn't matter.

529
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:50,825
What matters is
that she is alive.

530
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,619
We saved her life.

531
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,204
Well, that is one
thing that matters.

532
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:57,373
So is losing a
personal connection...

533
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:58,499
No, the medicine is...

534
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,210
Shaun, is this about Lim?

535
00:27:01,211 --> 00:27:03,880
What... What about her?

536
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:05,840
I don't know. I
just... It's...

537
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,050
Lim is still up...
upset with you.

538
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,343
She's still mad at you.

539
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:09,594
D-Does that bother you?

540
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:12,096
Dr. Lim and I have a
professional relationship...

541
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,806
No. No, you don't.

542
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,183
And you need to fix that.

543
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,768
The two of you need
to sort that out.

544
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,269
I don't know what
you want me to do.

545
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,896
I want you and Lim to
talk to each other.

546
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:21,022
She does not want to talk to me.

547
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:22,857
That depends on what
you have to say.

548
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,276
I have nothing to say.

549
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:29,614
Shaun, Lim is hurting, okay?

550
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,408
You are hurting.

551
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,410
Tell her that.

552
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:35,953
I mean, maybe... Maybe
she'll forgive you.

553
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:36,954
Maybe... Maybe she won't.

554
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,248
I don't know.

555
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:41,709
But the two of you
have to resolve this

556
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,836
for both of your sakes and mine.

557
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,390
Dr. Lim and I have a
professional relationship.

558
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:57,016
I do not need to talk to her.

559
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:58,643
I have to finish my op note now.

560
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:11,864
I've never done a
splenectomy that way either.

561
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:14,952
Cool surgery, not the
coolest circumstances.

562
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:20,248
Our patient went through
something terrible

563
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:22,709
and my initial reaction
was to judge her...

564
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,253
same way people judge me.

565
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:26,879
Don't beat yourself up.

566
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
You didn't know.

567
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:32,969
You're a good friend.

568
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,846
I know.

569
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,810
But...

570
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:45,231
I've been waiting to
be more than that,

571
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:47,192
and I don't think I
should do that anymore.

572
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,529
I'm gonna take a rain
check on research

573
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,073
and reschedule my date.

574
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:56,910
I think that's good.

575
00:28:58,162 --> 00:28:59,496
You deserve to be happy.

576
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:08,129
I have to go prep Toni.

577
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,353
I owe you an apology
for pressuring you.

578
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,360
I didn't do a rape kit.

579
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:35,073
And I've always regretted it.

580
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:39,495
And I didn't want
you to feel the same.

581
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:57,804
I was in medical school.

582
00:29:57,805 --> 00:30:01,641
He was a friend of a friend.

583
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:05,728
Somewhere along the way,
he became a stalker.

584
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:09,565
One night he showed
up at a bar I was at.

585
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:13,236
He followed me home.

586
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:15,531
I hated the idea of
being seen as a victim...

587
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,076
so I never told anyone.

588
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,261
I let that creep go.

589
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:42,766
And now I'll never know how
many other women he hurt.

590
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,854
But that's my regret.

591
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:50,648
And it's not fair
to put that on you.

592
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:28,937
I knew he liked me.

593
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,276
I should have made sure

594
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:37,988
that he knew it wasn't a date.

595
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,198
I shouldn't have had a drink.

596
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,784
I...

597
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:47,747
I don't even know

598
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:50,374
if I told him to stop.

599
00:31:57,007 --> 00:31:58,007
What if I didn't?

600
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:02,094
It is <i>not</i> your fault.

601
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:04,055
He took away your choice.

602
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:09,727
And now you have to do
what's best for you,

603
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,813
whatever that is.

604
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,733
Toni, time for surgery.

605
00:32:21,365 --> 00:32:22,573
Not yet.

606
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,789
There's still a little swelling,

607
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,375
but you'll have
minimal scarring.

608
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,966
They're gone.

609
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,718
Now those glasses will stay put.

610
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:45,179
Nice job with my braids.

611
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,264
Wasn't me.

612
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:51,435
Always wanted a daughter,
so I learned to braid.

613
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,355
Well, you might've found
a nice side hustle.

614
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:01,196
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

615
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,907
You're welcome.

616
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,338
Are you okay to continue?

617
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:20,506
Yes.

618
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:32,936
Are you okay to continue?

619
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:37,314
Yes.

620
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:48,492
Are you okay to continue?

621
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,914
Are you okay to continue?

622
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:00,922
Are you okay to continue?

623
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:07,845
Are you okay to continue?

624
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:13,017
Naveen, in the process
of removing the towel,

625
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,437
we also had to take your uterus.

626
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,565
We're so sorry.

627
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,317
There was no other way?

628
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,740
Yes, but I told them...

629
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:30,576
I told them to do it.

630
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:33,079
I needed you to survive.

631
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,664
Because you mean
everything to me.

632
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:37,708
And I failed at my
most important job...

633
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,002
Keeping you safe.

634
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:42,505
I failed you five
years ago in the O. R.

635
00:34:42,506 --> 00:34:44,757
And again yesterday.

636
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:47,384
I was so focused on
defending myself,

637
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,637
I wasn't thinking about
what you were going through,

638
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:50,514
how scared you were.

639
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,223
And I'm so, so sorry.

640
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,100
Whatever you need, if...
if you want me here

641
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:57,019
every step of the way, or...

642
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,522
out of the picture completely...

643
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,528
You better be here
every step of the way...

644
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:10,074
because I love you more
than anything, too.

645
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,832
I'm sorry.

646
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,553
How's she doing?

647
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,763
Surgery went well.

648
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,473
Her platelet count is turning
in the right direction.

649
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:36,475
Good.

650
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:37,893
And beyond the physical?

651
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:40,354
Too early to tell.

652
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:41,731
Recovery's a process.

653
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,945
All that time we were together,

654
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,406
why didn't you tell me?

655
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,703
Because I don't
need anyone's pity,

656
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:56,955
yours included.

657
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,792
It's in the past.

658
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:08,758
What you did for Toni,
that was really brave.

659
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,515
I'm here if you ever need
someone to be brave for you.

660
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,311
Thank you.

661
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:37,453
I need to talk to you
about your surgery.

662
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:40,039
I can't change what happened,

663
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,583
and I do not owe you an apology.

664
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:43,584
Dr. Murphy.

665
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:48,131
But I am sorry for other things.

666
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:55,095
In my RSI surgery today, the
medical choice was clear,

667
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,931
but I did not want to proceed

668
00:36:56,932 --> 00:37:01,018
because I knew what the
consequences would be.

669
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,604
In your surgery, the
medical choice was clear,

670
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:07,483
and I did proceed,

671
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:12,822
but I did not know what
the consequences would be.

672
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:16,325
I saved your life,

673
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:22,331
but my decision also
caused you harm.

674
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:26,253
When I saw you hurt
and bleeding...

675
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:33,092
I saw my brother
Steve, when he died.

676
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:34,969
When I thought I might lose you

677
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,264
the way I lost him,
I did not like that.

678
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:47,982
I am sorry...

679
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:50,401
this...

680
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,405
has been very hard for you.

681
00:37:55,365 --> 00:38:00,035
A medicine-only relationship
is... is not easy.

682
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:02,746
I...

683
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,749
It is not what I want.

684
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:09,086
I have missed your friendship.

685
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,176
I have missed you.

686
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:21,641
This has been...

687
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,313
really hard.

688
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,027
And my life is in
a good place now.

689
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:35,989
I'm happy.

690
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,327
But

691
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:45,289
still angry sometimes.

692
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,209
It may take a while
to let that go.

693
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:53,213
But...

694
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:58,552
I've missed you, too, Shaun.

695
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:08,187
Hey.

696
00:39:08,188 --> 00:39:11,649
You know, I love being the boss,
but connecting with patients

697
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,234
is the reason I got into
medicine in the first place.

698
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:17,404
And you made me remember that.

699
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:18,489
Thank you.

700
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,033
You're welcome.

701
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,705
Could I buy you a drink

702
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:29,708
as an apology for
being a pompous ass?

703
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,378
No.

704
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:36,007
Unless you throw in
some wings and fries.

705
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:38,842
Tough negotiator.

706
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,094
You know it.

707
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:48,394
Shaun came to see me.

708
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:50,562
We talked.

709
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:51,939
Thank you.

710
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,233
You're welcome.

711
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:56,235
Join me?

712
00:39:56,236 --> 00:39:58,737
I'm sure we can find
some cucumber water

713
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:00,531
around here somewhere.

714
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:01,825
Late dinner with Clay.

715
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,453
Good night.

716
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:17,340
Hey.

717
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:19,092
Hey.

718
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:27,851
Good night.

719
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,078
What was that?

720
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,248
I don't know.

721
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:04,178
You're back. Yes.

722
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:07,181
You told me I was isolating
myself in my other office.

723
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:09,349
Shaun, there's something
you should know.

724
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,479
Lim, when she was in her chair
and adjusted her position,

725
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,690
there was flexion and rotation
in the psoas and in the glutes.

726
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,693
There was movement.

727
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:23,322
She could walk again.
