1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,275
You're smiling.

2
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,424
Why?

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,842
Well...

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,968
That is...

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,470
your menstrual cycle.

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,014
It's been a year since
we lost the baby,

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,667
and I finished my
anti-coagulants.

8
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:18,776
Which means...

9
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,979
We can try to conceive again.

10
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,564
Mm-hmm. I have an appointment
with Dr. Winkler today.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,066
If she gives us the go-ahead...

12
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,734
A year was the minimum.

13
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,611
Good vibes, Shaun.

14
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:32,949
Send good vibes into the
universe, good things come back.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,659
Vibe with me, babe.

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,579
I would very much like
to have a baby with Lea!

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,081
Okay.

18
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,958
Well, get ready to make one.

19
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,418
Okay. We are going
to make a baby!

20
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,878
Yeah.

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,256
Mmm.

22
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,049
Mmm.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,509
Oh.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,221
I have 23 minutes until
I need to leave for work.

25
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,103
Should we save your swimmy
guys until I ovulate?

26
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,021
Oh, recent research demonstrated

27
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,440
frequent ejaculation
improves sperm motility.

28
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,568
Oh! In that case...

29
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,988
Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,205
We can talk about it.
Okay? Thanks so much.

31
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,087
Isabel.

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,258
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,845
Gena Cooper. Pregnant
with sextuplets.

34
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,014
That's what all my calls
and texts were about.

35
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,142
So you would already
know if you'd answered.

36
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,198
You show up, ask
me for a consult,

37
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,908
like you're any other doctor?

38
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,036
Whatever the appropriate
approach is for ex-wives,

39
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,331
tell me, and I'll take it.

40
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,752
Couple couldn't conceive,
so I prescribed clomiphene.

41
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,338
Six babies just after one round.

42
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,214
They won the lottery. Or lost.

43
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,216
Two require immediate
surgical intervention.

44
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,553
At least. Know any surgeons?

45
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,477
Marcus, this family
needs your help.

46
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,187
If needed, I will
step off the case

47
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,022
and I will find
them another O. B.

48
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,155
Stay.

49
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,784
It wouldn't be fair
to the patient.

50
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,290
Each of your babies gets their
own dedicated team of doctors.

51
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,667
Now, since all of
the babies will be

52
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,335
under 2 pounds at birth,

53
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,587
they will all need a
lot of care, attention,

54
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,840
and time in our NICU,
maturing those lungs.

55
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,303
Once they're feeling strong
enough to make some demands,

56
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,763
you'll hear that beautiful cry.

57
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,307
A baby crying is a good thing.

58
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,142
It lets us know
the baby's healthy.

59
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,103
And that's when we name them,

60
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,438
once they've cried and
we know they're okay.

61
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,317
I wish they could stay inside
Mom longer and get bigger.

62
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,153
Baby F's airway mass
is already causing

63
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,280
severe narrowing of the trachea,

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,907
and her lungs aren't
developing properly.

65
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,867
A few more days, and
her heart could fail.

66
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,286
So we deliver today. Yes.

67
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,913
Everyone ready?

68
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,754
Baby A through Baby E

69
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,048
will all be born in
under three minutes.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,592
Baby A.

71
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,845
At birth, they'll each
be given an Apgar score

72
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,680
to let us know how
they are doing.

73
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,433
7 or above is reassuring.

74
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,935
It's a girl.

75
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,396
Baby B.

76
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,106
Alright. Hello.

77
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,485
Baby A... Apgar 7.

78
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,324
It's a boy.

79
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,326
Surprise. Mono-di.

80
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,996
B and C share the same placenta.

81
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,748
Very rare. Identical twins.

82
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,584
Another boy, obviously.

83
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,295
Baby B... Apgar 5.

84
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,591
Baby C... Apgar 4.

85
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,718
Baby D.

86
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,854
It's... a boy.

87
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,152
Baby E.

88
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,487
Baby D... Apgar 6.

89
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,538
Spina bifida.

90
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,584
Baby E's a girl.

91
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,132
Baby E... Apgar 6.

92
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,717
Baby E
will go to the O. R.

93
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,178
For her spina bifida
surgery after delivery.

94
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,014
Exposing Baby
F to EXIT procedure.

95
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,351
Once Baby A through
Baby E are in the NICU,

96
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,729
Dr. Barnes will deliver
Baby F's arm and head

97
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,147
through the C-section incision,

98
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,732
leaving the placenta attached.

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,567
And, Mom, that allows you
to keep providing oxygen

100
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,944
to your daughter.

101
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,113
Nurse Denning, take Papa to
check on his other babies.

102
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,950
We're all good
here, Jack. Dr. Lim?

103
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,411
Then, Dr. Lim will perform
the EXIT procedure.

104
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,664
First time it's ever been
done in a multiple birth.

105
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,128
She's got this.

106
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,715
Moving through
the oropharynx cavity.

107
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,134
Baby F's umbilical cord
looks very thin and friable.

108
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,386
Placenta's still attached?

109
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,638
Yep. Mama's giving her
all the oxygen she needs.

110
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,099
At the larynx.
Approaching the trachea.

111
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,434
I've identified the cyst.

112
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,103
The pulse
is extremely faint.

113
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,063
The cyst is causing total
obliteration of the airway.

114
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,315
Microblator.

115
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,608
I've completely lost
the pulse in the cord.

116
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,026
We have less than a
minute to deliver.

117
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,361
Having trouble
visualizing the base.

118
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,487
Maybe you're not there yet?

119
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,072
Probing deeper. Keep going.

120
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,535
A little more. I see it.
You're two millimeters away.

121
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,955
Got it.

122
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,250
Cyst is decompressed.
Airway's open.

123
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,003
Placing E. T. tube.

124
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,299
Finally... Baby F.

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,217
It's a girl. Okay.

126
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,187
Good work.

127
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,607
Baby F... Apgar 5.

128
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,529
Thank you for taking this on.

129
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,531
The hard part's just beginning.

130
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,996
Okay.

131
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,999
Captions by VITAC...

132
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,102
Baby A's one and
five-minute Apgar?

133
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,562
Seven and nine.

134
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:36,273
Mom should be coming to.
Take her to meet her parents.

135
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:44,030
Keep B and C together.

136
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,699
We have two
different NICU rooms.

137
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,450
Neither boy is
crying, and co-bedding

138
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,744
identical-twin preemies
can be beneficial for both.

139
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:52,289
That's anecdotal. Risks
include poor thermoregulation,

140
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,540
increased... Just do it.

141
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,256
Baby D is not crying,

142
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:03,466
plus he has nevus simplex
and meconium-stained fluid.

143
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,635
Get the heel stick and go
tell the lab it's stat.

144
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:12,726
Spinal lesion covered
with sterile wet telfa.

145
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,060
Heading to O. R. 2.

146
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,313
Keep me posted.

147
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:20,650
And how's the star
of our show? Baby F.

148
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:23,069
Not singing yet,
but airway is clear.

149
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,655
Take her to NICU.
Hopefully she cries soon.

150
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:41,964
Hey. Hi.

151
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,341
My hero.

152
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:45,508
Where are my babies?

153
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:46,927
They're
in the NICU now.

154
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,470
Except for Baby A here.

155
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,396
She got a head
start on her siblings.

156
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,281
Listen to those healthy lungs.

157
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,117
Mm. First to cry.
She's an overachiever.

158
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,750
What do you think about Abigail?

159
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,502
Forever Baby A.

160
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,630
I love it. And her.

161
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,596
How 'bout it, B? Can we get
those lungs strong enough

162
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:34,015
to move you to a CPAP?

163
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:36,351
You hear those studies on
co-bedding identical preemies?

164
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:40,355
No. C's cyanotic. He's
tachypneic and retracting.

165
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:42,148
Check his liver.

166
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,526
The research is totally
shaded by confirmation bias.

167
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:47,904
Palpable three centimeters
below the costal margin.

168
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:50,699
If you'd been more assertive,
we wouldn't be stuck together.

169
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,659
Systolic murmur.

170
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,744
Why weren't you more assertive?

171
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,955
If I were a surgical
attending, I would have been.

172
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:58,540
I had to fight just
to be on this case.

173
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,458
You're gonna need an
echo, chest X-ray...

174
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,419
X-ray, BNP, and CBC to confirm
congestive heart failure.

175
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,129
I know.

176
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,587
Let's make a deal.

177
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,339
We only talk to each other
when medically necessary.

178
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,341
Fine.

179
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,182
Inset the needle in the
posterior iliac crest.

180
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:19,227
Later, I have to accompany
Lea to an OB-GYN appointment.

181
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:22,022
Dr. Andrews will supervise
you for a few hours.

182
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,398
Everything okay?

183
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,941
We don't know yet.

184
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:28,695
Last year, she
miscarried at 22 weeks.

185
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,197
Good precision.

186
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:35,410
When Baby D was first born,
you kinda took a moment.

187
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,245
That why?

188
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:38,456
Yes.

189
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,917
I think I've
penetrated the bone.

190
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,753
Syringe? No, you haven't.

191
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:47,630
You will hear and feel
a pop when you do.

192
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,091
Go a bit deeper.

193
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:54,637
Dr. Perez, you
need to be firmer.

194
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:55,931
More aggressive.

195
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,143
Go ahead.

196
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,901
Syringe?

197
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,740
Now? Yes.

198
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,495
As a surgeon, you must be
decisive and aggressive.

199
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:23,041
Aspirating the bone marrow.

200
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,542
Very good.

201
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,921
Get it to the lab for
microscopic analysis.

202
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,092
Good luck.

203
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,259
With the appointment.

204
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,470
You'll make a great dad.

205
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:39,557
You are not qualified
to make that prediction.

206
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,194
Incision immediately
lateral to the neural placode

207
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:52,779
into the epithelium.

208
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,823
Incision tight to the placode.

209
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:58,243
That method avoids leaving the
epithelials in the closure.

210
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,411
Is the play-by-play
really necessary?

211
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,664
It helps me to learn
by saying it out loud.

212
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,875
It helps me to do the
surgery if you don't.

213
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,639
You can talk. Just
not like Vin Scully.

214
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,142
Who's Vin Scully?
Alright, scrub out.

215
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,645
I'm kidding. Mostly.

216
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,109
The parents, Gena
and Jack? Heroes.

217
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,028
We might throw that word around
just a little too easily.

218
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,947
Think of the risk they took,

219
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,324
bringing six new
lives into the world.

220
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,160
Refusing to selectively reduce

221
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,162
is what got us here
in the first place.

222
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:43,955
Delivering 11 weeks pre-term

223
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,749
is a little bit less than ideal.

224
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,209
Like Dr. Andrews says,

225
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,336
we're going to beat the
odds and save them all.

226
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,673
Well, if we pull that off,
then we are the heroes.

227
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:58,012
Oxygenation dropped below 90.

228
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:01,764
We can't turn her over to
assess or treat her lungs.

229
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,392
We can't even do imaging.

230
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,104
We're gonna have to
tell the parents.

231
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,314
Prepare them.

232
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,154
I'll do it.

233
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,239
Are you sure?

234
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,992
You can't sugarcoat it.

235
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,044
Administer 2 mils
surfactant, prophylactically?

236
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,255
No indication of R. D. S.
She's on minimal settings.

237
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,376
I'd actually like to decrease
support and remove CPAP.

238
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:39,677
Yeah? No reason she
can't breathe on her own

239
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:41,554
now that her airway is clear.

240
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,395
Come on, Baby F.

241
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,813
Deep breaths.

242
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:59,405
Your basketball rival Clay
texted me, asked me out.

243
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,199
Get out.

244
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,368
I assure you, this guy
knows it's a real date.

245
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:04,827
If I go.

246
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:06,496
You're going.

247
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,376
That's our girl.

248
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,717
Baby E's lungs
are filled with fluid,

249
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,512
and she's in early
heart failure.

250
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:27,058
She may need to be reintubated,

251
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,811
which would mean
placing her on her back.

252
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:33,648
That would make it harder for
her surgical wound to heal.

253
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,692
That doesn't sound good.

254
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:36,986
She's very sick.

255
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,031
It's possible she
may not survive.

256
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,619
Mnh.

257
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:49,540
We'll pray for a miracle.

258
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,459
It wouldn't be our first.

259
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,972
I can arrange a visit from the
hospital chaplain if you like.

260
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,515
You can baptize the baby.

261
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,142
No.

262
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,520
You're asking me to let her
go. I'm not ready to do that.

263
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,649
You can't, either.

264
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,026
Please.

265
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,117
Of course.

266
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:39,940
O2 sats improving.

267
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,275
Way to go, Baby B.

268
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:42,776
You'll be shouting in no time.

269
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,534
Tell me you're not on Tinder.

270
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:52,703
You're in violation of the
medicine-only agreement

271
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:53,912
that you proposed.

272
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,873
And I'm not on Tinder.

273
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,374
My baby's on the mend.

274
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,459
Yours is the one with
the heart problem.

275
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,420
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

276
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:04,047
Then what's with all the
handsome dudes' faces

277
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,133
you're scrolling through?

278
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:08,678
Your screen is
reflected in the window.

279
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:12,472
Not that it's any of
your business, Columbo,

280
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,850
but they're not
dates. They're donors.

281
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,351
Organ donors? Finally
getting a heart?

282
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,313
Mm. Sperm.

283
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,190
Oh.

284
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:22,525
Yeah. "Oh."

285
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:30,115
Snowman sign on the chest X-ray.

286
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,325
It could be T. A. P. V. R.,

287
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:32,951
transposition of
the great vessels,

288
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,204
Ebstein anomaly, or
pulmonary atresia.

289
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:37,247
I don't see
differential cyanosis.

290
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,541
That rules out transposition
of the great vessels.

291
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,918
No boot-shaped heart, either.

292
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,711
Or gallop.

293
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,963
So it is T. A. P. V. R.

294
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,674
Which we can fix.

295
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,386
I'll get the parents' consent
and book an O. R. right away.

296
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,224
Thanks for the help.

297
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,231
Lucky I was a match. Yes.

298
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:05,734
As Baby D's father, there
was only a 38.5% chance

299
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,527
you'd be a bone-marrow match.

300
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,112
Why are you here?

301
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,240
Being on your feet
promotes blood flow,

302
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:13,742
and she wanted to
be with her husband.

303
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:15,619
I'm just glad I
can do something.

304
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,580
Gena's handled all the heavy
lifting for our family.

305
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,457
You have no idea how hard
this kind of stuff can be.

306
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,917
I do.

307
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,045
My wife and I have also
struggled to have a child.

308
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,005
Modern medicine's a miracle.

309
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,757
I hope you'll be
blessed like us.

310
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:31,134
I hope so, too.

311
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,637
But not as blessed.

312
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:39,893
I will insert the large bore
needle into your hip now.

313
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,063
Ugh. I hate needles.

314
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,856
How'd you two meet?

315
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,276
He was my prom date.

316
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:48,652
Been together ever since?

317
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:50,279
Uh, no.

318
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,115
Gena ran off to New York for a
decade to join the City Ballet.

319
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:57,369
Until I broke my ankle,
ended my career, came home.

320
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,081
We reconnected at our
10-year high-school reunion.

321
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:02,791
It was like no time had passed.

322
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,543
I never forgot her.

323
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,753
I never forgot you, either.

324
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:07,964
Done!

325
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,592
You get me yammering
on about Gena,

326
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,052
and I barely even notice a
needle going into my bone.

327
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,096
You did great. We'll
get this to the lab

328
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,308
and then transfuse it
into Baby D right away.

329
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,103
Nice work in there.

330
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,023
Baby C should be
crying in no time.

331
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:29,485
Are you sure you want to
raise a baby on your own?

332
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,073
Because I'm too careerist
to be a good mom?

333
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,700
Like I was too ambitious
to be a good girlfriend?

334
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:39,578
No.

335
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:42,664
You'll love your kid more
than any job or partner.

336
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,499
I sure do.

337
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,127
But if you don't have the
guy when you have the kid,

338
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:49,921
he might be tough to find.

339
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:54,217
I shouldn't have a kid 'cause
I may never find a man?

340
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,677
Okay, caveman.

341
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,013
Well, I never said I
wouldn't date a single mom,

342
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,223
but I am remarkably sensitive.

343
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,601
I want a kid, and
I'm done waiting.

344
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:04,811
See you back in the NICU.

345
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:18,450
She's improving. And hungry.

346
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,536
All ready for some colostrum.

347
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,164
Did you text Clay back yet?

348
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:27,501
After this, we can start
introducing a pacifier.

349
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,587
I didn't have sex for 17
months after I lost my leg.

350
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,464
And then, when I did, I thought,

351
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:36,009
"Oh, yeah. I remember
this. It's awesome."

352
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,804
It's a first date. I'm not
even thinking about sex.

353
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:41,139
Liar.

354
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,518
These make these chairs
that glide. And wedges.

355
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,478
This is not a death
sentence to your sex life.

356
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,271
Okay, I will text him back,

357
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,816
mostly to stop
this conversation.

358
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:53,110
Hm. But it's just dinner.

359
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,569
For now.

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,157
Damn. She's not
tolerating the colostrum.

361
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:00,701
I haven't started it yet.

362
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,375
So you guys ready to
start trying again?

363
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:11,586
Oh, yes. We put up a
calendar this morning.

364
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,171
And practiced.

365
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,133
I think she gets it, Shaun.

366
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,928
Visualizing the uterine wall.

367
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,227
That's scar tissue.

368
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,438
That sounds bad.

369
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:32,441
It's from the fetoscopic
surgery and D&C

370
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:33,859
after your miscarriage.

371
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,362
You should do a hysteroscopy
to remove the adhesions.

372
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,031
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

373
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,827
He's right. Uh, we can
attempt that, but...

374
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,455
You have Asherman's Syndrome.

375
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,543
Most likely, yes.

376
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:54,880
Well, can... Can we
still start trying?

377
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:56,132
I wouldn't advise it.

378
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,887
How much longer do
we have to wait?

379
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:04,055
I recommend continuing
birth control.

380
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,516
Getting pregnant right now
wouldn't be safe for you...

381
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,101
or the baby.

382
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,193
When will it be safe?

383
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:18,362
Maybe another year? Maybe two.

384
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,407
Maybe never.

385
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,667
Severe edema,
fluid in the lungs,

386
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,961
but no obstructions,
just as we expected.

387
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,714
So we've eliminated
brain, spine, abdomen,

388
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:54,007
anything congenital.

389
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:57,301
I shouldn't have let
you talk to them.

390
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:59,846
Miracles? Really?

391
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:00,847
I was direct and honest.

392
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:02,432
How's that being honest?

393
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,100
They think there's
a chance here.

394
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,893
As long as she's breathing,
her heart is beating,

395
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:08,020
her brain is functioning,
there's still hope.

396
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:10,523
This infant is under two pounds,

397
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:13,317
11 weeks premature, with
a major birth defect.

398
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:15,361
She's more than likely
too small, too weak,

399
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:17,280
and too sick to survive.

400
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:24,912
Stop being a cheerleader.
Start being a doctor.

401
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:33,504
O2 sats and heart
rate are improving.

402
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,758
Come on, dude. Cry for me.

403
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,509
You got this.

404
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,178
Who's a star?

405
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,347
Baby B is. He's
coming off the vent.

406
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:46,309
Yes, you are. And then
you're gonna wail.

407
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,353
Those guys you were
looking at earlier...

408
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:51,147
How much do you really
know about them?

409
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:52,315
You'd be surprised.

410
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:54,192
Well, besides their
physical attributes

411
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:56,277
and what diseases they carry.

412
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:58,446
Genetics can also determine
your sense of humor,

413
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:00,072
your values...

414
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:01,449
You want me to
have the sperm bank

415
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,992
ask them all to write
a knock-knock joke

416
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,619
and an answer to
the trolley problem?

417
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,330
Or ask me.

418
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,583
I'm not suggesting
I'd be the kid's dad.

419
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,585
I just want to help.

420
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:13,879
No strings attached.

421
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:19,884
Uh, Baby B's on
CPAP. O2 sats rising.

422
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:21,385
Hope to hear a cry son.

423
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:23,931
Excellent. Still no
cry from C, either?

424
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:26,974
Okay. Scope the baby.

425
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:29,602
T.A.P.V.R. repair may have
caused vocal cord palsy.

426
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:41,072
No missed or new
obstructive issues.

427
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:42,698
Upper airway's clean.

428
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:44,492
Why are her O2 sats plummeting?

429
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,118
Could be some sort of fistula,

430
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,578
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

431
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:50,874
R.D.S. Or it could
be neurological.

432
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:55,712
She's too fragile to
start testing blind.

433
00:23:57,297 --> 00:24:00,174
I'll stay with her.
Put her back on CPAP.

434
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:01,717
I'll put together a
full differential.

435
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:03,178
Eat something
while you're at it.

436
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,268
Marrow transplant
seems to be working,

437
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:12,979
but I couldn't pass the
NG tube into the stomach.

438
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,356
How'd the appointment go?

439
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:18,484
Not well.

440
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:19,611
Are you okay?

441
00:24:21,947 --> 00:24:23,240
No.

442
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:29,120
How long has he been drooling?

443
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,706
I don't know. I...
thought that was normal.

444
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:34,458
- It's not.
- Any luck with the NG tube?

445
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:38,546
No. That is a symptom.
This baby cannot swallow.

446
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:40,840
He has a congenial
tracheoesophageal fistula.

447
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,384
We need to operate.

448
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:48,306
Camera is in position.

449
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,182
Fistula's between
the distal esophagus

450
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:51,642
and the trachea.

451
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:52,643
You were right.

452
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:55,813
I know. Now reconnect
the esophagus.

453
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,607
Forceps.

454
00:24:57,608 --> 00:24:59,400
Repositioning thoracoscope.

455
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:01,402
Got it.

456
00:25:01,403 --> 00:25:03,613
Mobilizing the esophagus to
the level of the trachea.

457
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:05,406
Have you already
isolated the fistula?

458
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,741
Yes.

459
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:09,410
I didn't tell you to do that.

460
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:11,454
Uh... You should
have first mobilized

461
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:14,081
the proximal pouch
of the esophagus.

462
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:15,207
I'm s... I'm so... I'm sorry.

463
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,126
You have have interrupted
the blood supply.

464
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,669
The risk of anastomosis leaks

465
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,838
and tissue breakdown
are greater now.

466
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,590
Give
me the instrument.

467
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:23,759
Step back.

468
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,011
Move.

469
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:29,680
Take the camera.

470
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,103
Suturing.

471
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,398
Is he gonna be okay?

472
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,777
I don't know.

473
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:53,998
When I said "yes" to dinner,
I didn't mean tonight.

474
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,668
Patience is not my
greatest virtue.

475
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,462
I'm in the middle of
this preemie case.

476
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:01,339
So you fasting until it's done?

477
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,312
Brought your
favorite. Roast chicken.

478
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:19,440
Oh. It's like the first
time you asked me out.

479
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:20,859
Mm-hmm.

480
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:24,487
She's breathing on her own.

481
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:25,988
Nice.

482
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:28,657
I don't envy anyone
who has to try to sleep

483
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:29,992
in a house with six infants.

484
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:31,494
Mm-hmm.

485
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:32,578
No matter how cute they are.

486
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:34,539
I feel that way about one.

487
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,417
Oh.

488
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,628
Are... you opposed to kids?

489
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:43,422
I mean, not politically.

490
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:44,841
But...?

491
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,557
I'm not sure I
want any of my own.

492
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,603
Is that bad?

493
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:02,858
Being one of four, I...

494
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:05,237
I always saw myself
with a big family.

495
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:09,073
Being one of eight...

496
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,617
Pretty much why
I don't want one.

497
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:22,086
Ice Cube, Guy Fieri, Tom Hanks.

498
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:23,754
Everybody loves Hanks.

499
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:25,005
Not Tom Hanks.

500
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:27,091
Raider Nation is
deep and eclectic.

501
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,219
I promise I don't paint my
face. Unless it's the playoffs.

502
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,346
Oh. So only one
day per decade.

503
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:35,099
Okay.
Opposite sides of the Bay.

504
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,059
That's why they have a bridge.

505
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,561
I can't believe you were
actually there for "The Catch."

506
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:41,272
Were you sitting on
that side of the field

507
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,649
where Clark caught it?

508
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,612
Yep. You're distracted.

509
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:51,408
Want to walk me through
your case so far?

510
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,954
EXIT procedure for CHAOS.
Cyst was decompressed.

511
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,581
We weaned her off
CPAP, O2 sats improved,

512
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,041
then started crashing.

513
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,918
Not sure why.

514
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,503
Pass me the ghost
pepper sauce, would ya?

515
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:07,673
Ooh. Feel like that stuff's
gonna burn a hole in my chest.

516
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:09,508
What if your preemie's breathing
troubles aren't from above?

517
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,094
What if it's from below?

518
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:16,140
Diaphragmatic hernia.

519
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:18,642
Could allow the baby's
lower organs to protrude

520
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,978
into her chest, crowd her lungs.

521
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:23,314
If it started as a small
defect, we could easily miss it

522
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,482
on ultrasound with all
the crowding in that womb.

523
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:27,609
Mm-hmm.

524
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,946
Smart, handsome, and
you brought me food.

525
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:33,324
I might actually let you
take me out on a real date.

526
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,159
This is a real date.

527
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,078
I mean, it will be once we kiss.

528
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:45,461
Then we should
probably do that now.

529
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:48,005
My thought exactly.

530
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,524
Thank you for your offer.

531
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:08,525
But?

532
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:12,279
It would hurt too much
to see you every time

533
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,405
I looked at my kid.

534
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:31,173
The live birth
rate in pregnancies

535
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:34,718
after Asherman's
treatment is 67%.

536
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,262
She should have mentioned that.

537
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,475
Yeah. I guess so.

538
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:45,104
And hysteroscopy...

539
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:48,982
improves the odds of conception.

540
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:52,236
Our prognosis for conception
may still be very good.

541
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:57,449
I'm "sending good vibes
into the universe,

542
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,577
so good things come back."

543
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,163
Thank you, Shaun.

544
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:05,583
Maybe later.

545
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,753
Right now I'm just very sad.

546
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:18,345
I know.

547
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:37,614
O2 sats are falling. I need
suction and a ventilator.

548
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:40,742
Page Andrews.
She's bradycardic.

549
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,244
She's not getting enough oxygen.

550
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:10,940
O2 sats are rising.
Heart rate's normal.

551
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:14,359
She's fine.

552
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,653
Just forgot to breathe.

553
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:18,780
It happens when
they're this little.

554
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:34,796
I'm gonna go home.

555
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:36,507
You're giving up?

556
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,217
I'm accepting the situation.

557
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:39,801
There's still hope.

558
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:41,386
Stop with the hope
already, will ya?

559
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:43,055
It's not gonna save this child.

560
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:45,682
Hypnagogia.

561
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:48,018
Thomas Edison believed
the thoughts generated

562
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:49,603
as we drift off to sleep

563
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,438
were the most likely to
generate a breakthrough.

564
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,107
Alright, Thomas Edison,
the Wizard of Menlo Park,

565
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,736
the same guy who believed
that if he sat on a goose egg,

566
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:01,073
he could actually make
the goose egg hatch.

567
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:03,242
There was an experiment
published in Science.

568
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:05,452
Subjects tried to solve
a difficult math problem

569
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:07,996
late at night while
holding something heavy.

570
00:32:07,997 --> 00:32:09,331
When they drifted off to
sleep, they dropped it,

571
00:32:09,332 --> 00:32:11,416
and when they woke up,
they solved the problem.

572
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:13,001
Okay, when I go to bed tonight,

573
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,796
I'll cuddle with a barbell
while holding onto a light bulb.

574
00:32:15,797 --> 00:32:17,464
How's that?

575
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:18,966
Any breakthroughs on Baby E?

576
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:20,676
We've exhausted all our options.

577
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:22,970
We're moving on to
"watch and wait."

578
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:25,013
We were just talking
about hypnagogia.

579
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:27,474
The Edison sleep theory
from Science magazine?

580
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,268
Thought we might stay all night

581
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,103
and take turns
waking each other.

582
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:32,563
Well, that's...

583
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,983
Absurd? Silly? Ridiculous?

584
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:39,027
I was gonna say that's
better than "watch and wait."

585
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,537
You were right. Baby F has
a diaphragmatic hernia.

586
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,580
It didn't show up in
the initial X-ray.

587
00:32:58,581 --> 00:32:59,873
Anybody would have missed it.

588
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,710
It was Clay's idea.

589
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,754
I'm glad that I texted
him to bring you dinner.

590
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:07,339
You did not.

591
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,758
I did.

592
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,844
Well played.

593
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:16,390
After we get consent,
you can scrub in,

594
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:18,600
help me make that
little girl all better.

595
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:44,501
Hypnagogia! Ahh!

596
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,087
What?

597
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,133
The groin. What?

598
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,344
What? The groin?

599
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:57,473
If we can't access the baby's
chest, we can check the groin.

600
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,975
If she has bounding
femoral pulses...

601
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:02,603
It would indicate a
patent ductus arteriosus.

602
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:04,438
Which would explain the
fluid in her lungs and the...

603
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,856
The heart failure,
which could be fixed

604
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:08,984
with a Piccolo Occluder.

605
00:34:08,985 --> 00:34:11,029
Go get consent.
And an aspirin.

606
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:14,281
Uh, wait.

607
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:15,699
What is it?

608
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,451
If we can't put the
baby on her back,

609
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:19,162
how are we gonna
insert the device?

610
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,252
I'll get comfortable.

611
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,130
You scream in my face this time.

612
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:33,008
He's swallowing now.

613
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,511
But still not crying.

614
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:38,056
Ready to show your
brother how it's done?

615
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:02,121
Very polite of you to
wait for your brother.

616
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:05,416
Maybe there was something to
that shady co-bedding research.

617
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,210
Maybe you being a wuss was
a blessing in disguise.

618
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:17,428
It would have hurt me,
too... Having a kid with you

619
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,388
and not being part
of your lives.

620
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:29,022
Gaining access through
the umbilical vessels...

621
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:31,316
That was inspiring.

622
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:33,570
I credit Thomas
Edison. As you should.

623
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:39,491
Seriously, thank
you for humoring

624
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:42,161
my crazy idea, Dr. Glassman.

625
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:45,831
Thank you for helping me
to not give up on hope.

626
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:58,303
Come on, buddy. Let
me hear that cry.

627
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:05,560
Heart rate 110 BPM.
Respiratory 65.

628
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:10,147
Look. I'm so sorry.

629
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:13,901
I thought I was...
being decisive.

630
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:16,195
You were.

631
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:17,697
It was the wrong decision.

632
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:46,392
He will be okay.

633
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:51,772
You should feel bad,
but not too bad.

634
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:01,907
Sextuplet births
are incredibly rare,

635
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:04,618
one in almost 4 billion,

636
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,623
and the odds of 100%
survival are even rarer.

637
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:12,501
But I'm happy to report
all six babies are healthy

638
00:37:12,502 --> 00:37:14,753
and all six babies
will be going home.

639
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:25,514
It wasn't easy, but
because of all of you...

640
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:27,391
they made it.

641
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:28,684
Some of our friends...

642
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:31,061
Mnh-mnh. That's a
thicket of chest hair.

643
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,771
Mm. Chances are, his back...

644
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,565
Mnh.

645
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:38,026
Because of your hard
work, we're able to now...

646
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:39,319
Breakfast on me if you help me

647
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,530
make a list of
acceptable prospects.

648
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,199
I just wanted to
personally thank you.

649
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,661
And the parents, Gena and Jack,
they want to thank you, as well.

650
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:50,914
This is a time to celebrate.

651
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:54,209
B's competitive. He likes to do
everything before his brother.

652
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,712
And C's an empath,
waited until he knew

653
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:58,714
his brother would be okay
before doing his thing.

654
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:03,969
Hi.

655
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:09,141
Hi.

656
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:11,226
Byron and Christopher?

657
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:12,562
Yeah.

658
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:17,692
E.J. Her name is E. J.

659
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:21,737
It stands for Erin Jordan.

660
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:23,488
Thank you both.

661
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:33,040
Meet Baby F.

662
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:36,376
Hi.

663
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,132
Francesca?

664
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:47,471
But Gena and Jack
are first-time parents

665
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,431
who will be bringing
home six babies,

666
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:51,141
so they're gonna
need lots of help.

667
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:53,894
Now, for those of you who
are willing to continue,

668
00:38:53,895 --> 00:38:56,355
once the babies are at home,

669
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:59,274
there's a volunteer sign-up
sheet at the check-in desk.

670
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:01,443
I'm sure Gena and
Jack would be grateful

671
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:03,528
for any help you're
willing to give.

672
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,661
So you had a goth mom?

673
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:12,663
She sang you "Boys Don't
Cry" as a lullaby, right?

674
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:14,122
Oh, yeah.

675
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:16,625
She'd pick me up at school
blasting Joy Division, too.

676
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:18,418
Humiliated me at the time.

677
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:22,297
But... she was a good mom.

678
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:24,216
My dad used to sing
"Ein Keloheinu"

679
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:25,801
louder than everyone in shul.

680
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:28,553
I... hated it.

681
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:30,139
Which was probably the point.

682
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,020
Could be fun to embarrass
our kids some day.

683
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,147
Far, far in the future.

684
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:45,154
Thank you. Okay.

685
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,826
I'm glad I brought
this case to you.

686
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,286
Me too.

687
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:57,207
Marcus. I'm sorry.

688
00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:00,169
For giving up on
us. For cheating.

689
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:03,840
It's the worst
mistake I ever made.

690
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,719
It wasn't all you.

691
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,470
I don't know that I gave up,

692
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:13,182
but I certainly didn't
pay enough attention.

693
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:18,520
Gena and Jack grew apart...

694
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:20,939
but they found each other again.

695
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,400
It's a nice story.

696
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:26,194
Yeah.

697
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:27,821
Nice.

698
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:40,375
Derek.

699
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:47,674
Say "grilled cheese" six times!

700
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:51,011
Grilled cheese.
