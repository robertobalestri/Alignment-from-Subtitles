1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,711
Oh. Good morning.

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,034
Not so much.

3
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:07,136
Sorry. I hate when
repair guys are late.

4
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:08,407
He wasn't late.

5
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:11,457
He realized that my
"isolated termite presence"

6
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:14,908
is actually more of a complete
and total termite infestation.

7
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,351
I have to tent
my house. Oh, no.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,101
So, you had to pack up
all your clothes and food?

9
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:21,169
Vikane gas doesn't
affect clothes,

10
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:23,439
but you should definitely
throw out all your food

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,565
when you go home.

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,983
Already did.

13
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,290
Where are you gonna stay?

14
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,115
Oh. You should stay
in our guest room.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,159
I'll stay at a
hotel or something.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,271
But you hate sleeping in hotels.

17
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,591
I hate intruding on my
friends, and I hate intruding

18
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,101
on my friends' pregnant
wives even more.

19
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:45,086
I-It's not an
intrusion. Stay with us.

20
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,653
I'm okay. Thank you, though.

21
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,554
We want to. Absolutely.

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,070
We insist.

23
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,575
Okay.

24
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,164
Thank you.

25
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,425
It's delicious.
It's disgusting.

26
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,950
And it helps me poop.

27
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,647
I did not need to know
that. Well, you're a doctor.

28
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,857
You obviously know what prune
juice does to a man's...

29
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,026
Shut up. I'm trying to eat.

30
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:12,978
Oh. Coffee <i>and</i> a Red Bull.

31
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,129
You prepping for
a post-breakfast

32
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:16,446
MMA match there, big guy?

33
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,245
I was up late, need a boost.

34
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,955
I was catching up
on some journals,

35
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,873
and I've already
been to a meeting.

36
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,792
Check my sign-off
sheet if you want.

37
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,876
I didn't say anything.

38
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,045
You don't need to.

39
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,215
Wolke and Perez,
you're with me today.

40
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,675
I thought we were
scheduled with Park.

41
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,554
I just had to fire one resident,
and you two are on probation.

42
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,682
Not exactly my vision
for the department.

43
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,975
Felt like it was time for me

44
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,476
to take a more
hands-on approach,

45
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,104
see how your surgical
educations are progressing.

46
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,189
We round in five.
Don't be late.

47
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,404
I want to do another
embryo transfer ASAP.

48
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,780
Three months <i>is</i> ASAP.

49
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,490
Not if we restart my
hormone injections,

50
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,783
add Methylprednisolone,

51
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,202
and do prophylactic
endometrial scratching.

52
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,831
A more aggressive uterine
prep means more side effects.

53
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,958
I can handle it.

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,294
Morgan, I understand
your impatience,

55
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,504
but one unsuccessful embryo
transfer is no reason...

56
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,345
I want to do whatever it
takes to get pregnant.

57
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,217
Now.

58
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,054
Not in three months.

59
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,764
Okay.

60
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,015
We'll start the hormones

61
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,434
and the
Methylprednisolone today.

62
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,354
I have a new idea.

63
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,732
The echo results were that bad?

64
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,360
Your heart muscle's
deteriorating way too fast.

65
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,279
We don't have time to
wait for a matching donor,

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,947
so we're gonna fix
the one you have.

67
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,616
We're going to remove
the scar tissue,

68
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,118
use a synthetic patch, along
with your healthy tissue

69
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,204
to reshape your
ventricle over a balloon.

70
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,539
It's kind of like papier-mâché.

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,960
If that's possible, why
didn't we do it sooner?

72
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,921
It's a challenging
surgical technique.

73
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,298
Which makes it right in
Dr. Lim's wheelhouse.

74
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,511
But I'm confident it's the
best option for your situation.

75
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,015
This surgery is amazing.

76
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,433
How did you even
come up with it?

77
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,019
I didn't. It's a modified
"Dor Procedure"...

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,689
Basically an endoventricular
patch plasty.

79
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,149
There's nothing basic about
it. I'm really excited.

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,652
Spare me. What?

81
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,113
Stroking my ego isn't gonna
get you off of probation.

82
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,155
I am not stroking your ego.

83
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,367
I am sincerely...
Start with a D.E. MRI

84
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,452
to map the scar versus
functional tissue,

85
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,455
while I finalize
the surgical plan.

86
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,543
Dr. Perez, what do I
need from this MRI?

87
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,212
Completely pristine images
of right ventricular scarring

88
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,298
without artifact or distortion.

89
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,509
No room for error on this.

90
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,600
- - Captions by VITAC...

91
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,693
There's a small mass.

92
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,028
Her pediatrician
said it was a cyst.

93
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,363
He doesn't think
she needs surgery

94
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,574
but suggested we get a consult.

95
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,910
She definitely needs surgery.

96
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,247
It's a minor
outpatient procedure.

97
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,207
She's only 13 with
no previous symptoms.

98
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,667
It's most likely benign.

99
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,795
We will need to do a needle
biopsy and a CT to confirm.

100
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,547
What's a needle biopsy?

101
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,674
It's kind of like a shot.

102
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,384
In my belly?

103
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,179
Honey, it's okay.
You'll be fine.

104
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,930
Mom, no.

105
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,348
Mnh.

106
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,975
Can you do it
while she's asleep?

107
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,853
General anesthesia would
add unnecessary risk

108
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,354
to a needle biopsy.

109
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:36,066
Please, I can't do this.

110
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,985
Kelli, we're gonna numb you

111
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,489
and you'll close your
eyes, hold your mom's hand,

112
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,700
and count to 10, and
then it'll all be over.

113
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,664
Do you promise?

114
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,874
Absolutely.

115
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,593
This is not good.

116
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,094
Looks good to me.

117
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,305
Any end systolic
volume less than 200

118
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,389
is within parameters.

119
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,059
I mean Lim's idea
for Bob's surgery.

120
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,393
You said it was amazing.

121
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,686
That was before I'd
done enough research

122
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,813
to actually understand it.

123
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,065
It's way too risky.
You're just mad

124
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,483
because she called you
out for brown-nosing.

125
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,859
I was sincerely psyched.

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,402
And now, after
reading one article...

127
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,446
I've read five.

128
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,823
And right-sided failure

129
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,157
has resulted in
negative outcomes

130
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,535
in every case I've reviewed.

131
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,956
Lim's been treating
this guy for years,

132
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,208
knows the case way better.

133
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,001
Yeah, she also knows
the patient better,

134
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,795
which could be impacting
her objectivity.

135
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,090
You want to question the
Chief Surgeon's objectivity?

136
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,552
No, I want to suggest she
reconsider her strategy.

137
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,428
I wouldn't.

138
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,597
Why?

139
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,057
'Cause you're scared of her?

140
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,226
Yes. And you should be, too.

141
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,563
My OD and you and
Powell going rogue,

142
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,898
I'd rather not add to...

143
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,035
Can you show Mr. Zegras
how to apply the eye drops?

144
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,161
Sure. No problem.

145
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,044
Good job.

146
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,594
Hey.

147
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,263
I just closed a deal

148
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,974
with one of the biggest
CROs on the West Coast.

149
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,726
They're going to consolidate
all their clinical trials

150
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,769
at St. Bonaventure.

151
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,314
That's awesome.

152
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,399
Unless you're telling
me because you plan

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,443
to close the clinic to
make room for the CRO.

154
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,905
I have the space,
but what I don't have

155
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,198
is a smart, aggressive,
ambitious physician

156
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,744
to manage the partnership
and serve as P.I.

157
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,911
You interested?

158
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,830
I-I'm flattered.

159
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,206
It'll be a ton of work

160
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,667
but a great opportunity
for St. Bon's and yourself.

161
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,919
I agree.

162
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,796
It's just a bit unexpected.

163
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,257
Can I think about it?

164
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,468
Of course.

165
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,094
Take some time.

166
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,554
But not too much.

167
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,723
I'll need an answer by Friday.

168
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,695
There's almost no
viable cardiac tissue.

169
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,406
And poor contractions
in what little there is.

170
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,659
There's still an
area of tissue left

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,661
that could be viable after CABG.

172
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,496
We can't start
surgery just hoping

173
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,873
there's enough tissue to
reshape the ventricle.

174
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,250
That's an inherent
risk to this approach.

175
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,585
If you have another idea?

176
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,879
A BiVAD with an
unmatched donor heart.

177
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,506
Considered it and ruled it out.

178
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,175
He'd reject an unmatched donor
heart in less than a year.

179
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,220
Beats dying on the table
in less than 24 hours.

180
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,971
I appreciate your opinion.

181
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,557
Not a huge fan of the tone.

182
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,892
Sorry.

183
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,396
If we put Bob on longer
term anti-rejection meds,

184
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,690
that would buy several more
months for the unmatched heart.

185
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,692
During which time, he'd
be completely vulnerable

186
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,528
to infection.

187
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,447
I know SVR is high risk,
but given Bob's condition,

188
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,117
I'm convinced it's the only
solution to keep him alive

189
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,036
long enough to find a
matching donor heart.

190
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,621
I plan to spend some time

191
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,415
rehearsing every surgical step.

192
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,917
I'd suggest you two do the same.

193
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,677
Why did you say yes?

194
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,264
It was one of those moments
when you say the thing

195
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,265
a polite person is
supposed to say.

196
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,725
Mm-hmm.

197
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,769
Even as you're realizing
you don't mean it at all.

198
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,771
Okay. It'll be fine.

199
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,857
You'll be at work all
day, and at night,

200
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,483
I'm sure Glassman will
just sit in a corner

201
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,777
and read the latest
presidential biography.

202
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,281
That's... oddly specific.

203
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,241
Old dudes love reading
about presidents.

204
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,452
They fantasize about how they
would've done it all better.

205
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,754
What's wrong?

206
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,672
It's not a cyst.

207
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,883
It's an invasive
hydatidiform mole.

208
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,093
Interesting.

209
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,928
That type of tumor
could only occur

210
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,474
from a mutated fertilized egg.

211
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,643
She has had sex.

212
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:26,023
She's only 13, which means
even if she consented,

213
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,524
it's statutory rape.

214
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,077
There's a new
problem. Actually two.

215
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,496
This type of tumor is caused by
a mutation in a fertilized egg,

216
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,539
which means the surgery
will be more difficult.

217
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,959
It also means your daughter
has had sexual intercourse.

218
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,047
Wait, but I'm on birth
control, and we use condoms.

219
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,674
How could I be pregnant?
You're not pregnant.

220
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,969
The implanted egg mutated into
a tumor instead of a fetus.

221
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,223
And no birth control
is 100% effective.

222
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,475
But you can still
remove it, right?

223
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,227
Yes.

224
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,938
Y-You don't seem
surprised to learn

225
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,815
your daughter's had sex.

226
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,733
I'm not learning it.

227
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,486
She's been going steady
with Ryan for over a year.

228
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,155
He's in her grade.

229
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,448
He's sweet.

230
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,992
A 13-year-old child
should not be having sex.

231
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,787
I'm not a child, and me
and Ryan love each other.

232
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,331
And if I want to have sex
with him, it's my decision.

233
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,958
You're okay with this?

234
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,126
Teenagers are gonna do it

235
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,669
no matter what
their parents say.

236
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,838
So instead of forcing
her to sneak around,

237
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,383
I chose to talk to her about
safe sex, birth control,

238
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,594
and help her have a
positive experience.

239
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,012
Your daughter...

240
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,765
Is scheduled for surgery
tomorrow morning.

241
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,939
And as I deflate the balloon...

242
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,733
I'll remove the final clamps.

243
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,238
That was... awesome.

244
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,448
Still not sure it's gonna work,

245
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,325
but it'll definitely
be exciting.

246
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,619
I'd keep the pessimism
to yourself this time.

247
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,746
Okay, I'm not a
pessimist... I'm a realist.

248
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,748
Who's on probation.

249
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,334
I know. Lim is a grown-up.

250
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,128
She wants her ideas
to be challenged.

251
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,255
It's part of our job to do it.

252
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,842
In recovery, we talk a lot
about the value of humility.

253
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,635
Hey, Lim is not a higher power.

254
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,804
And you're confusing being
humble with being a wuss.

255
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,894
Ah, it's Lim.

256
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,688
But feel free to ignore it.

257
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,731
Show her what a badass you are.

258
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,199
Hey. I haven't
seen you all day.

259
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,326
I took it off.

260
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,162
Lim's covering my residents,
and, uh, Kellan's in town.

261
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,247
Mm. We're gonna see
Young the Giant.

262
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,665
And left these in my desk.

263
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,292
That'll be fun.

264
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,585
Yeah, fun for me.

265
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,337
I think he'd rather
be with his friends.

266
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,338
Although, he does enjoy me

267
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,632
paying for the tickets and beer.

268
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,300
Oh, my God, Kellan
can drink now?

269
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,719
I'm sure he's been
drinking for a while,

270
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,680
but, yeah, legally
for a month now.

271
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,891
Time flies.

272
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,893
Faster than you'd ever imagine.

273
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,439
Have a good night.

274
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,151
Park?

275
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,821
Andrews just closed
a partnership deal

276
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,448
with a big CRO.

277
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,451
He wants me to manage
it and serve as P.I.

278
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,953
Congrats.

279
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,163
It is a great opportunity,

280
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,832
exactly what I have
been looking for,

281
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,543
but it's gonna mean a
lot more time at work,

282
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,130
and I'm hoping to
be a mother soon.

283
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,719
My favorite memories
are all school plays,

284
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,347
baseball games, camping trips.

285
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,684
And my biggest regret
is that I missed

286
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,061
way too many of those moments.

287
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,855
Sorry. I wouldn't have asked

288
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,774
if I didn't want to
hear your answer.

289
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,484
You have a great job.

290
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,112
You know, maybe not the
opportunity of a lifetime,

291
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,907
but you can have a set
schedule with reasonable hours.

292
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,117
You know, it seems to me,

293
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,952
you already have the
best of both worlds.

294
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,789
Thanks.

295
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,874
And tell Kellan I said hi.

296
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,584
Will do.

297
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,592
Kelli is prepped and ready
for tomorrow morning.

298
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,929
Good. We are going home.

299
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,639
A 13-year-old can't
consent to sex,

300
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,309
and we're obligated to
report it if she does.

301
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,685
You want to call the cops

302
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,645
because she had sex
with her boyfriend?

303
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
Not the police. Child
Protective Services.

304
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,649
Just because her
mom says it's okay

305
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,443
doesn't negate that
it's statutory rape.

306
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,445
But if two
13-year-olds have sex,

307
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,197
which one is the rapist, and
which one is the rape victim?

308
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,574
They're <i>both</i> victims.

309
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,409
But only if they're
both rapists,

310
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,952
which doesn't make sense.

311
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,704
The terminology is
not the issue, Shaun.

312
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,206
She's in seventh grade,
sleeps with a Teddy Bear.

313
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,541
At the very least, her
mother should be required

314
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,876
to talk to a counselor.

315
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,044
You really think that would help

316
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,087
or just create an
even bigger mess?

317
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,839
That's not our call.

318
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,842
We have a duty
to... No, we don't.

319
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,471
Our patient is post-pubescent,
Tanner stage four.

320
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,097
She has the right
to her own decisions

321
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,432
regarding sexual activity,

322
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,100
as long as the partner
is of similar age.

323
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,352
Just because her body has
matured doesn't mean she's...

324
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,813
I am the attending, and
that is my decision.

325
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,398
That's true, Shaun,

326
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,442
but maybe you two should
discuss it a bit more.

327
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,360
The law is clear.

328
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,572
There is nothing
more to discuss.

329
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,629
Mmm. That smells amazing.

330
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,800
I am going to change.

331
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,301
My mother's marinara.

332
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,928
Usually there's
roasted garlic in here,

333
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,223
but I was told you have
certain food sensitivities.

334
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,641
Did he say sensitivity
or did he...

335
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,226
Explosive diarrhea.

336
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,144
Mm. I'm gonna wring his neck.

337
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,106
As you should. Here, taste.

338
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,443
Oh, my God. Right?

339
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,320
That is fantastic.

340
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,905
It's better with
the roasted garlic,

341
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,991
but, you know, your
house, your rules.

342
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,037
Now I see
where he learned it.

343
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,580
Shaun
cooks just like you.

344
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,874
Pre-measures everything
and arranges the bowls

345
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,959
in the order they go in.

346
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,254
Surgeons. We know
how to get it done.

347
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,135
Not to mention your fondness
for extra clean utensils.

348
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,679
No such thing as extra clean.

349
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,430
No, but I cleaned it.

350
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,807
You rinsed it.

351
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,268
I'm gonna sauté some vegetables.

352
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,145
Should be ready in 11 minutes.

353
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,147
Okay. I'll get changed.

354
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,574
There... the septal
leaflet of the tricuspid.

355
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,118
Play it again.

356
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,580
He's got severe regurg.

357
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,000
Which means we need to add
a valve repair to the CABG

358
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,043
and ventricular reconstruction.

359
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,503
There's no way he's strong
enough for that much surgery.

360
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,255
We don't have a choice.

361
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,590
I just need to figure out

362
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,633
how to do it all
in one procedure.

363
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,136
We could still do the BiVAD
with unmatched donor. No.

364
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,638
It's... The same idea
I said no to before.

365
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,726
So, what do you want us to do?

366
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,769
Nothing.

367
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,479
I need to think this
through on my own.

368
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,814
We could help you research.

369
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,900
I just need to figure out
the best surgical plan.

370
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,651
Have you considered
implanting an Impella first

371
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,069
to decrease the afterload?

372
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,110
And significantly increase
his odds of stroking out?

373
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,410
Sorry. Go home, get rest.

374
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,537
This is my problem.
I'll figure it out.

375
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,307
Lim's under a lot of pressure.

376
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,684
I'm...
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

377
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,687
I'm just tired.

378
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,397
See you tomorrow.

379
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,538
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

380
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>to an automatic
voice message system.</i>

381
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,545
Hey, Quinn, it's Danny.

382
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,215
Um, if you have some time,
could you give me a call?

383
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,509
I'm not up for another meeting,

384
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,472
but, uh, I'm feeling like...

385
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,018
I really should talk to someone.

386
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,478
Thanks.

387
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:13,592
I was... about
to take a shower.

388
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,802
Unless you would
like to go first.

389
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,054
Thanks, but you can go ahead.

390
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,223
I'm gonna make some coffee.

391
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,476
Oh. Dr. Glassman
already made coffee.

392
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,022
He also bought croissants for
us before he left for work.

393
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,108
Wow.

394
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,321
With breakfast and
coffee already made,

395
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,074
we now have time to take
an extra long shower.

396
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,659
Together.

397
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,329
Yes.

398
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,497
We do have time for
that.

399
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,299
A new ventricle and a new valve?

400
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,218
Repaired ventricle
and replaced valve.

401
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,724
This is really
my... only option?

402
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,311
There are mechanical
heart devices.

403
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,521
That I've already considered.

404
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,148
With heart failure
as advanced as yours,

405
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,816
it's not a better option.

406
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,823
Okay.

407
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,076
Whatever you think is best.

408
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,329
We're gonna take
good care of you.

409
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,498
I know. Thank you.

410
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,678
Get the new valve prepped.

411
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,560
Good morning.

412
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,854
Oh. When you
start your morning

413
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,650
with shower sex and
croissants, it definitely is.

414
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,652
Lucky you.

415
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,153
Would you be okay if your son

416
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,030
was having shower
sex and croissants

417
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,700
in middle school?

418
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,535
I am still contemplating
nursery colors,

419
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,704
so not ready to
think about all that.

420
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:10,333
But... maybe her
mom has a point.

421
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,918
I spent all of my high
school sneaking around

422
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,545
my parents' backs.

423
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,338
That's not a relationship
I want with my kid.

424
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,092
We're talking about
kids... Early teens.

425
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,762
I was 18 when I
lost my virginity.

426
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,305
Leon Maxwell.

427
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,890
We'd been together for a year.

428
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,767
I was sure I was ready.

429
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,438
And... how was it?

430
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,398
Fine.

431
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,900
Fun, after we figured
some things out.

432
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,235
But starting from Leon,

433
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,195
all the way to
Dwayne in med school,

434
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,822
sex has always felt
like a distraction.

435
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,282
A distraction?

436
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,742
Okay, definitely
sounds like those guys

437
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,023
had no idea what
they were doing.

438
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,290
Once I was intimate
in a relationship,

439
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,959
I felt less like my true self

440
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,879
and less close to God.

441
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,339
That's why I stopped.

442
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,216
Stopped?

443
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,010
Like, stopped...

444
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,554
Having sex.

445
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,270
I don't intend to do it
again until I'm married.

446
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,395
How long has it been?

447
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,688
Years ago, before we met.

448
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,856
You never told me.

449
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,608
We joke about sex all the time.

450
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,110
I go along with the jokes
so I don't become the joke.

451
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,821
I would never make fun of
you for anything like that.

452
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,407
Lea, you told me my
Bible study group

453
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,576
was "Fantasy Faithball."

454
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,953
Mm.

455
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,872
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,250
But then what was
your plan with Perez?

457
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,794
The same as any guy I date.

458
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,587
It's not like I don't
kiss or some other things,

459
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,798
but...

460
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,258
if a man is not
willing to commit

461
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,927
to who I am as a person
or what I believe in,

462
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,512
he is not worth my time.

463
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:52,143
It just... seems
a bit extreme?

464
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,354
And a little sad.

465
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,898
I mean, it can be a
really fun part of life,

466
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,567
and you've just cut
yourself off from it.

467
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,819
You're not listening to me.

468
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,822
For me, it wasn't a value
add... It was the...

469
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,282
This is why I don't tell people.

470
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,335
It's impossible to know

471
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,670
exactly how to shape
and size this valve

472
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,547
without knowing the shape of
the heart it's going into.

473
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,673
Which we won't know

474
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,354
until Lim finishes
repairing the ventricle.

475
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,066
He'd be better off with
a transplant, right?

476
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,809
I agree.

477
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,062
The patient's just going along
'cause Lim steamrolled him.

478
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,534
A square peg won't
seal a round hole,

479
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,035
and at the stage of the surgery
we're going to find that out,

480
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,412
it will be too
late to turn back.

481
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,414
It is not a perfect solution,

482
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,957
but it's the best we have.

483
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,542
And you've explained to Bob

484
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,211
just how imperfect
this solution is?

485
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,130
He's aware of the risks

486
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,340
and that he has limited options.

487
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,759
Sometimes patients need help
making difficult decisions.

488
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,513
I don't think this is a decision
you should be making for him.

489
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,057
And I'm not the only one.

490
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,025
I trust you.

491
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,070
We're operating on Bob
first thing in the morning.

492
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,248
Her blood pressure skyrocketed.

493
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,751
She could have a stroke.
Start IV labetalol.

494
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,255
This is why children
shouldn't have...

495
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,798
Stop.

496
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,927
You need to focus
on the medicine.

497
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,221
She is going into
critical bradycardia.

498
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,389
We need to push atropine.

499
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,358
My patient's blood pressure
has remained stable.

500
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,485
We can operate tomorrow.

501
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,695
That's great.

502
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,822
Mmm. This smells amazing.

503
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,618
Mmm. Tastes even better.

504
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,496
The secret is thyme. You
got to have fresh thyme,

505
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,831
because if you let it dry,
it saps all the flavor.

506
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,833
That and a little
bit of lemon zest.

507
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,961
Truth bomb... uh, I might have

508
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,380
oversold my enthusiasm
for you staying here,

509
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,674
but if you keep cooking
like Gordon Ramsay,

510
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,009
I won't let you leave.

511
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,387
Well, as much as I love
sleeping in a twin bed

512
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:36,265
in a half-remodeled nursery,
I think I may have to decline.

513
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,354
Yeah, Ruben? Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

514
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,731
That's... That's
double the quote.

515
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,441
Okay. Yeah.

516
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,651
Approved.

517
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,528
Unbelievable.

518
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,072
Now I have to replace
the roof rafters.

519
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,157
Yay. If you have to
replace the whole roof,

520
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,492
why not just get
a brand-new house?

521
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,285
Why would I do that?
I love the house.

522
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,080
It's ancient, too
big for one person,

523
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,374
and completely falling apart.

524
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,837
You do complain a lot about
all the repairs you have to do.

525
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,422
That is the house

526
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,258
where we brought Maddie
home as a newborn.

527
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,718
That is the house
where we celebrated

528
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,886
every single one
of her birthdays.

529
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,056
Every year, we'd turn that
house into a haunted house

530
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,351
with a cemetery in the
backyard and a fog machine.

531
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,561
We scared the living daylights

532
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,188
out of every kid in
the neighborhood.

533
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,696
I come home into that foyer...

534
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:36,200
and that staircase is
where Maddie would descend

535
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,078
in her prom dress.

536
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,790
You can never sell that house.

537
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,212
I can never sell that house.

538
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,926
Clinic's low on phlebotomy kits.

539
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,428
Any chance we could
steal some from surgical?

540
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,971
Sure.

541
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,772
Just make us whole when
your shipment gets in.

542
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,642
Andrews offered me...

543
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,020
I heard. Congrats.
You deserve it.

544
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,605
Thanks. I do.

545
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:10,276
But... you're smart,
aggressive, and ambitious.

546
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,029
I'm sensing there's
another "but."

547
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,741
You decided to never have kids.

548
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,035
Wouldn't really say I decided.

549
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,913
It just never happened.

550
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,706
I'm sorry. Don't be.

551
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,291
I can't be both the
mother I'd want to be

552
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,335
and the driven,
perfectionist surgeon

553
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,462
I know I am.

554
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,259
My advice... Decide
what brings you

555
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,845
the most fulfillment and
then commit fully to that.

556
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,515
You can't have it all.

557
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:44,268
But plenty of men...
No, they don't.

558
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,896
They're just less conflicted
about the choices they make.

559
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,325
You totally put me
on the spot with Lim.

560
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,119
I never said I was
gonna back you up.

561
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,162
You're right. My bad.

562
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,207
You and I know probation
means different things for us.

563
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,042
Yours is a slap on the wrist,

564
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,753
a correction for coloring
outside the lines.

565
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,297
I'm in a holding pattern,
while everybody watches to see

566
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,676
if I'm actually a
surgeon or a junkie.

567
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,053
Part of being a
surgeon is standing up

568
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,223
and fighting for your patients.

569
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,981
Why'd you leave your robe
hanging on the bathroom door?!

570
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,859
I didn't. I lent my extra
one to Dr. Glassman.

571
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,486
You both hang your robes
outside the bathroom?

572
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,238
I never noticed that before.

573
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,916
I'm glad
you find it so amusing.

574
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,292
What'd you expect?

575
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,585
You ran a sneak
attack on your husband

576
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,086
when you had a house guest.

577
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,088
Who else hangs their
robe outside the bathroom

578
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,925
so the steam doesn't
make it moist?

579
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,427
Mm. And that's not
the only thing.

580
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,512
Their cooking techniques,
cleaning styles,

581
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,933
the way they lay out
their toiletries.

582
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,893
You said he's like
Shaun's father.

583
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,687
Yeah. The apple
doesn't fall far.

584
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,522
Somehow, in this case, I think
Shaun's actually the tree.

585
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,690
Uhh.

586
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,068
One thing is clear...

587
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,778
Grandpa Glassman
needs a new robe,

588
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,321
one that doesn't
match your husband's.

589
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,573
Aww. Grandpa Glassy.

590
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,325
I love that.

591
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,826
Now if only I could
erase a certain image

592
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,203
of Grandpa Glassy.

593
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,833
Hey, I'm really sorry

594
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,338
about saying you
were... extreme and sad.

595
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,091
Thank you.

596
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,635
It's unfair of me to blame you

597
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,137
for being surprised at something

598
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,682
I've intentionally never shared.

599
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,100
Abstinence is important to me,

600
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,893
but I don't always
feel comfortable

601
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,104
being open about it.

602
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,690
Well, I'm really glad you did.

603
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,944
Do you have a vibrator?

604
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,114
Because in terms of getting
closer to God, I find...

605
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,242
No, we're not talking
about this right now.

606
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,870
Two croissants, please. Mm.

607
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,956
Cut this suture, Dr. Wolke.

608
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:59,506
The valve is seated... nicely.

609
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,009
I've removed a lot of scar
tissue from this ventricle,

610
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,136
but there's still more.

611
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,472
We need enough viable tissue
to close this ventricle.

612
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,351
I don't think we have it.

613
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,938
Hold this clamp. Tightly.

614
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,525
This area looked good
in the pre-op MIBI scan,

615
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,861
but it's dead now.

616
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,196
Must be delayed apoptosis.

617
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,325
What's the plan?

618
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,163
I need an idea.

619
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,372
Any idea.

620
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,755
We could do an
additional vessel bypass.

621
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,173
It might restore some
hibernating tissue.

622
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,924
Some, but we'd never find enough

623
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,468
to make up for this deficit.

624
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,969
Can we use a synthetic
patch to close the gap?

625
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,596
It needs muscle tissue
for the ventricle to pump.

626
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,014
You can't have a
functional heart

627
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,515
without a working
right ventricle.

628
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,271
Unless we do what we do

629
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,273
in babies with
Ebstein's Anomaly.

630
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,817
Bypass the defective
right ventricle,

631
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,445
divert deoxygenated blood
directly back to the lungs.

632
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,032
He'd only have one
ventricle pumping blood

633
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,700
to his entire body.

634
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,827
But in time, the left
ventricle would get stronger.

635
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,788
We keep those babies alive
until they're teenagers.

636
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,039
That could buy
you plenty of time

637
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,707
to find a matched
donor heart. Let's go.

638
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,422
Hey.

639
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,716
They already have
four clinical trials

640
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,593
with IRB approval.

641
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,844
Mm.

642
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,808
I am honored that
you thought of me.

643
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,311
It's just...

644
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,938
I'm trying to get pregnant...

645
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,773
IVF with a donor.

646
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,110
And I've decided...

647
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,863
I can't have it all.

648
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,834
At the risk of...
overstepping...

649
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,629
I think you're selling
yourself short.

650
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,882
My mother was the
Senior Director

651
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,551
for Human Rights First.

652
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,261
Total workaholic.

653
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,430
Growing up, sometimes
it seemed like

654
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,391
she was always on the
phone or a plane. Mm.

655
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,560
That must have
been hard for you.

656
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,229
It wasn't easy, but whenever
I really needed her,

657
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,815
she was always there for me.

658
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,192
She was my idol.

659
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,695
And to this day,

660
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,865
if I need advice on
a tough decision,

661
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,617
she's my first call.

662
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,246
There's more to
being a great mom

663
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,998
than parent-teacher conferences.

664
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,255
Is her
pressure climbing?

665
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,716
No. 120 over 81,
holding steady.

666
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,302
Curettage is complete.

667
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,304
The entire tumor's evacuated.

668
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,140
Massage the uterine fundus.

669
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,810
Pressure's dropping. Fast.

670
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,938
She is going into shock.

671
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,441
Could the tumor have caused
some sort of bleeding disorder?

672
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,693
There's no bleeding down here.

673
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,320
Push vasopressors and fluids.

674
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,115
What is this?

675
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,125
The tumor thinned
her uterine wall.

676
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,127
She's perforated. She's
bleeding internally.

677
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,921
Prep her for a STAT laparotomy.

678
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,089
Rapid infuse two units of O neg.

679
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,926
We need to isolate the vessel
and clamp it before she...

680
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,722
We just lost her pulse.

681
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,765
Retraction.

682
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,482
A uni-heart? That's new.

683
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,234
Well, once we removed
the scar tissue,

684
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,069
there was even
less viable muscle

685
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,321
than what we anticipated.

686
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,532
Dr. Wolke came through
with the audible.

687
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,784
Uh, sports reference.

688
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,160
She's saying it was your idea.

689
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,662
Aww.

690
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,872
Which Dr. Lim
executed brilliantly.

691
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,667
And I'd be saying that even
if she weren't in the room.

692
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,002
You'll still need a
donor heart eventually,

693
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,379
but this should
buy you five years,

694
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,048
maybe more before that.

695
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,132
Thank you.

696
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,602
The surgery was too
dangerous for Bob.

697
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,854
You were right about that.

698
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,648
And about advocating
for the patient,

699
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,775
even when you were
pissing me off.

700
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,611
Might've helped if I had
had the uni-heart idea

701
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,281
before the patient was
splayed open on the table.

702
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,741
Yeah, sometimes great
things come out of pressure.

703
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,952
Although, I try not
to depend on them.

704
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,455
Sounds like the perfect prelude
to letting me off probation.

705
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,749
Don't push it.

706
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,210
But... excellent work.

707
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,754
Keep it up.

708
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:52,923
You too, Dr. Perez.

709
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,185
Hi, honey.

710
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,064
Is it over?

711
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:13,485
Your surgery was a lot more
complicated than anticipated,

712
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,071
and it was successful.

713
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,866
We got all the tumor.

714
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,993
Everything kinda hurts.

715
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,787
I will increase your medication.

716
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,083
Ryan. Hey.

717
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,003
I thought this little guy

718
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,088
might, uh, make you feel better.

719
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,257
Aww. He's such a cutie.

720
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,176
Yeah, I got him
at the gift shop.

721
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,636
Hey, I brought your laptop, too.

722
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,180
The group chat's blowing up
over this new Apex update.

723
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,349
Um, is there Wi-Fi
in this place?

724
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,142
Kelli needs to rest tonight.

725
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,686
And when you go home,

726
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,980
sexual activity
will be very risky,

727
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,108
given the trauma
of your surgery.

728
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,611
For how long?

729
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,655
Six months, at least.

730
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:02,076
And maybe you should think
about waiting even longer.

731
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,578
We'll talk more
about this later.

732
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,917
Thank you...

733
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,003
both...

734
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,632
for saving my girl.

735
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:41,073
Hey. It's Danny.

736
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:44,243
Yeah. Having a bit
of a rough week.

737
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,537
Thanks, man.

738
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,331
Uh, you know where
St. Bon's hospital is?

739
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,958
There's a coffee
shop two blocks west.

740
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,501
I'll meet you out front in 20.

741
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,628
Okay.

742
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,805
This is awkward.

743
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,851
What's awkward? Nothing happened.
Wait. What do you mean nothing...

744
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,561
What do you mean, what do
I mean? Nothing happened.

745
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,562
Right. Nothing happened.

746
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,064
Exactly.

747
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,484
That is very impressive.

748
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,070
If I saw your mom totally naked

749
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,363
and I was also totally naked,

750
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,198
I would definitely
never forget...

751
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,409
That's not helping,
Shaun. Thank you, Shaun.

752
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,453
You know what? All
things considered,

753
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,163
I actually had a
really nice time.

754
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,915
I'll be craving that salmon.

755
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,542
I wrote down the recipe.

756
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,919
Actually, the salmon comes
out a lot more tender

757
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,463
out of my Viking oven.

758
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,257
I'm gonna have you both over
to dinner as a "thank you."

759
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,134
And my neighbor is calling.

760
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,469
The one who stole
your lawn mower?

761
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,721
No, the one who cut back
my trees without asking.

762
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,639
Yes, Brent?

763
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Slow down.

764
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,479
What?

765
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,866
Danny.

766
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,785
I was surprised to
hear from you, man.

767
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,871
Heard you went to rehab. Yeah.

768
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,749
All good. Been
four times myself.

769
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,959
I'm kinda in a hurry.

770
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,503

tar around right now,

771
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,840
