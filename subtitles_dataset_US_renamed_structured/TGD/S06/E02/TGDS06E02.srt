Aah!

00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,438
No. Please stop.

25
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,523
What's wrong?

26
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,813
That noise hurts my ears,
and you don't need pencils.

27
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,210
Our orders
are electronically entered.

28
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,250
I use pencil
when I'm doing research.

29
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,046
Congratulations.

30
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:47,062
I come bearing gifts
for our new attending surgeons.

31
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:48,595
Bummer
you have to share an office,

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,946
but I can make sure your
first day starts with a smile.

33
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:54,868
Is it noise-canceling earbuds?

34
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:56,149
It is not.

35
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:58,126
You guys are
big decision-makers now.

36
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,718
Figured you might need
some help.

37
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,636
<i>But of course!</i>

38
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,791
Sounds like a brilliant idea!

39
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,375
- Eh?
- Is the answer always yes?

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,718
I don't know. Ask.

41
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:14,523
Is the answer always yes?

42
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:15,943
Tequila stat!

43
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:17,027
Oh!

44
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:19,323
Am I awesome or what?

45
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:21,335
- You are awesome.
- Mm.

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,554
But tequila can't be
the answer to everything.

47
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:25,976
I would not be so sure.

48
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:34,132
Uh, Lim is in the parking lot.

49
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:35,984
Hmm.

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,437
You... You okay?

51
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,934
Yes.

52
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,726
Why wouldn't I be?

53
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,756
Whoo!

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,328
Welcome back, Chief.

55
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,915
Thank you.

56
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,756
I've never been
this happy to be at work.

57
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,687
- We've missed you so much.
- Ah.

58
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:12,871
It's only been a few months.

59
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,335
It's been 14 and a half weeks.

60
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,039
Awkward.

61
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,900
Her and Murphy.

62
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:23,115
It's awkward between
Murphy and most people.

63
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,367
He didn't paralyze everyone.

64
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:26,068
He didn't paralyze her.
He saved her life.

65
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:29,015
If he would've done the surgery
Glass man ordered him to do...

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,812
There's no way to know
what the outcome would have been.

67
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:32,882
The M&M was clear on that.

68
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,257
The final determination
was "inconclusive."

69
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,148
I'd hug you, but I'd have
to steal your wheelchair.

70
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,281
Oh, no. What happened?

71
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,093
Oh, I lifted
the front end of a bus,

72
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,484
you know, to save a kid.
Normal Monday.

73
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:45,835
Got to lift with your legs.

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,656
Yeah.

75
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:51,937
So, I tried to keep your in box empty,
but that was impossible.

76
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:55,429
Everybody, party's over.
She's got work to do.

77
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,406
Well, no, actually,
um, before you go,

78
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:02,766
I just want to thank you

79
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,835
for the flowers,
the food, everything.

80
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,109
It was incredibly helpful.

81
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:13,484
And I'd like to thank
Dr. Murphy.

82
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,078
You saved my life.

83
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,281
You're welcome.

84
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,851
Oof. So awkward.

Doctors Wolke and Allen,
meet our new first years,

90
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,820
Doctors Danica Powell
and Daniel Perez.

91
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,335
Newbies.

92
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,960
- Don't call them that.
- Sorry.

93
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:50,781
Welcome to St. Bonaventure.

94
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,315
Thanks.
Glad to be here.

95
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,084
I look forward
to working with you both.

96
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:56,354
Have a great first day.

97
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,479
Thank you.

98
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:03,048
Nurse Hawks showed us around,

99
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,201
introduced us to the OR staff.

100
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,596
Everyone seems super helpful.

101
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,233
I'm sure they were.

102
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,319
Hmm.

103
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:11,984
You want the soldier
or the farm boy?

104
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,523
Naval Academy grads
are called sailors,

105
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,546
not soldiers.

106
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,672
Well, she's been in combat.

107
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,529
That makes her a soldier
in my book.

108
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:19,715
They both have

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,501
excellent USMLE scores.

110
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:22,386
Well, she has more

111
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:23,490
real-world experience,

112
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,632
but he'll be useful getting
extra help from the nurses,

113
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,585
which could come in handy
on our first day.

114
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:30,076
It's not our first day.

115
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,198
We've been here five years
and have leadership experience.

116
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,387
Being an attending
shouldn't be much different

117
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:37,141
than being a senior resident.

118
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,810
I'll take Handsome Dan.

119
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:41,467
Okay.

120
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:45,862
Good morning.

121
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,282
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

122
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:48,209
I'm an attending

123
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,271
at San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

124
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:54,240
You and Dr. Wolke
will be with me today.

125
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:58,216
Allen and Perez, you're with me
in the ER today.

126
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,103
Actually, I was just about
to take Perez.

127
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:01,748
You may have been "about to,"
but I just did.

128
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:03,032
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hold on.

129
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:04,170
Dr. Murphy and I...

130
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:05,791
Were decorating
your new shared office,

131
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,462
while I was getting
this approved by Andrews.

132
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:10,281
Oblivious to anyone else's
needs but your own, as usual.

133
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,418
Pathetically blaming everyone
else for your problems,

134
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:13,865
as usual.

135
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,045
They used to be

136
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:18,965
in a relationship.

137
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,396
It ended badly.

138
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,068
Let's go.

139
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:29,232
It still
feels like I'm choking.

140
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,686
The EMTs said they could barely
get into your apartment.

141
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:34,582
Looked like you hadn't
been able to clean up

142
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,021
or take out the trash in months.

143
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,788
Those are my collections.
It's none of their business.

144
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,013
Large, palpable anterior mass.

145
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:47,637
When was the last time
you saw a doctor?

146
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,873
I don't know.
Ten, twenty years.

147
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:55,347
When was the last time
you left your house?

148
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:56,767
What does that matter?

149
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:59,092
We just want to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

150
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,743
If you want,
we could have a social worker

151
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,240
come down to talk to you.

152
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,977
You know, this is exactly why
I don't come to hospitals.

153
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:09,248
All you want to do
is meddle in things

154
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,902
that are none
of your damn business.

155
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:13,589
It looks like
you may need some surgery

156
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:15,138
to remove this mass.

157
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:16,543
You think
you'd be okay with that?

158
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,560
What the hell
do you think I'm here for?

159
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,546
The donor heart is on its way,

160
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,029
so we need to start
prepping you for surgery.

161
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,631
I see you brought in
reinforcements.

162
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,981
Hi. I'm Dr. Danni Powell.

163
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,116
Dr. Powell's
one of our new residents.

164
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,685
This is her first day.

165
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:37,722
- Oh, and she's assisting?
- Yes.

166
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,857
I don't want a first year
on her first day

167
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,990
in on my husband's
heart transplant.

168
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,715
You're a surgeon yourself.

169
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:48,131
You are aware
the only way residents learn

170
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,577
difficult surgeries
is by participating in them.

171
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:54,935
Yes, and I'm also aware that
residencies last five years,

172
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:57,913
so there's no reason
she needs to do this day one.

173
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,734
Honey, it's okay.

174
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,982
I'm sure Dr. Murphy
knows what he's doing.

175
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:04,887
Mm.

176
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,359
It's gonna be fine.

177
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,979
How can I be
more worried than you?

178
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,295
You're smarter.

179
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,443
It's part of why I love you.

180
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,640
And hopefully
my new heart will, too.

181
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,081
It definitely won't change that.

182
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,050
Can you hear me?

183
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,151
Code Blue! I need a cart!

184
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,206
Aah!

185
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:35,909
I've been
looking for you.

186
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,776
I have a patient in the ER

187
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,464
who needs a mass
removed from his neck.

188
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,666
I need an attending
for Allen and Perez.

189
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,964
Okay. Uh, I'm pretty swamped.

190
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,136
Well, obviously, I wasn't
expecting you to do it,

191
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,489
but Murphy's on a transplant,

192
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,176
Park's busy
decorating his office...

193
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:52,542
"Obviously"?
Why wouldn't I do it?

194
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
I just... Andrews said...

195
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,729
Surgeries are still done
with our hands, right?

196
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,550
The only thing
that should be obvious

197
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,721
is that I'm not on call,
but Park is,

198
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,782
so get over your stupid
breakup drama and go talk to him.

199
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,874
So, I'll reschedule your 11:00?

200
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:12,976
I can fit it in.

201
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,578
Didn't you want to make sure
you had the funding confirmed first?

202
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:16,662
Good point.

203
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,292
I will be doing
Mr. Persiko's hernia repair.

204
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:24,283
Audrey, I'm amazed
by your courage and fortitude,

205
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:27,596
and I will do everything in my
power to assist in your return.

206
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,932
But that might not
include surgeries.

207
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,190
I have pretty much lived
at physical therapy

208
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,667
the last three months.

209
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,253
I have practiced extensively

210
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,006
in a custom chair
that holds me upright

211
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,818
so that I can see and reach
the entire surgical field.

212
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:44,938
You know practicing in PT

213
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,471
is not the same
as working in an OR.

214
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,690
And your office is not the same
as a courtroom,

215
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:53,893
so I won't bore you
with my rights under the ADA.

216
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:58,385
I can do all the duties
of chief surgeon.

217
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,447
Okay.

218
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,523
But I'm joining you on Persiko.

219
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,845
There is no reason
the president and chief surgeon

220
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,965
need to tag team
a hernia repair.

221
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,096
Yes, there is.

222
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,565
Heparinization complete.

223
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,930
Bypass initiated.

224
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,950
Cross clamping
the aorta.

225
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,216
And tighten the caval snares.

226
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:28,393
Dr. Powell,
prep the donor organ.

227
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:29,679
Check the atrial septum.

228
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:31,499
Make sure there's
no patent for a men ovale.

229
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:32,713
Looks good.

230
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:36,385
The mitral, pulmonic,
and aortic valves also good.

231
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,272
Thank you.

232
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,818
I will transect
the superior vena cava

233
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:43,666
while you divide the aorta
and pulmonary arteries.

234
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:46,507
Are you serious?
That's the most difficult part.

235
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,594
Are you confident
you can handle it?

236
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,780
Definitely.

237
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,229
Then so am I.

238
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,205
Potts scissors.

239
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,666
Wait, hold on.

240
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:00,924
The donor heart
has a floppy tricuspid.

241
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,177
There was
no evidence to suggest

242
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:09,400
severe tricuspid insufficiency
on the donor's echocardiogram.

243
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,570
The valve is damaged.

244
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:18,486
That must've happened during
the organ recovery surgery.

245
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:20,721
We can't replace one
damaged heart with another.

246
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,574
It took three months
to get this one.

247
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,793
He won't last three more.

248
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:25,346
Aborting now
and putting him on ECMO

249
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,017
would move him
to the top of the wait list.

250
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:30,182
We should be able to find
a new one in a few days,

251
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:31,602
a week at most.

252
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:32,839
You really
want to take that risk?

253
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:36,127
It's not her decision.
It's mine.

254
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,299
Abort the surgery.

255
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,351
Bring the... better heart

256
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:01,799
We had to abort the transplant.

257
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,525
The damage was too severe.

258
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,721
We placed him on ECMO
and closed his chest.

259
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,733
He's being transferred to ICU
while we wait for a new donor.

260
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,635
You made that decision
without even consulting me?

261
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,722
It was surgical judgment.

262
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:15,986
And I'm a surgeon.

263
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,166
Not at this hospital.

264
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:19,891
Here, you're just
the patient's wife.

265
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,541
"Just"? My husband's life
is in your hands.

266
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,494
I have every right
to ask questions.

267
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,799
Excuse me, Dr. Hall,
may I ask you something?

268
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:27,884
What?

269
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:32,408
I understand that you're upset
and frightened,

270
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:35,236
and you may disagree with our
decision to abort the transplant.

271
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,290
But we are gonna do everything
in our power

272
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,642
to find a new heart.

273
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,877
Is there any way
that we can help you?

274
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,498
Any pre-op echo or operative
reports that you'd like to see?

275
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:49,572
Is there anyone else
that you'd like to talk to?

276
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:53,563
Can I see him?

277
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,705
Absolutely.

278
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,736
As soon as he's stable
in the ICU,

279
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,783
we'll have a nurse bring you in.

280
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,643
Anything else
that we can get for you?

281
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:04,143
Any food or a coffee?

282
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:09,271
Um, no.

283
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,096
Thank you.

284
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:21,854
So, what kind of stuff
do you like to collect?

285
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:24,870
I collect Egyptian pottery.

286
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:27,588
I got obsessed with King Tut
in elementary school.

287
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:30,394
I know. My friends all think
it's very odd, too.

288
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:33,800
Uh, I collect electronics,
mostly.

289
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:37,080
Hi-fi stereo, computers, TVs.

290
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:40,933
All people care about now
is the next shiny thing.

291
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,261
Use it once,
toss it in the trash.

292
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:45,378
You go to flea markets
or garage sales?

293
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:48,089
Mm. They try
to rip you off there.

294
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:51,800
I can shop and compare a
hundred different places online,

295
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:54,416
select what I want, have it
delivered right to my door.

296
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,456
It's just nice
to go out sometimes.

297
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,628
I'm not a hermit or a hoarder.

298
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:01,753
No one's calling you that.

299
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,572
Everyone calls me that.

300
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,892
Just do your damn test.

301
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,280
Remove the thing,
and I can get out of here.

302
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:18,932
Okay.

303
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:21,513
Let me help you.

304
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:22,699
No, I can do it.

305
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,355
I know, but you've
never had a problem

306
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,241
asking me to scratch your nose
during surgery.

307
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:27,963
Thanks.

308
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:34,807
This thing...

309
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,367
I feel slow and awkward.

310
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:40,494
You're like Ripley in Aliens.

311
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,096
A total bad ass.

312
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:48,822
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,807
You didn't do anything.

314
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,635
I wish I was as strong as you.

315
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,377
I can't sleep.
Still have nightmares.

316
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:02,611
You're stronger than me.

317
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:06,111
I'm just a better poker player.

318
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,815
Your bedside manner
is impressive.

319
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:16,330
I spent two years
in Afghanistan,

320
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,479
so had plenty of practice
de-escalating conflict.

321
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,708
What about a biventricular
assist device?

322
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,994
Could extend the function
of his current heart.

323
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,569
Well, that's pretty short-term.

324
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,038
I was actually thinking...

325
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:35,074
Okay, he isn't oxygenating
sufficiently despite the ECMO,

326
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,072
and he's bleeding
from his cannula sites.

327
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:38,527
Have you considered a CARMAT?

328
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:41,480
We looked into
artificial hearts weeks ago.

329
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:43,166
He is not a candidate.

330
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,424
I shouldn't have aborted
the transplant.

331
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:50,033
What about a xenotransplant?

332
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,709
I was just reading a study
about the use of pig hearts.

333
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:55,928
That's not an option.

334
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:57,479
Why not?

335
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:01,237
The most recent patient
lasted two months,

336
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:03,890
which is longer than
ECMO will keep him alive.

337
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,721
Because it's immoral.

338
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,283
Animals aren't surgical devices.

339
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,690
They are living beings who have
a right to self-determination.

340
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:17,291
Well, so was the guy whose heart we
just threw in the trash a few hours ago.

341
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,812
That man made a free choice
to have his heart removed

342
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:21,627
after he died.

343
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,174
No one executed him
so they could take it.

344
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:28,127
We execute millions of pigs
every day for food,

345
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:31,143
and saving a human life
is more important.

346
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:34,619
Killing animals for food
or for medicine is wrong.

347
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,572
I won't do it.

348
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:38,838
Okay.

349
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:45,299
Dr. Powell, you have no choice.

350
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:49,519
Refusing to comply
with an attending's decision

351
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:52,002
would be grounds
for termination.

352
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:56,361
Everything I've ever done
has been my choice.

353
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,878
So, you can fire me
if you want to,

354
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,979
but I won't participate
in a xenotransplant.

355
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:06,580
Mm.

356
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:10,182
So, what are we doing?

357
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:17,113
As long as his wife consents,
xenotransplant.

358
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:20,337
Right. I will be here if you
need me for another patient.

359
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,908
Cut.

360
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:45,307
Can you loosen the top strap so
that I can lean forward a bit more?

361
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,986
And someone get her brow.

362
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,041
Thank you.

363
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,041
Okay. That should be good.

364
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:00,979
3-0 vicryl sutures.

365
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,319
Yeah.

366
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:10,791
- You need help? You want me to...
- No. I got this.

367
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:12,377
I got it.

368
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,025
It's okay.

369
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:27,762
This is a damn hernia repair.

370
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,382
I should be able to do it
in my sleep.

371
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,252
Metz scissors.

372
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:44,893
You okay?

373
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:55,861
No. Take over.

374
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,463
Metz.

375
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:13,962
The mass has completely grown
into the larynx.

376
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,901
With possible
bilateral involvement.

377
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:17,440
We should
still be able to excise

378
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,051
without doing any more damage
to his voice.

379
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:22,188
I-I don't think the patient
cares about his voice.

380
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,775
He's not interested
in talking to anyone.

381
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:27,041
Or he just likes solitude.

382
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,784
I used to spend
every summer alone

383
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,455
in the cab of a combine,
and I loved it.

384
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,910
So, Mister-Already-
Knows-Every-Nurse-By-Name is a lone wolf?

385
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,217
I don't buy it.

386
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,394
Our lone wolf
has refused a psych consult,

387
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,320
so we should focus
on what we can actually fix.

388
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,597
- I agree.
- Then let me finish.

389
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,222
We need a laryngoscopy
to assess the compression

390
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:47,564
from the mass
on his vocal cords.

391
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,510
I disagree.

392
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:50,940
Better to do a needle
aspiration to assess malignancy.

393
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,463
He's my patient. Laryngoscopy.

394
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:56,127
But I'm the attending.

395
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:57,627
Needle aspiration.

396
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,346
We could do both.

397
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:04,626
Fine.

398
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,299
Sure.

399
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,392
The chief of surgery
is responsible

400
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:20,380
for a lot more
than just cutting.

401
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,696
I'm not giving up just because
I failed on my first try.

402
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:24,417
That wasn't what
I was suggesting.

403
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:27,855
I'm just...

404
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,312
impatient.

405
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,774
I screwed up, which could've
endangered a patient.

406
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:37,797
You should be pissed off at me,
not giving me a damn pep talk.

407
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,040
Do I have the power
to fire residents?

408
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,275
Yes.

409
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:51,861
I have a heart transplant patient
who is rapidly deteriorating...

410
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:55,133
Stop. You're now an attending.

411
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:58,618
You need to learn how to make
tough decisions on your own.

412
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,902
- Good job.
- Mm.

413
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,651
Now breathe.

414
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:17,338
Two-minute rest
and we'll do one more.

415
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,508
Hey.

416
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,377
What are you doing here?

417
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,407
Oh, looking for a heating pad.

418
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,985
Or is it ice?
I never know which one.

419
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,422
Ah, nobody does.

420
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:28,775
Judging from your walk, I'd say
you need a lot more than that.

421
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,579
She's right. And the real
problem's not your back.

422
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,020
It's your shoulders.
Your posture's all slumped.

423
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:35,688
I see that a lot
in my older clients.

424
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:37,223
Oh. Well, thank you.

425
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,000
I fell into a trench
during World War I.

426
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:42,578
I'm gonna get you a bolster.

427
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,032
How you doing?

428
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,024
Other than having to tap out
of a hernia repair?

429
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,539
Fantastic.

430
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,641
Standing's a lot harder
than it looks.

431
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:55,275
So don't.

432
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:57,078
Do the surgery from your chair.

433
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,486
Well, unlike Murphy,

434
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:01,023
I have to be over the patient
to see inside.

435
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:02,688
So lower the patient.

436
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,631
That would throw a bunch
of things out of sync,

437
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:07,241
the staff, the table.

438
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,795
You're the chief.

439
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:11,873
Let them sync up with you,
Chief.

440
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,101
The doctor's password
is irrelevant.

441
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:23,169
The patients have their own
separate log in ID.

442
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:25,972
You say irrelevant,
yet the patients can't log in.

443
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:28,641
They have to reset their
password every time they try.

444
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:29,726
Damn it.

445
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:33,016
I need some advice.

446
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,555
And I need an epidural.

447
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,762
And I need a new tech.

448
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:37,445
This guy's coding
is a total mess.

449
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,687
I'm doing a xenotransplant,

450
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,824
but my new resident
refuses to participate.

451
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,058
She think it's immoral.

452
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,560
Dr. Andrews said
I have the power to fire her,

453
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,130
but I am not sure if I should.

454
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:51,731
Mm, if she's this defiant
on day one,

455
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:53,566
it's only gonna get worse.

456
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:57,570
You have been defiant
to your attendings, right?

457
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,756
Surgery you did on Lim
as an example.

458
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,008
That's different.

459
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:04,610
My decision
in Dr. Lim's surgery was right.

460
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:06,767
Dr. Powell, clearly wrong.

461
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,474
Your decision
left her paralyzed.

462
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,383
He's not here to discuss Lim.

463
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,508
Your newbie is trouble
in all caps. Fire her.

464
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:16,709
I'd like to remind you
it's her first day.

465
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,412
It's also your first day.

466
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,219
Take a minute, think about it.

467
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,426
Thank you for your help.

468
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:29,193
You have much more leadership
experience than Lea does.

469
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:32,060
But I trust her more.

470
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,790
I'm going to fire Dr. Powell.

471
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:44,443
It's a pig.

472
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:45,528
It's a life.

473
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:49,844
Animals feel pain and fear.

474
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:52,713
They have emotions,
just like humans.

475
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,505
Every drug we take gets tested on
animals first. Are you against that too?

476
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:57,872
Call me a hypocrite,

477
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:01,833
but I believe that there is a
difference between a rat and a pig.

478
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,709
And as soon
as the tech advances,

479
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:05,762
we should stop using rats, too.

480
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:08,122
Didn't you fight in a war?

481
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:10,382
You're okay
with killing for your country,

482
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,450
but won't sacrifice a pig
for your patient?

483
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,083
I was never okay with killing.

484
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:18,982
And only somebody who's never
been in the military

485
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,743
or known somebody who has been

486
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:24,247
would say something so idiotic.

487
00:24:24,445 --> 00:24:26,505
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

488
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,732
I need to speak
with Dr. Powell.

489
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,591
The pig heart's here.
We need to go.

490
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:40,516
We will finish this later.

491
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,880
Pull it back a little.
You went past the cords.

492
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:56,109
Wish there was a way
we could reach this guy.

493
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,006
At least get him to go outside

494
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:00,180
and stop trying
to fill his loneliness

495
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:01,966
with electronic junk.

496
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:06,402
When my grandma died,
I saved her sweaters

497
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,990
because they smelled
like her pipe tobacco.

498
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,474
That's... interesting,

499
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:14,466
on a number of levels.

500
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,614
But your grandma's sweaters
are obviously different

501
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,529
than a stack of broken TVs
and receivers.

502
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:21,835
And you're handsome... enough.

503
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,320
You don't need to go on about
how much you love your grandma.

504
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,396
Already flirting.

505
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:28,940
He's only been here a few hours.

506
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,227
Have you at least finished
the scope first?

507
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:32,313
Finishing up.

508
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:34,848
I'll export the images
to his chart.

509
00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:37,651
And we were definitely
not flirting.

510
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,130
Absolutely not.

511
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:41,416
I usually wait till the second
day on the job for that.

512
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:51,369
Needle nose.

513
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:53,700
Oh.

514
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:55,982
I always thought the needle nose

515
00:25:56,069 --> 00:25:58,497
was the unsung hero
of the toolbox.

516
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:04,161
Got it.

517
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:08,913
Awesome.

518
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:11,300
Actually, not awesome.

519
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:15,701
Even with all the covers off,
your knees won't fit under.

520
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:16,998
Damn it.

521
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,982
What if you took
the motor out totally?

522
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,204
OR nurses can manually raise
and lower the table without the motor.

523
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:24,438
It's not the motor.
It's the frame,

524
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:27,036
which is welded to the table.

525
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,005
Which means I'm screwed.

526
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:30,438
We can figure this out.

527
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,326
I gotta go.

528
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:38,146
Thanks for your efforts,
but this isn't happening.

529
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,782
Where is the cooler?

530
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:47,013
- Cooler?
- We thought you were bringing the heart.

531
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:48,164
I am.

532
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:56,000
We've found that patient
outcomes were much better

533
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:59,146
if the heart remained in vivo
until the last possible moment.

534
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:02,279
Sign here, please.

535
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,303
For specimen A71923?

536
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:09,309
We're not supposed
to name the specimens,

537
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:12,419
but we call him Wilbur.

538
00:27:14,823 --> 00:27:16,036
Okay.

539
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:24,513
Come along, Wilbur.

540
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,872
We need a pre-op ECHO.

541
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:40,740
How? He's covered in hair.

542
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,366
How do you think?

543
00:27:45,418 --> 00:27:47,444
Is it okay?
They want to see him.

544
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:49,545
I'm sorry. We have to
prep him for surgery.

545
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,254
It is okay.

546
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,943
You can do that
while they pet him.

547
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:07,884
Why does he need an operation?

548
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:12,408
Well, he is giving his heart
to another one of our patients.

549
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:15,209
But how will he live
if he gives his heart away?

550
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,294
No.

551
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:17,994
He can't.

552
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,638
He is going to die.

553
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:23,486
Mm.

554
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:27,031
Dr. Lim.

555
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,240
Dr. Lim.

556
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:32,829
- This better be fast.
- It will be.

557
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,959
I thought I should let you know
that I am firing Dr. Powell.

558
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:37,716
- Okay.
- Okay.

559
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,264
Uh, mind if I ask why?

560
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:41,572
Oh.

561
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:44,568
She refused to participate
in the xenotransplant.

562
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:49,412
She thinks using animals for medical
procedures or research is immoral.

563
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,975
That's an odd opinion
for someone

564
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,685
who wants a career in medicine.

565
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,600
But it's not your job
as an attending

566
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,072
to weed out the bad residents.

567
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:01,057
It's to mentor
and mold them into...

568
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:09,832
It's okay.

569
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,701
Wilbur is very friendly.

570
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,404
Good talk. I gotta go.

571
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,466
We finally figured out
how to lower the light.

572
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:27,233
Still haven't solved
the table issue.

573
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:29,485
I have. Scrap the whole thing.

574
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,087
And do surgery
sitting on the floor?

575
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:35,233
No. On a sturdy, stainless-steel
table that sits on four legs

576
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:36,559
instead of a bulky pedestal.

577
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,513
Like they have
at my butcher shop.

578
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,568
And in our morgue.

579
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:46,974
Your beliefs are misguided
and very wrong.

580
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,740
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim
confirmed

581
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:53,951
that your insubordination
is just cause for termination.

582
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:56,732
I'm sorry you feel that way.

583
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,081
But I understand.

584
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,949
I'll clean out my locker.

585
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,936
You don't have to do that.

586
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:08,060
My job is to mentor and teach
you how to be a good doctor.

587
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:13,482
So I want you to watch the
xenotransplant from the OR gallery.

588
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:16,451
Just because
you think it's immoral

589
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:19,318
doesn't mean you shouldn't
learn how it's done.

590
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,357
Are you willing to do that?

591
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,162
Yeah. Yes.

592
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,044
Good.

593
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,295
You can go now.

594
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,883
There's a lot of blood
from the tumor surface.

595
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,169
I need gauze.

596
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:53,670
It's not stopping.

597
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,678
You need to cut off
the tumor blood supply.

598
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:57,741
Thank you, Dr. Reznick.

599
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,977
Actually, I think the bleeding might be
coming from the superior laryngeal artery.

600
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:10,935
Adding additional
clamp and a silk tie.

601
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:15,873
The bleeding stopped.

602
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,326
Good catch.

603
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:19,609
Thanks.

604
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,138
Looks like you're
more than just a pretty face.

605
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:26,107
My grandma, who I loved
and cherished, would agree.

606
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,287
There's a minor tear in
the inferior epigastric artery.

607
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:44,818
No, I've got this.

608
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:48,365
I need to get more light
and a ten blade.

609
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:52,959
I'll open over the entry site.

610
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:56,693
Thank you.

611
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,896
Come on. Where are you?

612
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:02,982
There it is.

613
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,646
Bipolar forceps.

614
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:12,420
And... we're back on track.

615
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,896
Nice work.

616
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:45,316
It's kind of a big deal. Maybe
you want to say something?

617
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:47,170
Mm. Why?

618
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,263
Never mind.

619
00:32:51,884 --> 00:32:53,763
You're our hero, Wilbur.

620
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,865
Ten blade.

621
00:33:07,503 --> 00:33:09,131
Sternal saw.

622
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,100
Oh.

623
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:25,927
This is harder
than I thought it would be.

624
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:31,287
- You want me to do it?
- No. I am the attending.

625
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:33,732
I will do it.

626
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,084
Okay.

627
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,849
Stop!

628
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:54,885
Motorcyclist just declared
brain dead in the ER.

629
00:33:55,018 --> 00:33:57,475
He's a match, and his family
consented. Heart's on the way.

630
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,455
Oh.

631
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:07,654
Oh.
That felt inappropriate.

632
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:09,310
It was.

633
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:13,029
We need to close over chest
and wake him up.

634
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:21,856
Your surgery
was very successful,

635
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:24,706
and, thankfully,
not innovative at all.

636
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:27,761
You're gonna be fine.

637
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:29,972
Thanks to Dr. Murphy.

638
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,214
It was a team effort.

639
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:39,325
Except for Dr. Powell.

640
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,081
Ah.

641
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,647
I thought
I was supposed to rest.

642
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:52,339
Movement post-surgery helps
the blood flow and recovery.

643
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:07,464
What's a pig doing in here?

644
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,190
His name's Wilbur.

645
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:10,532
He was gonna donate his heart,

646
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,378
but turns out
they didn't need him.

647
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:17,472
Want to meet him?
He's super nice.

648
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,589
Pigs are actually
one of the smartest animals.

649
00:35:22,902 --> 00:35:24,542
I grew up on a farm.

650
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:27,319
We once had a pig
who could do long division.

651
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:29,097
Mm.

652
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:33,472
What's gonna happen to him now?

653
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,393
He'll have to be euthanized.

654
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,641
He's been genetically modified.

655
00:35:38,924 --> 00:35:40,753
Can't be around other pigs.

656
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:45,863
Use you once

657
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:48,300
and throw you away.

658
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,912
You are brilliant.

659
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:14,021
- It worked?
- Perfectly.

660
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:16,122
Wilbur's got a new parent,

661
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,684
and Jeremiah's got a reason to
step outside at least twice a day.

662
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:19,768
Mm.

663
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,380
I'm impressed. Seriously.

664
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,822
You should be.
Because I'm awesome.

665
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:31,074
Jeremiah just needed a
little push in the right direction.

666
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:35,464
I'm glad you didn't just make
a snap judgment

667
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:37,074
based on his appearance.

668
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,871
I thought I knew your type.

669
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:46,332
I'm sorry.

670
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:47,920
Mm.

671
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:51,090
Wanna grab a drink,
let me make it up to you?

672
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:54,019
We're good.

673
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,440
And I'm beat.

674
00:36:57,397 --> 00:37:00,371
Gonna go home,
do some restorative yoga,

675
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:01,881
and, uh, hit the hay.

676
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,410
Yeah, me too.

677
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,410
No, I'm kidding.

678
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:07,072
I'm gonna drink.

679
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,957
But mad respect.

680
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,347
Namaste.

681
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,558
So, he wasn't your type,
but now he is?

682
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:22,522
- I never said that.
- Ooh.

683
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:23,889
You absolutely said it.

684
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:25,355
You just used your flirty voice.

685
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,043
You were like,
"Mad respect. Namaste."

686
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,832
Can we continue this argument
over Negronis?

687
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:35,766
I paid last time.

688
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:37,019
I paid last time.

689
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,630
- No, I paid last time.
- Oh, really?

690
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,989
Yeah, 'cause I had to leave
the tip, too.

691
00:37:42,074 --> 00:37:43,074
Kick.

692
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:45,019
Toes up.

693
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:46,507
Good.

694
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:48,668
Down.

695
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:51,629
How was the appy?

696
00:37:51,817 --> 00:37:52,980
Fine.

697
00:37:53,653 --> 00:37:55,011
Fine, but what?

698
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,925
I'll, uh, get you set up
with the E-stim.

699
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,418
I feel like a racehorse that's
been relegated to the carousel.

700
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:16,644
I used to tell people
that it took me... two years

701
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:19,287
to get back to being
the surgeon that I was,

702
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:22,355
you know, before
the brain cancer and all that.

703
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:24,722
I lied.

704
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:28,269
I never got back to being
the surgeon I was.

705
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:32,106
You're never going to be
the doctor you were.

706
00:38:32,198 --> 00:38:33,761
That's a fact.

707
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:37,324
But you have no idea
the doctor you're gonna become.

708
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:41,879
And I am here for you.

709
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,769
Anytime.

710
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:47,793
Thanks.

711
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:06,907
I've been told you two have
been sniping at each other.

712
00:39:06,992 --> 00:39:09,199
- No, we...
- This is not a conversation.

713
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:12,338
You two need to
sort your stuff out,

714
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:14,623
because I don't ever want
to have to deal with it again.

715
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:16,433
- Yes.
- It won't happen again.

716
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:18,238
Good.

717
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:28,629
So, how was your first day?

718
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,366
Tequila stat!

719
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:34,419
Are we commiserating
or celebrating?

720
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,465
We are definitely celebrating.

721
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,152
Ugh.

722
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:11,687
Come on!

723
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:15,233
- Hey. Tough day?
- Oh.

724
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:18,213
I know you said
you don't want any...

725
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:20,007
No, I... I'm... I can do this.
Thank you.

726
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:25,980
Ah!

727
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:31,209
Come on!

728
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,090
You okay?

729
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:49,175
No, I am not okay.

730
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,392
I'm so sick of this chair.

731
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,650
I'm sick of having to drive
with my hands.

732
00:40:55,735 --> 00:40:57,937
I'm sick of not being able
to get around

733
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,238
because there are stairs
everywhere.

734
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:05,488
And I hate that my body
won't do what I want.

735
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,995
I hate having to train
like an Olympic gymnast

736
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,315
just so I can get off
the damn toilet.

737
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:12,308
And I hate Shaun Murphy.

738
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,691
This is all his fault.

739
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,734
