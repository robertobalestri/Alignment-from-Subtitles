1
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,009
Stop looking at me.

2
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:25,726
Mm, pancakes. The
Peanut is thrilled.

3
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,862
You are wearing the
maternity jeans I bought you.

4
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,263
Glad you're happy about that.

5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,931
You're 28 weeks pregnant.

6
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:34,100
Your weight has
increased 21.5 pounds,

7
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,068
and our baby is moving lower.

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,337
Hmm. At least there's pancakes.

9
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,473
We need to buy a minivan.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,808
No, we don't.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,009
The Striped Tomato has no
infant safety features.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,113
Shaun, I just surrendered
to maternity jeans.

13
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,883
This is not the right time for
broaching the "Mom-mobile."

14
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,218
When would be the right time?

15
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,287
These are amazing.

16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,322
- Did you use buttermilk?
- Greek yogurt.

17
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,595
Mm.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,903
I will e-mail you my spreadsheet
of child-safe vehicles.

19
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,907
We can discuss it
on your lunch break.

20
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:16,339
<font color="#ff65b4"><i>Resync By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,613
Sonja Baylor?

22
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,456
Wait. Who's the Code Gold?

23
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,200
Is it Taylor Swift? Did her
broken heart finally give out?

24
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,326
Better. Roland Barnes.

25
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,597
The green tech guy?

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,810
He was attacked by a tiger.

27
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,265
Sorry. In San Jose?

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,668
At his exotic animal rescue
in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

29
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,713
Concierge doctor called to
say they're on their way.

30
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,706
San Jose General is much closer.

31
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,374
- Why would he come here?
- Because of you.

32
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,719
Deep chest
wall lacerations,

33
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,211
multiple rib fractures,
hemopneumothorax.

34
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,924
I stabilized him and placed a chest
tube, but he needs a CT, stat.

35
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,984
- Dr. Kalu.
- Dr. Andrews.

36
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:02,364
Good to see you, Dr. Murphy.

37
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,959
Oh, hello... Jared.

38
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,160
A famous billionaire
and a cute reunion?

39
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,663
This is almost Swift-worthy.

40
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,144
Is Leo a
decent poker player?

41
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,798
<i>Us Weekly</i> has photos of Roland
coming out of his game last week.

42
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,348
Won my Lambo off him.

43
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,188
No sign of trauma to
the liver or spleen.

44
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,058
Ugh. Beyonce did a private
show at his birthday?

45
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,994
Ah. It was awesome.

46
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,062
No major intraperitoneal
hematoma.

47
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,765
Moving on to the chest.

48
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:53,040
So, how does one go
from St. Bon's resident

49
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,308
to concierge doctor

50
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,962
for the fifth richest
man in the world?

51
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,613
I was working at Denver Memorial

52
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,746
when I met Roland

53
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,517
at a fundraiser
hosted by my parents.

54
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,587
His wife collapsed during
the silent auction.

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,220
Nutmeg allergy.

56
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,691
I gave her an epi and helped
her to outbid John Legend

57
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,264
for a weekend at an
underwater hotel.

58
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,694
Well...

59
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,562
Roland hired me that night.

60
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,631
Why does he need a
personal physician?

61
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,099
Does he often get
attacked by wild animals?

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,870
Uh, chronic sciatica.

63
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,740
And he travels a lot, you
know, so there's vaccines,

64
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,576
plus BOTOX injections,
cholesterol scripts,

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,310
medical advice for
friends and family.

66
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,080
Why'd you leave St. Bon's?

67
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,182
He was fired for assaulting an
attending who harassed Claire,

68
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,751
and then he sued the hospital.

69
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,620
- You're that guy.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,388
I hear Andrews is, uh,
not your biggest fan.

71
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,922
Surprised he let
me in the building.

72
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,996
Depressed and dislocated sternum,
manubrium, and rib fractures.

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,465
They're too fragmented

74
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,078
for a standard sternal
reconstruction.

75
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,802
- He still does this, huh?
- Mm.

76
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,580
Always makes my day.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,582
I have an idea.

78
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,184
This is why I
brought Roland here.

79
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,458
It's a girl.

80
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,561
We're naming her Esther.

81
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,296
We hope she'll be
brave and selfless

82
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,232
like Queen Esther,

83
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,445
baddest bitch in the Bible.

84
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,268
How are the meds going?

85
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,104
Fine.

86
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,001
Any excessive discharge?

87
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,917
Oh, a couple of days
ago, I was on a walk,

88
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,822
and it was a little
like I'd peed myself.

89
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,399
Could that be from the MilliDox?

90
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,149
No, you're actually
on the placebo.

91
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,156
Your amniotic
fluid is a bit low.

92
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,078
We should admit you
for further testing.

93
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:54,895
He asked for you.

94
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,530
Inoperable leiomyosarcoma

95
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,943
with major vascular involvement.

96
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,136
What are you doing here?

97
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:07,327
I'm dying.

98
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,210
My doctors say

99
00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:13,161
that there's nothing
they can do for me.

100
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,720
I'm hoping you can.

101
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,655
We should get a
CT and a PET scan.

102
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,222
Fine.

103
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,361
We will
completely rebuild

104
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,997
your sternum and
anterior chest wall

105
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,966
with donor bones
and titanium plates.

106
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,768
It is a very
complicated surgery.

107
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,670
Jared says you're a
damn good surgeon.

108
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,540
Yes, I am a damn good surgeon.

109
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,609
He is.

110
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,078
And I'll be overseeing your
care every step of the way.

111
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,665
Appreciate the
personal attention.

112
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,348
I want Jared there, too.

113
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,585
Jared is my doctor.

114
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,253
Dr. Kalu will be read in
on every major decision.

115
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:55,555
I want him in the OR.

116
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,360
I will fast-track your
surgical privileges.

117
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,652
Something's going
on between you two.

118
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,717
I'm very perceptive that way.

119
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,220
- It's a long story.
- Hmm.

120
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,123
I saw on his chart
he's from Phoenix,

121
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,792
and he broke his arm
a couple years ago

122
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,427
at a Tae Kwon Do
match, your sport.

123
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,731
So, I'm gonna go with
he's your Johnny Lawrence

124
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,299
who cheated during your match
at the All Valley tournament.

125
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,135
I've been watching
a lot of <i>Cobra Kai.</i>

126
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,906
He slept with my wife,

127
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,742
so yes to the cheating,
no to the tournament.

128
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,754
This is from six months ago.

129
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,425
This is from today.

130
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,563
A leiomyosarcoma should have
progressed more than that.

131
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,363
Yeah, maybe they had
the diagnosis wrong.

132
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:23,252
Release the pectoral
muscles from the attachment medially.

133
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,947
Should I place
the low-profile plate?

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,640
Don't you need to create
a landing zone for the fixation?

135
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,286
He is right.

136
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,923
Get better exposure by elevating

137
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,692
the right pectoral
muscle from the ribs.

138
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,362
I understand SF
General's cardiac unit

139
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,098
is named after your boss

140
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,468
and that he sponsored a surgical
exchange program with Haiti.

141
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,430
Dr. Kalu, would you like
to place the screws?

142
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,474
Very much so.

143
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,477
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

144
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,314
Drill guide,
self-tapping screws.

145
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,420
Feels good.

146
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,491
You have been very
polite to Dr. Kalu,

147
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,727
despite having fired him.

148
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,529
Is that only because you
want a donation from Roland?

149
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:20,552
- It's okay. You don't...
- It's true.

150
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,669
Dr. Kalu and I did not
part on the best of terms,

151
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,671
but I'm happy you
found your niche.

152
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,908
And I believe in
the work we do here,

153
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,044
and Roland Barnes can
help us do even more.

154
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,380
I told Roland this was the
best hospital in the state.

155
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,748
When we get him healthy,

156
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,161
I'll be happy to tell him again.

157
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,755
BP's dropping. Cardiac
output is awful.

158
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,123
He's
in heart failure.

159
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,034
The cardiac contusion must have
been too small to spot on CT.

160
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,626
He needs a balloon pump

161
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,495
to help his heart
circulate more blood.

162
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,948
And we need to get it in the
next five minutes, or he dies.

163
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:54,770
BP has stabilized.

164
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:56,872
Cardiac output is improving.

165
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,673
He should make a full recovery,

166
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:01,167
but he should not get so close
to jungle cats in the future.

167
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,982
In the... In the OR,
I really missed that.

168
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:11,286
Then why did you
stop being a surgeon?

169
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,821
Um, working for Roland

170
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:15,057
was too interesting an
opportunity to pass up.

171
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,325
Is sciatica interesting to you?

172
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,027
No, it's more, um...

173
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:20,562
- I came as soon as I heard.
- Hey.

174
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,164
Poor Rolly.

175
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:24,166
Uh, Shaun, this is
my girlfriend Dalia.

176
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,400
Hi.

177
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:27,334
You...

178
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,038
I have seen you on the bus

179
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,908
in a-a perfume ad.

180
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,948
Fern test confirms

181
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:42,184
it's a premature rupture
of the membranes.

182
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,197
We should terminate before
an infection sets in.

183
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,754
What about in-patient expectant

184
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:47,189
management and antibiotics?

185
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:49,525
PPROM pregnancies can
be carried to term.

186
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,698
Rarely, and when they are,
babies are likely to have

187
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,395
cerebral palsy,
neurologic abnormalities,

188
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,660
intellectual disability...

189
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:57,903
Which we'll tell the parents, but
this is a badly-wanted pregnancy.

190
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,868
They've been trying to
conceive for five years,

191
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:02,304
had two first-trimester
miscarriages already.

192
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:04,275
Saving the baby may
be her priority.

193
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,215
But saving her is ours.

194
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:08,569
Sonja is our patient.

195
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:11,746
We should explain her options
but recommend termination.

196
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:18,019
Morgan is right, but be
clear about the options.

197
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,792
The seat springs
allow the car seat

198
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:25,327
to move more than one inch,

199
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,763
which creates
additional injury risk.

200
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,967
There are no over-shoulder seat
belts in the back for the car seat,

201
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,270
no crumple zone, and you would
have to install a roll cage,

202
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:38,043
which still would not be as reliable
as one built into the vehicle.

203
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:40,075
Since you hate minivans,

204
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,078
I have looked into hatchbacks and
SUVs with sufficient safety features.

205
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:46,648
It's not just about
hating minivans.

206
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,851
- What is it about?
- I love this car.

207
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,419
It's my history.

208
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,288
My brother and I restored it,

209
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:55,457
used to drive it to
shows at The Fillmore.

210
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,872
You and I took it on our first
road trip. I can't sell it.

211
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:01,263
Then... we do not have to.

212
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:03,036
As long as you never
put the Peanut in it.

213
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:04,499
We still need a family car.

214
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,134
Yeah, we do.

215
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:10,839
Roland's awake.

216
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,114
But it's possible that
we could save our baby?

217
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:21,850
You'd have to live here.

218
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,118
We'd monitor you every day

219
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,353
and give you prophylactic
antibiotics and steroids

220
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,489
when the baby gets
closer to viability.

221
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:30,492
To be clear,
even with all of that,

222
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,128
you may still develop a
serious uterine infection

223
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,197
that could require
a hysterectomy

224
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,499
or cause fatal complications.

225
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,125
I think we should terminate.

226
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:53,181
What would you do...

227
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,552
if it was your baby?

228
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,654
Termination is the safest.

229
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:00,155
I was talking to Dr. Allen.

230
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,194
I would...

231
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:09,998
pray on it.

232
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:14,936
And then?

233
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:19,586
I want to know
what you would do.

234
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:35,857
I think I...

235
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,195
would try to save the baby.

236
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:49,204
We have to fight for our Esther.

237
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,247
We'd need a biopsy

238
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,141
before we can give you
any definitive answer.

239
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:04,986
Okay.

240
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,121
So, when do we do that?

241
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,593
I'll give you a detailed referral
to take to another doctor.

242
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,927
If I wanted to go to another
doctor, I would have.

243
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,037
I don't have to
keep treating you.

244
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:15,230
But you will.

245
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,229
You're not a quitter.

246
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,570
You worked your ass off
to save your marriage.

247
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:23,410
You never tapped out
in a fight. You...

248
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,627
I always admired
your persistence.

249
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:29,978
I kinda hated it, too.

250
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,700
Looking back at my life...

251
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:42,257
I don't like the view.

252
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,698
I hurt... a lot of people.

253
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,262
That's the real reason
that I came here.

254
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:57,807
For forgiveness.

255
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,288
The intra-aortic
balloon pump worked.

256
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,623
You won't need a new heart.

257
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:16,458
Great.

258
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:18,026
So, when can I get out of here?

259
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,563
Oh, not for a few days.

260
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,197
We will need to monitor you

261
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,265
for post-surgical complications.

262
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,201
Your heart rate is elevated.

263
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,803
Have you been exerting yourself?

264
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:35,803
She did most of the exerting.

265
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:40,850
Okay.

266
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,098
I need 1,000 milligrams
levetiracetam

267
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,416
and 4 milligrams
lorazepam, stat!

268
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:47,847
Is Rolly gonna be okay?

269
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,604
Roland had a seizure.

270
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,507
You... should sit down.

271
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,354
Dalia was there.

272
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:19,156
Naked.

273
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,326
They were having sex.

274
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,636
Dalia and I aren't together.

275
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,170
She's with Roland.

276
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:35,039
It's part of the gig.

277
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:36,775
I pretend she's with
me so Roland's wife

278
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,869
doesn't get suspicious
that Dalia's always around.

279
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:41,411
Oh.

280
00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:44,454
You think that sex
brought on the seizure?

281
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:48,085
Oh. Arousal can increase
the heart rate by 38%,

282
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,022
and if his brain was
also deprived of oxygen,

283
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:51,966
it could cause a seizure,
which would mean his heart

284
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,491
is still not pumping
enough blood.

285
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,031
Does it bother you to have
to lie on a regular basis?

286
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:02,233
It's not my favorite responsibility,
but it's a great job, so...

287
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,401
Why is it a great job?

288
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:11,527
On my last day, Shaun, you told me
that one day I will be very happy.

289
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,078
But I was miserable.

290
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,279
I felt like a failure.

291
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,910
And then I met Roland, and
he saw something in me,

292
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:25,222
this guy that I really admired,
that the world admired.

293
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:27,525
You know, he... he valued me.

294
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,429
And I certainly don't mind
flying private to Amsterdam

295
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:33,665
to have rijsttafel with the
Queen of the Netherlands.

296
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,434
I also said you would
fulfill your potential.

297
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:38,536
And I'm not doing that?

298
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,170
No.

299
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,942
Sciatica?

300
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,299
Thanks for reminding
me I'm still a failure.

301
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:55,887
I'll get the BNP test and
echo and check out his heart.

302
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,363
Inject saline to
get us to submucosal plane.

303
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,003
Why'd you stay on the case?

304
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:12,236
There's the tumor.

305
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,273
He was right. I take my
obligations seriously.

306
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:17,408
Take four samples.

307
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:22,848
Not because some part of
you wants to forgive him?

308
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:24,248
Withdraw the scope slowly.

309
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,587
He doesn't deserve it.

310
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:36,628
Let's start with a sofa.

311
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:38,063
Let's take a look.

312
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:41,298
Finally, somebody recognizes
my interior design genius.

313
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,300
Looks nice.

314
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:46,772
Hey, I love this. I'll take it.

315
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:48,172
No.

316
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,185
This is literally the
first thing you've sat on.

317
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:53,511
Okay, I'll sit in ten other ones,
and then I'll take this one.

318
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:55,847
No. If you know you like
something, stick with it.

319
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,383
Like my car.

320
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:02,553
Shaun wants to buy a minivan.

321
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:05,957
And what, you want to put your
infant in a '75 Gran Torino?

322
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:08,325
No. It's not safe for a baby.

323
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:10,695
But...

324
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,830
it is...

325
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,434
cool.

326
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:22,708
Even when I am going to
my super grown-up job

327
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:24,643
in my lady-boss pantsuit,

328
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:29,915
I get to get out of
that car, and I'm cool.

329
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:36,220
And soon, I will be just
another 30-something mom

330
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,555
in a practical car

331
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:40,391
with a baby seat in the back
and spit-up on my shirt.

332
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:45,197
Maddie's mom used to warn
me to take two shirts

333
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,632
whenever I went
out with the baby.

334
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:50,035
- I had to learn the hard way.
- How?

335
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,071
H-How do I want
this baby so badly,

336
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,676
but feel so icked
out by being a mom?

337
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:01,046
Define "icked out."

338
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:02,913
Like...

339
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:05,416
mnh.

340
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,753
I don't know.

341
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,788
Okay, that's well said.

342
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:10,921
I don't know.

343
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,590
Hey, you got mixed emotions.

344
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:13,964
Welcome to the human condition.

345
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,728
I'm gonna take this one.

346
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,434
Her fever's hiked.
She's in a lot of pain.

347
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:27,038
Her heart rate's 117. Fetal heart
rate 180. They're both tachycardic.

348
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:29,775
500 milligrams acetaminophen
and start ampicillin.

349
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,413
This is the infection
we were worried about.

350
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:41,720
Your baby is very
unlikely to survive,

351
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:43,955
and your life is in danger.

352
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,324
We need to terminate now.

353
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,697
But her heart's still beating.

354
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,134
Esther can only
stay alive in utero,

355
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:59,738
and as long as she's in there,
you'll keep getting sicker.

356
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:03,642
I'm so sorry.

357
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm here. We can
get through this.

358
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,750
We can try again.

359
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:18,757
No.

360
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:29,267
Your baby needs at least
two more weeks to be viable,

361
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,170
and if we wait that long,
you will probably die.

362
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,640
"If I perish, I perish."

363
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,576
That's what Queen Esther said

364
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,578
before she risked her
life to save her family.

365
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:43,782
Sonja.

366
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,785
"If I perish...

367
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:51,421
I perish."

368
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:02,334
According
to your BNP test and echo,

369
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,203
your seizure was not
related to heart trauma.

370
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:07,072
The EEG will let us
assess your brain.

371
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:08,840
So, what's your pitch?

372
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:10,809
Hospital presidents
don't supervise EEGs.

373
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,014
I've been very impressed

374
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,216
by your Global
Engineers Initiative,

375
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,652
and I think we can do the
same thing with medicine,

376
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:22,854
train doctors from
the developing world

377
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,232
to take care of
their own people.

378
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:25,816
What makes St. Bon's
the place to do it?

379
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,059
We're very hands-on here.

380
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:30,527
Our residents don't just
do appies and lap choles.

381
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,197
With the guidance
of our attendings,

382
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,130
they come up with complex
treatment solutions,

383
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:36,368
untangle the thorniest
ethical dilemmas,

384
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,403
and learn how to provide
top-notch patient care.

385
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,572
If we could sponsor
more residents

386
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,742
from the developing world,

387
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,995
we'll send them home ready
to serve their communities.

388
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:48,445
But Jared, who I
trust with my life,

389
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,224
wasn't good enough to be
one of those residents.

390
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:51,248
You fired him.

391
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:55,387
You saw something
in him I missed.

392
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:56,888
- Mm.
- But I'm seeing it now,

393
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,302
and I've granted
him full access.

394
00:21:58,657 --> 00:21:59,824
That's a very politic answer.

395
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,878
What do you think, Jared?
Has he earned my money?

396
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:06,473
I learned a tremendous
amount here at St. Bon's,

397
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,767
and as you've experienced,
the care is top-notch.

398
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,002
Mm, unfortunately,
the food isn't.

399
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:14,039
Oh, text Dalia and ask her to
bring us back some of those, um,

400
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:16,841
pork buns from Yank Sing. Ohh.

401
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,076
Dalia went into the city?

402
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,644
Mm-hmm, to meet up with friends.

403
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:20,818
And you're okay with that?

404
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:22,113
Why wouldn't I be?

405
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,081
No reason.

406
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,517
Uh, all right.

407
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:28,753
Let's start this. Close
your eyes and relax.

408
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,159
Labs confirm Sonja
has chorioamnionitis.

409
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,459
We should add gentamicin.

410
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,594
That would damage
the baby's kidneys.

411
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:39,297
It's our only way
to keep Sonja alive,

412
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:41,900
and it buys us time to
convince her to terminate.

413
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:43,702
She's being suicidal.

414
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:44,879
Risking your life for your child

415
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:46,537
is usually considered admirable.

416
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:49,007
Not if you're both
going to die...

417
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,009
because of the false
hope you gave her.

418
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,610
I answered a patient's question.

419
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,079
You gave her permission.

420
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:56,314
We're supposed to at
least try to be objective.

421
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:59,617
Objectivity is a myth,
especially on this subject.

422
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,271
I know the pain
Sonja's grappling with.

423
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:02,953
So do I.

424
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,831
I was in med school,
on birth control,

425
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:15,100
and I got pregnant anyway.

426
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,237
I wasn't ready for a kid.

427
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,940
I was scared...

428
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:24,475
and sad...

429
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:27,344
and relieved.

430
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,682
It was medical procedure
I had years ago,

431
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:31,975
and I'm at peace with it now.

432
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,651
Most women are.

433
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:37,155
Because it was their choice.

434
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:38,957
A choice you got to
make, and I did, too.

435
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,226
Let Sonja make hers.

436
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,661
It's not our job to help
patients choose death.

437
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,634
Her lungs are failing.

438
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:57,811
Her O2 sats are falling.
Fever's climbing.

439
00:23:58,912 --> 00:23:59,947
Intubation cart.

440
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,949
Administer propofol
and rocuronium.

441
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,518
Hey, we need to sedate
you so we can intubate.

442
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,054
That'll keep you breathing,
but the only way to...

443
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,355
No. You can't kill her.

444
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,525
Esther's life before mine.

445
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,193
- Sonja, please.
- Promise me.

446
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,196
- I can't.
- Promise me.

447
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:26,807
Anthony.

448
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,480
I p...

449
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:34,848
I promise.

450
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,352
I love you.

451
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:54,344
Shaun, check out the activity in the
left frontal lobe from Roland's EEG.

452
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,836
Interictal spikes.

453
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,272
They are very small,
likely incidental.

454
00:24:58,405 --> 00:24:59,673
Hmm.

455
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:02,409
Roland's selfish and possessive.

456
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,302
He hates it when people
have fun without him,

457
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:06,747
but today he was
totally fine with Dalia

458
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,720
hanging out with friends
while he's stuck here.

459
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:11,451
Being unselfish is a symptom.

460
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:13,025
Maybe one of his
wounds got infected.

461
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,522
Bacterial encephalitis
from the claws or teeth.

462
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:17,758
This could be subtle edema.

463
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,826
Plus behavioral changes
and interictal spikes.

464
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,561
That sounds like
neurocysticercosis.

465
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:23,455
- A tapeworm cyst.
- With larva in the brain.

466
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:29,870
But it would take a tapeworm weeks to
fully form larva and a cyst in his brain.

467
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:31,538
The attack was two days ago.

468
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,410
Ooh.

469
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:39,079
Roland's last local safari
was about two months ago,

470
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,081
and he fell into a giant
pile of tiger crap.

471
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,251
We can remove the cyst and larva

472
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:47,087
with stereotactic navigation
and hydrodissection.

473
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,455
- Awesome.
- Oh!

474
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,460
You're not a failure.

475
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,103
Seriously? Four guesses?
I got it in two.

476
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,106
What's up with you?

477
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,608
You lose a patient?

478
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:13,459
Actually, I might save one.

479
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,116
Joe.

480
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,919
Mia's Joe?

481
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,922
Waiting on his biopsy results.

482
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,092
He asked me to forgive him.

483
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:27,427
What did you say?

484
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,430
I refused.

485
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:32,565
You would have, too.

486
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,167
Hmm, well, maybe.

487
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,238
Then again, I am capable
of letting things go.

488
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:39,506
I can let things go.

489
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:42,943
I prioritized my
career for a day,

490
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:44,436
which you decided
was unacceptable,

491
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:46,947
even after I changed my mind.

492
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,785
And how long did it
take you to forgive Mia?

493
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,820
Dr. Park.

494
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,525
Your diagnosis is in.

495
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,877
Right this way, guys.

496
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:10,537
Be careful. You've got history
you're carrying right there.

497
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,477
There's a couple of
steps. Be careful.

498
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,090
Thanks, guys. First
door on the right.

499
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,247
Stadium seats?

500
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,983
Authentic Candlestick
Park stadium seats.

501
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:24,684
Got them from a broker.

502
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:26,353
- Very cool.
- Right?

503
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:28,822
- Thank you for the inspiration.
- You're welcome.

504
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,359
Your turn next. Get your coat.

505
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,091
You have a stromal
tumor in your stomach

506
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,535
and a small lesion
on your liver.

507
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,902
And we can remove both.

508
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,069
You'll be cancer-free.

509
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:46,840
Hmm.

510
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:51,546
T-That's incredible.

511
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:53,013
Thank you.

512
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:56,349
You get it, right?

513
00:27:56,484 --> 00:27:57,584
You're not dying.

514
00:27:58,819 --> 00:27:59,853
Yes.

515
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:02,254
This is amazing.

516
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,026
I'm so grateful.

517
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,597
- But it...
- That's not why you came here.

518
00:28:30,383 --> 00:28:32,453
Sonja will likely be
in multi-organ failure

519
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:35,021
within the next 48 hours.

520
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:37,558
And when that happens,
Esther will not survive.

521
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:43,730
But if we terminate
now, Sonja still can.

522
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,967
You can save your wife's life.

523
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,070
It's all up to you.

524
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,284
He says...

525
00:29:06,987 --> 00:29:08,088
He says he can't do it.

526
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,658
He needs to keep his promise.

527
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,598
I know what to do.

528
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:25,502
<i>♪♪ Yeah, lacing the
shoes I'm on the move ♪♪</i>

529
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:27,061
<i>♪♪ I got so much to prove ♪♪</i>

530
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,476
<i>♪♪ Ain't no substitute
For hard work... ♪♪</i>

531
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,836
- Sorry, man.

You okay?

539
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,251
A worm laid eggs in my skull?

540
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,943
Larva.

541
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:03,113
You were right.
Murphy's the best.

542
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,160
What would you say
to $100 million?

543
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:16,726
I'd say that's remarkably
generous, uh, but...

544
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:18,338
You can't accept it.

545
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:23,200
You are not medically fit to
be making any major decisions

546
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:25,107
because of the larva.

547
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:28,571
I closed a huge deal last week
with Mr. Worm as my consigliere.

548
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,140
I feel pretty competent.

549
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:34,146
Well, I'd be happy to accept
your money after the surgery.

550
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,397
Sonja, it's okay.

551
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:49,260
I turned off your sedation.

552
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:52,528
I need to talk to you.

553
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,637
I'm gonna let go of your hands,

554
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:56,165
but you can't pull out the tube.

555
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:13,039
When I was 18,

556
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:15,854
I had an abortion.

557
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:22,310
That child would
have been 11 now,

558
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,711
just starting middle school.

559
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:29,135
Every time I see a kid that age,

560
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:32,698
I think about who
they would have become

561
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:36,070
or what kind of mom
I would have been.

562
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,111
I believe God's forgiven me.

563
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:43,323
That's kinda His thing.

564
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:49,380
And I believe God picked
you for motherhood.

565
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,956
You are so strong,

566
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:55,558
so brave,

567
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:59,272
with such a deep
capacity for love.

568
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:10,354
But your Esther isn't
developed enough

569
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:12,542
to survive outside of the womb.

570
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:16,307
The infection will
kill both of you.

571
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:23,951
I told you if I were you, I
would try to save the baby.

572
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,734
I prayed for a miracle.

573
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:33,404
And I don't know why
it didn't come today.

574
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:42,556
The only way for you to be
the mom God wants you to be...

575
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:47,650
is to let Esther go.

We were able to

No additional metastasis.

616

621
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:47,529
and larva.

622
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:49,055
Awesome.

623
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:52,604
- And I might hurl.
- Let's close.

624
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:56,957
Can Dr. Kalu do the closing?

625
00:36:58,363 --> 00:36:59,547
Be my guest.

626
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:04,890
4-0 NUROLON.

627
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:10,409
You said you
missed being a surgeon.

628
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:13,513
If you complete
your residency here,

629
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:14,961
you can do more than closing.

630
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,218
I doubt he wants to go
from five-star restaurants

631
00:37:18,243 --> 00:37:19,619
to hospital vending machines.

632
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:24,644
Actually... someone,
um, helped me realize

633
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:26,134
that I'd love a
second chance here.

634
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:36,545
The Chief
of Surgery's responsible

635
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:38,538
for all hiring decisions
in her department.

636
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,048
I've, uh... I've
learned a lot about myself,

637
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:46,199
how to better communicate,

638
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:48,148
how to manage challenging
personalities.

639
00:37:48,173 --> 00:37:49,542
Hmm.

640
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:52,363
I hear Roland can be a handful.

641
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,682
Prepared me for tough patients
and tougher attendings.

642
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,078
And my surgical skills
are still sharp.

643
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:01,222
Andrews actually let
me do Roland's closing.

644
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,702
I'm impressed.

645
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:06,572
Murphy really wants you on
his team. That carries weight.

646
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,961
But I don't have any openings
for third-year residents.

647
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:15,407
I understand.

648
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,142
But I do have a slot
for a first-year.

649
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:48,935
I-I'm so sorry for your loss.

650
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:12,119
So our Esther will
always be with me.

651
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,503
Someday,

652
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:22,527
maybe we can tell her brothers
and sisters all about her.

653
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:39,764
Oh.

654
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:41,895
Aw yee...

655
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,890
This car is perfect
for the Peanut.

656
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,867
- And pretty cool, too.
- Aw yee...

657
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,202
Oh, let's take this
rocket ship for a ride.

658
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:52,504
Oh, man.

659
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:54,312
Aw yee...

660
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:10,723
Dr. Andrews.

661
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,191
Here's your check.

662
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:18,872
And this is what happens
when you poach my employees.

663
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,412
This is so good, especially
after a day like today.

664
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,887
- To our differences.
- Mm.

665
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,583
Mm. If you'll excuse me.

666
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,732
Time to exercise my
reproductive freedom.

667
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:51,098
I'm doing my third round of IVF.

668
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:54,350
You're gonna go jab yourself in the
belly alone in the hospital bathroom?

669
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:57,969
Gimme.

670
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:01,480
- I am a doctor.
- Mm.

671
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:04,604
Have at it.

672
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,987
To reuniting with old friends.

673
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,785
And a mommy mocktail

674
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:21,327
with fresh rosemary.

675
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:22,562
Yum.

676
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:24,513
Love having bougie Kalu back.

677
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:27,033
To Jared...

678
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,267
Mm.

679
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:31,004
Fulfilling his potential

680
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:33,206
as my new first-year resident.

681
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:42,749
Oh, it's probably Glassy.

682
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:48,650
You Dr. Shaun Murphy?

683
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,943
Yes.

684
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,432
I am an attending surgeon

685
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:53,395
at San Jose St.
Bonaventure Hospital.

686
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:55,895
You've just been served.

687
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,317
You're being sued
for malpractice.

688
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,623
It wasn't Dr. Glassman.
