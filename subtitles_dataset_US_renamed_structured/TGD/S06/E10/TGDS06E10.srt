00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,606
<i>Previously on "The
Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:05,083
Glassman found movement
in my psoas and glutes.

3
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:07,775
He and Murphy found an
endoscopic solution.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,810
- How about I make you dinner?
- Sounds good.

5
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:10,937
It's a date then.

6
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:12,163
A date.

7
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:14,567
Audrey... Will you marry me?

8
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:19,085
Shaun. I'm pregnant.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,620
My OB told us it isn't
safe for me... or the baby.

10
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:23,832
Danny!

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,555
No, no, no. Danny.

12
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:26,766
Danny.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,591
<i>♪ Let the sun burn my eyes ♪</i>

14
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:40,393
<i>♪ Awake, my heart is
open wide to you ♪</i>

15
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:42,693
- Good morning.
- Morning.

16
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,113
I'll get the coffee.

17
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:46,540
This is my third stay in a week.

18
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:49,003
I no longer require
guest-level service.

19
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:50,430
I want the practice.

20
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:56,397
Two cups, no cane,

21
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:59,125
no guarantee how
long it'll take.

22
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,697
Well, when it comes to you,
my patience is boundless.

23
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,931
One of the many things
I adore about you.

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,515
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,109
<i>♪ Inside my mind, oh ♪</i>

26
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,414
It's
been three months.

27
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,842
The man's a saint.

28
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,988
I have been recovering
from a major surgery

29
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,648
and re-learning to walk.

30
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:22,342
Your recovery's remarkable.

31
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,233
So is your procrastination.

32
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,893
I am taking the time to consider

33
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,319
the biggest decision of my life.

34
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:28,300
Clay's fine.

35
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:30,353
No man... no <i>person...</i>

36
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:33,615
Is fine waiting this long for
an answer to that question.

37
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:38,345
Ever done one of
whatever this is before?

38
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,671
No. You?

39
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,130
Mm-mm.

40
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:44,065
I've been clean for 92 days.

41
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,718
I went to rehab for two months,

42
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,145
and I go to meetings
every single day.

43
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,287
I don't know if you two
can ever trust me again,

44
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,325
but I am willing to
do whatever it takes

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,781
to earn back my place here.

46
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:59,629
And we'll do everything we can
to support you in your recovery.

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,193
But our number-one obligation
is to our patients.

48
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:04,254
For their safety and yours,

49
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:06,220
we need to put some
guardrails in place.

50
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,103
You'll be on probation
for six months.

51
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:12,094
You cannot prescribe
or administer

52
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,869
any controlled substances.

53
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,638
You will be given
random drug tests,

54
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,665
and every step of
your patient care

55
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,475
will be supervised by the
Senior Resident on your case.

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,865
Today that is Dr. Allen.

57
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,275
You okay with those
terms, Dr. Perez?

58
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,417
Absolutely.

59
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,172
I'm just happy to be here.

60
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,687
How are you?

61
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,190
Better.

62
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,025
A lot better.

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,275
I hadn't heard from you.

64
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,785
Which is totally understandable.

65
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,527
I just wasn't sure...

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,962
I didn't know what to say.

67
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:55,871
You're not the reason
that... That happened.

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,969
As your supervisor on the case,

69
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:06,565
I will oversee your charting,
your patient interactions,

70
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,126
double-check your med orders.

71
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:12,539
And this.

72
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,279
Fetal
movement is good.

73
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,239
Heart rate is normal at 150.

74
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,056
I've been monitoring
the heart rate daily.

75
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,185
It ranges from 146 to 163 BPM.

76
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,112
Her last emesis was
three weeks ago.

77
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:33,912
So the nausea's getting better.

78
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,505
- Great.
- And the fatigue.

79
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,567
Less improvement on the
constant state of terror.

80
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,716
You made it through
the first trimester.

81
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,901
- You're doing great.
- Mm.

82
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,268
You two want to know
the sex of the baby?

83
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,294
- Yes.
- No. Don't look.

84
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,503
It'll be a fun surprise.

85
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,297
Oh.

86
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:52,356
It is fun to be prepared.

87
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,472
Oh.

88
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,443
What's going on?

89
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:05,942
There is
a small, thinning area

90
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,207
on your uterine wall.

91
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,613
It is slightly hypoechoic,

92
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:12,887
likely a result of the scar
tissue from your prior surgery

93
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:14,525
and Asherman's syndrome.

94
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,357
Is that bad? It sounds bad.

95
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,717
Mm.

96
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:23,232
If it progresses, your
uterus could rupture

97
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:26,028
and we would lose the baby.

98
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,719
But it's very possible the
lining will remain stable

99
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:33,972
and your pregnancy
will progress normally.

100
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,647
What happens now?

101
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,574
We'll put you on bed rest
and monitor you closely.

102
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,203
You're wrong.

103
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,740
There may be a surgery
that can fix this.

104
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:59,848
I need to talk to
Dr. Lim and Dr. Glassman.

105
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:07,178
<font color="#ff65b4"><i>Resync By M_I_S

106
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,152
Hello. I have admitted
Lea for close monitoring

107
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:19,650
and a follow-up MRI,

108
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,797
which detected a small amount
of free fluid in the abdomen.

109
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,832
This, plus a slight
decline in the hematocrit,

110
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,061
increases the likelihood
of rupture by 3% to 5%.

111
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,404
Shaun, I'm so sorry.

112
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,698
How are you and Lea holding up?

113
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:33,025
Oh. Fine.

114
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,152
I found a surgery to fix it.

115
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,542
I have spent the
last three months

116
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,873
researching every complication
of Asherman's syndrome.

117
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,867
I discovered an
experimental procedure

118
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:43,262
to reinforce the uterine
lining with collagen fleece

119
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,662
that will expand as
the uterus grows.

120
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,383
I have studied the technique,

121
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:49,658
and I will teach
you how to do it.

122
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,693
How many times has this
procedure been done?

123
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,587
Five. Three had good outcomes

124
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,464
and the babies were
carried to full term,

125
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,746
and the odds are better for Lea

126
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,450
because you are
above-average surgeons.

127
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,809
Shaun, I
don't need to remind you,

128
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,169
but this procedure
can induce labor

129
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,795
and can cause major bleeding.

130
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,121
You could lose the baby.

131
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,983
If we wait and the
uterus ruptures,

132
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,813
we will definitely lose the baby

133
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:15,648
and Lea could suffer a
catastrophic hemorrhage.

134
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:17,608
Due to the size of
the uterine window,

135
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,839
there's a good chance it won't.

136
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:21,893
No, with Lea's prior surgery
and the significant scar tissue,

137
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,928
I put the likelihood of
rupture at close to 65%.

138
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:26,455
Those chances...

139
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,741
not good.

140
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,529
Lea's body, her call.

141
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,853
Drew Dewitt.

142
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:39,883
Has recurrent desmoid tumors
caused by Gardner's syndrome.

143
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,470
The one on his liver is benign,

144
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:43,230
but it hasn't
responded to chemo.

145
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:45,757
It's encroaching on the stomach
and spleen. It has to come out.

146
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,847
Thus, the surgical consult.

147
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:52,799
He has almost no
small intestine.

148
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,836
He needed a major
resection a year ago.

149
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,067
He's been living off IV
nutrition ever since.

150
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,721
I've treated him for
post-op infections

151
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:00,585
and pain management
over the last year.

152
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,319
I've never seen this much
scar tissue in a patient.

153
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:04,112
How many surgeries has he had?

154
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:08,141
20. Plus 16 rounds chemo
and 34 hospital stays.

155
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,403
Unfortunately, we have to add
one more surgery to that list.

156
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:14,544
Will this surgery affect his
place on the transplant list?

157
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,804
We've been waiting over
a year for a small bowel.

158
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:19,682
Apparently, I'm "too
healthy" to move to the top.

159
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:23,110
It shouldn't, barring long-term
infection or other organ damage.

160
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:25,702
When you're ready, we
can take you to pre-op.

161
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,289
- You got this, D.
- You know it.

162
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,504
I have no idea.

163
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,253
Would you
like us to go over

164
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:53,913
the risks and benefits again?

165
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,384
No, I know everything
that could go wrong.

166
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,076
All I can see is
what can go wrong.

167
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,502
You don't have to
decide right now.

168
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,129
We can continue to monitor.

169
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:03,558
If we wait, the uterine
window could expand

170
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,097
and make the surgery more risky.

171
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:07,367
Now is the safest time.

172
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,993
Don't pressure her, Shaun.

173
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,078
Okay. Okay, I
know I trust you.

174
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,302
So if you think surgery is the right
decision, then we should do it.

175
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,196
On one condition.

176
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,207
I want you in the OR.

177
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:31,906
Not for me, but if
something were to go wrong

178
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:35,135
and we lose our baby,

179
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,282
I need you to be with her.

180
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:40,107
Or him.

181
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:49,106
With my guidance, I think
there is a very good chance

182
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,614
our baby will be fine.

183
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,081
Mm.

184
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,019
Forceps and Metz.

185
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,299
How's it feel to
be in the OR again?

186
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:08,641
Very good, sir.

187
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,431
We're all very glad
to have you back.

188
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:14,340
We've exposed the
surface of the liver.

189
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:17,235
Tumor's invaded the liver
capsule and parenchyma.

190
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,260
That's twice the size
it appeared on imaging.

191
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,150
If we take out all of the tumor,

192
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,576
he'll only have
half a liver left.

193
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:27,371
We don't have a choice.

194
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:30,308
Ultrasonic dissector for resection.

195
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,640
Make sure to
approximate the edges

196
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,040
so it overlaps with
the uterine window.

197
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:50,364
I internalized that the first
three times you told me, Shaun.

198
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:53,230
I'm sorry you and Lea
are going through this.

199
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:55,010
Mm. Dr. Lim was able

200
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,148
to place the fleece patch
seven seconds faster.

201
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:00,971
But your laparoscopic suturing
technique is superior.

202
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,504
You will be in charge of that.

203
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,165
Practice it now. Please.

204
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,723
Shaun, I've done
it a million times.

205
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,883
You have never done
them on my wife.

206
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:12,063
Fair point.

207
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,449
Because we had
to take more of your liver

208
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:21,433
than we'd hoped, your liver
function is declining.

209
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:26,900
Getting your nutrition through
an IV is tough on your body.

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,998
The TPN that's keeping me
alive's also killing me?

211
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,600
That's gnarly.

212
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,944
So, what's the
alternative to TPN?

213
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,089
How do we get him nutrients?

214
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,523
We're looking into it.

215
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,286
For now, we're gonna
manage your symptoms

216
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,940
and keep you stable until a
small bowel becomes available.

217
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:46,206
There's no way those organ cops
can say I'm too healthy now.

218
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,663
I'll order cholestyramine
for the itching

219
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,367
and liver function
testing every few hours.

220
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:56,826
I'll call UNOS and do
whatever I have to...

221
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,741
to get him moved up the list.

222
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,494
Where you sneaking off to?

223
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm walking down the
hall, in plain sight.

224
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,259
The alarms, the pills,

225
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,035
the classic Morgan
evasion techniques.

226
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,918
You're getting your embryos
implanted, aren't you?

227
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:20,834
Congrats on cracking that
already wide-open case.

228
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:23,790
I have to give myself a
time-sensitive injection now,

229
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,537
then yell at some nice
transplant people.

230
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:27,164
Why didn't you tell
me? I could help.

231
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:30,223
I'll refer you to the minutes
of our previous meeting...

232
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:32,095
"We need boundaries."

233
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:45,689
I remember you put on my hospital
socks for me last time, too.

234
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,126
I hate that we have a routine.

235
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:51,417
This time is different.

236
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,778
- Hi.
- I love you.

237
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,283
How are you? Do
you need anything?

238
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,557
There's Funfetti cake in Pedes
for Nurse Hawks' birthday.

239
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,124
Do you want me to
get you a piece?

240
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:04,517
Just this is great.

241
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,983
Please leave.

242
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:07,789
Having visitors
increases the risk

243
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:08,949
of perioperative infection,

244
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:10,757
and stimulation can
raise blood pressure,

245
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:14,232
which increases the risk of
intraoperative complications.

246
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:23,065
I need to do your pre-op exam.

247
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:30,749
He just doubled over.

248
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:33,186
My gut is trying to kill me.

249
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,571
Please, can you
give him something?

250
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,942
I'll up his morphine. Check
the site for infection.

251
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:41,644
Hang on. You're gonna be okay.

252
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:45,679
Dr. Allen, his wound dehisced.

253
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,506
What does that mean?

254
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:48,980
His muscles couldn't
hold the stitches.

255
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:50,057
It tore open.

256
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,569
Move the patch three
millimeters to your right.

257
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,111
It should overlap
with the wound margin.

258
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:04,827
- Got it.
- Yes, there.

259
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:05,979
That is good.

260
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:07,489
Dr. Wolke,
take the scope, please.

261
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:08,205
Sutures.

262
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,895
5-0 Prolene sutures in
the myometrium defect

263
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,594
need to be placed exactly
one millimeter apart.

264
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,087
Dr. Murphy, take
one more step,

265
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,648
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

266
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,275
Applying the glue.

267
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:21,942
No, no. That's too far.

268
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,347
- The view is obscured.
- Shaun. A little to your left.

269
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:28,939
She's bleeding.

270
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,431
No signs of rupture.

271
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:33,641
You may have placed
the sutures too deep

272
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,303
because you didn't
have a clear view.

273
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,499
The sutures are fine.

274
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,025
I should take over.

275
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,153
- Shaun.
- There, a small bleed underneath the patch.

276
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,683
Must've nicked a vessel.

277
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:43,982
I'll clip it.

278
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,032
Suction.

279
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,541
Okay, we can continue to close.

280
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,536
Yes. Lea and the
baby are fine.

281
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,672
In spite of the
avoidable errors.

282
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:05,392
His abdominal wall is
too weak and damaged

283
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,219
from prior surgeries
to hold the sutures.

284
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:08,531
We covered the
wound with plastic,

285
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,000
but we need to take
him back to the OR

286
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:11,369
and close him up before
it gets infected.

287
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,833
The tissue will just
tear open again.

288
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,327
His skin and muscles need
time and nutrition to heal.

289
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:17,224
I have a small bowel for Drew.

290
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:23,282
Drew's wound dehisced.

291
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,241
We can't take that organ.

292
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,622
I'm not turning it down.

293
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,675
This is Drew's only chance.

294
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,845
Tell UNOS we need to
run some more tests.

295
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,205
Buy us a few hours.

296
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,508
That's how long we
have to figure out

297
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:39,972
how to stitch this
kid back together.

298
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,394
What about component separation?

299
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,429
That could weaken
the tissue even more.

300
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,756
Right.

301
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:00,286
Maybe a four-step
Fabian procedure.

302
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:03,033
Except Drew doesn't have
time for four steps.

303
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,998
Hi.

304
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,977
Here to check Lea's
post-op vitals.

305
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:27,120
I also brought supplements.

306
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:28,246
Mm.

307
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,496
Thank you.

308
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:33,321
All right, your post-op
ultrasound looks good.

309
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,121
Oh.

310
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,845
Fetal movement and
heart tones are great.

311
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,438
Oh, thank God.

312
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:41,874
When can I go home?

313
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,237
You need to be
here for monitoring

314
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,131
for several more days.

315
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,903
I can't go days
like this, Shaun.

316
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,125
I hate it here.

317
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,585
You are here for work every day.

318
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,980
Not in this room, in this bed,

319
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,966
thinking about everything.

320
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:06,419
Jerome and I can visit
on our lunch break.

321
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:08,943
Oh, we could take the "What
Yankee Candle Are You?" quiz

322
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,436
that's on page 17.

323
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,319
Rest will help
you recover faster

324
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:15,564
so you don't have
to be here anymore.

325
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:18,120
Her ultrasound does look good.

326
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,346
Thank you. You can go.

327
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,252
Thank you.

328
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,198
UNOS called again.

329
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,176
I told them we have to re-run
Drew's liver function test

330
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,434
and get a CT scan.

331
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,303
I bought us an hour at most.

332
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:44,746
What about a
Sure-Closure device?

333
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,373
Too high a risk
for ventral hernia,

334
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,651
which could lead to us needing
to resect his large intestine,

335
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,377
leaving him even worse off.

336
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,888
I already played it out.

337
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,384
For your embryo thing, you
know, whenever that is,

338
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,044
I can give you a
ride, if you need one.

339
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,412
I'll get an Uber.

340
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:05,701
You really want to go to the
most important appointment

341
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,702
of your life with a
stranger in a Camry?

342
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,832
I've chosen to do this
alone, and I'm fine with it.

343
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,876
And I'm... I'm trying very hard

344
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,938
not to care about what anyone
else thinks about that.

345
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,474
So having you imply how sad it
is that I have to take a cab

346
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,124
to a doctor's office
is not helpful.

347
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,618
He threw up, and his
pain is getting worse.

348
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,604
He's already maxed out on
morphine. I'm overriding.

349
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,319
There's increased redness
and swelling on the edges.

350
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:44,738
Early signs of infection.

351
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,964
I love you, Mom.

352
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,158
- You're gonna be fine.
- It's okay.

353
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,552
We knew we'd get here someday.

354
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,439
I'm ready.

355
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,674
No.

356
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,887
I am not giving up on you.

357
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,598
Don't give up on me, D.

358
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Please.

359
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,858
Oh. I-I will take those.

360
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,338
They're from all the nurses.

361
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,243
We just want you both to know
that we're thinking about you.

362
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,632
I will pass that along.

363
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:26,066
But not these.

364
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:29,314
Baby's breath has a
strikingly unpleasant odor.

365
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:33,513
Is there anything you need?

366
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,389
We're fine.

367
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,121
Uh, 502's family
is on their way in.

368
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:42,547
Heads up... They
are a loud bunch.

369
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,390
They're very excited to
be taking Meemaw home.

370
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:53,966
I don't think Lea's fine.

371
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:57,036
She's lonely and bored,

372
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,163
and being back in that room

373
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,556
is bringing up a lot
of painful memories.

374
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,377
And I know you're just...
You're trying to protect her,

375
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:05,769
but...

376
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,322
but it's making you kind
of a pain in the ass.

377
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,015
Your wife, who's
carrying the tiny human,

378
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:16,215
she needs her loud bunch.

379
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,384
People asking how she is
doing and being worried

380
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,968
will only make Lea worry
more, and that is not helpful.

381
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:25,268
Not for you,

382
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:29,392
but I think Lea needs more
than just you right now.

383
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,525
She needs lots of people
showing concern and love.

384
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,130
And maybe you do, too.

385
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:38,584
More than you think.

386
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:53,399
<i>♪ I think of when... ♪</i>

387
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,328
Question for you.

388
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:57,915
Does it bother you that
this has been sitting here

389
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,776
for three months?

390
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:01,262
No.

391
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:03,509
- Does it bother you?
- No.

392
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:10,077
I'm feeling a little pressured.

393
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:11,471
I've barely brought it up.

394
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:14,366
And I appreciate that.

395
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:18,628
But it sitting here
is kind of pressure.

396
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,686
It was meant to
be a cute gesture.

397
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,735
A subtle...

398
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,063
Not so subtle reminder

399
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,872
that the offer is
still "on the table,"

400
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:31,026
which has clearly
overstayed its welcome,

401
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,609
and the last thing I want is
for it to come between us.

402
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,173
Are you un-proposing?

403
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,408
No, I'm un-pressuring.

404
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:48,568
I love you, and I'm
not going anywhere.

405
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,459
When you're ready, we'll
put it back on the table.

406
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,084
What about a Velcro
biocompatible patch?

407
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:59,685
It would facilitate his
granulation tissue growth.

408
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,413
How do we keep it from
adhering to other organs?

409
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,902
Yeah.

410
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,297
This should be turmeric
chicken with asparagus.

411
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,422
That's what I was gonna
make you for our date.

412
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:23,339
And after work, all I had to do was
go to the store and get some chicken.

413
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:29,105
But instead, I-I
texted my dealer.

414
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,231
For a thousand reasons,

415
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:36,316
none of which excuse
nor explain anything.

416
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,322
You don't owe me an explanation.

417
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:41,548
I do.

418
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,792
And I wish I could give you one.

419
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:48,891
Every day for the past 92
days, I've asked myself,

420
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,385
"Why didn't I just
go get the chicken?"

421
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:54,032
I mean, we would have
had a great dinner.

422
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:57,686
I mean, you would have
been funny and beautiful.

423
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:02,675
And I would have tried way
too hard to be charming.

424
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:05,572
And then...

425
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:08,806
who knows?

426
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:17,307
I'd give anything to
go back, start over.

427
00:22:19,285 --> 00:22:20,686
Give us a clean slate.

428
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,838
Me too.

429
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,192
What if we did that for Drew?

430
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,353
What if, along with a new bowel,

431
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:42,213
we gave him a whole
new abdominal wall?

432
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:43,968
Clean slate.

433
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,709
Has it ever been done before?

434
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,192
Not exactly.

435
00:22:56,249 --> 00:23:00,134
I'm gonna look down and
see... someone else's abs?

436
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,862
Replacing it is the only way
to get you a new small bowel.

437
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:05,866
You'll be able to eat
again. You'll get stronger.

438
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:08,860
What are the chances it'll work?

439
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:11,897
It's never been done in tandem
with another transplant.

440
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,606
There are increased risks
of rejection or infection.

441
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:18,168
But both organs are in great
shape and a good match.

442
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,827
It's our best shot
to save your liver

443
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:21,386
and give your body time to heal.

444
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,451
Thank you so much.

445
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:33,710
Okay.

446
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,479
Well, let's do this.

447
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,496
If we don't keep quiet,

448
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:59,614
Shaun is gonna come down on us
with the hammer of Thor, okay?

449
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,353
It's so nice to laugh.

450
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:03,012
Enter Shaun with a chest plate

451
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:05,506
and a red cape with the Mjolnir.

452
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,671
I don't want to get kicked
out before I know...

453
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,044
Boy or girl?

454
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:14,763
I have to start scoping out
the latest baby fashions.

455
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,055
I don't know.

456
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:21,147
I don't want to know.

457
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:29,342
Last time, when we found
out we were having a girl,

458
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,692
Shaun and I were
choosing her name.

459
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:36,054
I liked Sage and
Skylar and Sofia.

460
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,464
Something with an "S,"
after my grandma, Susie.

461
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:43,859
And then she was... gone.

462
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,040
And I can't do that again.

463
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,513
Maybe you should tell
Shaun about this.

464
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:56,970
He's already so worried,
no matter what he says.

465
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:00,767
And what if talking
about it just...

466
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:07,473
I have something for you.

467
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:08,888
Mm?

468
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:11,663
My faith.

469
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:14,139
Not just in God.

470
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:17,657
I have faith in the
surgery you had.

471
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,490
I have faith in you and Shaun,

472
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,484
and that your baby,

473
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,699
whatever it is,

474
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,005
is going to be okay.

475
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:38,171
Your 10-minute
visit has run over.

476
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:41,601
I have to scrub in anyways.

477
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:47,546
Pencil me in for the next
10-minute opening, Thor.

478
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:51,984
Thank you. I-I needed that.

479
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:58,885
Mmph. Pfft.

480
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,312
But not that.

481
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:02,074
I kind of feel nauseous.

482
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:07,374
We should do another ultrasound.

483
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,814
Mm.

484
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:28,141
This surgery could buy
you a year, maybe more,

485
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,735
give you back some
quality of life.

486
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,610
But...

487
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:35,563
it should be what you want.

488
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:51,873
You're 17 and
you've suffered more

489
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:54,006
than some people
their whole lives.

490
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,350
No one would fault you
for deciding you're done.

491
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,454
I can't.

492
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,955
Your mom has given you all
the support in the world,

493
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,481
but this is your fight.

494
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,097
Do you want to keep going?

495
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:18,106
The worst part about
all of this is knowing

496
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:21,747
one day, it'll end,

497
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:23,425
and my mom will be alone.

498
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:29,003
She's been with me through all
the hardest parts of my life,

499
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,126
and I won't be around when she has to
go through the hardest part of hers.

500
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,425
If I can put that off,

501
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,647
if even for a little bit,
then I'm gonna do that.

502
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,070
And hope that makes the
days she'll face alone...

503
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:44,877
a little easier.

504
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,379
You're all set.

505
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,071
We'll take you to surgery soon.

506
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,684
I love you.

507
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:44,001
And whatever happens...

508
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,973
you don't need to
worry about me.

509
00:28:50,035 --> 00:28:51,514
I'll be okay.

510
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:07,878
I love you, too, Mom.

511
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,843
She was feeling
nauseous, so I did an ultrasound,

512
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:43,803
which detected increased
fluid in the abdomen,

513
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:45,426
but then she lost consciousness.

514
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,515
It is almost certainly
internal bleeding.

515
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,674
I'll scrub in, right away.

516
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,045
No, no, no. You can't come in.

517
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,980
- This is likely a complication from the first surgery.
- Shaun...

518
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:55,140
It is my fault, and
I need to fix it.

519
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:56,748
Shaun, if we can't
stop the bleeding,

520
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:59,643
we may have to take Lea's uterus
in order to save her life.

521
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,138
If we get there, we're gonna
make the decision quickly

522
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:04,659
and with medical factors
only, no emotion.

523
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:09,005
Lea would want me in there
in case we lose the baby.

524
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,897
If that happens...

525
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:11,257
<i>If</i> that happens,

526
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:13,281
I'll come back and
get you, I promise.

527
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:26,367
Surgical site looks
good. Patch is intact.

528
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,527
No signs of acute
placental abruption.

529
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:29,777
Bladder's clean.

530
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:32,505
No blood coming from the
ovaries or the fallopian tubes.

531
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,399
And the bowel is intact.

532
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:36,125
It's gotta be coming
from the uterus.

533
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,353
If we clamp the uterine vessels,
we may slow down the bleeding.

534
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,246
But we put the baby at risk.

535
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,391
If we don't stop it soon,
we're gonna put Lea at risk.

536
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:49,149
I'll clamp the internal iliac
on the side of the bleed.

537
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:50,643
Buys us some time.

538
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:52,413
Give two more units of
blood and stay four ahead.

539
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:53,438
Retractor.

540
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:57,444
If the
site is hemostatic,

541
00:30:57,469 --> 00:31:00,971
they will look for
placental abruption.

542
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:07,980
Next, they will check
the bladder, ovaries,

543
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,404
and fallopian tubes.

544
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:13,352
Shaun.

545
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:22,763
They can't clamp
the uterine vessels

546
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:24,748
without hurting the baby,

547
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,963
but they can place an
atraumatic vascular clamp

548
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,378
on the internal iliacs,

549
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:34,788
which will slow down the bleed
while they try to locate it.

550
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:45,561
Once they stop the bleed,

551
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:50,209
they should be able to repair it

552
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:52,388
and be done by...

553
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,085
5:26.

554
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,210
The surgery went really well.

555
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:13,976
You should be able to start
eating real food again

556
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,977
in a few days.

557
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,889
Better make sure my new
six-pack is looking good.

558
00:32:19,531 --> 00:32:21,199
The abdominal wall
is holding together.

559
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,715
No signs of infection.

560
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,639
We'll see how long that lasts.

561
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,860
One step at a time, D.

562
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:32,318
We'll let you get some rest.

563
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,561
No alcohol in that
new gut of yours.

564
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:41,000
Not for four more years.

565
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,757
One step at a time, Mom.

566
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,844
Hey, I don't want to help
because I feel bad for you.

567
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,995
I feel bad for me.

568
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,761
You're gonna be an amazing mom

569
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:02,951
because you're amazing at
whatever you put your mind to,

570
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,451
and I'm a little
conflicted, I guess,

571
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,277
because I won't be a part of it.

572
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,824
Making my single-mother
IVF journey about you

573
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:13,671
is uncharacteristically
self-absorbed.

574
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,027
I'm impressed.

575
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,364
You changed me.

576
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,127
And doing things
alone isn't sad.

577
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:27,819
Still doesn't mean you
have to do them that way.

578
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,754
From here on, I'm gonna request
not to be supervised by you.

579
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,228
Why?

580
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,685
I didn't OD because
of you, or us.

581
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:58,209
But I knew I
couldn't be with you

582
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,756
if I wasn't okay.

583
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:03,920
So I convinced myself I was.

584
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,447
Jordan, if I let myself
get close to you,

585
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:11,504
I will fall for
you again, and...

586
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:15,382
and I will want so
badly to be okay,

587
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,191
to be ready for us.

588
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:24,146
I can't risk that.

589
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:29,435
I wouldn't want you to.

590
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,478
Mm.

591
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,568
I can't believe how much
I'm gonna miss somebody

592
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,317
I'll still see every day.

593
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,475
Lea's in emergency surgery.

594
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,364
Two more
units, right away.

595
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:52,941
Removing the
packing over the uterus.

596
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,819
Suctioning.

597
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,589
Fetal heart rate 101.

Intermittent decels.

599
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:03,163

00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:07,847

As the uterus grew, it ruptured.

640

That was inevitable.

641
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:57,648
Had nothing to do with

642

Okay.

643
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:05,129
Had Lea not been in the
hospital when this happened,

644
00:38:05,377 --> 00:38:07,379
she might not have survived.

645
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:10,358

Good morning.

660
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:18,515
Can I get that to go?

661
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,018
I gotta stop at my place
and grab a shirt for work.

662
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:23,266
I'm sure you have
a minute. Stay.

663
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:27,231
- Am I about to be punished for something?
- No.

664
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,672
- I was just thinking.
- Mm-hmm.

665
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,201
I love you.

666
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,520
I love you, too.

667
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,545
And I love us.

668
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,391
Same. Always good to hear.

669
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:45,668
And I've decided I want
us to move forward.

670
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:49,341
At my own, learning-to-walk
kind of pace.

671
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,676
Clay Porter...

672
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:03,402
will you move in with me?

673
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,631
I would kneel, but I'm not sure

674
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,663
I could gracefully
get back up again.

675
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,028
It's so sparkly.

676
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:12,277
Love it.

677
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,728
Mm.

678
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,031
Audrey Lim...

679
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:23,081
you've made me the
happiest man alive.

680
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,409
This is a one-time thing.

681
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:46,827
Don't expect me to drive you
to your next colonoscopy.

682
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:48,749
And here I was looking
forward to that.

683
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:51,270
Take McLaughlin
to William Street.

684
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:52,997
The freeway's backed
up this time of day.

685
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,176
Alright, just don't
forget the tip.

686
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,046
The fleece patch is holding well
and expanding with the uterus.

687
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,826
Everything looks great.

688
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:17,803
Your baby is very
cute and squirmy.

689
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:21,132
So, you wanna know what it is?

690
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:32,523
Y-You already know, don't you?

691
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:38,304
I have been looking
at your uterus a lot.

692
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,212
Mm.

693
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:41,631
But... But I can keep a secret.

694
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,378
The light blue is very...

695
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:54,478
Heteronormative.

696
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,158
I was going to say pastel.

697
00:41:58,369 --> 00:41:59,893
But, yes, that too.

698
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:03,068
I think he's gonna like
something in the gray palette.

699
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:05,282
Calming but warm.

700
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:08,479
Elegant yet understated.

701
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:14,139
I think our son would
like that very much.
