1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:02,079
<i>Previously on</i> The
Good Doctor <i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:04,177
I want to do another
embryo transfer ASAP.

3
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:05,924
You have some lettuce.

4
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:07,183
- Oh.
- No, no, no. Here.

5
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,765
Dr. Glassman, it would
be hard to lose my father

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,874
just as I am about
to become one.

7
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:20,604
Do the scan for me.

8
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:28,111
Please hold still.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,388
I'm breathing.

10
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:32,082
You moved your head.

11
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:34,491
Shaun, go away and let
the technician do his job.

12
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:36,227
I sent him out for coffee.

13
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:39,529
I am now scanning the
location of your prior tumor.

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,236
Did you decline
maintenance chemotherapy?

15
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,238
It's hard to hold still
while I'm talking.

16
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,632
Dr. Blaize recommended six
cycles of temozolomide.

17
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:51,978
The slight benefit of that stuff

18
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,214
wasn't worth the
constant nausea.

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,806
The benefit is statistically...

20
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:56,352
Shaun, I made my choice.

21
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:59,833
You chose wrong.

22
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:05,823
There's a spot on your brain.

23
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,438
There's the right
ovary. And that looks like the...

24
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,099
Corpus luteum.

25
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,459
The endometrium is smooth
and around 13 millimeters,

26
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,717
which means my uterine
infection is cleared.

27
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:30,695
Carrying the pregnancy to term
should be a lot easier this time.

28
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:33,526
Your transfer is on my
schedule for tomorrow evening.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,052
Fantastic.

30
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:38,815
And you have two high-grade
embryos available.

31
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,093
Do you want a boy or a girl?

32
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:50,533
You don't have to decide now.

33
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:52,278
Just let me know before
the embryo transfer.

34
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:00,044
Seven and a half hours.

35
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:01,479
Uninterrupted?

36
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,123
Didn't even have to wake
up to use the bathroom.

37
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:05,348
So?

38
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,351
Six hours, 45 minutes.

39
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:10,345
Oh, winner, winner,
pancakes for dinner.

40
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,122
I really thought I
had it in the bag.

41
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:13,940
How'd you do, Danny?

42
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,471
How much sleep you
get? Over or under?

43
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,593
No clue.

44
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,559
Hold up.

45
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,638
- Morning, all.
- Morning.

46
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:30,874
Dr. Allen.

47
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:33,144
Good morning, Dr. Kalu.

48
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,019
Park is doing a hip
arthroscopy today.

49
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,245
I'd like to scrub in.

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,371
Sorry, I'm already
assigned to Park.

51
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,317
I'm thinking about
specializing in ortho,

52
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:41,742
so how about a trade?

53
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,020
How about no?

54
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:45,990
Sorry I asked.

55
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,160
Go, team.

56
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,799
Brady Sullivan. Oil rig
worker. Metal sheet hit him.

57
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,535
Severe chest and
pelvic injuries.

58
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,003
O2 sats are critical.

59
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,837
Brady, I'm Dr. Andrews.

60
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,315
He's non-responsive.
Sluggish pupils.

61
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,450
There's
major hemorrhage.

62
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,009
GCS six, no head trauma.

63
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:07,423
Three-inch right-sided sucking
chest wound. Collapsed lung.

64
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,046
That's from the support hook.

65
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,261
The metal sheet he was
welding caused another injury.

66
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:14,884
How deep does this go?

67
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,543
Down to the spinal column.

68
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:17,887
He's nearly cut in half.

69
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,916
It's scar
tissue from the radiation.

70
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,441
Could be, but the FA value...

71
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:40,010
Is more consistent with a
glioblastoma recurrence.

72
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,320
That's right, and the path

73
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,447
of the radiation
they blasted me with,

74
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,615
that Swiss cheese look,
textbook necrosis.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,311
The irregular shape implies a
multifocal cancerous lesion.

76
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,728
I've been
looking at brain scans

77
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:50,988
since before electricity.

78
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,432
I think I know what
scar tissue looks like.

79
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,591
You are not objective here.

80
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,724
Oh, right, and you are?

81
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,749
Neither of you are.

82
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:00,264
If that lesion is cancer,

83
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:02,588
a DNA spinal fluid
analysis will confirm it.

84
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:03,968
Yes.

85
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,245
That is objective.

86
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,805
I'll do a spinal tap
and send it to the lab.

87
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,571
Should have results in 24 hours.

88
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,170
Fine.

89
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,260
I'll set it up.

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,986
O2 sat's 68.

91
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,347
Chest tube's in,
draining a lot of blood.

92
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,533
Every time I clamp a
bleeder, another one pops up.

93
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,926
Dr. Lim? Where do you want us?

94
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,203
We're busy with
the chest trauma.

95
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,667
I need you guys on
the pelvic injury.

96
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,097
How do we remove it?

97
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:35,041
You don't. It's the only
reason he didn't bleed out.

98
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,465
I need you four to
figure out a plan

99
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,169
to reattach his lower half.

100
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,437
Read every journal.
Study every case report.

101
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,215
Check all the international
surgery registries.

102
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,239
Look everywhere.

103
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,475
PA ruptured. Gotta move him.

104
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:45,842
OR one, now.

105
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,164
- Give me the baby.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

106
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:58,656
I'm here for Jazz.

107
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,400
- Just hand her to me.
- I don't know you.

108
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:02,526
I don't know you.
I don't know you.

109
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,995
- Sir, please.
- Hold on, let me talk to him.

110
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,431
I'm a doctor here.
I can help you.

111
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,202
I don't need a
doctor. I need Jazz.

112
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:14,071
Jazz. Is Jazz the mother?

113
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:15,772
Yes.

114
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,146
You're trying to help the baby?

115
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,277
Jazz... Jazz passed out

116
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,680
and then the, uh... the
flashing lights took her.

117
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,415
An ambulance?

118
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,882
There's an encampment
over on Elm.

119
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,296
Is that where you and Jazz were?

120
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:30,621
Then she's a patient here.

121
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,360
They didn't see the
baby in her tent.

122
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:39,196
She didn't sound good.
She... she needs her mama.

123
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:43,234
You did the right thing
bringing her here.

124
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:46,170
Can I examine her?

125
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,040
Uh...

126
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,378
and you'll... you'll
find... you'll find Jazz?

127
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,714
I promise.

128
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,926
We have a code pink. The
baby's in heart failure.

129
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,261
You may have saved her life.

130
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:15,808
Found another tear
in the pulmonary artery.

131
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,268
A big one.

132
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,012
Every major
artery in this lung is damaged.

133
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:21,705
His body needs to divert
every resource it has

134
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,806
to his vital organs.

135
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:26,210
We should amputate
his lower half.

136
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,488
- We're not there yet.
- It's barely hanging on.

137
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,547
But it is. We're
gonna try to save it.

138
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,025
It's a big
job to hand the residents.

139
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:33,226
Good thing
I hire the best.

140
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:38,222
This vessel's too
damaged to repair.

141
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:40,391
I need to clamp the trunk.

142
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,629
Start the clock
on lung ischemia.

143
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,180
I
think we should sack

144
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,873
the upper segmental
pulmonary artery.

145
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:58,918
That would mean
he'd lose his upper lung lobe.

146
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,411
He has a physical job.

147
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:01,955
If we
end up amputating,

148
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,614
he's not gonna be
working oil rigs.

149
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,191
But he could be
playing wheelchair basketball.

150
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,284
PTFE graft on his artery
could save his lung.

151
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,286
Okay.

152
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,431
Central line is in.

153
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,324
Pushing milrinone to
increase cardiac output.

154
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,967
Severely decreased
heart function,

155
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,269
but her chambers look normal.

156
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,970
Increasing high flow oxygen.

157
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,115
- BP is improving a little.
- Found it.

158
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,784
In her posterior chest,
there's a critical...

159
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,048
Narrowing of her aorta.

160
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,447
Her eye spacing is approximately

161
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,848
six millimeters wider than
the upper limit of normal.

162
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,193
She also has
slightly low-set ears

163
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,884
and her hands are swollen.

164
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,691
She has Turner syndrome.

165
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:55,308
If we don't get that narrowing
fixed in the next few days,

166
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,332
she'll die.

167
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,170
It won't be easy to
access, but I need an angio

168
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:02,005
for a better view.

169
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,974
I'll locate the mother
and get consent.

170
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:12,349
Brady's pelvis is broken

171
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:13,923
and separated from
the spinal column.

172
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,819
So to reattach his lower half,

173
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,288
we need to repair the pelvis,
plus all the damaged organs,

174
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,557
plus the major
vascular injuries,

175
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,493
and then find a way to
ensure it all heals.

176
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:27,664
Are we even doing the right
thing by trying to fix this?

177
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,376
You want to give up
before we even start?

178
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,034
I've just never read anything

179
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:32,746
supporting reattaching
this kind of injury.

180
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,871
Could kill him.

181
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,215
Amputation is the
safest thing to do.

182
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,639
Lim already knows
about that option.

183
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,418
- Our job is to find a better one.
- No, our job...

184
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,711
Danny's right. We need
to divide and conquer.

185
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,080
I will work on organ damage.

186
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:44,681
I'll focus on public fractures.

187
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,184
I need intraoperative
imaging to build a 3D model.

188
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:48,585
Oh, well, I'll go with you.

189
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,121
I need to see the full extent
of the vascular injuries.

190
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,357
That leaves you to figure
out how these repairs heal.

191
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:56,927
I'll see what I can find.

192
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,101
- This is the baby's mom?
- We think so.

193
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,445
She was brought
in a few hours ago

194
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:06,703
from a homeless encampment

195
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,405
with a delayed
postpartum infection.

196
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:10,874
She's septic.

197
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,278
They're optimistic
she'll pull through.

198
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,781
Soon, let's hope.

199
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,384
We've got some big decisions
to make for her baby.

200
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,395
Her name's Jasmine West.

201
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,165
She's homeless and
has bipolar disorder.

202
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,801
County records show the baby
was born seven weeks ago.

203
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:38,404
No dad in the picture,
no other family.

204
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:42,508
And this was all she had on
her when EMS brought her in.

205
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:43,710
We need your consent

206
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:45,912
for the baby's
diagnostic angiogram.

207
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,014
Sure.

208
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:50,416
The baby's Turner syndrome
makes every procedure,

209
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,652
even a diagnostic
test, a little riskier.

210
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:55,822
Well, this is your
area of expertise.

211
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,870
Her baby's name is Eden.

212
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:16,943
Pretty close to
the upper lung bifurcation.

213
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,811
I reinforced
it with sealant.

214
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,680
With
a synthetic wrap?

215
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,524
Are you questioning
my surgical skills?

216
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,059
Are you
getting defensive?

217
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,422
Okay. We're done.

218
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:30,723
Let's test it.

219
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:40,033
Good job.

220
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:58,618
Cardiac function stable.
You're good to go.

221
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,087
Inserting the catheter.

222
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,857
What a cute little girl.
Little girls are cute.

223
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:07,193
- Mine would be really cute.
- Yeah, she'd be adorable.

224
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:08,461
A boy could be adorable too.

225
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,289
Are you trying to
pick your embryo?

226
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:13,032
I'm leaning towards a girl.

227
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,901
I have a playbook to work from.

228
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:16,502
My playbook didn't help me much.

229
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,071
A lot of my issues
with Kellan came

230
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,672
from me trying to stop him

231
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,541
from making the mistakes I made.

232
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,018
If I'd had a daughter,
maybe I wouldn't have

233
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,202
dumped all my baggage on her.

234
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:26,347
You should choose a girl.

235
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:29,115
But you're having a boy.

236
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:30,750
We didn't get to choose.

237
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,251
In all long-term health metrics,

238
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,287
females are more likely
to outperform males,

239
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,155
although they'll
probably make less money.

240
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,209
The narrowing is longer
than it measured on echo.

241
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,896
We should resect
the narrowed segment

242
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,499
and do an aortic anastomosis.

243
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:48,302
Huge surgery for a baby.

244
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,304
It's the only
definitive treatment.

245
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:52,138
Very definitive if
she dies on the table.

246
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,806
Balloon dilation is safer.

247
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,585
We can do a bigger procedure in a
few years when Eden can tolerate it.

248
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,945
Her heart failure could
relapse between surgeries.

249
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,219
Your two-step approach is safer,

250
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:07,963
but only if the baby
gets daily medication

251
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:09,655
and regular follow-up care.

252
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,524
That's a lot to ask
of a homeless mom.

253
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:18,664
I'll page CPS and get consent.

254
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,066
You two practice the surgery.

255
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,199
A lot.

256
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:28,007
His pelvis looks like a jigsaw
puzzle with a 100 missing pieces.

257
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,810
Jared may be right.

258
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,180
You're taking his side.

259
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:35,648
I'm not taking anyone's side.

260
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,550
- Scans don't lie.
- Okay.

261
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,988
I'm not sure if you're
mad at him or me,

262
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,990
but we all need to get along.

263
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,505
Well, you two seemed
to be getting along

264
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,329
pretty well at the taco
truck the other night.

265
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:53,166
That was nothing.

266
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,334
Mm-hmm.

267
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:55,902
You're spying on me?

268
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,439
I was getting a taco.

269
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,508
This green-eyed monster thing
is not a good look for you.

270
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,009
I'm not jealous.

271
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,144
But you're right.

272
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,014
We're supposed to be a team.
He's just not a good fit.

273
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,649
Let's just focus on the patient.

274
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:12,318
Fine.

275
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:17,357
Can't see how we're gonna repair

276
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,025
all of that arterial damage.

277
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,861
What if we don't?

278
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,064
They could bypass it.

279
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,034
All of it.

280
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:34,408
This paper by
Dr. Alice Chen features

281
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,751
interesting data on
tumor treating fields

282
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,076
for GBM tumors.

283
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,744
I'm trying to
enjoy my tuna melt.

284
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:40,913
Dr. Chen is starting
a new study soon.

285
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:42,449
You should call her.

286
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,864
I'm not gonna spend the day
chasing down cancer treatments

287
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,488
because I don't have cancer.

288
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,357
Okay, there is a higher
probability of cancer relapse

289
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:52,067
because you refused
maintenance chemotherapy.

290
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,291
I'm not gonna talk about this.

291
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:54,736
Recurrent GBM causes
much worse symptoms

292
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,028
than temozolomide.

293
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:57,697
That's the decision I made.

294
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,234
I'm going crazy. There are
three crib sets I like.

295
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:03,102
I just can't decide.

296
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:05,606
Could you guys go to the
store after work tonight

297
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,073
and pick your fave?

298
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:11,144
Okay.

299
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,982
I have to go practice
the baby's surgery.

300
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,085
I will see you after work.

301
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:22,722
Oh, my God!

302
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:26,527
Should I be worried?

303
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,960
About me? No.

304
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,316
We're
going to kill him

305
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,008
trying to save the
lobe of his lung.

306
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:44,844
Removing it still leaves
him with 4/5ths capacity.

307
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:47,256
When there's a chance
you might lose half your body,

308
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,814
everything you
have left matters.

309
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:55,566
I need
lobectomy instruments.

310
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,926
This is my
OR, my department.

311
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,495
My hospital.

312
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,664
And when a doctor's
judgment is compromised,

313
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:07,467
it's my responsibility to step
in and protect our patients.

314
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:10,136
In what possible
way am I compromised?

315
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:16,142
Are you implying that my time in a
wheelchair is affecting my objectivity?

316
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:18,711
How could it not?

317
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,182
This is my patient.

318
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:25,751
And
I'm your boss.

319
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,531
You can either do this with me,
or I'll find someone who will.

320
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,610
Deaver retractor.

321
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:58,587
After they fix
the colon, Lim can use

322
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,890
some preserved bowel
to create a new bladder

323
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:02,324
like these Korean surgeons did.

324
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:04,694
That would work perfectly
with what I found.

325
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:06,763
We can bypass all of
the artery injuries

326
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,497
through two Dacron conduits

327
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,966
directly to his
lower extremities.

328
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,300
And the improved blood flow
would help with my idea

329
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:13,903
with his pelvis.

330
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,738
So skin flaps,

331
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,007
Dacron artery
bypass, neo-bladder,

332
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,642
bowel repair with
biomaterials, and...

333
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:26,949
a badass, Wolverine-like
adamantium skeleton.

334
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,951
It's experimental, but
it's pretty damn cool.

335
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,020
Now, how do we make
sure all this heals?

336
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,222
There's one study in Canada.

337
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:35,876
A cocktail of recumbent
growth hormones

338
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,758
and pentoxifylline showed
a threefold increase

339
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,107
in traumatic wound
healing rates.

340
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:41,630
That's great.

341
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,000
There's only four patients,

342
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,013
and none of them had the
same injuries as Brady.

343
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:47,804
So no one got cut in half

344
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,471
with a metal sheet
on an oil rig?

345
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:51,808
Great, I guess we just
toss that study out.

346
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:53,876
I'm just saying, I wish
we had something better.

347
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:57,847
I'll happily take a
threefold increase.

348
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,614
This is a workable plan.

349
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:01,069
Good, because Lim
wants an update.

350
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,761
Some promising ideas,

351
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,696
but there's a lot of
frail tissue to heal.

352
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:17,466
I found a study
using growth hormones

353
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,168
to accelerate the healing.

354
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:20,837
Interesting. Would
that work here?

355
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,874
There was a threefold
plan that we had...

356
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,052
Well, hang on, I want to hear
from the guy who did the research.

357
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:32,414
I'm not confident it would.

358
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:34,416
You guys said you
had a workable plan.

359
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,128
It can work. Jared's
being overly cautious.

360
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,996
If you close the pelvis
without good vascular support,

361
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,688
all these repairs
will get necrotic.

362
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,967
We will have good support. The Dacron
conduit to restore blood flow...

363
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,367
Not normal flow and
not quick enough.

364
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:44,602
Oh, dude, you've been doom
and gloom from the start.

365
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:45,695
- I've been...
- Enough.

366
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:47,930
Find a way to heal him.

367
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,532
I don't care who it comes
from, but I need it soon.

368
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,720
The nurse said she's
responding to the medication.

369
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,457
How long will Eden be in the
hospital after the surgery?

370
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,059
Two weeks.

371
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,628
Jasmine's on the wait list
for long-term housing.

372
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:21,002
She might have a place by then.

373
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:24,734
Also, uh,

374
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,137
is this safe if she
keeps breastfeeding?

375
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:29,591
The police found
this in her tent.

376
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:33,075
This is a bipolar
mood stabilizer.

377
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:34,209
It's safe.

378
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:36,746
How long has she
been taking this?

379
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,523
She saw her psychiatrist
for the first time in years

380
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:39,916
about five weeks ago.

381
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,919
She responded to it in the past.

382
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:45,620
She had a follow-up
scheduled with him tomorrow.

383
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:53,129
There's another treatment
option for Eden.

384
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:55,932
I know, I know.
It's disgusting.

385
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,810
You're gonna think, "What
are the percentages?"

386
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,869
Trust me, you change his diapers

387
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,442
and you are gonna
bond with your son.

388
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,939
Okay, here is the
Angelic Dream Set.

389
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:06,474
And be attentive to
Lea. Be extra attentive.

390
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:07,977
She's gonna be sleep-deprived.

391
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,511
You are gonna be sleep-deprived.

392
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:11,056
You're both gonna want
to lose it. Don't.

393
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,115
This mattress is
very comfortable.

394
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,718
This dark wood is a
little bit funereal.

395
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,154
The baby won't care
about the color.

396
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,923
It's all about
first impressions.

397
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:22,992
It's a newborn, you
know? Clean slate.

398
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,027
You want to surround it
with beautiful things.

399
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:26,839
A stuffed, soft... No,
you don't want to do that.

400
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:28,297
That's a hazard.

401
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,908
But these spinny things...
What do you call these?

402
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:31,300
Mobiles, mobiles.

403
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,969
You know, everywhere he looks,

404
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,704
you want him to be
interested, stimulated.

405
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,538
Beautiful sounds.
Beautiful music.

406
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:38,373
Mozart. Joni Mitchell.

407
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,575
If you want to talk
about something

408
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,830
other than selecting a crib,

409
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,255
it should be brain
cancer treatments.

410
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,655
Oh my God! I don't want
to think about that.

411
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,759
I can't not think about it.

412
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:48,617
In 12 hours, we
will have results...

413
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,119
- Exactly.
- We should be prepared.

414
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:53,388
Okay, Shaun, stop. Just...
just stop for a second

415
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:56,826
Sit down.

416
00:19:58,861 --> 00:19:59,861
Okay.

417
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,036
If I have cancer,

418
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:13,042
I'd be at stage four, right?

419
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,677
There's no miracle
cure for that.

420
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:18,546
You still haven't called
Dr. Chen in Cleveland.

421
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,749
I read her paper.

422
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:21,483
It doesn't work
with recurrent GBM.

423
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:34,063
How can you think about teddy
bears when you might be dying?

424
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:38,834
If you're right, Shaun,

425
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:41,436
then I won't be here
when your son is born.

426
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,572
I won't be here to help you.

427
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,246
We'll know when we know.

428
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:58,453
I like the lighter wood.

429
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:01,924
So do I.

430
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,898
What else should I
know about diapers?

431
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,644
Lung lobe is out.

432
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,418
These segmental
vessels are damaged.

433
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,351
Running 7-0
sutures should fix them.

434
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,755
Why bother?
The upper lobe is out.

435
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,990
If we can get
Perez's Dacron graft to work,

436
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:34,402
we could use them to
save his lower half.

437
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,660
Very unlikely.

438
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,238
The residents
are working on it.

439
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,902
And
obviously not succeeding.

440
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,143
First,
I'm compromised,

441
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,703
now you're slagging
on the residents?

442
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,714
Two are on
probation, you let another one go,

443
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,373
and her replacement
is someone I fired.

444
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,284
He's also the world's
most experienced first-year,

445
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,719
and he brings a new
perspective to the mix.

446
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,478
And training these
guys is my job.

447
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,680
Your job
is to make my job easier.

448
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,525
I thought it was to
run a great surgical department.

449
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,494
If you were doing
that, I wouldn't have to think

450
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,438
about that department as
much as I have recently.

451
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:05,223
Vessel loops.

452
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:18,637
You changed
the baby's surgery?

453
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,872
We weren't giving
Jasmine enough credit.

454
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,550
She's done a lot to
turn her life around

455
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,675
since Eden was born.

456
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,510
For seven weeks.

457
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,687
And with this new
treatment plan,

458
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,280
she has to keep it
up for seven years.

459
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,849
A baby can change a person.

460
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,596
<i>Code pink, NICU bed three.</i>

461
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
That's Eden.

462
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,391
<i>Code pink, NICU bed three.</i>

463
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,404
Lim asked for my opinion.

464
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:03,582
I met so many rich, entitled
guys like you in college,

465
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,584
and I couldn't stand them...

466
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,797
Even the ones I slept with.

467
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,889
If you can't handle
the hard work,

468
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,525
just get in your
Lamborghini and go home.

469
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,529
Sherry Lewis.

470
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,569
One of my last
patients in Denver.

471
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,505
Late-stage ovarian cancer.

472
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,374
Treatment's pelvic exenteration.

473
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,077
You remove everything.

474
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,313
The bladder, colon,
uterus, and vagina.

475
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,148
Now, in success,

476
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,752
the patient lives with
colostomy and urostomy bags,

477
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,954
severe menopause, and
absolutely no sex life.

478
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,625
Well, it's brutal but effective.

479
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,327
Would have been.

480
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,466
But I talked my
attending out of it,

481
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,068
in favor of an
experimental surgery.

482
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,637
A wide excision
of all the tumors,

483
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,306
then you reconstruct the entire
pelvic floor with TRAM flaps.

484
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,607
Incredibly advanced.

485
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,996
The type of stuff you're
talking about doing to Brady.

486
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,785
Sherry, um...

487
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,991
Sherry died on the table.

488
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,163
And I left Denver.

489
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,115
We take risks and people die.

490
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,119
But if we play it safe,

491
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:51,690
they die too.

492
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,829
I'd rather regret fighting
too hard for a patient

493
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,631
than not hard enough.

494
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,985
Why would your
daughter shave your cat?

495
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,190
Long story.
Point being, don't get a cat.

496
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,435
Kids are gonna tell you they're
gonna clean the litter box.

497
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,061
They're not gonna clean the litter
box. Don't fall for that trap.

498
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,464
You made a lot of mistakes.

499
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,665
Yeah.

500
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,434
It all boils down to

501
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,369
Maddy's mom basically raised her

502
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,672
while I focused on work.

503
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,241
You were a surgeon. She
was a real estate agent.

504
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:44,676
I love surgery.

505
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,578
I love poking around
in people's brains.

506
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,646
It's very exciting.

507
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,249
And I get to save some
lives while I'm at it.

508
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:54,252
Saving lives is very exciting.

509
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,454
So were Maddy's first
steps, her first words,

510
00:25:56,588 --> 00:26:00,325
her first piano
recital, or so I heard.

511
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,260
Work over family, and
that's what you get.

512
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,162
You're not gonna make
the same mistakes.

513
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,031
I don't think I will.

514
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,134
We are very different people.

515
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,340
Are we?

516
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,783
I have learned some very
useful things from you.

517
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,718
Well, right back at you.

518
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,262
The baby needs surgery.

519
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,862
The crib needs to be assembled.

520
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,231
Go.

521
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,832
But you chose work
way too often.

522
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,734
When should I prioritize family?

523
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,335
When you
have a sick baby

524
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,739
and a piece of furniture, the
sick baby wins every time. Go.

525
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,741
I got this.

526
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,933
Serial debridement.

527
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,291
Helps healing a little, but...

528
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,625
it increases
infection risk a lot.

529
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,827
Well, then I'm tapped out.

530
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:10,894
Me too.

531
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,432
I guess we should tell Lim.

532
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,701
Lamborghinis.

533
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,771
Lamborghinis.

534
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,107
Now, most sports cars use
pressurized combustion

535
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,052
to achieve that kind of
performance, but not Lambos.

536
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,144
No, no, no, no.

537
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,621
To reduce engine
wear, they use vacuums

538
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,147
to pour gas into the pistons.

539
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,949
Now, Brady's organs won't heal

540
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,092
because we can't get
enough flow to them,

541
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,085
but if you force more blood

542
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,030
into the area, well, then
we cause lethally high

543
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:39,157
abdominal compartment
pressure. So...

544
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,126
Let's pull in the blood
passively by creating a vacuum

545
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,795
using internal suction devices.

546
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,203
A low pressure system with low
tissue stress is better for healing.

547
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,836
That's...

548
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,506
That's a brilliant idea.

549
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,876
But it won't work.

550
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,844
Not without blood coming
into the right areas.

551
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,180
I need your help with that.

552
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,850
Where do you need the blood?

553
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,659
It's what we proposed earlier,

554
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,527
plus a healing
plan that Jared...

555
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,729
I can read.

556
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:21,833
Good work.

557
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,538
It's four
experimental techniques

558
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,842
rolled into an eight-hour surgery
with lousy odds of success.

559
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:41,853
Let's give it a try.

560
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,435
Dacron conduits
are connected to the aorta.

561
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,038
Do the anastomosis sites
look secure enough?

562
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,931
Any weak spots in there
will move that metal.

563
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:00,409
He'll bleed out.

564
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,709
They know.

565
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:03,945
On three.

566
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:07,181
One, two, three.

567
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:28,769
We have hemostasis.

568
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:30,781
And good blood
flow through the conduits.

569
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,506
Tissue's perfusing.

570
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:39,480
Yes! Yes!

571
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,823
Time to move
on to the pelvic fractures.

572
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,962
This is much more important
than assembling a crib.

573
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:56,764
But patients will
always need surgery,

574
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:59,033
and my family will
always need attention.

575
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,336
If there's no clear
choice between a patient

576
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,105
and your family, pick the
one that's related to you.

577
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,239
Hmm.

578
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,445
Obviously, choose
family when you can,

579
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:13,281
but sacrifice is
part of the job.

580
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,317
That's a good point.

581
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,951
But you are divorced.

582
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,519
That is more
sacrifice than I want.

583
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,988
Fair.

584
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:23,691
Eden's O2
sat just dropped a bit.

585
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:24,959
I'm nowhere near her lungs.

586
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:46,547
Turner syndrome
causes leaky vessels.

587
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,150
The stress on Eden's body is
causing lymph fluid to build up.

588
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:51,018
We can drain it
with a chest tube.

589
00:30:51,152 --> 00:30:53,992
Her chest is so small, you'd risk a
collapsed lung and pleural infection.

590
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,691
I could clear the
lung with diuretics.

591
00:30:57,825 --> 00:31:01,028
The risks and benefits of both
treatments are nearly identical.

592
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,509
But that also means it doesn't
matter which one we choose,

593
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,933
which makes the choice easy.

594
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:08,336
I find inserting chest tubes
particularly satisfying,

595
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,904
so I will do that.

596
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:18,879
The risks and benefits of a boy and
a girl are nearly identical too.

597
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,384
But girls kick ass.

598
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:33,727
This implant's gonna be
a tight fit around the cauda equina.

599
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:36,198
The bioengineer's
mapping algorithm

600
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:38,732
was designed to
optimize stability.

601
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:40,466
Well, Brady's
not an algorithm.

602
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,062
His nerves are gonna
run where they run.

603
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:45,440
I'll
set it in position.

604
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:49,544
Nerve impingement.

605
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,550
I'll expand
the narrowing with a rod.

606
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,897
Wait, there's an alternate
algorithm that can fix that.

607
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:03,458
Settle down,
Dr. Allen. I got this.

608
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:06,428
That's $100,000 worth of
tech, and she's using a rod.

609
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,934
Nerve
activity flattening.

610
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:18,072
One more minute.

611
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,129
The old
cantilever maneuver.

612
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:37,658
Nice work.

613
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,111
Can't
beat the classics.

614
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:48,102
Eden's surgery went well, so
I was hoping Jasmine might...

615
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:01,949
V-fib.

616
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,621
Ran a code for an hour, but...

617
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,625
she'd just been
through too much.

618
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,467
Vacuum
devices are in position.

619
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,670
Let's see if they work.

620
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:24,242
Keep a close eye
on his intra-abdominal pressure.

621
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:27,708
We have vacuum.

622
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,249
IA
pressure's okay.

623
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:32,280
Time for
the tissue flaps.

624
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:34,349
Looking good, Lambo.

625
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,596
There's a
small spike in IA pressure.

626
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,888
Increasing vacuum suction.

627
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,990
Still climbing.

628
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,205
Pressure's
compressing his organs.

629
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,164
He's getting ischemic.

630
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:51,458
I'm going up to 55.

631
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,674
He's in shock.

632
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,911
I did this.

633
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,180
You didn't do anything.
We're in this together.

634
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:12,028
We
need to amputate.

635
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,355
Not yet.

636
00:34:13,488 --> 00:34:14,256
Audrey,
pressure's too high.

637
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,390
<i>We're killing his organs.</i>

638
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:16,523
I think he's wrong.

639
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:19,860
Then fight for your patient.

640
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:26,900
We
need to amputate.

641
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:31,649
- Okay.
- All right.

642
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:33,007
We need a Liston
amputation knife,

643
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,942
a bone saw, and a set
of 5 1/2-inch hemostats.

644
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,811
He can handle 75.

645
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,185
With that kind
of pressure, he'll bleed out.

646
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:41,416
Normally, yes.

647
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,251
But the Dacron conduits
Dr. Perez chose

648
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:45,119
are more rigid than
typical vessels.

649
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:46,655
They'll hold up.

650
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:48,522
Let's do it.

651
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:54,229
I trust my residents, Marcus,
and I need you to trust me.

652
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:04,665
Let's go to 75.

653
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:24,560
Brady's family are here.

654
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:29,699
Is my husband...

655
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,901
The surgery was a success.

656
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:33,871
It will be a long
recovery, but...

657
00:35:34,004 --> 00:35:35,004
Oh.

658
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:41,778
Thank you for saving my dad.

659
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:46,884
I'll take you to him.

660
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:53,891
I should be dead on my
feet, but I just feel...

661
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:56,060
- Awesome?
- Yeah.

662
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:04,902
It's been 24 hours.

663
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,705
Yeah.

664
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:17,680
I just need a minute.

665
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:20,417
A minute won't
change the results.

666
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:22,920
No, it won't.

667
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:40,404
No cancerous DNA detected.

668
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:41,939
I was wrong!

669
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,208

710
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:28,979
Ah, you did the last cool case.

711
00:38:29,113 --> 00:38:31,048
This one's going to Dr. Murphy.

712
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:34,952
This is cool.

713
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,256
Dr. Park should take it.

714
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,258
I have to finish
setting up our nursery.

715
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:54,571
Hey.

716
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Good job today.

717
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:00,944
Thanks.

718
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,449
I've been under the microscope

719
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:08,085
with the board lately,
and I am stressed.

720
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:15,259
Things were said that
probably shouldn't have been.

721
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:21,465
Things weren't
said. You said them.

722
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:30,107
If you don't trust me, fire me.

723
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,645
And if you do, then
stay out of my way.

724
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,430
Hey.

725
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,633
Dalisay?

726
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,402
The baby's upset.

727
00:39:58,535 --> 00:39:59,536
Her heart?

728
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,238
No, everything's fine there.

729
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,640
I just... I think she
needs some company.

730
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,542
I'll get to her when I
can, but I'm slammed.

731
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:32,936
I'm here, Eden.

732
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:53,690
You can open your eyes now.

733
00:40:56,026 --> 00:40:57,861
It's so sweet.

734
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:00,430
The crib.

735
00:41:01,865 --> 00:41:03,033
The dresser.

736
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,701
It's the Angelic Dream Set.

737
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:06,069
The dark walnut was funereal,

738
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:09,172
but it also came
in natural pine.

739
00:41:09,306 --> 00:41:13,010
Oh, our little peanut
is gonna love it.

740
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:15,846
Oh.

741
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:19,283
Whatcha got there?

742
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:22,185
There are

743
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:25,055
two screws missing.

744
00:41:26,223 --> 00:41:28,058
That is not good.

745
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:30,994
No Biggie, Shaun. It's
just a couple screws.

746
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:34,598
No, that means
Dr. Glassman missed a step.

747
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:41,738
Dr. Glassman doesn't
have brain cancer,

748
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:45,242
but there is something
wrong with his brain.
