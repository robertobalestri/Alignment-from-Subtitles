1
00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:02,164
Previously on "The
Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,750
You put me here, and I'm
really angry about that.

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,819
I am sitting in this chair
because of that surgery.

4
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:11,385
I enjoyed our field trip.
I had a good time, too.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,722
I'm sorry. I just...

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,765
I can't.

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,602
I know how to fix everything.

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,855
There's a surgery that
will cure Lim's paralysis.

9
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:29,946
It's not the cord.

10
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,990
It's a deformity of
the spinal column.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,744
Even if there's kyphosis,
that doesn't mean...

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,162
She used to have
a 10-degree curve.

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,957
Now it's 15.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,667
So, what do you propose?

15
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,544
We go through the abdomen
and chest, fix the deformity,

16
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,088
and stabilize the column
with cage, plate, and screws.

17
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,840
With the tension in the cord
relaxed, her body can heal.

18
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,550
It will fix the paralysis.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,010
That might work.

20
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,971
Might. Might work.

21
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,390
Might doesn't cut it,
especially with the amount

22
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,350
of instrumentation
around the spinal cord.

23
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,727
You could poke a hole in
the gut or in the lung.

24
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,646
Sepsis is a very
real possibility.

25
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,940
I won't poke a hole in anything.

26
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,233
Do I need to remind
you how confident

27
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,402
you were the last time?

28
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,699
I'm sorry, but the odds aren't
good enough, not for me.

29
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,743
Then better the odds.

30
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,663
You two see if you can find a
surgery in our comfort zone.

31
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,624
Any objections?

32
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,377
No.

33
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,087
Then I need to get started.

34
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,172
I will be very busy this week.

35
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,645
And you never
fainted before today?

36
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,064
No, never.

37
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,736
Actually, I guess I
fainted last week.

38
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,487
I was at recess.

39
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:57,033
I just sort of woke
up on the ground.

40
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:01,162
I thought you wouldn't let
me do the Halloween pageant.

41
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,413
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,958
It's okay. We just
want you to get better.

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,086
So, you're Cinderella.

44
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,298
I have the main solo. I'm
singing "No One Is Alone."

45
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,842
Sondheim. I love it.

46
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,218
What's your favorite?

47
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,914
Why is there singing?

48
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,125
And why are you... green?

49
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,461
It's Halloween.

50
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,590
Heart rate's still 38 BPM.

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,551
Hopefully, we can get you
back in time for your solo.

52
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,261
We can't.

53
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,764
The electrical system in
your heart is malfunctioning

54
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,349
and you risk cardiac arrest.

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,351
We can easily implant
a pacemaker today

56
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,519
to keep it functioning normally.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,688
Once it's in, a
pacemaker is very safe.

58
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,981
W-Why is this happening to her?

59
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,943
We will do blood work and
electrophysiologic studies

60
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,403
to find out.

61
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,488
Plus, genetic workups
on all three of you.

62
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,075
If it's inherited, you
might be at risk, too.

63
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,831
Happy Halloween.

64
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,338
Captions by VITAC...

65
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,099
I get dizzy a lot

66
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,684
'cause I banged my
head when I was a kid.

67
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,853
They know, buddy.

68
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,521
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,773
Sometimes I forget stuff, too.

70
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,859
Chris is always
looking out for me.

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,236
He picks me up from
day care every day.

72
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,449
He cooks me dinner, and he
lets me play video games.

73
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,242
Sounds like a good brother.

74
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,744
Tell them what we
say to each other.

75
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,498
I say, "I got your
back, little bro."

76
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,043
And then I go, "I got
your back, big bro."

77
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,590
Nice approximation
of the wound edges.

78
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,342
You're good to go, Ollie.

79
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,640
Back's been bugging
me. Joys of aging.

80
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,476
Your pants are pretty loose.

81
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,144
Lost a little weight recently.

82
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,563
When did you see a doctor last?

83
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,814
I don't know.

84
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,858
Between Ollie and
looking for work...

85
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,152
Mind lifting up your shirt?

86
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,163
We're gonna order lab tests and
a C. T. for you, just to be safe.

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,544
That potential assistant I
liked, with the septum ring?

88
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,296
Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,130
Well, I watched her TikTok,

90
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,674
and now I'm looking
for another one.

91
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,720
You reading your tablet?

92
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,597
Yes, but I'm also
listening to you.

93
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,767
With the Dr. Lim surgery,
I have to do two jobs.

94
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,062
Well, how about you
start after our lunch?

95
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,149
This is a growth opportunity.

96
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,860
As a boss, you need to delegate.

97
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,488
You think I write every
line of code myself?

98
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,242
I am a surgeon. I
cannot delegate surgery.

99
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,952
So, figure out the
elements of your job

100
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,498
that only you can do
and delegate the rest.

101
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,667
That is a good idea.

102
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,794
The Force is with me.

103
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,299
Nice. Love it.

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,759
Ooh. Gorgeous.

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,388
So, the navy blue dress
or the black skirt?

106
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,724
They're all great. Your
date's gonna be blown away.

107
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,768
Not necessarily my date.

108
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,437
My neighbors aren't taking
me to romantic restaurants.

109
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,481
Your neighbors are
a 90-year-old couple

110
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,901
and that hermit who likes
to talk to his geodes.

111
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,153
It's a date, right?

112
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,866
This is my floor.

113
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,576
Wise answer, matey.

114
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,577
Date.

115
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,499
Date. Definitely a date.

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,835
Which is a problem 'cause
those outfits suck.

117
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,211
What else you got?

118
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,590
Trashy... frumpy... slutty...

119
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,883
not slutty enough.

120
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,719
God, no. Anything else?

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,263
In my closet.

122
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,349
We'll meet there. 8:00 p. m.

123
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,855
Try to
hold still, Chris.

124
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,398
This will just
take a few minutes.

125
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,984
Okay.

126
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,781
I would have thought that you
had more Halloween spirit.

127
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,241
Oh, I have a lot.

128
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,784
But as a professional woman,

129
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,787
I express it after work.

130
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,913
Interesting. Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,792
What are you up to?

132
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,879
There's a big pub crawl
around San Pedro Square.

133
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,797
A bunch of us are going.

134
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,715
That sounds fun.

135
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,926
Want to join?

136
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,929
I think I'll skip. But thanks.

137
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,433
No problem.

138
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,609
I think I made things weird
between us last night.

139
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,445
It's fine.

140
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,116
A three-centimeter mass

141
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,202
partially compressing
the bile duct.

142
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,791
Pancreatic cancer.

143
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,755
Hey.

144
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,465
You wearing that in the O. R.?

145
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,966
I got the genetic testing back.

146
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,677
Skyler has hemochromatosis.

147
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,844
Explains the heart problems.

148
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,055
Yes, but look at her
parents' results.

149
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,766
Mom carries the recessive gene.

150
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,267
But not her dad.

151
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,811
Which means he's not her dad.

152
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,772
And given how he let us test
him, he doesn't know it.

153
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,405
What are we gonna
tell her parents?

154
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,116
The genetic testing results.

155
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,285
Placing the generator in
the infraclavicular pocket.

156
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,787
Any thoughts on how?

157
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,206
Without destroying
their marriage, I mean?

158
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,043
I will delegate that
task to you two.

159
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,796
It will be a growth opportunity.

160
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,340
You also need to inform
Skyler's biological father

161
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,967
that he's the carrier.

162
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,594
Well, we don't know who he is.

163
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,598
Then it will be an even
bigger growth opportunity.

164
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,934
Adsons and 3-0 vicryl.

165
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,108
You have stage three
pancreatic cancer.

166
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,943
That means it hasn't
metastasized yet,

167
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,613
but it's spread to
your lymph nodes.

168
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,241
So, I'll... I'll do chemo?

169
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,577
Chemo, radiation,
molecular therapy

170
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,164
would give you
about eight months.

171
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,498
There is a very
extensive surgery

172
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,250
called the Whipple procedure.

173
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,044
It involves removing
your gallbladder

174
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,047
as well as parts of your bile
duct, pancreas, and intestines.

175
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,758
Okay. When can we do it?

176
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,719
It only has a small
chance of success,

177
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,015
and if it fails, you'll have
less time and more pain.

178
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:27,274
When Ollie was a kid, my
mom worked from home a lot.

179
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,486
She always had me looking
after him, which I hated.

180
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,197
One day, I was reading comics...

181
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,106
and he fell down the stairs.

182
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,871
You were just a kid yourself.

183
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,498
Ollie's injury isn't your fault.

184
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:51,381
I will do anything
to be there for him.

185
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,802
We'll order the pre-op testing
for the Whipple procedure.

186
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,309
I'm busy.

187
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,769
No, you are waiting on

188
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,562
your patient's
ear wax to soften.

189
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,731
We can use a thoracoscopic
and laparoscopic approach

190
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,733
with endoscopic decompression.

191
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,652
I want to present
it to Dr. Lim.

192
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,112
No.

193
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,864
This approach has been
used for tumor surgery.

194
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,991
Did you say "surgery"?
We're not talking about you!

195
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,868
It's less invasive
than my initial idea,

196
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,287
with a lower risk
of vascular injury.

197
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,497
I said no, Shaun.

198
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,706
This is wild.

199
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,875
It's like Rice Krispies
popping in my ear.

200
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,089
I did what Dr. Andrews said.

201
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,133
I lowered the risk of injury.

202
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,843
You didn't do what
Dr. Andrews said.

203
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,678
You didn't raise the
chance that we're gonna fix

204
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,972
her paralysis. Paralysis?

205
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,683
I am not talking about you. We're not
talking about you! Tilt your head.

206
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,477
Not good enough.

207
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,200
Jacob will be back soon.

208
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,327
Let's start with us.

209
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,912
The pacemaker is working great.

210
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,123
Thank God.

211
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,710
But she has a genetic disease
called hemochromatosis.

212
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,297
Um, excess iron is
building up in her body.

213
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,507
That's why she was
having heart issues?

214
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,884
Yeah.

215
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,802
And there's a small amount
of damage to her liver,

216
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,846
but it looks like we
caught that in time.

217
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,390
Iron is carried in
red blood cells,

218
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,726
so the main treatment is
just regular blood draws.

219
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,727
That's it?

220
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,314
Great.

221
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,276
Because of the forms you signed,
we're supposed to tell you

222
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,945
and your husband
these results together

223
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,407
and explain that hemochromatosis
is a recessive genetic disorder,

224
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,701
which means that for Skyler
to have the condition,

225
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,578
the gene needs to be
carried by both parents.

226
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,582
And then we'd explain
that you carry it,

227
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,086
but... your husband doesn't.

228
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,007
But that doesn't...

229
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,970
Oh, God.

230
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,472
Oh, God.

231
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,566
Jacob's old college roommate.

232
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,946
We were really close
with him and his wife.

233
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,243
Jacob suspected,
but I denied it.

234
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,749
He was just so amazing,
and I was in a rut.

235
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,294
Jacob and I are good now.

236
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,090
Skyler is his daughter. I
don't want that to change.

237
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:42,511
We can't avoid your husband
finding out his test results.

238
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,224
Can you give us the
biological dad's info?

239
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,185
He needs to know he's a carrier.

240
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,563
I don't want him involved.

241
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,984
We can't tell him anything
about you or Skyler.

242
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,902
Privacy laws.

243
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,115
But if he has other children,
they could be in danger.

244
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,119
Mick Kang.

245
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,085
I better
go talk to my husband now.

246
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,599
Are you trying to look
like a stalk of celery?

247
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,728
Oh.

248
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,021
Ohh!

249
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,399
My go-to in the before times.

250
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,608
Pair it with...

251
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,820
The Louis Vuitton blouse?

252
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,821
Mm-hmm. Yes.

253
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,658
And... these.

254
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,285
Hot, classic.

255
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,286
Well done.

256
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,125
Only issue... They could
be hard to get off.

257
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,919
A feature or a bug, depending.

258
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,380
Let's take a break.

259
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,467
What's going on?

260
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,221
I'm a different person
now, with a different body.

261
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,599
That he apparently
finds attractive.

262
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,017
You'll figure it out.

263
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,479
It's not only sex.

264
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,150
I worry I'm just racing
to start my life again.

265
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,363
How much do I even like him?

266
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,365
Is he a nice guy?

267
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,493
Definitely. Cute?

268
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,661
Pretty cute.

269
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,792
Having just lost a nice
and pretty cute guy,

270
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,627
it goes a long way.

271
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,049
This'll work.

272
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,470
Doesn't look like we can
preserve the pylorus.

273
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,431
We can reassess
early in the surgery.

274
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,314
I was an idiot the other night.

275
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,483
When I almost kissed you.

276
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,821
Obviously, I like you.

277
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,782
But it's a line I can't cross.

278
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,618
If this is because
we work together...

279
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,746
It's not.

280
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,207
I can't date anyone right now.

281
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,680
But I really hope we
can keep being friends.

282
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,090
Okay.

283
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,631
If we don't do a distal, we
run the risk of... Hold up.

284
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,350
We clearly both like each other,

285
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,312
but nothing can happen for
some reason you won't share.

286
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,150
But you still want to hang out?

287
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,569
Yeah.

288
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,655
Let's look at the
common hepatic artery.

289
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,467
Our other growth opportunity's
waiting in the cafeteria.

290
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,603
You think I carry
a gene for this...

291
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,729
Hemochromatosis.

292
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,439
So, if you have kids...

293
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,900
Yeah, two boys.
6-year-old twins.

294
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,860
The warning signs
would be bronzed skin,

295
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,778
liver problems, lack
of energy, joint pain.

296
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,280
No.

297
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,282
As far as I know,
they're totally healthy.

298
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,326
How did you find
out I'm a carrier?

299
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,453
I've never even been
to this hospital.

300
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,122
I'm sorry. We're
limited by privacy laws.

301
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,584
But as long as you and your kids
get checked out, you'll be fine.

302
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,003
Privacy laws? Who...
Whose privacy?

303
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,381
I'm sorry. We can't
say anything more.

304
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,843
Jacob?

305
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,139
Daisy had a kid?

306
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,895
Hey, look, man, um, they
just... They called me in here.

307
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,188
I didn't...  No!

308
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,648
No, no, no, no, no. Don't!

309
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,483
Ah!

310
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,279
Ow.

311
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,703
Okay, residents, that
did not work at all.

312
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,413
You chose a very bad
place to meet Mick,

313
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,040
and then Mick got
his nose broken,

314
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,667
and then Mick complained
that you got his nose broken,

315
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,126
and then Dr. Andrews
berated me

316
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,419
for not being a good attending

317
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,672
when all I did was
delegate to the two of you.

318
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,174
She suggested meeting
him in the cafeteria.

319
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,593
And you didn't object. As a
feminist, it's not my place to...

320
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,595
You both did terrible jobs.

321
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,973
I have to work on
Dr. Lim's surgery.

322
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,892
Go check on Skyler's pacemaker.

323
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,570
I can see the
common hepatic artery.

324
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,656
Resecting the large lymph
node anterior to it.

325
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,870
Dr. Park, the abdominal wall.

326
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,044
That's not local spread.

327
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,926
Metastasis. We can't finish.

328
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,053
We have to close him
up, reverse what we can.

329
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,227
We will go in
posteriorly at T9-L1.

330
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,688
With no anterior
instrumentation,

331
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,190
she'll be at a lower risk of
postsurgical complications,

332
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,276
and her prognosis
will be improved

333
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,153
by completing
posterior osteotomies

334
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,197
to release tension on the cord.

335
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,325
Still too risky.

336
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,868
Have you even
apologized to Lim yet?

337
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,078
I have nothing to apologize for.

338
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,788
Oh, my God. Shaun.

339
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,082
Oh, you are still mad at me
for not following orders.

340
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,335
That's why you keep
shooting down my ideas.

341
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,045
You didn't listen to
me, and you're refusing

342
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,797
to accept responsibility,
so yeah, I'm a little mad,

343
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,343
but I'm shooting down your
ideas because they're too risky.

344
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,178
I don't believe that.

345
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,013
Okay, fine, don't
believe it, then.

346
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,057
I want you to stop
being mad at me

347
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,351
so you will like my ideas again.

348
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,435
Doesn't work that way.

349
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,354
Then how does it work?

350
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,272
How long are you
going to be mad at me?

351
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,274
I don't know.

352
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,112
I'm gonna go finish
my clinic hours.

353
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,207
Is there something wrong
with her pacemaker?

354
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,209
Her heart is fine.

355
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,670
She has jaundice.
Her liver is failing.

356
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,470
Hypotension from the heart block
caused unexpected shock liver.

357
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,389
She has been listed for
a transplant on UNOS.

358
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,057
I've asked for an
exception to speed it up,

359
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,433
but at this rate she will die

360
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,102
before a donor liver
becomes available.

361
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,478
We tested her mom.

362
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,189
She's not a good match,
and her dad isn't either,

363
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,649
since he's not her dad.

364
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,026
What about her
biological father?

365
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,905
The mom's been calling him,
but apparently he blocked her.

366
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,824
We could try.

367
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,410
You got him punched in the face.

368
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,578
I will talk with him instead.

369
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:12,335
No. Y-You said before that
I might have eight months.

370
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,088
We didn't know it
had metastasized.

371
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,759
I always said I
wouldn't do this to him.

372
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,346
You're not doing anything
to him. You're sick.

373
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,433
He's gonna wind up
in a group home.

374
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,685
There are good ones.

375
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,271
Patient Services can advise you.

376
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,655
Should we get your brother
so you two can talk?

377
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,870
Yeah.

378
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,423
Got a minute?

379
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,967
Not really.

380
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,846
Patient of mine...

381
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,016
he's devoted his life to
taking care of his brother,

382
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,726
who's got a traumatic
brain injury,

383
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,270
but he's dying of pancreatic
cancer and he's terrified.

384
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,980
The Whipple procedure
is the only...

385
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,066
This isn't a surgical question.

386
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,985
I was hoping you'd talk to them.

387
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:25,451
About your experiences with
Steve, and after he died.

388
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,621
Why?

389
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,022
It would be great for them to
see how well you've turned out.

390
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,753
I don't know his brother
will turn out well.

391
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:40,048
I have ASD, but he
has a brain injury.

392
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,508
I know, but... I lived in a bus.

393
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,926
I don't know where they live,

394
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,385
but it is almost
certainly not a bus

395
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,906
or you would have
already mentioned it.

396
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,391
I still think it could help.

397
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,229
It's much more likely I can help
with fixing Dr. Lim's paralysis.

398
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,390
Your patient is dying anyway.

399
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,152
Why are you in this office?

400
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,196
I have a meeting.

401
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,460
You're making this
worse with Shaun.

402
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,170
You do realize that, don't you?

403
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,755
You're making him more upset.

404
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,882
He's got to take
responsibility for what he did.

405
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,008
He's trying.

406
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,134
And you staying pissed at him

407
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,594
isn't going to
help that process.

408
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,638
Which is exactly why
I'm gonna stay away.

409
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,056
Well, you can't
avoid him forever.

410
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,517
Yes, I can. Stop it!

411
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,272
You're mad at him. He's
not going to apologize.

412
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,023
Someone's got to
make the first move.

413
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,275
And that has got to be me?

414
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,442
Yeah, of course it does.

415
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,237
He's a grown man, and
he's your husband.

416
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,239
He has ASD, and he's your son.

417
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,579
Your daughter is
in liver failure.

418
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,831
None of her relatives
are suitable donors,

419
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,125
but you might be.

420
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,460
You want me to give my liver?

421
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,297
Just one lobe. The full
liver would kill you.

422
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,007
I've never met her.

423
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,009
I mean, I...

424
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,886
I only heard about
her a couple days ago.

425
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:12,307
Okay, you're... You're
biologically linked.

426
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,226
That gives you responsibility.

427
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,438
I have two little
boys who need me,

428
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,734
a wife I'm already in
couples therapy with.

429
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,485
I feel sorry for this girl.

430
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,404
I really do.

431
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,489
But I cannot destroy
my family for her.

432
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,013
My brother's going to be
okay. We're going on a trip.

433
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,273
Ollie, how about
Nurse Hawks here

434
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,394
takes you to the cafeteria
to get some ice cream, hmm?

435
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,527
Sundae?

436
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,528
Go for it.

437
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,080
I found a website for
a clinic in Mexico

438
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,166
that offers a cure
for pancreatic cancer.

439
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,087
Immunotherapy, stem
cells, supplements.

440
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,005
I know these clinics.

441
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,341
They're scams preying
on desperate people.

442
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,843
What do I have to lose?

443
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,930
Your money, for one thing.

444
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,059
Your brother will need
it after you're gone.

445
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,520
If he loses me...

446
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,689
he'll never make it.

447
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,732
He will.

448
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,736
You don't understand.

449
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:54,200
Growing up, um, my
family was really close.

450
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,703
We worked the farm together.

451
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,705
My brother...

452
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,999
My brother was my best friend.

453
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,376
One day, the tractor rolled,

454
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:08,381
and my brother herniated
a disk getting it back up.

455
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,884
Doctor gave him Oxy,
and 18 months later

456
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,761
he moved on to heroin.

457
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:18,391
Counselors, they, um...
They told me, my mom, my dad

458
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,851
to cut him off,

459
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,562
that he needed to
hit rock bottom.

460
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,273
So we did.

461
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,775
And he did.

462
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,321
For a while there, it
felt like he was gone.

463
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,993
My brother tells me now

464
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,454
that our family's love,

465
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,206
everything my
parents taught him,

466
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,917
that's what got him through.

467
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,840
We saved him, even
when we weren't there.

468
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,512
Last month, he actually, um...
He marked five years sober.

469
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,351
Ollie can handle this.

470
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,148
Tell him the truth.

471
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,822
Don't argue with
me. - I'm not!

472
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,492
Stop acting like a brat.

473
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:22,080
Let's go now.

474
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,207
That was school.

475
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,708
You hit Susan Dawkins again?

476
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,419
She was being mean to
me, like she always is.

477
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,796
Well, we talked
about this, Maddie.

478
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,256
All you got to do
is... Is stay away.

479
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,925
Why do I have to
change what I do

480
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,343
when she's the one who's mean?

481
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,513
Because hitting people
isn't acceptable, Maddie.

482
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,182
Sometimes in life,
people are gonna be mean.

483
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,767
You always make
everything my fault.

484
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,186
No, I don't. You're
supposed to be on my side.

485
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,063
I'm trying to be on your side,

486
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,856
but you make it
damn near impossible

487
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,483
because you never listen to me!

488
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,985
You don't listen. You
just boss me around.

489
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,737
Oh, my God. Okay.
You know what?

490
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,365
Just go to your room. No.

491
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,327
What did you say to
me? Go to your room.

492
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,662
I hate you.

493
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:06,083
I said go to your room!

494
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,850
Hepatic encephalopathy.

495
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,353
Without a new liver,
she'll be dead by tomorrow.

496
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,896
Did you get the
exception from UNOS?

497
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,981
No.

498
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,191
Then it's over.

499
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,569
It's not.

500
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,614
Her biological father
could still be a match.

501
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,994
First, you two failed with
Mick, then I failed with Mick.

502
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,122
We need to figure it
out together this time.

503
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,922
Ollie...

504
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,300
we're not gonna go to Mexico.

505
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,428
Are you better?

506
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,141
No.

507
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,518
Are you dying?

508
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,065
Yeah.

509
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:19,530
But we are gonna spend
every minute together.

510
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,326
And I'm gonna find you
a great group home.

511
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,870
And I know that's hard.

512
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,499
Ollie, I am so sorry.

513
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,672
Rajan's in a group home.

514
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,595
Rajan. From my day group.

515
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:50,186
He says he's got his own bedroom

516
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,772
and the people are nice.

517
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,568
He's okay.

518
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,326
I got your back, big bro.

519
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,914
I got your back, little bro.

520
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,728
Can I come in?

521
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,360
I am mad at you.

522
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,696
And for good reason.

523
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:46,994
But no matter how mad I get,
I never stop loving you.

524
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,123
I didn't tell that
to Maddie enough.

525
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,883
I don't know what you want
me to take away from that.

526
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,762
That I love you.

527
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,810
I do too.

528
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:18,315
And that I had good reasons...
Non-emotional reasons...

529
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,110
For shooting down
your earlier ideas.

530
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,070
But I think there
might be something

531
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,280
to that endoscopic plan, maybe.

532
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,157
Do you have any of
her C. T. scans?

533
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,993
I have many of them.

534
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,246
Well, let's start with one.

535
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,230
Thanks for coming out, guys.

536
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,366
That was beautiful.

537
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,993
Thanks.

538
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,870
I'm Lea.

539
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,331
Mick. First time at the show?

540
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,126
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,630
Uh, can I... Can I
show you something?

542
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,341
Sure.

543
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,775
Wow. She's... incredible.

544
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,026
Your daughter?

545
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,904
N-No.

546
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,865
Yours.

547
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,464
We'll go in posteriorly

548
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,633
with minimally invasive
percutaneous screws

549
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,593
and do a complete
vertebral column resection

550
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,263
at the maximally
kyphosed segments,

551
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,141
then reconstruct the vertebral
bodies with an expandable cage.

552
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,643
You're building a whole
new spinal column.

553
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:21,230
It's the safest way to remove
the tension in your cord

554
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,691
and let your body do its work.

555
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,942
You came around?

556
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,944
I wouldn't say I
came around exactly,

557
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,405
but I don't think
it's crazy to say yes.

558
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,740
At this point,
it's not a medical question.

559
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,826
It's an emotional one.

560
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,580
You got to ask yourself, how bad
do you want out of that chair?

561
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,040
I'll think on it.

562
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,342
You look...

563
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,387
I'm gonna use a highly
precise term here...

564
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,097
snazzy.

565
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:59,268
Well, I spent hours applying
very expensive snazz.

566
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,519
You look great, too.

567
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Thanks.

568
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,487
Reservation for
two under Joseph.

569
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,619
One moment.

570
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,038
Is this the only entrance
into the dining room?

571
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,457
It's an old building.
I'm so sorry.

572
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,292
A couple of waiters are
coming down right now.

573
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,252
They'll carry you and
the chair upstairs.

574
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,004
It's no problem.

575
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,131
Um...

576
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,719
You know, I have always loved

577
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,222
this little courtyard
area out here.

578
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,182
Could you possibly bring down
one of those corner tables

579
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,351
and a couple of chairs?

580
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,730
Uh, just one, actually.
I come equipped.

581
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,608
I'll make it happen.

582
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,818
Thank you.

583
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,868
"A New Hope" is, of
course, a perfect movie.

584
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,453
Correct.

585
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,624
But, talking about
the recent ones,

586
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,669
ah, there's one that, for
me, really stands out.

587
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,587
"Rogue One."

588
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,549
Yes! Oh!

589
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,718
Oh, that ending!

590
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,177
Genuinely a stunner.

591
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,721
Oh, not just for the franchise,

592
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,266
but for any Hollywood
blockbuster.

593
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,310
So, what are we watching?

594
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,447
I'm sorry.

595
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,074
I didn't think that, uh...

596
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,830
Should I go?

597
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,665
Yeah.

598
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,272
I'm guessing it wasn't a date?

599
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,117
If it would help, I
could tell you about

600
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,079
what I thought was a
romantic trip to Acapulco

601
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
right after my accident.

602
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,957
It wouldn't.

603
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,838
It never even occurred to him

604
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,216
that I would think
it was a date.

605
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,223
Don't do the surgery.

606
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,891
Whatever Dr. Murphy
is proposing

607
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,352
I'm sure sounds
pretty good right now.

608
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,187
Do you even know
what he's proposing?

609
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,899
This is about you wanting your
old life back at any cost.

610
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,152
I've been where you are.

611
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,490
The first year
after I lost my leg,

612
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,451
I would have risked
anything to get it back.

613
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,830
But I like my life now.

614
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,624
I like who I am now.

615
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,751
Give yourself time.

616
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,182
Skyler? Can you hear us?

617
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,935
Mommy?

618
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,813
Oh, careful. You've
got a lot of stitches.

619
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,399
What happened?

620
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,445
You got really sick, but
these doctors fixed you up.

621
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,074
This man gave you
part of his liver.

622
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,578
He saved your life.

623
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,705
Who are you?

624
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,587
I'm Mick.

625
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,477
See you on Monday.

626
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,190
Five years sober, huh?

627
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,782
Do you even have a brother?

628
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:10,079
I do. But, um, he's
not the addict.

629
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:16,126
And... your addiction...

630
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,755
Is that the reason

631
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:23,091
why you and I can't...

632
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,468
Yeah.

633
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,520
About six months
ago, I had a setback.

634
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,313
Bought some heroin.

635
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,191
Flushed it before I
took it, but still.

636
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:44,154
My first priority is making
it to midnight without using.

637
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:48,367
My second is becoming a surgeon.

638
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,493
And I don't know
how to add a third

639
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,119
without risking the others.

640
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,669
Thank you for trusting me.

641
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,883
I really hope we can be friends.

642
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,885
Yeah.

643
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,096
We're friends.

644
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,154
I have reserved an O. R. for
tomorrow afternoon in case...

645
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,824
I've decided
against the surgery.

646
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,911
Thank you for your work.

647
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,247
Why?

648
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,624
She doesn't owe us an
explanation, Shaun.

649
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,501
Yes, she does.

650
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,087
I revised my plan,
like you told me.

651
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,422
Shaun.

652
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,090
I can look for less
invasive methods.

653
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,091
Shaun, stop.

654
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,468
I-It's not fair. Shaun, stop.

655
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,178
Dr. Lim, if your concern is
recovery time... You know what?

656
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,388
You don't have to stay for this.

657
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,473
I can show... Stop!

658
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,195
It's not fair.

659
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,076
Tell me the reasons why
you think it's not fair,

660
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,620
and I'll try to explain it.

661
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,290
I'm sorry.

662
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,516
I heard Lim said
no to the surgery.

663
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,144
You did the right thing trying.

664
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,272
It accomplished nothing.

665
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,364
When I went back to Hershey
to help my family's company,

666
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,116
I thought it would
fix the business,

667
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:57,162
fix things with my brother,
fix things with my parents.

668
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,414
Failed on all three.

669
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,958
But I'm glad I did it.

670
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,211
That makes no sense.

671
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:09,758
I'd rather do my best and fail
than always regret not trying.

672
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,554
When people are in
pain, try to help them.

673
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:20,019
Even if you think it
won't change anything?

674
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,564
That only makes it braver.

675
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,626
Thanks for coming.

676
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,384
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

677
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:57,055
Dr. Park wants me to talk
to you about my life.

678
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,017
I don't know if I can help.

679
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,645
But I am going to try.

680
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,538
Okay...
