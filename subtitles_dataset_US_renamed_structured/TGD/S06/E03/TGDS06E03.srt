our married people plates
so much. Don't you?

00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:13,243
They have a pleasant heft
and no rough surfaces.

4
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:15,157
No. Hmm.

5
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:16,227

[gentle music playing]

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,055
We should have a dinner party.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,861
We have six smooth, beautiful
married people plates.

9
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:29,257
We can invite
Frank and Morgan.

10
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:31,377
That sounds not fun

11
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,750
and like we might have fewer
plates by the end.

12
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:36,148
What about Jordan and Asher?
That could be fun.

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,710
But if we invite Asher and
not Jerome, is that offensive?

14
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,922
Okay, best idea yet,

15
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,880
skip the dinner party, skip the
awkwardness, see our friends at work.

16
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:47,515
I'll be ready in a minute.

17
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,696
It will be closer
to four minutes, possibly five.

18
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,116
Both are acceptable.

19
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,563
[Dr. Lim] I need
the M&M report on my surgery.

20
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:08,569
And by your surgery, you mean?

21
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,960
The one Shaun performed on me.

22
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,610
The committee found no evidence
that Shaun did anything wrong.

23
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:14,758
Inconclusive.

24
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:16,905
They decided the evidence
was inconclusive.

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,391
I would like to do
my own review.

26
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:20,549

27
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,616
Do you really think
you can be impartial,

28
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:26,101
or will you just be searching
for a reason to punish Shaun?

29
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,703
I don't know why I would,

30
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,015
unless something in the report
suggests Dr. Murphy made a mistake.

31
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,965
I'll email you the file.

34
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,041
I'm fine.

35
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,813
Mm. So brave,

36

after your crush shot you down!

37
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,696
I asked Perez to drinks

to him all day.

39

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,088
Cady, you're safe.
I'm Dr. Park.

52
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:48,447
I'm here to help. I need to
examine your wrist, okay?

We were on our way
to an inpatient psych facility.

She hasn't even recognized us
in at least two months.

No, no, no.
Don't talk to them!

- They're liars!
- Cady, Cady, Cady, please hold still.

Please, please, Dr. Park.

- No! No! Get that away from me!
- Cady, Cady, Cady.

- Careful with the arm.
- No! No, no!

This is Dr. Shaun Murphy,
one of our surgical attendings.

72
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:34,927
This is Julianne.

73
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:36,952
She fractured her ankle
falling off a curb.

74
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:39,037
The tibiotalar joint
may be an issue.

I got dizzy
from hypoglycemia.

76

Must've mistimed my insulin.

77
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,526
No idea how that happened.

00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:47,490
Is it time to check

No, not yet.

Oh, that is a very shiny

00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,404
How long has it been,
Dr. Murphy?

82
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,941
Lea and I have been married
for three months

83

why Jay-Z

The first year of marriage
is crucial

94
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:21,851
for cultivating good patterns
and weeding out bad ones

95
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:24,318
before they can harden
into habits

96
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:26,936
that will define
your entire relationship.

97
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,428
What habits define
your marriage?

98
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,335
I'm afraid all our habits
are in the past.

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,821
My husband died recently.

100
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,394
I'm so sorry for your loss.

101
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,029
How long has he been gone?

102
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,209
A little over five months.

00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,285
Is it time to check
my blood sugar?

104
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,178
You asked her
about a minute ago.

105
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:51,428
- It was longer than that.
- No, it wasn't.

106
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,209
And I know, from your podcast,

107
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,678
your husband died
several years ago.

[dramatic music playing]

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,678
You need surgery on your ankle,

110
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,522
but we should MRI your brain.

111
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,586
We've repaired the laceration
to her radial artery,

112
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,683
but there's still
a decision to be made

113
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,318
on treating her wrist fracture.

114
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:19,569
There's a choice between
external or internal fixation.

115
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:22,357
The external fix at or involves
attaching a metal frame

116
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,765
to her forearm and hand.

117
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,389
It requires a longer stay

118
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:28,209
and frequent adjustments
for eight to twelve weeks.

119
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,399
Internal gets Cady
out of the hospital sooner,

120
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,301
but has a high risk
of complications,

121
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,326
like nerve damage or infection.

122
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,740
Uh, I don't like the sound
of those complications.

123
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:41,506
The treatment center will only
hold her spot for a week.

124
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:44,202
What happens if they can't
handle those adjustments?

125
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,576
I can reach out to them.

126
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:48,429
I-I-I'm not certain
about sending Cady

127
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,201
away for treatment
at this point.

128
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,099
She nearly killed herself
rather than go to that place.

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,061

She's a danger to others.

131
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,553
She needs more help
than we can give her.

132
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,596
We'll leave you two alone
to talk.

133
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,959
As Cady's mother,
it's my decision.

00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,043
Moira!

135
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,654

137
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,467

Not yet.

- Uh, I'll clear out.
- Please stay.

147
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,889
I am interested
in your opinion, as well.

148
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,405
Must be a real doozy of a case

149
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,452
if you called all of us,
the chief included.

150
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,343

151

and a distorted sense of time.

152
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,312
It is too soon to tell
if it is a doozy.

bad habits that developed

155

during the first year of your
respective failed marriages.

156
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,269
Or good habits, if you had any.

[quirky music playing]

158
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,441

159
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:22,027
As an attending,

160
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,421
I no longer have time to talk

161
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:24,679
to you all individually,

162
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:26,443
so, I called a meeting

163
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,420
of the divorced.

164
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,037
Dr. Glassman, you have
the most failed marriages.

165
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:36,193
Park's split-up was much
more recent. You go first.

166
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,624
Well, that was a break-up,

167
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,810
not a divorce.

168
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,256
You and Dr. Reznick
seemed pretty serious.

169
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,662
Um, don't get involved

170
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:49,412
with a pathologically ambitious
narcissist and, uh...

171
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,409
be as emotionally open
as possible,

172
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:54,895
which you're already great at.

173
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:56,364
[Dr. Andrews]
And that goes for everything.

174
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,783
Nothing is too small to discuss.

175
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,771
Except for the infinite number
of differences of opinion.

176
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,779
And how do you know
which ones don't matter?

177
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:11,589
Dr. Murphy, if you have
concerns about your marriage,

178
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:12,775
talk to your wife.

179
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:14,722
Meeting adjourned.

180
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,409
[quirky music continues]

181
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,210
Julianne's brain MRI.

182
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,670
Check out the parietal lobe.

183
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,342
Dr. Andrews!

184
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:26,409
This case maybe...
after all.

185
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:31,225
You have a grade 2
oligodendroglioma

186
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,499
centered in your parietal lobe.

187
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,652
It's disturbing
your precuneus region.

188
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:36,972
May I?

189
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:42,264
Looked at a lot of brains during
my doctoral psych program.

190
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:47,498
It's close to the motor
and primary sensory cortex.

191
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,389
We will need to map out

192
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:50,765
the critical structures
of your brain

193
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:51,968
to determine
a surgical approach.

194
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,123
There are risks,

195
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,662
but if we can get all of it,

196
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,668
the prognosis is excellent.

197
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,293
Or we could
try to shrink the tumor

198
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:59,361
with chemo and radiation,

199
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:00,881
but there's an increased chance

200
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:04,598
the tumor will progress
to a grade 4 glioma.

201
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:07,082
[sighs]

202
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:09,933
I want the surgery.

203
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:14,040
My life's work has been
to help people find

204
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,051
what my husband and I had.

205
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,739
I'm not done yet.
[Chuckles]

206
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,809
That is... very good to hear.

207
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,985
This transcranial
magnetic stimulation

208
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,083
will pinpoint the pathways
of your motor cortex

209
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,060
and help us resect
your brain tumor.

210
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,858
And this is my wife, Lea.

211
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,353
- Hey.
- Lea, met Julianne.

212
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,713
She is a marriage therapist

213
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,473
and told me to be careful
of the habits we set.

214
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:42,918
Great to meet you,
but under the circumstances...

215
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:44,323
Chatting with you two
is much better

216
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,380
than contemplating those
circumstances. [Chuckles]

217
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:48,541
Stay.

218
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:50,161
I made a list of small habits

219
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,647
that could become
larger problems.

220
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:52,800
[chuckles]

221
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,951
[quirky music playing]

222
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,817
"Snoring, minor tardiness."

223
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:03,513
- Is that supposed to happen?
- Yes.

224
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:05,794
A disconcerting tolerance
for dust.

225
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,645
- These are all my habits.
- Yes.

226
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,340
Do I have habits
you would like me to change?

227
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,692
At this point,
you better just say it, hmm?

228
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,668
The dishes.

229
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,325
You take them
out of the dishwasher

230
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,356
and rerinse them
after I've already done it.

231
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,684
Because you are doing it wrong.

232
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:28,566
- [groans]
- Try to hold still.

233
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:31,851
We just need to make sure that your
wound's clean for surgery tomorrow.

234
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:34,637
My head hurts.
I-I need to sit up.

235
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:35,872
Hey.

236
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,231
Please, just let me see my mom.

237
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,707
She wouldn't like
what you're doing to me.

238
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:52,817
We're all trying
to help you feel better.

239
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,459
You hungry?

240
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,872
Paul went to get you some food.

241
00:10:58,335 --> 00:10:59,857
I want to go home.

242
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,201
Okay, wound looks good.

243
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,601
- Now, let's pack it with gauze.
- [moans]

244
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,577
We can give her something
to try to help her relax.

245
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:06,938
No. No more poison.

246
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,279
She doesn't need to be drugged.
She's uncomfortable.

247
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:12,614
- [groans]
- Please, just let her out.

248
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,200
I can't. I'm sorry.

249
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,249
[groans]

250
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,718
[somber music playing]

251
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,758
On all three fundamentals,

252
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:29,638
water temperature, choice of
equipment, and application of force,

253
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:30,888
your technique is lacking.

254
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:32,232
Shaun, we have a dishwasher.

255
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,162
This is just
a preliminary rinse.

256
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,902
Shaun, um, instead
of offering a critique,

257
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,357
try stating a positive need.

258
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:46,403
You know, something like, "I wish
the situation was more like this..."

259
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,669
I wish the situation
was more like

260
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,298
Lea knew how to wash the dishes.

261
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:55,434
- [beep]
- We're done with the mapping.

262
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:01,043
Lea, do you enjoy
doing the dishes?

263
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,528
Does anyone?

264
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:04,098
[scoffing] I do.

265
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:09,112
Then forget finding
common ground on this, huh?

266
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,278
Divide and conquer.

267
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,759
[whimsical music playing]

268
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:21,045
He went three for four, two doubles,
three RBIs, and struck out the side!

269
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:22,680
[laughter]

270
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,349
Well, wait until he's 16
and can throw a curve.

271
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:28,668
Oh, I-I think I can
get back from here.

272
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:30,606
Oh, please.
I'm enjoying the company.

273
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,051
Ohh!

274
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,020
You're so sweet.
[Laughs]

275
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:38,411
- I feel nothing. Leave me alone.
- Fine.

276
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,865
[whimsical music playing]

277
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,351
What have you two been
fighting about?

278
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:45,686
- Everything.
- Just little stuff.

279
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,619
Yeah, because you're so crabby.

280
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:49,551
Because you're so distracted.

281
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,977
It's always like this
when I'm on night shifts.

282
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,348
Why do you think night shifts
are a problem?

283
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,778
We have less time together
to hang out and...

284
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,466
Sex! There's no sex.

285
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,629
Because he's too tired
when he gets home.

286
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:06,824
Hmm.

287
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:11,043
Why do you have to wait
until he gets home?

288
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,530
Five more on this side,
then switch.

289
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,348
I'm going to get a heat pad.

290
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:23,658
You wanted to do
a hemihepatectomy,

291
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,614
but Shaun changed
your surgical plan.

292
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,575
Is that right?

293
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:32,254
Would you like me to put my
hand on a Bible, counselor?

294
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,986
I thought removing a lobe
was the safest choice.

295
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:38,200
After I left, the parameters
changed. Shaun adjusted.

296
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:41,352
A resident overruled
your judgment,

297
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,661
without bothering
to consult you,

298
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,135
and you were fine with that?

299
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,567
That resident was days away
from becoming an attending,

300
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:49,901
and he did exactly
what you trained him to do:

301
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:52,088
He made a tough decision,
a hard call,

302
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,114
with limited data.

303
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,301
Would you have made that call?

304
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:00,812
When I got back,
I evaluated the progress,

305
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:03,801
and I decided
that it was safe to continue.

306
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,637
It was safe?

307
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,809
Or you had no choice?

308
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:11,645
Clearly, you read the report.
You tell me.

309
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,356
You asked why
no one had come to get you.

310
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,950
If you were fine with Shaun's
call, why would you care?

311
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:21,786
I was worried about you.

312
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,902
Thank you.

313
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,676
But if you were fine with
the call, why would you care?

314
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,692
- I got angry.
- You didn't say angry in the M&M.

315
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:34,812
You said, "Concerned."

316
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,029
You're slicing the salami
pretty thin right now.

317
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:38,443
Why not just say you were angry?

318
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,332
My precise emotional state
is not medically relevant.

319
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,853
Unless you were angry
because Shaun made a bad call.

320
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,940
[tense music playing]

321
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,028
Shaun saved your life.

322
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,535
[sighs]

323
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,613
[gentle music playing]

324
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:19,153
What? [Scoffs]

325
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,598
Folding the shirt in thirds

326
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:23,685
allows them
to be stored vertically.

327
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,903
Sure, but I'd rather...

328
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:27,848
Storing them vertically
saves space

329
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,098
and makes them easier to find.

330
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,197
Well, why don't you
fold the shirts?

331
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,059
That is an excellent idea.

332
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,114
[chuckles sarcastically]

333
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:43,513
Good night.

334
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:45,489
Good night.

335
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:55,141
[playful music playing]

336
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,764
Not a bad way
to spend a dinner break.

337
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:02,849
[laughs]

338
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,782
I'm going to go crash for a
while before my call starts.

339
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:08,911
Okay.

340
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,963
Hey, we need Dr. Park
or security.

341
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,260
- What's wrong?
- I-I went home to get a change of clothes...

342
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,454
[Moira] I must've fallen asleep.

343
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,985
She's gone.

344
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:22,001
[tense music playing]

345
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,757
Cady couldn't sleep with,
with the restraints.

346
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,688
She was upset and uncomfortable.

347
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,454
I took them off.

348
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,758
I asked her to. It's my fault.

349
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:38,875
It's not your job
to enforce hospital protocol.

350
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,102
Security's been alerted.
They're working top-down.

351
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,282
You guys cover the east wing.

00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,484
and giving mannitol to keep
her brain pressure down.

527
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:16,082
Well, whatever happens,
we'll get through it.

528
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,297
You're in for the long haul now?

529
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,351
You threatened
to walk out on us.

530
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:24,840
I was upset.

531
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:29,158
I just... I was trying to do what
was best for her and for... for you.

532
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:30,778
By leaving us?

533
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:55,901
Your symptoms point to another
tumor in your occipital lobe.

534
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:58,141
No tablet this time?

535
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:02,829
The tumor doesn't show up
on imaging, but I know it is there.

536
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:06,266
We can see an irregular and
distinct pattern of edema in that region.

537
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:10,204
If the tumor's there, it will
very likely stop your heart again.

538
00:27:11,268 --> 00:27:13,485
I've been dead before.

539
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,852
It was pretty great.

540
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:18,868
I don't want the surgery.

541
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:23,868
No, the bright colors you couldn't
describe, that's color agnosia.

542
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,736
Your husband being just out
of reach, that's optic ataxia.

543
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:28,352
You did not see Heaven.

544
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:31,549
You had a seizure
caused by your tumor.

545
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:33,752
Dr. Murphy,

546
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:37,856
you and I are both cursed

547
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:41,276
with being very good
at fixing things.

548
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,182
When Scott was alive,

549
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:49,823
I could have made a list of a hundred
ways to improve my marriage, my husband.

550
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:52,112
But when I saw him again...

551
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:57,901
I couldn't think
of a single thing I'd change.

552
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:02,612
I just want to be
with my husband again.

553
00:28:06,358 --> 00:28:07,358
You will be.

554
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,018
Uh, I think
what you experienced was real.

555
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:17,272
What you saw, it's...
It's not going anywhere.

556
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,884
And there are still a lot of
people here who need your insight.

557
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:27,020
I know that matters to you
because even with a tumor...

558
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,674
Two brain tumors.

559
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:31,804
Two brain tumors
and a broken ankle,

560
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,299
you still made a point of
helping half your medical team.

561
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,081
Eternity is a long time.

562
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,985
Your husband will be waiting
for you whenever you get there.

563
00:28:42,265 --> 00:28:44,400
[pensive music playing]

564
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,206
He better.

565
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,120
Let's see if you're right.

566
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:04,313
She's a GCS of eight,

567
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,159
has most
of her brain stem reflexes.

568
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:09,175
But no signs that she's ready
to come off the vent.

569
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:14,502
She always took
forever to wake up.

570
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:24,190
I saw Paul
in the cafeteria just now

571
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,777
surrounded by empty coffee cups.

572
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,199
If you'd like some company...

573
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,762
No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Doctor.

574
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,598
I used to be a lieutenant
on an aircraft carrier.

575
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:52,137
The first time
I saw a plane land,

576
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:55,075
I thought... for sure
this sucker is going to

577
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,239
skid right off the other end
into the ocean.

578
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:02,259
I promise there's a point
to this.

579
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,344
[chuckles]

580
00:30:04,522 --> 00:30:05,823
But they never do.

581
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,707
Because the planes,

582
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,686
they have these
tail hooks that catch

583
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,027
on these giant,
inch-thick steel wires.

584
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:15,266
These wires, they can stop
a 50,000-pound aircraft

585
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:19,816
traveling 150 miles per hour
in two seconds.

586
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:22,715
And they almost never break...

587
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,074
until they do.

588
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:33,332
One swung across the deck
and hit my leg, sent me flying.

589
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:36,121
I was in a coma for weeks.

590
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:39,043
My parents, they had to decide

591
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,254
whether or not
to amputate my leg,

592
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,273
and they disagreed.

593
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:47,695
It got ugly.

594
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:54,569
But my mom won.

595
00:30:58,006 --> 00:31:00,341
And I went to med school
on one leg.

596
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:05,780
And my parents, they celebrated
45 years last month.

597
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,154
When a family member is sick,

598
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:16,924
everybody gets a pass.

599
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:36,667
Hi, there.

600
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:43,127
After Shaun committed to the
angioembolization,

601
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,370
my collateral vessels bled,

602
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,245
causing my blood pressure
to bottom out.

603
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,167
Audrey, it's late...

604
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:50,839
That loss of BP led to my cord
ischemia, which led to my paralysis.

605
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:53,861
- Do you agree?
- Yes, as I said in the report, yes.

606
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,042
The report is facts.
It's just facts.

607
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,081
Audrey, what exactly
do you want from me?

608
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,167
I am sitting in this chair
because of that surgery.

609
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,654
And everybody here
seems completely fine with it.

610
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:06,805
Fine with Shaun's decision,
fine with him going rogue.

611
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,893
I'm not fine with it.

612
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,230
- I'm not fine with it.
- Well, that is not what you said in the M&M.

613
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,349
What Shaun did was headstrong,
it was risky,

614
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,053
and it's not
what I would have done, okay?

615
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,671
But let's just be clear.

616
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:19,784
He didn't make a mistake,

617
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:21,170
he did what he thought was best,

618
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,755
and it shouldn't be a mark
on his career as a surgeon.

619
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,209
- That is not your decision.
- And I'm angry, okay?

620
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm angry. So what?
It's irrelevant.

621
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:33,168
I'm so angry I could scream.
It keeps me up every night.

622
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,155
What if Andrews
didn't call me away?

623
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,409
What if I had come back
just five minutes sooner?

624
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:39,733
What if? What if? What if?

625
00:32:39,818 --> 00:32:42,120
- Well, what would you have done?
- [sighs]

626
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,597
Come on, Aaron.

627
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:47,190
What would you have done?

628
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:51,706
Would you have told Shaun
to go back to the original plan?

629
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,198
Yes.

630
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,065
[sighs]

631
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,284
Thank you.

632
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,856
Because everything's fixed now?

633
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:16,083
Because you're gonna
walk again soon?

634
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,591
Because you're with me.

635
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:26,341
Finally somebody sees my side
instead of Shaun's.

636
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,966
It's not either-or.

637
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,770
I'm not so sure.

638
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,974
There's just something sexy
about the closet.

639
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:52,303
Maybe it's the symbolism.
You know, like coming out of the closet.

640
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:54,794
- I get it. I just don't approve of it.
- Why?

Really?

711
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:49,478
Are you gonna teach me
your technique?

712
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:50,500
No.

713
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:54,594

732

Hey, Cady's latest neuro exam
showed no deficits.

733
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:03,055
And the alignment
from her ex fix looks great.

734
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:09,000
Um, I'm sorry.

735
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:14,885
Chain of command was never
my strong suit. I'm working on it.

736
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:16,086
Thank you...

737
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:21,898
for your service, Lieutenant.

738
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:31,234
Was anybody
ever gonna ask about my limp?

739
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:38,203
Shaun wanted to,
but we told him he wasn't allowed.

740
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:44,875
[chuckles]

741
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:51,091
You lost a patient today,
Dr. Murphy?

742
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:54,125
She seized on the table
before the first incision.

743
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,570
Autopsy confirmed she had a
high-grade occipital lobe tumor

744
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,077
which would have killed her
in three to six months.

745
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:01,936
Your advice was good.

746
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,047
I talked to Lea about habits

747
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:06,562
and learned she doesn't
appreciate when I wash the dishes

748
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:08,087
after she washes the dishes,

749
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:09,750
even though
she is doing it wrong.

750
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,086
Shaun, I can't hear this.

751
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:13,711
[loudly] Your advice was good.
I talked to Lea about...

752
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:15,820
I mean, I don't want to hear it.

753
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:22,197
I'm having complicated feelings
about my surgery.

754
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,545
- What you did.
- I saved your life.

755
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,773
This...

756
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,971
This... is a struggle.

757
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:36,672
You put me here, and
I'm really angry about that.

758
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:41,258
As your boss,

759
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,077
I need to set my feelings aside,

760
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,108
be professional, and I will.

761
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:50,617
But that's all.

762
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:53,586
I don't want you to ask me
about my personal life,

763
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,117
and I don't want
to hear about yours.

764
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:02,789
From now on, our relationship
is medicine only.

765
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:05,265
