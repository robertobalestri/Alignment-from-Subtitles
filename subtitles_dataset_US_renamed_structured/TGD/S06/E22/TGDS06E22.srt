1
00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:02,193
You should put this on now.

2
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:04,609
My contractions are
still nine minutes apart,

3
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:06,853
and they're not...

4
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:08,717
not that bad.

5
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:11,892
They are now 8 minutes
and 45 seconds apart.

6
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:14,792
We should get pancakes.
Where's my sweater?

7
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:17,519
I don't want pancakes. I
want you to put this on.

8
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:21,039
Shoot... I forgot
my lucky socks.

9
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:22,810
The ones I wore last time
I was in the hospital...

10
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,560
when my brilliant
husband came up

11
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:26,286
with a miracle surgery
to save our baby.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,632
Those are hospital socks.

13
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,979
They are identical to all
the other hospital socks.

14
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,498
I will get you another pair.

15
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,742
But they won't be my lucky ones.

16
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,571
- I'll go home and get them.
- N-No.

17
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:37,815
You need to stay
here. And put this on.

18
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:39,886
And get hooked up
to a fetal monitor.

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,404
I will get the socks.

20
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,339
Okay.

21
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,384
How long after we get there
will the surgery start?

22
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:57,500
You'll go straight
to the pre-op,

23
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,768
where they'll do a
chest X-ray and echo.

24
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,046
Oh, why waste time with
that? I need a new valve.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,426
There's no mystery here.

26
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,083
We'll also need blood
and urine samples.

27
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:07,189
Huh. I can give
you that right now.

28
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:09,053
That's... not necessary.

29
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,848
Efficiency, boys.

30
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:13,367
Clearly, none of you have
been in the military.

31
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,546
Yeah. We're Oscar-Mike
from the nursing home,

32
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,306
but some dense fog put
us behind schedule.

33
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:22,756
Yeah. Make sure
the O.R. is prepped

34
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,207
and Dr. Park is at the ready
for Mr. Ermey when we get there.

35
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,726
On the double.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,865
Your dad a Marine?

37
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,107
Brother.

38
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:31,731
Oorah.

39
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:34,906
Okay. Just make sure
your "dense fog" excuse

40
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,943
is only for your
critical care transport

41
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,082
and not dinner tonight.

42
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:39,808
Um, dress code?

43
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:41,360
To the nines.

44
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,500
Going tens.

45
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,960
Hello?

46
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:54,995
Danny?

47
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:57,895
You there?

48
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:58,999
Danny?

49
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,493
You okay?

50
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:14,428
My knee's kind of messed
up, but otherwise okay.

51
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,501
Mr. Ermey? We've
been in a crash.

52
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:19,617
All right. We're
gonna get you down.

53
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:20,745
- Okay.
- All right.

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,436
- You got his legs?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:23,610
All right. Three, two, one.

56
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,681
Gotcha.

57
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:26,900
- All right.
- Take his armband off.

58
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:29,305
- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right.
- Watch your head.

59
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,171
Okay. I'm gonna unstrap you.

60
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:34,355
- Okay.
- All right. You ready?

61
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,829
- Mm-hmm.
- Three-two, one.

62
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,004
- -Oh!
- I'm good. I'm good.

63
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,212
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,319
Okay.

65
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,370
The truck came over the
line. I had nowhere to go.

66
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:00,612
Are you all right?

67
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,890
I think my leg's broken.

68
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,364
Okay. Stay up there.
I'll get to you.

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,169
Can you reach your radio?

70
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,629
We're gonna need at least
five more ambulances.

71
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,689
Got it.

72
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:08,907
Danny, you take the driver
of the pick-up truck.

73
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:10,450
- I'll get to the family.
- All right.

74
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:11,520
Dispatch...

75
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:19,459
It's gonna be okay, girls.

76
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:20,539
Okay, I'm Jared. I'm a doctor.

77
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,013
- What's your name?
- Uh, uh, Kenny.

78
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:23,359
I can't breathe.

79
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:25,027
Kenny, any pain in your
chest? Trouble breathing?

80
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,442
Uh, uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay. Help them.

81
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,346
All right. You sit over
there. I'll get to them.

82
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,505
Hey, girls.

83
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,586
I'm gonna get you out
of these car seats

84
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,725
so you can be with
your dad, okay?

85
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:36,062
- What's your name?
- I'm Bea.

86
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:38,581
- Okay, Bea.
- My sister's name is Ella.

87
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:40,376
Okay. Okay. All right.

88
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,861
Let's get you out of there.

89
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,655
It's gonna be okay.

90
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,519
Good job, Bea. Well done.

91
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:47,418
Ella, I'll be right
back for you, okay?

92
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,213
Good job. Now, you
go to your dad.

93
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,042
- There you go.
- I got you. I got you.

94
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:57,117
He's alive! He's alive!

95
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,532
But pulse is weak and thready.

96
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,396
Hey.

97
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,857
I'm gonna get you out
of here safe, all right?

98
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,675
Yeah, yeah. Don't
worry. I'm fine.

99
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,608
All right. Hold still, please.

100
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,404
Okay, Ella. I'm
Dr. Kalu. Are you okay?

101
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,511
My chest... I can't breathe.

102
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,423
Okay. Let's get you out of here so
you can be with your dad, all right?

103
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,620
Good job, Ella.

104
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,485
I've got you. That's it.
You're doing so well.

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,109
I've got you. Get
you under here.

106
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,627
Come on.

107
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,629
Okay. Good job, guys.

108
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:28,562
Good job.

109
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,635
No, no, no, no, no.

110
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,776
No. Hey! Hey!

111
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,985
Stop! Stop! Hey!

112
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,159
Danny!

113
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,495
Lea's in labor.

114
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,324
We're having our baby today.

115
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:10,432
Congratulations.

116
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,001
Morning, ladies.

117
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,624
Eden, clocking in today?

118
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,386
My trial had three participants
drop out at the last minute,

119
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,767
and every available
nanny within 90 miles

120
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,149
is either dumb,
lazy, or incompetent.

121
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:40,289
Mommy Morgan has very
exacting standards.

122
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,154
I'm willing to lower them
momentarily if you're available.

123
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,718
I just need a few
minutes to give my spiel

124
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,124
to a room full of
perimenopausal IBS patients.

125
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,057
I would, but I just
got paged to the E.R.

126
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,719
I'll stop by later.

127
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,038
Be professional.

128
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,834
At least five seriously injured

129
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,250
multi-vehicle collision
patients are inbound,

130
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,734
including Dr. Perez.

131
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,081
I'll take the first patient.

132
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,531
Then Dr. Park, then
Andrews, Wolke, and Allen,

133
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:16,739
in that order.

134
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,786
Senior doctors, when you have
stabilized your patients,

135
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,030
please circle back and
assist the residents.

136
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:22,780
Take a deep breath, everybody.

137
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:25,069
Driver of the last car of the
pile-up... head-on collision.

138
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,060
Conscious, has a pulse,
but not responding.

139
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,098
Suspected cervical spinal cord
and brachial plexus injury.

140
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:31,271
Chest hurts.

141
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:33,446
Where's my phone? I
need to make a call.

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,160
You'll get your phone
call soon, Mr. Ermey.

143
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:37,829
Get an eFAST and
assess for shock.

144
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,417
Let's fix that lac.

145
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:40,705
I need to drain the
hemopericardium.

146
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,386
Give FFP to control
the bleeding.

147
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,251
Fracture of the right femoral
shaft and left distal radius.

148
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:46,424
We got it.

149
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,392
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm... I'm good.

150
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:49,634
Where's Perez?

151
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,026
Kalu is bringing him
in the last ambulance.

152
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,052
So, he's the least critical?

153
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,570
He's...

154
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,917
He'll be here soon.

155
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:00,714
Multiple rib fractures and
associated pneumothorax.

156
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,820
It hurts.

157
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,410
Hey, I'm Dr. Wolke.

158
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:07,756
We're gonna help you, okay?

159
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:14,936
Finally.

160
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:27,500
Still no purposeful
eye or limb movements.

161
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,683
Likely a high c-spine fracture.

162
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,952
Let's get her stabilized
for a trauma pan-scan.

163
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,816
Massive right-side
hemopneumothorax,

164
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,266
but she's holding
her own on vitals.

165
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,760
- She needs a chest tube.
- What does that mean?

166
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,418
- Is... Is she gonna...
- She's gonna be okay.

167
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,489
We just need to make sure that
you and the little one are good.

168
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:42,491
- If you could take a seat...
- I-I-I'm fine. Just a bruise from my...

169
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:43,975
Yes, I know you feel fine,
but we need to make sure.

170
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,483
I-It's okay, Bea.

171
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:46,968
Um, I-I-I got to call my wife.

172
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,487
She doesn't even know
any of this happened.

173
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:50,972
Abdominal ecchymosis,

174
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:53,146
peritoneal hemorrhage,
possible hemothorax.

175
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,423
You're bleeding everywhere.

176
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,322
Call up to O.R. 2 for
an emergency ex lap.

177
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,841
No opioids.

178
00:07:58,876 --> 00:07:59,981
What?

179
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,190
Just promise me.

180
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:03,363
No opioids.

181
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,848
Okay.

182
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:08,990
Tell the anesthesiologist
opioid-free.

183
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:12,096
Ow!

184
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:14,202
Considerable
intraperitoneal fluid.

185
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:16,825
She has a perforation and needs
abdominal surgery right away.

186
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,585
No! Dad!

187
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,311
It's gonna be okay, baby.

188
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,520
Mommy will be here soon,
and we'll all play Scrabble.

189
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:27,053
We think you suffered
a neck injury,

190
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:29,237
but we need to get some images
so we can tell for sure.

191
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,846
Hey.

192
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,159
All stabilizing ligaments
have been completely severed.

193
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,061
Internal decapitation.

194
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,536
Have you ever worked
on one of these?

195
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,307
Never even seen one.

196
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,289
Why aren't you in
your patient room?

197
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:00,015
Oh, I had some last-minute
e-mails to send,

198
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,466
and my preggo-brain
forgot my laptop in here.

199
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,570
Did you get my socks?

200
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:05,676
Is there something
wrong with your room?

201
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,023
We could get you extra blankets.

202
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,338
What is this?

203
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:15,237
This is the cutest
hat I've ever seen.

204
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:20,139
Oh! I got one for each of us.

205
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:23,073
Shaun, I love them.

206
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,424
We should take it to Glassy.

207
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,979
We should go to your room.

208
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:35,844
I-I know things are...

209
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,742
difficult between
you two right now,

210
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,711
but his grandson is
being born today.

211
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:43,334
He knows.

212
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:47,373
He said, "Congratulations,"

213
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:48,512
and then he shut the door.

214
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,721
Mm.

215
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,760
We need to get you hooked
up to a fetal monitor.

216
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,563
The surgery went well. We
repaired Ella's bowel perforation.

217
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:09,636
Mommy, did you bring snacks?

218
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,467
We'll go to the
cafeteria together

219
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,261
as soon as we're done
talking to the doctors.

220
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,159
When can she go home?

221
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:20,061
Uh, there was some
damage to her spleen.

222
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:22,201
Uh, we'll need to monitor
that for the next few days,

223
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,454
make sure it doesn't get worse.

224
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:24,582
But I'll keep you updated.

225
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,322
I've got to be in the O.R. in 10
minutes for my valve replacement.

226
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:32,245
Order a post-op CT and
run serial hematocrits.

227
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:40,150
Mm. Sorry.

228
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm not used to having
consultations in my kitchen.

229
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:45,776
I've never seen that much
separation between skull and spine.

230
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,398
Have you? Not in anyone alive.

231
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,575
I was thinking
occipitocervical fusion surgery

232
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,095
using a plate with
four-point fixation

233
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,820
and transpedicular and
translaminar screws.

234
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,893
You're gonna have to add

235
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:03,449
iliac crest graft
and Songer cables.

236
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,661
You're looking at over
two hours just to realign

237
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:10,904
and stabilize the
skull and the spine,

238
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,139
and then the real work begins.

239
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:15,185
Your odds of success
are somewhere

240
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:19,223
between minimal and nonexistent.

241
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,537
Well, marathons are pointless, but
millions of people run them anyway.

242
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,505
Feel like running?

243
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,473
I've been deemed "unfit."

244
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:29,440
You wouldn't be cutting.
You'd be consulting.

245
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:32,202
Flattering.

246
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:34,998
You're still one of the
world's foremost experts

247
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:36,792
on the brain and spine,

248
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,967
and my patient's head is
hanging on by a thread.

249
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:44,145
This one's scary. I
could use some help.

250
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,150
Sure.

251
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:52,118
I'm up for some...
color commentary.

252
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,056
You have another contraction
coming in one to two seconds,

253
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:00,264
and it is a big...

254
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,233
one.

255
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:06,374
They are now six minutes apart
and increasing in intensity.

256
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:09,032
We should have the nurse
check your dilation again.

257
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,658
Hi. Big day. Excited
for you both.

258
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,005
Everyone is busy because
of the accident...

259
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,845
Lim is prepping, Andrews
and Park are in surgery...

260
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,216
And I think my
patient is in trouble.

261
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,332
Her latest CT shows her splenic
injury is getting worse.

262
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,978
How's Perez doing?

263
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:26,542
They're just finishing
up his surgery now.

264
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,121
Your patient needs a
splenic artery embolization.

265
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:31,168
How long can she wait? There
are no attendings available.

266
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,192
She cannot wait.

267
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,747
Shaun...

268
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:37,094
you need to do the surgery.

269
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:41,409
I... should be here with
you, to give you ice chips

270
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:44,239
and hold your hand and
talk about the future.

271
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:46,690
Have you been watching movies
about people having babies?

272
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:49,762
I'm fine.

273
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,109
I have hours to go before
the Peanut makes his debut,

274
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:54,456
and how complicated
is this procedure?

275
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,940
It is quite straightforward.

276
00:12:57,183 --> 00:13:00,290
I love you, and I'm so happy
we're starting our family.

277
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:03,258
But there's a little
girl who needs you.

278
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,538
Please, go.

279
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,438
Okay. Prep the O.R.

280
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,997
Do not have this
baby without me!

281
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:34,129
No opioids.

282
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,131
Thank you.

283
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,825
You want the itemized list?

284
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:44,001
Multiple displaced
rib fractures,

285
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,521
contusions on both lungs,
abdominal bleeding,

286
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:50,663
and a fractured pancreas,
which is as painful as it gets.

287
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,945
Danny, you need to let
me give you pain meds,

288
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,533
- real pain meds.
- No.

289
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:01,191
I've already got you on
acetaminophen, lidocaine,

290
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,331
gabapentin, and magnesium.

291
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,574
Your heart rate and
BP are still elevated.

292
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,507
You are at risk for a
heart attack or stroke.

293
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,819
No.

294
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:12,167
I worked way too
hard getting sober.

295
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,344
I can't go back to square one.

296
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,725
You need opioids.

297
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,521
What I need...

298
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:26,181
is to hear you tell me
about our dinner tonight.

299
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:29,495
Please.

300
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,186
Distract me.

301
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,609
The restaurant is
very romantic...

302
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:44,130
Tablecloths and
candles everywhere.

303
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:47,893
And the music isn't so loud that
it drowns out all conversation.

304
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,833
The trial starts Monday.

305
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,428
You'd only be in-patient
for three days,

306
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,837
then weekly check-ins
for six weeks.

307
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:04,081
I suppose I could
hire a dog-sitter.

308
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,704
But Lincoln doesn't
like new people.

309
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,431
Or tall people. Or men.

310
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,882
Can you excuse me
for just one second?

311
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,264
She's the sweetest girl.

312
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,783
She prefers to face
out, be involved.

313
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:18,889
Yeah. Better.

314
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,787
I'm almost done here.

315
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:23,421
I need to push my 2:00 p.m. to 3:00
p.m., my 3:00 p.m. to tomorrow.

316
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:25,758
So, is it three
days and two nights?

317
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,563
Or three days and three nights?

318
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:28,907
Sorry. A little
more head support.

319
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,453
No, not like that.

320
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:34,905
Just...

321
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,320
Here we go. Right there.

322
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:39,151
I need to go.
Lincoln's waiting.

323
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:42,223
No. Wait. Barbara,
it's... It's two nights.

324
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,234
Please go talk to him.

325
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,237
Shouldn't you be in a room
somewhere, having a baby?

326
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,101
Congratulations, by the way.

327
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,551
You two cannot be
in a fight today.

328
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,863
It's not a fight.

329
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:04,417
I know it's a big deal, but
can you please put it aside,

330
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:06,074
at least for today?

331
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:08,042
I got to go to the O.R.

332
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,976
This is probably the most
important day of Shaun's life.

333
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,356
He needs his father.

334
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,775
Oh, my God.

335
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,856
Either my water just broke,

336
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,675
or I just peed all
over your office.

337
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:22,332
Either way, it would be a first.

338
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,966
You have plenty of time.
Here, let me help you.

339
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,922
No, no. I'm married
to Dr. Shaun Murphy.

340
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:28,372
He has walked me
through the steps

341
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,271
of the birthing process
many, many times.

342
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,100
I can take it from here.

343
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,931
Please go talk to him.

344
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,243
I'll call janitorial.

345
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,727
I just...

346
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:45,976
Gail, always a nice surprise,
but you caught me on a busy day.

347
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,392
Well, sadly, I'm about
to make it busier.

348
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:50,567
The board's calling an
emergency meeting for tonight.

349
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,570
Okay, and what is the board
defining as an emergency today?

350
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,159
You, Marcus.

351
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,644
And how you're going to handle
the nurses' push to unionize.

352
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,232
I'm on top of it.

353
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,923
That's the problem.

354
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,310
The splenic artery
embolization went very well.

355
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,140
Your daughter should not
need any more surgeries.

356
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:13,842
She'll need to spend
the next few days

357
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,351
in the hospital until we
can remove her NG tube,

358
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,214
get her back on regular...

359
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:20,769
Honey? Wha...

360
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,739
- What's happening?
- Profoundly hypotensive.

361
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:27,845
-Kenny! Pulse disparity
-between arms.

362
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,813
This is likely an
aortic dissection.

363
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,746
We need to get him
to an O.R., stat.

364
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:37,717
Reasonably happy in this life...

365
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,548
Supremely happy with
You forever in the next.

366
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:42,274
Amen.

367
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:46,554
Danny, your BP's 211
over 130, heart rate 194.

368
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:48,176
You're having a
hypertensive crisis.

369
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,109
You need fentanyl. The
pain is killing you.

370
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:53,250
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

371
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:54,838
I cannot change...

372
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,464
He asked you not to do that.

373
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,442
He's not responding to the
antihypertensive drips.

374
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,709
Right, so up the dose.

375
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,687
He's tachycardic and
hypertensive because of the pain.

376
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:06,781
He's going into shock.

377
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:09,094
- He's not. He's praying.
- He's dying.

378
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:11,372
The courage to change
the things I can...

379
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:14,409
That prayer is what
starts every NA meeting.

380
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:16,308
He is clinging
onto his sobriety.

381
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:17,822
And the wisdom to
know the difference.

382
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,254
And wisdom to know
the difference.

383
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:22,773
He's admitting he
doesn't know what to do.

384
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:23,936
He's asking God to help him.

385
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,662
I'm helping him.
You can leave.

386
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:29,321
Accepting hardship as
a pathway to peace...

387
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,947
Living one day at a time...

388
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,262
Enjoying one moment at a time...

389
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:41,747
Forever in the next. Amen.

390
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,516
Forgive me.

391
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:03,596
Accepting hardship as
a pathway to peace.

392
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:25,676
We need to place the graft

393
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,885
to replace the descending
and thoracic aorta.

394
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,232
We need six more units of blood.

395
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,200
I did a full exam in the E.R.

396
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,511
I mean, the imaging was clear.

397
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:34,927
There were no signs
of dissection.

398
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,308
Trim the distal aorta.

399
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,760
It must have started small
enough to be undetected.

400
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:42,693
His blood pressure
gradually expanded the tear

401
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:43,728
until it ruptured.

402
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,905
Oh.

403
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,597
There's a false lumen.

404
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,908
It extends past the carotid.

405
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:52,461
The graft...

406
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:53,601
won't work.

407
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,366
Well, can you...

408
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,748
Can you have one
of your visions?

409
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:04,473
Come on, Shaun. There
must be something.

410
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:05,992
For his family.

411
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:12,309
He's lost more than
half his blood volume.

412
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:17,314
His brain has been
underperfused for too long.

413
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:23,147
Time of death...

414
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,117
4:36 p.m.

415
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,264
You might have mentioned you
were one of the organizers

416
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:38,507
behind the nurses'
unionization push.

417
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,441
Does it matter?

418
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:43,858
Not to me, but the
board feels differently.

419
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,964
Apparently, our
relationship is why

420
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:49,484
I haven't been coming
down hard on the nurses.

421
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,106
I can personally
attest that you've been

422
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:52,936
a total pain about
it the whole time.

423
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,835
Cute. They're
threatening my job.

424
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,703
I don't want you to
lose your job over us.

425
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,843
I don't want to lose
you over my job.

426
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,510
You know, Shaun and Lea are
having their baby today.

427
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:17,029
Yes, I'm aware.

428
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:18,858
Have you talked to him?

429
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,688
I said, "Congratulations."

430
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:22,355
Well, the alignment
looks much better,

431
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,071
but she could have
horrible stenosis.

432
00:21:25,106 --> 00:21:26,970
Are you planning
on talking to him?

433
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,350
Beyond one word?

434
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:31,388
I'd decompress the C1
with a laminectomy.

435
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:37,566
You know, a crotchety,
old, wise man once told me

436
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:40,846
that hanging onto
my anger was toxic.

437
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,995
I'm not "crotchety."

438
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:43,100
You were right then.

439
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,539
And I'm right now.

440
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:46,990
He publicly humiliated
me yesterday,

441
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,268
as everyone in this room
is quite well aware.

442
00:21:49,302 --> 00:21:51,270
Well, he's having
his baby today.

443
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,344
Pass me two 28-mill
pedicle screws, please.

444
00:21:56,378 --> 00:21:58,656
- I'll take those.
- Right.

445
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:00,175
Old habit.

446
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,119
I saw your family
leave a while ago.

447
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,122
Are they getting a hotel?

448
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,645
You gave me fentanyl.

449
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,959
I did.

450
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:29,653
Was it a hard decision?

451
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,243
Overriding my wishes?

452
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,556
Honestly?

453
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:37,592
No.

454
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,458
You were on the verge
of a heart attack.

455
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:43,943
- Or brain bleed.
- Yeah, but not definitively.

456
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:48,430
I wasn't willing to risk your
life waiting for "definitively."

457
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:51,433
But you were okay sending me
back to certain opiate addiction.

458
00:22:54,782 --> 00:22:55,783
I couldn't...

459
00:22:58,337 --> 00:22:59,994
let you die.

460
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:30,093
I stopped by to offer
my nanny services.

461
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:31,611
But it looks like
you're all set.

462
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,682
I got all three
participants locked in.

463
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:35,788
Trial's starting on time.

464
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:38,032
Now I just need to tell
Andrews that I'm done.

465
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,034
Done?

466
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:42,484
With this job.

467
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:47,662
Look, you've had a long day.

468
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:50,389
But you'll find a
rhythm. And a nanny.

469
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:53,668
I can't do this job
as well as I want

470
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:55,394
and take care of Eden
as well as I need.

471
00:23:57,361 --> 00:24:01,365
I've made the mistake of putting my
career ahead of the people I love before.

472
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,988
I'm not doing it again.

473
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:21,799
The nurses put a chair
next to the table for you,

474
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,594
if you would like to sit.

475
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:38,989
Is it okay to touch him?

476
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,508
Yes.

477
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,165
Just don't remove the sheet.

478
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,221
He was just here.

479
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,198
How am I gonna tell my girls?

480
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:26,485
I don't think I can do
any of this without him.

481
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,148
When my brother Steve died,

482
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,773
I didn't know how
I would survive.

483
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,604
He had always taken care of me.

484
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:47,609
But I did.

485
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,304
Because someone else
came into my life

486
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,306
who took care of
me and loved me.

487
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,313
Now he may be gone, too.

488
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,359
It is very hard to lose people
you thought would never leave.

489
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:17,985
But you will...

490
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:23,714
be okay because
you have no choice.

491
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,133
When we lose people we love,

492
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,516
we have to find a
way to keep going

493
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,518
for the people we still have.

494
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:43,355
Take as much time as you need.

495
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:50,569
I'm going to have a baby now.

496
00:27:06,732 --> 00:27:08,423
Oh, you're back.

497
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,873
How's the little girl?

498
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:13,118
She will be okay.

499
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:14,464
Mm.

500
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:17,674
How far apart are
the contractions?

501
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,331
About two minutes.

502
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,161
Okay.

503
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:24,888
It is time to start pushing.

504
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:26,510
Are you sure?

505
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,167
I don't... I don't
feel anything.

506
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:29,513
That's because of the epidural,

507
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,619
but your prostaglandin
E1 and E2 levels

508
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:32,965
are at peak concentration

509
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,554
for stimulating
myometrial contractility.

510
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,039
It is time.

511
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,420
Oh.

512
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:42,354
I'll gown up and be right back.

513
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:46,358
I will refill your water
bottle and get an extra pillow.

514
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:48,394
Do you want a warm
or cold washcloth?

515
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:51,708
Either is fine, but
I-I need more time.

516
00:27:51,742 --> 00:27:54,023
Delaying delivery can cause
excessive postpartum bleeding,

517
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:55,781
plus an increase in
bacterial infections.

518
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:59,405
I'll get one warm and one cold.

519
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,891
Shaun, wait. Come
here a minute.

520
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,205
I'm scared.

521
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:11,866
Really, really scared.

522
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:14,558
It is...

523
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,560
common for women to be anxious

524
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,011
about the birthing process.

525
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,774
For nine months, my whole
goal was to keep this baby

526
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,744
in my belly, safe and
sound and protected.

527
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,265
And now it feels like
I'm supposed to just

528
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,301
shove my own heart
into the world and...

529
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:37,236
And let it walk around
all exposed and vulnerable

530
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:39,204
and so, so tiny.

531
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:46,728
And I'm not gonna be able
to protect him anymore.

532
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:54,564
It will be okay.

533
00:28:57,843 --> 00:28:58,844
Probably.

534
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:06,127
I am very excited
to meet our son.

535
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:09,924
I'm really excited, too.

536
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:17,345
Okay.

537
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:20,762
Okay, let's... let's do this.

538
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:27,597
Okay.

539
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,982
You're two hours out
of surgery. Lie down.

540
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,914
When can I get back to the home?

541
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:36,640
I need to take your vitals.

542
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:37,779
Ehh.

543
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:41,128
Want us to call your family?

544
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:43,544
I got to call Martha.

545
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:45,477
- Wife? Girlfriend?
- Neither.

546
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:47,306
We take walks every morning

547
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:50,171
with about 20 other old
farts from the home...

548
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,692
All waking up to watch
the damn sunrise.

549
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:56,039
Not your preferred activity?

550
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:58,110
Doc, if God wanted us
to see the sunrise,

551
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:00,699
he would have put it at
a more reasonable hour.

552
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:05,669
You go because Martha's there.

553
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:11,675
I think it's time I told her...

554
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,230
she's the reason I
wake up in the morning.

555
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:20,201
Let's give her a call.

556
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:23,411
Thanks.

557
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,690
You're all right, Doc.

558
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,256
I went through my
patient record.

559
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,948
You made the right call.

560
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:48,057
Thank you.

561
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:50,438
But...

562
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,098
I'm going to need all the
help I can get to recover

563
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,893
without relapsing.

564
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:04,107
I...

565
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:07,800
need to go back to
Texas with my family.

566
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:14,669
I knew when I gave
you the drugs,

567
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:15,705
I might lose you.

568
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:19,950
And it wasn't a hard decision?

569
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:21,711
The decision was easy.

570
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,094
The aftermath is...

571
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,347
Well, I'm not going anywhere
until we have our date.

572
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:37,382
Are you free tonight?

573
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:46,080
The levator ani muscle is
undergoing a stretch ratio

574
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:48,945
of 3.26, which is normal.

575
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:51,327
Shaun, I need you up
here, not down there.

576
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,399
Why isn't he coming out?

577
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,135
The little guy is just
progressing slowly.

578
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,516
I think we need a
vacuum assist to help...

579
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,231
You want to vacuum
my baby out of me?

580
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,312
It is standard protocol

581
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,234
if a baby is stalled
in the birth canal.

582
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:03,970
I covered this in the
e-mail about instrum...

583
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:05,720
There were a lot
of e-mails, Shaun.

584
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,412
Okay.

585
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,000
Is it safe for the baby?

586
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:12,175
Mm.

587
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,452
Will he have a cone-head?

588
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,525
Only for approximately 48 hours.

589
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:20,425
Okay, mama. You ready?

590
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:21,667
Mm-hmm.

591
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,327
I am here for you.

592
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,157
You can squeeze my hand.

593
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:45,559
You're doing great.
He's almost here.

594
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:53,912
Oh!

595
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,295
Congratulations, Mom and Dad.

596
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:04,543
Ooh.

597
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:07,719
Oh, I can't believe you're
finally here, Peanut.

598
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:11,826
He doesn't look like
an alien at all.

599
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:17,038
His... head has a
very nice shape.

600
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:19,248
Yeah.

601
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:20,663
He is beautiful.

602
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,358
Dr. Murphy, would you
like to do the honors?

603
00:33:26,393 --> 00:33:28,671
Yes.

604
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,431
I would very much
like to do that.

605
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:36,989
Hi.

606
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,136
Look at what we made.

607
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,348
Hello.

608
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:52,591
It is very nice to meet you.

609
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:55,801
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

610
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,152
I'm your dad.

611
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,268
You think anybody would notice
if we took this home with us?

612
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,614
I think you should leave it.

613
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,652
I wasn't really
going to take it.

614
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:20,688
Oh, sure you were.

615
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,828
But...

616
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:24,278
I don't think you should resign.

617
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:28,369
Because you don't have
to do it all alone.

618
00:34:33,424 --> 00:34:35,462
You're the reason I
wake up in the morning.

619
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,982
So, whatever there
is to figure out,

620
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:42,745
all I want in the world is
for us to do it as a family.

621
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:56,621
I love you, too.

622
00:34:59,002 --> 00:35:00,314
She has a dirty diaper.

623
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,765
And I have 30 lab
reports to review.

624
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,575
Thank you...

625
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,129
for saving my life.

626
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,063
You're very welcome.

627
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:29,067
I-I, um... I didn't mean today.

628
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:34,693
I meant when you made looking
for a foot in a lake fun.

629
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:39,388
When you sat next to
me in church, quietly,

630
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,113
knowing that was
exactly what I needed.

631
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:46,429
And, uh, when you trusted me...

632
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:50,295
even though I'm pretty
sure I didn't deserve it.

633
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,920
And, of course, today.

634
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,892
You make me believe
that I can do this.

635
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:11,143
You will be okay.

636
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,602
I'm gonna miss you.

637
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,654
Thank you.

638
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:43,452
I love a sunset
as much as anyone,

639
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:46,420
but isn't this a little
sentiment over science?

640
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,974
There's a case study
out of Alabama...

641
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:51,356
Internal decapitation.

642
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,669
They took the patient
out every night...

643
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:56,706
Sunset, beautiful
sky, and fresh air

644
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:58,639
to help stimulate the brain.

645
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,712
How long before
they got a response?

646
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:05,577
A couple days, but it worked.

647
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:09,201
Hey, how can you argue with a
thing called "Operation Sunset"?

648
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:15,829
Your family is coming.

649
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:20,143
I know they'd love to see
you smile, or even a blink.

650
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:23,975
Or you could just flip us off

651
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,929
because you're cold and
you're afraid of heights.

652
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,292
You've got your
methods, I've got mine.

653
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,364
Whatever works.

654
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,403
Shaun and Lea had their baby.

655
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,925
Do you want to go meet him?

656
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:46,722
I think I'll stay
here. Thank you.

657
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:55,696
I know that losing
surgery is devastating.

658
00:37:57,077 --> 00:38:00,287
