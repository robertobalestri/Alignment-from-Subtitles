The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,840
Dalisay! I know I
didn't show you enough respect,

3
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:10,343
and I didn't make enough effort to
see things from your point of view,

4
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:11,745
but I want to change.

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,279
How about dinner?

6
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,381
You pick me up at
7:30, Saturday.

7
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,316
We can try that Filipino place.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,054
I think maybe you and I
could be gifts to each other.

9
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,756
And we should be open to that.

10
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:24,701
I have no idea what it looks
like for us to move forward.

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,125
We'll figure it out.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,170
It's a perfect practice run
for when your own comes along.

13
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,832
I'm going off my IVF meds.
I'm not doing another cycle.

14
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,768
<i>Eden, she's what I've been
waiting for. She's my daughter.</i>

15
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:37,236
I thought it was Dr. Glassman's
cancer returning,

16
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,941
but it is damage to Dr. Glassman's
brain as a result of a mini-stroke.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,745
It is permanent.

18
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,891
He shouldn't be doing
surgery anymore.

19
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,148
Ah.

20
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,264
Two weeks to Peanut Day!

21
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,547
Yes.

22
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:55,048
So you're making
lasagna for breakfast?

23
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:56,890
It's going in the freezer.

24
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,257
I've packed my hospital bag,

25
00:00:58,285 --> 00:00:59,506
written my Birth Plan,

26
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:01,302
and soon all I'll
have on my list

27
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,764
is to do my nails and relax.

28
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,533
73% of births happen
before the due date,

29
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:09,168
so you need to start
relaxing immediately.

30
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:12,046
'Cause if there's one thing
you can cram, it's relaxation.

31
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,305
Yes.

32
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,886
Have you heard
anything from Glassy?

33
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,114
Hmm. Oh. No.

34
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,783
He might be mad
when he finds out

35
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:24,818
you went to Lim with
his brain scans.

36
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,953
It was very important
for his future,

37
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:29,221
both medically and
professionally.

38
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:30,755
Well, it's not just
the information.

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,566
It's the whole
behind-his-back thing.

40
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:35,327
He wouldn't listen to
me, so I had no choice.

41
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,942
I think you did the
right thing, but...

42
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,257
just talk to him?

43
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,587
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,234
I've had a stroke.

45
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:59,560
Yes. A small one.

46
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,609
- I should probably give you some time.
- Yeah, you should.

47
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:15,702
He, uh, hit the brakes
instead of the gas

48
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,704
and thumped his head
on the steering wheel.

49
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,314
I'm a shoo-in for the Dumbest
Patient of the Day.

50
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,817
Oh, it's too early
to hand that out.

51
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,119
You want to hear
about a dumb patient?

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,662
Doctor says to her he's
waiting for her X-ray.

53
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,824
She says, "Well, that's weird. I
never dated anybody named Ray."

54
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,051
A little too early
for that, too.

55
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,527
The laceration's
superficial.

56
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,863
Couple stitches, and
you're good to go.

57
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,588
- Yay!
- You sure?

58
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,776
He hit his head pretty hard.
Maybe you should run some tests?

59
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,736
There's no sign of fracture,

60
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,658
closed head injury,
or brain bleed.

61
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,096
Dr. Murphy?

62
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,155
It's not about the accident.

63
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,348
He's been behaving very strangely
for the last six months.

64
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:59,278
Oh. He's alert, responsive,
engaging socially...

65
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,305
Which is nothing like him.

66
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,969
His whole life, he's
been... terrible.

67
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:07,504
Constantly fired, been
through four divorces,

68
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:09,831
estranged from all of
his kids, except me.

69
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,704
He was always just... a dick.

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,426
Then he changed.

71
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:18,206
Now he's telling dad
jokes, asks about my day.

72
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,844
He gave me a birthday present.

73
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,403
He is a different person.

74
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:27,931
This does not sound to
me like a medical issue.

75
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:32,376
But I will order a brain MRI because it
would be very interesting if it were!

76
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,262
Are you mad at me

77
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:50,563
for going to Dr. Lim

78
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:51,930
with your brain scan?

79
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,352
Yeah, a little bit.

80
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,915
But maybe you saved
my life, so...

81
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,106
I didn't think you were,

82
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,280
but Lea said you might be,

83
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,416
so we were both right.

84
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,953
What are you going to do?

85
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,095
About your job?

86
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,414
I don't know, Shaun.

87
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,852
I just found out I had a stroke.

88
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,768
I-I'm still reeling
a little bit.

89
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,489
Maybe when I decide,

90
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,133
I'll let you know.

91
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,995
Okay.

92
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,136
I hear it beating!

93
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,705
Wow. Dr. Wolke has a heart?

94
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,707
I wasn't sure
myself, to be honest.

95
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,508
I have one, too.

96
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,846
Now, that, we all knew.

97
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,398
Hey, Nico.

98
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,982
The doctors are
gonna take Olivia

99
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,986
to get some ice cream and
you to get some tests.

100
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,729
Followed, of course,
by some ice cream.

101
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,157
- Thanks, Dr. Marcus.
- Yeah.

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,961
Get some ice cream.

103
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:05,097
Nico's sarcoma has invaded his
thigh and hip, here and here.

104
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,374
But luckily, there's
no signs of metastasis,

105
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,637
which means we can
debulk the tumor.

106
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,413
How much time would
that give him?

107
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,846
Nine months, maybe even a year.

108
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,393
We could take him to Salzburg.

109
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,857
With Nico's illness
and all his surgeries,

110
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,700
he's never really had
a great Christmas.

111
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,995
He found this photo of the Salzburg
Christmas Market in Austria.

112
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,881
He talks about it all the time.

113
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,560
This surgery could
just get us there.

114
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,069
Not "just."

115
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,259
Th-There's always
medical advances.

116
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,116
We have to be realistic, Seb.

117
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,097
And you have to keep
a positive attitude.

118
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,298
This is good news.

119
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,382
Some final pre-op testing,

120
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:51,186
and Nico can have
his surgery tomorrow.

121
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,865
Come on.
Be reasonable, please.

122
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,693
You've been fed,
changed, swaddled.

123
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,095
I have walked. I have rocked.

124
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,530
I have bounced.

125
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,452
I've worn you on my front,
on my back, on my hip.

126
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,904
Shh.

127
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:13,239
Please, Eden. You
have to go to sleep.

128
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,108
Shh.

129
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:18,331
Be reasonable, please. Shh.

130
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,599
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

131
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,697
So... you gonna tell me or not?

132
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,700
- Hmm?
- Where are we going tomorrow?

133
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,170
Oh, it's a surprise.

134
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,296
Hmm.

135
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,828
As in, you have no idea.

136
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,341
It's been
harder than I thought.

137
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,309
All right? A movie's
too predictable,

138
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,581
an escape room is too dorky,

139
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:11,082
and, well, dinner
at my place is out.

140
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,808
I'll pick something.

141
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,478
No, see, I don't want
you to deal with this.

142
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,103
It's supposed to be fun, Danny,

143
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,523
which it will be, once we
get over this first hump.

144
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,383
So let me do it, okay?

145
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,709
And, yes, I said "hump,"

146
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,985
which I regret saying
for multiple reasons.

147
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,898
His daughter was right.

148
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,403
I will take ace inhibitors,
aspirin, statins

149
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,297
to help reduce the
likelihood of future stroke

150
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:45,923
to near absolute zero.

151
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,276
I will reduce my
workload by 25%.

152
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,403
Any operation over six hours,

153
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,571
I will have a backup in the OR.

154
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,823
I will even eat more broccoli.

155
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,244
I'm not really
comfortable with you

156
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,829
doing any surgery right now,

157
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,322
not until we've determined

158
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,551
the full extent of any
potential impairment.

159
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,119
Do I look impaired to you?

160
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:08,413
No, but I think we
should run a few tests.

161
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:12,934
Do you see any evidence at
all that my work has suffered?

162
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,644
You are a brain surgeon.

163
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,405
The margin of acceptable
error is miniscule.

164
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,400
I have a pretty good idea
of how precise I need to be.

165
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:21,844
I'm not comfortable
with subjecting

166
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,508
any patient to that risk.

167
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,353
Most of the patients
that I take on,

168
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,022
other surgeons won't even touch.

169
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:34,953
Without me, the likelihood
that they will die is 100%.

170
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,727
I am not questioning your value.

171
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,355
I'm just asking that you wait

172
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,508
until there is no doubt.

173
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,358
There's no such
thing as "no doubt."

174
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,800
Aaron, I...

175
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,198
I cannot have you
operating right now.

176
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,955
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,274
Then you will have to fire me.

178
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,444
And I will sue you.

179
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,787
You know, I'm
thinking of cooking up

180
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:18,508
a batch of the world-famous
Poulet a la Andrews tonight.

181
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:19,533
I'm in.

182
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,659
Hmm.

183
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,798
But I want to give you
a courtesy heads up.

184
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:27,200
The nurses are gonna send out

185
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,328
an official e-mail about
a unionization drive.

186
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,421
I just increased
the nursing budget.

187
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,648
More than a year ago.

188
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,942
And it mostly went to
temps or traveling nurses.

189
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,250
Not mostly. I can
show you the numbers.

190
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,788
Point is, we're underpaid,
underappreciated.

191
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,557
A union could protect us.

192
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,017
Sorry to interrupt. Got
Nico's pre-op testing back.

193
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,249
His chemo hit his
bone marrow hard.

194
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,368
Platelets only 22k?

195
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,001
He can't have the surgery.

196
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,670
You have a large malignant
hemangiopericytoma

197
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,738
compressing your frontal lobes.

198
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,170
- Malignant?
- Yes.

199
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,691
But it's operable.

200
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:11,417
Which is good, because
if left untreated,

201
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,147
this would likely kill
you within a year.

202
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,150
- Okay.
- You were right.

203
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,886
The tumor is probably why
your father stopped being

204
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,088
"a dick" a few months ago.

205
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,225
Sorry, Dad.

206
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,995
It's all right.

207
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,568
I knew our relationship
had improved.

208
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:33,492
I just didn't know it
was because of <i>this.</i>

209
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,479
So, if you remove it, could
that change my personality back?

210
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,081
Most likely.

211
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,618
Thank you, Doctor. I'm
gonna pass on the surgery.

212
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:58,793
If you want to bench
our top surgeon,

213
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:01,404
you're gonna need more than
one indeterminate scan.

214
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,541
Are you worried about losing our
top surgeon or our top earner?

215
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,966
Why does everyone think wanting
to keep this hospital solvent

216
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,711
is something to be
embarrassed about?

217
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,815
You want to open up the
door to another takeover?

218
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,783
I just want to be
clear about our agenda.

219
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,609
Well, then, let me clarify.

220
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,544
Yes, I'm worried about
losing our top earner,

221
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,780
but I'm more worried
about Theo Singh,

222
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,349
the 27-year-old newlywed with
the pilocytic astrocytoma.

223
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,451
We can refer him to
Dr. Cachoa at General.

224
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,587
Theo's tumor is
compressing his brain stem.

225
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,355
Cachoa probably
won't even take him.

226
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:30,261
I can deal with that. And
you're doing it again.

227
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:33,456
My department, my call.

228
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,281
Once litigation is threatened,
it becomes <i>my</i> call.

229
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,089
Glassman refused
cognitive testing,

230
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,616
and until I have
more information,

231
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:43,324
I'm not letting him into the OR.

232
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:48,104
So he does all of his
surgeries as planned,

233
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:49,854
but with a backstop.

234
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,322
You assign another surgeon
on all of his cases

235
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:53,623
and not just the OR.

236
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,000
And he'll be happy with that?

237
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,432
It's a compromise.

238
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:58,236
Nobody's ever completely happy.

239
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,163
- I know I'm not.
- Neither am I.

240
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,812
The hallmark of a
successful negotiation.

241
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,072
I forgot you were coming.

242
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:13,076
That's odd, given how you read
my text ten minutes ago, but...

243
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:16,145
Beautiful, healthy baby.
Beautiful and healthy mom.

244
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:19,541
So it looks like
things are going great.

245
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:21,028
Definitely.

246
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,486
Is she eating well?

247
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,647
- Like a horse. Shh, shh.
- Nice.

248
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,409
- Sleeping?
- Like a baby.

249
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:32,595
I underestimated diaper demand,
but everything else is...

250
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,797
perfect.

251
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,457
Shh. It's okay.

252
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,060
When Kellan was fussy,
we'd put his car seat

253
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,613
on top of the washing machine.

254
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:42,907
The vibrations
knocked him right out.

255
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,275
Well, this isn't like her.

256
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,697
Okay. Shh.

257
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,340
You mind?

258
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,509
Ah. All right.

259
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:58,597
Oh, I've missed this.

260
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,884
What?

261
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,064
See? Like a baby.

262
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:09,103
What?

263
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,696
My patient is refusing
the hemangiopericytoma

264
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,373
resection surgery that
will save his life.

265
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,433
I want you to talk him into it.

266
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,778
That's not how
this works, Shaun.

267
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:21,904
It should be.

268
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,634
You are more
persuasive than I am.

269
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,151
Ask Glassman.

270
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:30,386
He's removed more anterior fossa
tumors than anyone on the West Coast.

271
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,057
But Dr. Glassman should not
be doing any surgery until...

272
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,993
I agree, but I was overruled.

273
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:38,601
If you want someone to
change your patient's mind,

274
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,987
Glassman's your best shot.

275
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,186
You <i>are</i> persuasive.

276
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:52,101
Nico's body isn't making the blood
cells and platelets he needs.

277
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,269
There's, uh... There's got to
be a way to get his counts up.

278
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:56,927
With Nico so sick...

279
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,438
it may be time to
consider palliative care.

280
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:05,279
- No.
- Let's hear the doctor out.

281
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,715
No, I'm not giving up on
him. Neither should you.

282
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,423
And neither should they.

283
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,395
Nico's been
through so much.

284
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,308
You think I don't know that?

285
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,333
I'm trying to save his life.

286
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,074
Dr. Park will pull
the team together

287
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:26,913
and see if there's a solution
that works for everyone.

288
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,239
Thank you.

289
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,710
So much.

290
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:37,121
He doesn't want
his tumor removed,

291
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,922
so I don't know what
there is to discuss.

292
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:41,249
Given the tumor's impact
on his frontal lobes,

293
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,351
he might not be competent
to make that decision.

294
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,687
And you don't think I'm
competent to be a doctor, so...

295
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,422
Oh, no. Just to
be a neurosurgeon.

296
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,625
The surgery should give
Kurt about 20 more years.

297
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:54,129
Let's recap, 20 more
years as a bad father

298
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:56,597
versus one year
as a good father.

299
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,533
There is no medical
justification...

300
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:00,011
Yes, there is,
Shaun. Yes, there is.

301
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:02,913
There's an emotional one!
There's an emotional issue!

302
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:06,340
Your voice is getting louder, and
your face is flushed. Are you upset?

303
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,952
You should have come
to me with the scan.

304
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,163
You don't go to Lim. You
don't show it to Lim.

305
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:12,689
You said you were only
a <i>little</i> mad at me.

306
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,092
Y-You ratted me out to
the head of the department

307
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:17,485
when I specifically
asked you not to do that!

308
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,654
Yes, I did that because
you did not believe me...

309
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,023
Well, then, you come to me!

310
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:23,859
You try to convince me.
Again and again and again!

311
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,660
Don't you think you owe me that?

312
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:28,151
That's four times. I tried
a lot more than that.

313
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,842
What do you want from me?

314
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,715
You want me to go with you to see
if he's competent? Is that it?

315
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,412
Okay. Fine. Let's go.

316
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,214
Hey.

317
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,625
Did Dr. Park find anything?

318
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:49,818
Not yet.

319
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,955
I just wanted to see
how you guys are doing.

320
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,789
Seb's with the kids.

321
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:58,020
I, um, needed a little break.

322
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,783
Seb and I used to talk
about how every day was a...

323
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,497
A beautiful day.

324
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,253
I remember.

325
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,753
Do you understand
what will happen

326
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,530
if you don't have the operation?

327
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:30,400
Yes. I'll be dead
within a year.

328
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:33,162
And why is that
preferable to surgery?

329
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,073
Hailey was right about me.

330
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:40,018
I was a terrible person,
a terrible father.

331
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,869
Never played with her.
I hardly talked to her.

332
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:44,870
I can't even remember
holding her hand.

333
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,155
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

334
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,648
I was five, terrified
of the flying monkeys,

335
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,391
but when I reached
for your hand...

336
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,017
I pulled it away.

337
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,298
I never tried to again.

338
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,709
I don't want to go back.

339
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,819
I don't want to lose this.

340
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,120
I don't want to lose <i>you.</i>

341
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,193
The brain is a funny thing.

342
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:25,064
It wants to do the things
that makes it feel good,

343
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,290
get that dopamine hit.

344
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:29,885
In fact, it actually
can reshape itself

345
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:33,856
as it continues to try to
experience those good feelings.

346
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:37,049
So you're saying I m-might...

347
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,962
be able to stay this way?

348
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:43,798
Maybe.

349
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:48,003
You work hard to be the best version
of the person you want to be.

350
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:49,720
I've had that fight.

351
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:53,722
You should listen
to Dr. Glassman.

352
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,879
And he has removed more
anterior fossa tumors

353
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,380
than anyone on the West Coast.

354
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,751
Hey, I have faith in you, Dad.

355
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,178
You can do the work. You
could stay a good man.

356
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,511
Whew.

357
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:14,753
Well, uh, like the patient said,

358
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:16,340
"I didn't want brain surgery,

359
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,621
but the doctor
changed my mind."

360
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,002
That... was a dad joke?

361
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,634
And a "yes."

362
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,354
If <i>you</i> do the surgery.

363
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:33,281
I've heard that you, uh, know
your way around a fossa tumor.

364
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:37,366
As you wish.

365
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,972
- So, what are we doing here?
- You don't remember?

366
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,803
A bicoronal
subfrontal craniotomy.

367
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:55,488
- And?
- Possible orbital osteotomies.

368
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,393
Drill.

369
00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:00,510
We would place a
lumbar drain first.

370
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:03,846
Before incision, yes. I thought
I'd focus on the surgery.

371
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:07,651
Be careful of the
sutura coronalis.

372
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:09,453
Why? Does the patient
have one of those?

373
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,655
All higher primates do.
If you don't remember...

374
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:14,399
That was a joke. In the
OR, we call that a joke.

375
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,424
Hmm.

376
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:18,828
Popping the top.

377
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:28,991
- And let's get under the lobes.
- Wait.

378
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:31,375
That is not the
next step. It's...

379
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,570
Assessing and ligating
the anterior third.

380
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:37,214
I thought I'd do that
after I get a better view.

381
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:39,348
That...

382
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:42,394
is an acceptable option.

383
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,558
Wonderful.

384
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:46,723
But you must remember to...

385
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:48,601
Shaun, no more talking while
I'm doing this procedure.

386
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,135
This is my patient, so
I should be able to...

387
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,371
Shaun, I'm asking you to leave.

388
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:52,614
I will be quiet,
but if another...

389
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,370
One of us is going
to leave, Shaun.

390
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,843
It's not gonna be the
one doing the surgery.

391
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,875
Let's get after it.

392
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:13,443
We'd start with
blood transfusions,

393
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,977
plus a cocktail of
five medications

394
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:16,795
to ramp up production
of blood cells.

395
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,855
That should get Nico
through the operation.

396
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,268
A few weeks later,
we'd follow up

397
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,213
with a stem-cell
transplantation from one of you.

398
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,309
What could the side effects be?

399
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,615
Elevated risk of infection
and bleeds from the surgery

400
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,309
and possible toxicity
from drug interactions.

401
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,421
You know the alternative.

402
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,862
He'd be gone in
just a few months.

403
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:42,158
If you were in our
place, what would you do?

404
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:48,994
I'd do the surgery.

405
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,659
- Okay.
- Thank you.

406
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,261
Thank you.

407
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,898
We'll prep Nico for surgery.

408
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:05,774
Okay.

409
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:09,573
If this works, it'll
be a real win-win

410
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:12,301
because one day I do
plan to do laundry again.

411
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:31,261
All right, Eden.

412
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:34,289
I'm just gonna sit
down for one sec.

413
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:47,543
No! No.

414
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:54,115
That'll stay just between us.

415
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:04,813
I want Shaun off the case.

416
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:07,162
It's his patient.

417
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,574
I don't want to crack
a man's skull open

418
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:09,966
while standing next to someone

419
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:11,836
who's waiting for
me to screw up.

420
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,762
I want a team I can trust
100% and who will trust me.

421
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:20,058
- Shaun's off the case.
- Thank you.

422
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,500
And <i>I'll</i> be assisting.

423
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,260
Welcome aboard.

424
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,265
This is nice.

425
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:46,913
Are you talking
about the chicken?

426
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:49,030
Not exclusively.

427
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:55,881
I just hope it doesn't get
messed up by things at work.

428
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,753
The unionization drive.

429
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:05,254
What if I could
squeeze the board?

430
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:08,984
Get them to sign off on some
real and meaningful improvements.

431
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:10,583
You might not even need a union.

432
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,831
Those would have to be some
pretty big concessions.

433
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:16,638
Okay.

434
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:21,484
How about a 5% raise,

435
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:25,181
1-to-4 cap on
nurse-to-patient ratios.

436
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:28,260
Might even be able to get a Chief
Nursing Officer on the board.

437
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:32,698
That's pretty interesting.

438
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,575
I have no idea if anyone
else would go for it.

439
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:41,416
Any chance you could find out?

440
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:45,064
Well, there's a big
difference how hard I can push

441
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,315
for a proposal that might
work versus one that will.

442
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:51,804
I could float it
to a couple people.

443
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:53,441
Yeah?

444
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:54,603
Yeah.

445
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:58,661
Dessert?

446
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:00,071
Yes.

447
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,200
As soon as the surgery's
over, the case is yours again.

448
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:12,389
I will watch from the gallery.

449
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:14,683
No need. I'll have a much
better view from the floor.

450
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:18,043
The video feed on the
monitors is excellent.

451
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,294
And it couldn't hurt
to have more backup.

452
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:23,148
Actually, it could, Shaun.

453
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:26,381
I was wrong, sending
you to Glassman.

454
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,273
He's pretty upset right
now, and if you push it,

455
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:31,817
it could really hurt
your relationship.

456
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:34,944
But if a doctor is
making mistakes...

457
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,855
You don't have to be
the one to catch them,

458
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,451
not when others can.

459
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:42,344
Not when the doctor is your dad.

460
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:50,735
There we go. There we go.

461
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,931
Come on. I have a few left.

462
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:01,646
It's okay. Don't worry.

463
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:03,148
Okay.

464
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,575
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No!

465
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,489
I knew I was running
out! I knew it.

466
00:25:08,513 --> 00:25:11,145
What kind of mom
runs out of diapers?

467
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,206
Morgan?

468
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:21,506
Eden, if you're
alone, open the door!

469
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,798
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

470
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,368
I'm failing at everything.

471
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:46,457
You know, when Kellan
was three months,

472
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:49,340
Mia had to go out of town.

473
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:54,035
It was my first time alone
with him, and he was teething.

474
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,550
It was 4:00 in the morning,
and neither of us had slept.

475
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:59,044
And suddenly...

476
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,705
Hmm.

477
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,993
I knew exactly how
to fix everything.

478
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:08,258
One, or both, of us was
going out that window.

479
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:13,896
No one went out the window.

480
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,248
We both fell asleep.

481
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,757
Of the many times I've
heard about your failures,

482
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,384
none has ever made me happier.

483
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:25,568
You're not failing. You're
just, uh... muddling through.

484
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,901
I am <i>not</i> a muddler.

485
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:29,613
Mm. Every parent is.

486
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:33,385
Key is to not lose your
mind while you're muddling.

487
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,300
What?

488
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:41,315
I've freed
up the lateral aspect.

489
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,540
Cauterizing.

490
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:46,596
We're ready to
take out the tumor.

491
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,752
Dr. Kalu, you want the honor?

492
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,442
Thank you, Doctor.

493
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,912
There's mets all over his liver.

494
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:06,857
Can we resect the
most involved segments?

495
00:27:06,882 --> 00:27:08,742
It's too widespread.

496
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:12,412
So... what do we do?

497
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:18,263
We close him up and
tell the family.

498
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:32,326
Start the timer.

499
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:45,906
Place the lumbar drain, please.

500
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:57,217
Hey.

501
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:00,220
- Tough day?
- Yeah, it was.

502
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:03,134
When I was arguing with the board
and fighting with Lim and...

503
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,975
I just found out I got
to tell a kid's parents

504
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,191
that a surgery I
recommended failed

505
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:13,353
and their boy has a
month to live. So...

506
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:15,420
that tipped it a
bit beyond "tough."

507
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:18,914
I'll come back later.

508
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:20,600
No. Look. I'm sorry. I'm okay.

509
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:22,843
What's up?

510
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,881
- This may not be the time.
- No. It's fine.

511
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,997
I floated your idea
to a few nurses.

512
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,864
They don't trust perks that
can be taken away at will.

513
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,875
They want a union. I'm sorry.

514
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,061
Which nurses?

515
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,243
- Their names?
- Yeah.

516
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,233
You're asking me to
inform on my co-workers?

517
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,803
I just need to know
how serious this is.

518
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,111
Are we talking
influential people

519
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,398
or some disgruntled part-timers?

520
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:11,459
<i>No!</i>

521
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,951
<i>You need to use a
Penfield dissector</i>

522
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:14,611
<i>to avoid lacerating
the sagittal sinus.</i>

523
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:18,773
- Dr. Murphy!
- I'm using the blunt end of the drill bit instead.

524
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,691
<i>Okay. Carry on.</i>

525
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:27,416
Well, thank you. Speak again,
Dr. Murphy, and I'll have you removed.

526
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,950
I heard you were here,
and I said, "Impossible,

527
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,318
because Lea and I talked about

528
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:41,788
how this is her very
precious and finite me-time."

529
00:29:41,922 --> 00:29:43,522
Tonight's the big date
with Perez, right?

530
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:44,767
- Mm-hmm.
- What are you gonna do?

531
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,126
I have no idea.

532
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,961
I thought of this Italian place,

533
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:50,294
but then I remembered they
have house wine on the tables

534
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,332
and figured that might
trigger a relapse.

535
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:55,536
And then I thought of indoor
skydiving, but what if he gets hurt?

536
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,338
- So I...
- You're really overthinking this.

537
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,641
I thought maybe he
wasn't ready to date,

538
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:03,043
but now I'm thinking I'm not.

539
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,213
Maybe you're not, but you're
really gonna regret it

540
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,649
if you don't give it a shot.

541
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:11,213
Take him to the Batumi
Grill, order the khachapuri.

542
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:13,787
Now my Slanket is waiting.

543
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:18,512
Khachapuri. Okay.

544
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:21,538
- You're giving up?
- That's not what we...

545
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:23,472
You can't do this to us, to him.

546
00:30:23,497 --> 00:30:24,895
I'm so sorry, Sebastian.

547
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,488
You can't promise that you have a
cure for my boy and then abandon us.

548
00:30:27,512 --> 00:30:29,828
- There's nothing we can do.
- So find another surgery.

549
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,549
We need to focus on improving the
quality of the time Nico has left.

550
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:35,343
Do not tell me where
to focus. He's my son.

551
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:37,911
I don't... I don't... I
don't want quality time.

552
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,379
- All I want is my boy.
- Seb.

553
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,988
- I'm talking to him.
- You're being selfish.

554
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:46,901
Forcing any more operations
will only cause Nico more pain,

555
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:49,329
and you and Talia and Olivia

556
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,059
will have terrible
memories of his last days.

557
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,918
I don't care about memories.

558
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,064
You should.

559
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,499
Because soon they
are all you'll have.

560
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,004
Hey.

561
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,802
You wouldn't let
me give up before.

562
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:08,335
And you were right.

563
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:14,038
But now it's time.

564
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,616
Dads are supposed to
fight for their kids.

565
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:30,047
So you fight...

566
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:34,505
to give your son as many
beautiful days as you can.

567
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,218
You need a rest?

568
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:17,188
No. Just stretching.

569
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:21,581
Okay.

570
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:26,972
And there is our houseguest.

571
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:33,006
Having overstayed his welcome.

572
00:32:35,516 --> 00:32:38,560
- There's a lot of bleeding.
- Vascular clips.

573
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:41,170
Must be a tear
in the anterior cerebrals.

574
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:44,231
No, it's
from the dural feeders.

575
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:46,235
Hmm. As expected.

576
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,212
- And there we are.
- Hmm.

577
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,304
Oh, the
bleeding's stopped.

578
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,203
Nice.

579
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,932
<i>No!</i>

580
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:16,042
<i>Dr. Glassman, please tell
us what the next step is.</i>

581
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:17,202
<i>You hesitated.</i>

582
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:19,163
<i>You need to say what
comes next in the surgery.</i>

583
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:21,742
Somebody please call security.
Shaun, you are out of line.

584
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,211
Answer.

585
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:26,989
Please.

586
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:45,122
It's, um...

587
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,366
We need to
decompress the optic nerve.

588
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,732
Rhoton dissectors.

589
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:29,217
Hey.

590
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:34,635
The patient's in recovery.

591
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:41,146
Your surgical plan was flawless.

592
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,544
Alison Borden.

593
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:52,552
34-year-old mother of two.

594
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:54,513
My first solo surgery.

595
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:59,242
Frontal AVM. It was
a walk in the park.

596
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:01,216
I was pumped. I was flying.

597
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:07,896
And then... her
feeding artery tore...

598
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,916
and I couldn't
stop the bleeding.

599
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:16,123
Bipolaring, clipping, suturing.

600
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,693
We thought we were
gonna lose her.

601
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:24,869
And I couldn't get this
image out of my mind

602
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:28,638
of her kids coming
home from school

603
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:33,718
and seeing their father just
sitting there, you know?

604
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:43,873
Finally, I stuck a neuro-patty
on a muscle patch graft.

605
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:45,761
That did it. It held.

606
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:50,280
And when I walked
out of that OR,

607
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:53,379
I thought, "I am never
going back in there again."

608
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:01,184
Then I saw Alison in recovery.

609
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,847
Husband, kids. All smiles.

610
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,871
She gave me a big hug.

611
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:11,994
Despite my raging ego...

612
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:15,868
I've tried... I've always tried

613
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,790
to make it about the patients.

614
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:23,260
To do what's best for them.

615
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:33,611
I never thought that would
mean putting <i>down</i> my knife.

616
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,186
The surgery
went very well.

617
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,985
We were able to completely
remove your tumor.

618
00:36:57,406 --> 00:37:00,224
Hey. Dad. How are you feeling?

619
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,184
Well, my head kind of hurts.

620
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,075
I bet.

621
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:22,385
I gave you that locket.

622
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,407
Yeah.

623
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,390
For my last birthday.

624
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:30,068
Yeah.

625
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,543
Yeah, that seems
like a long time ago.

- Thank you.

642
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:03,586
So, where we heading?

643
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,698
It's a Georgian place. Lea
swears by their khachapuri.

644
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:07,927
Oh, that sounds amazing.

645
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,166
I have no idea what that is.

646
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:12,756
I had to look it up.
It's cheese bread.

647
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:14,272
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

648
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:52,158
Sorry about earlier.

649
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,921
Not your finest moment.

650
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:57,740
This, on the other hand...

651
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,057
Amazing.

652
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:06,415
Wow.

653
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:10,328
Hey. Do you think maybe...

654
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:12,772
We can do dinner another night.

655
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,168
I like the suit.

656
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:30,330
Oh! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

657
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:33,902
No, like, I <i>really</i>
like the suit.

658
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:36,787
Maybe it could, uh,
come home tonight?

659
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:39,457
Ho, ho... ho.

660
00:40:55,097 --> 00:40:56,859
It's a beautiful day.

661
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:05,556
Kurt and Hailey held hands.

662
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:11,247
It must be hard to accept
you are compromised,

663
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:12,620
but you did not hurt a patient,

664
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:14,458
so now you understand
why I did it,

665
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:15,985
and you can't be mad at me.

666
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,703
You didn't have to
do it that way, okay?

667
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,205
You were right. You didn't
have to do it that way.

668
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,301
- But if I was right, then...
- You humiliated me in public.

669
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:28,397
In my operating room, in
front of my colleagues.

670
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:31,973
Do you have any idea how much
that hurt, coming from you?

671
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,863
I don't know what to do.

672
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,620
You could just leave me alone.

673
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:54,578
Hello? Lea?

674
00:41:54,603 --> 00:41:56,272
The Peanut's coming early.

675
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:03,474
The Peanut is coming!
