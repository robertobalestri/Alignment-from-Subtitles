1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,413
Previously on
<i>The Good Doctor...</i>

2
00:00:01,437 --> 00:00:02,971
You go going to
the club or work?

3
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:04,916
Yeah, these early calls are
gonna take some getting used to.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,317
Browne retractor.

5
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:07,428
No Browne retractor.

6
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:09,314
I thought I put it on
your tray from the supply room.

7
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:10,899
<i>Dr. Kalu
is not your peer.</i>

8
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,657
He's your employee,
and you are his boss.

9
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:15,626
I do not plan to give
Jared special treatment.

10
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:18,429
And if I see it, it won't
be good for either of you.

11
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,631
I'm not expecting
special treatment, Shaun,

12
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,786
but I don't appreciate being
treated like an intern either.

13
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,802
Dr. Andrews said he is judging my
performance off of your performance,

14
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:27,796
and your performance
is not good.

15
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:31,334
You come in with your fancy
car and your old tricks and think,

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,961
"Ta-da, I'm a surgeon,"
but you're not.

17
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,763
I just want to prove
that I belong here.

18
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,525
When I checked on
Yara post-operatively,

19
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,514
I noticed you only used eight
sutures when you closed,

20
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,353
and she had a small bleed.
You should have used ten.

21
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,688
Dr. Glassman closed
the galea and skin.

22
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:47,291
- Dr. Glassman skipped two sutures?
- Guess so.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,675
At what time did you wake
up yesterday morning?

24
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,963
The usual, 5:30. Why?

25
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:00,329
At lunch, you had a Cobb salad
with balsamic vinaigrette,

26
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:02,906
so that's 450 calories ingested,
assuming you kept it down.

27
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:03,831
Yes, I kept it down.

28
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:07,800
Did you use a sauna, engage in rigorous
exercise, and/or experience diarrhea?

29
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,378
No, I didn't do any
of those things.

30
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,049
What's with the
questions, Shaun?

31
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,276
You made an error in
yesterday's craniotomy.

32
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:15,035
I'm trying to evaluate
various factors

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,162
that would negatively
impact focus.

34
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:18,222
I made an error?

35
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,258
You closed with
only eight sutures.

36
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:22,092
The size of the
wound required ten.

37
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:23,594
We need to figure out why.

38
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,421
Why do we need to
figure out why?

39
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:27,356
Two sutures, it's a
blip. It's not a thing.

40
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:30,574
It could be part of a more
troubling pattern needing attention.

41
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,700
- Shaun, the surgery was a success, right?
- Yes.

42
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,258
The patient had a great outcome.

43
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:36,594
There is no pattern.

44
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,142
Goodbye.

45
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:48,638
I'm a surgeon,
and I belong here.

46
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm a surgeon,
and I belong here.

47
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,852
You are a surgeon,
and you belong here.

48
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,226
I just keep imagining
you in the mirror

49
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:08,739
like, "You have the hair of Tracee
Ellis Ross and the swag of Beyonce."

50
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:10,241
Do not shame my self-care.

51
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,012
Affirmations are
backed by research.

52
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,281
FMRI evidence
shows a correlation

53
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,684
with positive
changes in the brain.

54
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:23,179
I've just put the finishing
touches on a surprise.

55
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:24,880
Drum roll please.

56
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:28,818
Or not.

57
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,319
Well, get your song lists ready

58
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,596
because you are all
officially invited to...

59
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:39,102
Star Karaoke, 7:00 p.m. until
question mark, question mark.

60
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:42,406
You know it's gonna be a party when
there's double punctuation involved.

61
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:45,301
Yeah, just the chance to unwind and
get to know you all a little better.

62
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,355
Sounds fun. Thanks
for the invite.

63
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,782
Prepare to be destroyed. My
"Someone Like You" slays.

64
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,867
Need a surgical consult for a clinic
patient with a dislocated patella.

65
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,152
Mm, sorry, ER.

66
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:00,607
You two are it. Room one.

67
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,491
When did the chest pain start?

68
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,191
I first noticed
it Tuesday morning

69
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,228
along with shortness of breath.

70
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,996
Are you taking
any medications?

71
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:17,855
I started with one, then
switched a few times.

72
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,488
These are used to treat ADHD.

73
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,180
And brain fog.

74
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,473
I'm a COVID long-hauler.

75
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:30,454
Um, and I just started
guanfacine and N-acetylcysteine,

76
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,883
which may actually
be helping finally.

77
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,719
- When was your initial infection?
- Eight months ago.

78
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,422
It just felt like a mild
flu, but then it got worse,

79
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,891
like someone poured
molasses on my brain.

80
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:44,086
I've done cognitive therapy,

81
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:45,914
memory exercises,

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,263
still am,

83
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:49,284
whatever I can do to
get back in the field.

84
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,116
- Which one?
- Clover.

85
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:54,784
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

86
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,977
- Oh.
- Wow.

87
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:01,791
I have been studying how white clover
adapts to environmental changes...

88
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:05,828
And
I'm on indefinite leave.

89
00:04:05,873 --> 00:04:07,531
Please stop talking now.

90
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,499
Bluish skin, low O2
levels, rapid heart rate.

91
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:14,063
And increasingly
labored breathing.

92
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,591
Possible pulmonary embolism.

93
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:17,819
Order a chest CTA
and echo, stat.

94
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,232
I have to go.

95
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:27,770
Oh.

96
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,583
You will need this.

97
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,768
I sent one half of a high
volume order to your printer.

98
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:39,149
These are Glassman's op reports?

99
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,115
For the last three
months. January to March.

100
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,008
October to December is printing
in Park's and my office.

101
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,841
So you sent reports for, like,
100 surgeries to my printer?

102
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:49,872
No, 176 surgeries.

103
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,502
473 pages.

104
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,796
I've emailed Operations
to replace your toner.

105
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:55,490
Many elements are in color.

106
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:58,032
And why, exactly, do
you need all of this?

107
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,597
To find out if his
mistake was a blip.

108
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:17,160
Second time I've
dislocated my knee.

109
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:20,356
Uh, first was a few
months ago, I think.

110
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,733
- That was the sprained ankle.
- Ah.

111
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:24,627
The dislocation was last year.

112
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:28,092
Your MRI shows no associated
damage to bones or ligaments.

113
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:32,735
She's also been complaining
about dizziness,

114
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:36,205
swollen ankles, maybe
menopause-related.

115
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:38,898
Dr. Reznick is looking to get her
on hormone replacement therapy.

116
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,610
Orion insisted I come in and
get everything checked out

117
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:44,630
before she leaves and
moves 6,000 miles away

118
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,490
to live alone.

119
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:49,385
I'm moving to Prague
next week for a new job,

120
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:51,420
and you can come visit
me anytime you want, Mom.

121
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:52,918
Not with a busted knee.

122
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,189
To move forward with HRT,

123
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,825
I need to confirm
all the medications

124
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,561
you've used over
the last five years.

125
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:02,998
Oh, uh, there was a
purple triangle one,

126
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,467
but they took me
off that last year

127
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,670
and an orange-shaped one.

128
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:08,995
I'll review it with you.

129
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:12,841
We need to see how
your knee is moving.

130
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,056
Lay back, please.

131
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,932
Go ahead with the
exam, Dr. Kalu.

132
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,051
I thought I'd observe.

133
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,452
It's a knee exam,

134
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:25,645
not a multi-ligament
reconstruction.

135
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,137
You told me last time not
to assume I know everything.

136
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:29,858
This is just making
me do your job.

137
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:39,115
That sounded like an apneic
spell. Check her tonsils.

138
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,311
Ms. Garcia.

139
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,040
Mm?

140
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,927
Oh, did I fall asleep again?

141
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,286
Yes.

142
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,963
Can I take a quick
look in your mouth?

143
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:52,222
Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:56,685
Kissing tonsils.

145
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,287
They're so enlarged,
they're touching

146
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,556
and obstructing your airway,
causing severe apnea.

147
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:03,555
You need a tonsillectomy
right away.

148
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,533
No pulmonary embolism, but
multiple cardiac issues.

149
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,469
Severe narrowing of
the pulmonic valve,

150
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,136
hypertrophied right ventricle

151
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,790
and opening between
the lower chambers.

152
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,575
This set of defects
almost looks like

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,706
- tetralogy of Fallot, but...
- It is.

154
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,363
She has the fourth malformation,

155
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,690
overriding aorta.

156
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,958
I've never seen tet
in an adult before.

157
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,971
How is she still alive?

158
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:35,416
Hang on a sec.

159
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,193
I have to write
everything down now.

160
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:41,497
Tet is almost
always diagnosed in infancy.

161
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,599
Doctors somehow missed
it in your case.

162
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:45,768
Oh, you have
a rare presentation.

163
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,821
The right ventricle
obstruction has been balanced

164
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:50,105
by an increased flow
into the left ventricle.

165
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,941
Damage from COVID
disrupted the balance.

166
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,443
The virus may have
saved your life.

167
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:56,011
Very few undiagnosed
tet patients

168
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,312
survive past childhood.

169
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,281
A mere 2% make it to 40.

170
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:00,716
You're saying

171
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,427
I would have just dropped
dead at some point?

172
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:04,520
It's very likely.

173
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:08,157
We can remove that risk with
two separate procedures.

174
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,459
First, we'll close
the extra vessels

175
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:13,028
that have formed to compensate
for your heart defects.

176
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:15,405
Then we'll do a surgery
to repair those defects.

177
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,235
Is it possible the
tet is connected

178
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,704
to my long COVID symptoms?

179
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:24,102
Could fixing my heart
clear up my head,

180
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,475
the brain?

181
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,912
No. I'm sorry.

182
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:40,556
You snagged our table.

183
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,225
Beat Hawks and Nunez to it.

184
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,060
You're a champion.

185
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:47,663
One Splenda, half Sugar in
the Raw, light almond milk.

186
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:48,985
Now who's the champion?

187
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,010
Mm.

188
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,097
I have something for you.

189
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,172
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,157
An agreement acknowledging
a consensual relationship.

191
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,418
I, Marcus Andrews,
would like to take you,

192
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:12,020
Dalisay Villanueva, on a date.

193
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:16,133
And as hospital president,
you know, I already signed it.

194
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,474
This is so romantic.

195
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:21,647
Give me the pen.

196
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,073
- Dinner this weekend?
- Let me see.

197
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,542
Oh, I'm needed on the ward.

198
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,272
Sorry. Lock it down later?

199
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,297
Sure.

200
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:45,382
Iced coffee?

201
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:46,973
I'm good.

202
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,193
How about a hot coffee?

203
00:09:51,393 --> 00:09:54,396
In honor of Daphne's
successful tonsillectomy,

204
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,099
I got a few options.

205
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,067
Is that a latte?

206
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:00,202
Mm.

207
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,439
It was a routine tonsillectomy.

208
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,725
Those were unusually
large tonsils.

209
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,526
A good thing her
daughter brought her in.

210
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,591
You think Daphne was
better off not breathing?

211
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:15,050
I don't think it's
a daughter's job

212
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,752
to make sure Mom
goes to the doctor.

213
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,389
It's Daphne.

214
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,594
Heart rate spiked.
She's hypoxic.

215
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,120
Turn up oxygen to max flow.

216
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:33,602
Loud murmur from the right
ventricle and atrium.

217
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:35,513
Chronic damage from apnea
could have increased

218
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,249
the pressure in her lungs,
causing right heart failure.

219
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:39,087
BP's dropping.

220
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,472
We need to get her
to the cath lab.

221
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,788
Positioning
coiling system.

222
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,117
Two vessels
left to close.

223
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,211
Deploying the coil.

224
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:58,160
O2 sats are dropping.

225
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:01,763
Her infundibular muscle
is clamping down.

226
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:04,234
She is having a tet spell.

227
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,502
Give phenylephrine
and 100% oxygen.

228
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,755
I have never seen
one in-person before.

229
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,767
We need to move blood
up to the lungs.

230
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,718
Give her a bolus
and up the opiates.

231
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:20,515
If we don't stop the spasm,

232
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,391
she could have
permanent brain damage.

233
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:36,804
The chance of a future
infundibular spasm is very high.

234
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,244
Her tet repair surgery
will be much more risky.

235
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,114
Pressure in Daphne's lungs
is still critically high.

236
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,011
Not a routine
tonsillectomy at all.

237
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,320
Puncturing the atrial septum.

238
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:57,755
Right heart is decompressing.

239
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,991
Give nitric oxide to relax
and dilate the vasculature.

240
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:04,129
Her apnea really did a number
on her pulmonary vessels.

241
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:06,355
No wonder she's
clumsy and forgetful.

242
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,593
She's been sleep- and
oxygen-deprived for decades.

243
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:12,363
It still doesn't make her her
daughter's responsibility.

244
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:15,428
Would you want Kellan to put his
life on hold to take care of you?

245
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:18,302
Not his whole life, no,

246
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:21,554
but I don't think being overly
devoted is the worst quality in a kid.

247
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:22,780
Remove the catheters.

248
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,659
I was one of six
growing up, only girl.

249
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,119
Mom and dad worked a lot,

250
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,824
so I was basically second
mom since kindergarten.

251
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,614
I love my brothers, but...

252
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,995
there's a lot you miss out on

253
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,207
if you're all about taking
care of someone else.

254
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,612
She's throwing a lot of PVCs.

255
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,219
Maybe an electrolyte issue.

256
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,010
BP's dropping. Heart rate 172.

257
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:55,459
We're barely getting a pulse.
She's in V-tach. Defib pads.

258
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:15,319
BP and heart rate stabilizing.

259
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,570
Get a new chemistry,
chest X-ray, EKG.

260
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,915
We need to figure out what else
is going on with her heart.

261
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,734
Oh, please don't
disturb my materials.

262
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:36,887
Which are what, exactly?

263
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:39,081
Dr. Glassman made an
uncharacteristic surgical error.

264
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,961
I am determining if
it was an anomaly

265
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,753
or part of a pattern.

266
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,837
Glassman must be really
pleased about that.

267
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:45,863
He is not.

268
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:48,166
You are being sarcastic.

269
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,820
Performance review is
a standard practice

270
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,529
and benefits both
doctors and patients.

271
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:54,680
I have identified three additional
errors made in the last four months.

272
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:56,383
I don't see a pattern.

273
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,876
A dural tear on scarred tissue,

274
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,687
closing with a running
nylon instead of Monocryl...

275
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,054
Is that even a mistake?

276
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,848
Dr. Glassman has always
used subcutaneous Monocryl.

277
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,352
These are variations,
minor missteps.

278
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:09,724
You pore through four months
of any surgeon's op reports,

279
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:11,413
and you'll find
discrepancies like this.

280
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,999
- No.
- Yes.

281
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,573
Not in mine.

282
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:18,408
That's probably true.

283
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,503
Eh, if you're not
finding a pattern,

284
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,693
maybe it's because
there isn't one.

285
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,354
My patient is awake.

286
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:32,910
Does this mean you can't move
forward with the tet repair?

287
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,704
There's a medication
called propranolol

288
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,488
that will significantly
reduce the risk

289
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,649
of having another
spasm during surgery,

290
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,418
but because of your long COVID,

291
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:42,625
you're at risk for some
very rare side effects.

292
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,809
- Are they serious?
- Yes.

293
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,930
Well, some of them are
not, like nausea, vomiting,

294
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,890
muscle aches, and
dizziness, but others,

295
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:51,129
such as hypoglycemia
or visual changes...

296
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:52,755
We'll start you on
the propranolol.

297
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,641
There's a good chance you won't
experience the rare side effects,

298
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,469
but we'll need to keep
a close eye on you.

299
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:00,947
And are those
patients ahead of her

300
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:02,934
also seniors with diabetes?

301
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,042
Do not hang up on me, Phillip,

302
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,058
or I'll head down to
do this in person.

303
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,331
I'll wait.

304
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:10,713
Hey.

305
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:16,488
There is a great new
Portuguese spot I read about.

306
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:19,647
I can make reservations for
us Friday or Saturday at 7:00?

307
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,819
Uh, I'm working a
double both days.

308
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:25,271
It's been a nonstop scramble
since Baker and Linh left.

309
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:27,274
Well, you have two new
travelers starting on Monday.

310
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:28,640
We need staff nurses.

311
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:29,847
These nurses are
highly skilled. We...

312
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,457
It doesn't matter
how skilled they are.

313
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,413
Travel nurses disrupt workflow,

314
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:35,010
don't build long-term
relationships.

315
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,938
Right now, we just don't have the
resources for permanent replacements.

316
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:40,106
You just hired a new
full-time surgical resident

317
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,642
to replace someone who
left way more recently.

318
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,403
That was Lim's department. I...

319
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,444
Yes, great. I'm
sending her down.

320
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,486
Sorry. We'll talk later?

321
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:49,511
Of course.

322
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,958
So you're watching
to see if I throw up?

323
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,250
Or faint, seize, or
have muscle spasms.

324
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:04,949
You know, before
COVID, my brain was...

325
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,905
I did evolutionary patterns,

326
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:11,835
genetic, uh...

327
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,332
how genes go together.

328
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,069
The sequence.

329
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,036
Now my brain can't handle the
sequence of brushing my teeth.

330
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,692
My focus, my working
memory, all of the...

331
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,583
The executive function.

332
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:39,603
It's not always happening.

333
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:45,534
Please page Dr. Wolke to monitor
her and stay until he comes.

334
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,328
Push your hand against mine.

335
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,501
The pattern is errors
in executive function.

336
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:53,954
Shaun, I'm in the middle
of doing something.

337
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:57,086
Your brain cancer
may have returned.

338
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,204
- All errors are tied to executive function.
- Shaun...

339
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,365
Specifically to working and
procedural memory governed

340
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:06,978
by the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex,

341
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:08,869
a common site for
a recurrent glioma,

342
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:12,105
which strongly suggests
your cancer has returned.

343
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:15,208
My last scan came back
completely clear. I'm fine.

344
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:16,777
Your last scan was
six months ago.

345
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,212
These errors all took place
in the last four months.

346
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:20,648
So you need another scan.

347
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:22,061
The evidence is very compelling.

348
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,349
No, it's really not.

349
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,886
I perform complex
surgeries, Shaun,

350
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,822
more so than any other doctor
on this staff, by the way.

351
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,858
So yeah, the percentages
would dictate

352
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:34,828
that I might make more minor
and irrelevant missteps,

353
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,864
if that's what you want
to call them, and...

354
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:38,566
And the rate of
errors has increased.

355
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:41,234
Yeah, because I take
on the tougher cases,

356
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,503
the ones no one else will.

357
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:45,639
No, you need another MRI now.

358
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,808
Shaun, what I need is to
get back to my patient.

359
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,244
And you need to knock
first next time.

360
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,794
It's the greening of the...

361
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,153
My turn.

362
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,630
I'm trying to get some of
my cognitive exercises in.

363
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,434
What are you memorizing?

364
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,479
It's a poem from <i>The
Carrying,</i> Ada Limon.

365
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,505
Hmm.

366
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,615
The collection is
mostly about...

367
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,843
not having the life you
thought you'd have, I guess.

368
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:22,610
The one I was just reading,
it's about spring coming,

369
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:25,197
<i>Instructions on Not Giving Up.</i>

370
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,590
- Sounds useful.
- Yeah.

371
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:29,458
Too bad I can't
read it all at once.

372
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,185
I've just graduated from haikus.

373
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:35,263
I never even thought to look
at a poem before I got sick.

374
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,862
Didn't have the patience
for it at the time,

375
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,488
but it's basically
all I read now.

376
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,932
I started writing, too.

377
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,493
It's kind of a creative therapy.

378
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:49,135
Mm.

379
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:52,372
There was a kind of poetry

380
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,575
to the genetic variations
in white clover too.

381
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,962
I'd give anything to...

382
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,821
Your blood pressure
is going down,

383
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,099
and your heart rate's climbing.

384
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:10,124
I feel kind of dizzy.

385
00:19:10,256 --> 00:19:11,781
Let me check your glucose.

386
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:17,682
She's having a seizure.
Crash cart now!

387
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,277
We thought something else
was going on with your heart,

388
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,436
but it's a kidney issue.

389
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,280
You have a narrowing
of your renal arteries,

390
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:27,344
which was exacerbated by
the pulmonary hypertension,

391
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,585
causing your kidneys to fail.

392
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,117
And this is because
of my sleep apnea?

393
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,855
We believe so, yeah.

394
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,724
Uh, can she get a transplant?

395
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:37,985
I can do a test,
see if I'm a match.

396
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,487
Unfortunately, your other health
concerns rule out a transplant,

397
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:46,026
but a renal artery bypass would allow
your kidneys to heal on their own.

398
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,317
There's risk of complications,
some quite serious.

399
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:54,601
But in success, you could
live a full, independent life.

400
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,905
But... oh, but serious,

401
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,749
as in I could die?

402
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:03,777
Some complications can be fatal.

403
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,945
But the risk is relatively low.

404
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,205
Are there other options?

405
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:11,060
Well, there's dialysis,

406
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,338
but you'd need multiple sessions
a week for the rest of your life.

407
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:20,410
Um, that's less risky, but I...

408
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:24,297
I don't think I could
handle all that on my own.

409
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,105
Mom, Mom, if you want to choose the
dialysis, I'll stay in San Jose.

410
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,657
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:34,842
I don't want to keep you.

412
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,944
No, you have nothing
to be sorry for.

413
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:41,395
All this time you've been
sick and struggling, and I...

414
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:43,501
I judged you.

415
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,865
But your new job.

416
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:49,484
It's just a job.

417
00:20:57,785 --> 00:21:01,076
So the medication you gave me

418
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:03,436
to make my surgery safer

419
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,014
will actually make
it more risky?

420
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,190
That's right.

421
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:09,381
But without that medication,

422
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:12,075
I'm much more likely to
have another tet spell.

423
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,983
Yes, and possibly more
severe than the last time.

424
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:20,228
The brain fog,
all my deficits...

425
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:22,667
could get worse,

426
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:26,024
for possibly forever?

427
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,128
Yes.

428
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,598
But if we don't
do the tet repair,

429
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:34,185
your heart will
stop at some point.

430
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,039
I've already been through

431
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,543
losing my thoughts,
my whole self.

432
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,227
I can't do that again.

433
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:55,275
Find another way
to fix my heart.

434
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,601
All right, new idea.

435
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,862
We go back to the old idea
and just do the surgery.

436
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,490
It's a non-starter.

437
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:16,457
We need to present a way to help
her tet without triggering her tet.

438
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:19,518
A percutaneous valve and VSD
closure could help with blood flow.

439
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:21,092
That involves
catheters in the heart,

440
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:22,971
which would cause
the muscle to spasm.

441
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,858
All right. It's
time for some WWSMD.

442
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,394
Whatever you and Jerome
do on your own time is...

443
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:30,072
It's "what would
Shaun Murphy do?"

444
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:04,797
<i>♪♪ If a party is
what you need ♪♪</i>

445
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,440
<i>♪♪ They're dancing ♪♪</i>

446
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,545
What about a shunt?

447
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,703
It would improve blood
flow, buy a few months

448
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,613
to continue her
cognitive recovery.

449
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:14,558
Once she feels better
about where her brain's at,

450
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,140
maybe she lets us fix her heart.

451
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,719
Her tet will likely
kill her before that,

452
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:22,781
but placing a shunt
won't trigger a spell,

453
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:24,906
making it something
she'd actually accept.

454
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:29,927
I'll take it to her.

455
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:32,625
I can stay only 45 minutes.

456
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,827
I have to review
Dr. Glassman's OR videos.

457
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,200
Didn't you already review them?

458
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,827
Not for symptoms of
glioma recurrence.

459
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:40,299
New evidence will convince
Dr. Glassman to get a scan.

460
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:42,960
Okay, you binged months
of data in one day.

461
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:44,579
You'll have a clearer
head in the morning.

462
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:47,272
Until then, here we
are, karaoke rager.

463
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:48,974
- Yay.
- It is yay.

464
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,201
We have song lists.
Plus Jared's our friend.

465
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,512
He just moved back.
Celebration is in order.

466
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,436
I will review the
videos in the morning.

467
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,635
Yay!

468
00:23:58,517 --> 00:23:59,952
It sounds pretty wild in there.

469
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:03,648
<i>♪♪ Because maybe ♪♪</i>

470
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:07,625

00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:10,862

472
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,636
I
was just warming up.

473
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:20,497
- Where is everyone?
- There is a lot of food.

474
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:23,061
Yeah, I had it catered.
You're the first to arrive.

475
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:26,552
And so far,
last-minute rain checks

476
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:29,223
from Morgan, Park, Asher, Danny.

477
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:31,934
Oh, and Jerome.

478
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,596
So it's just us four?

479
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:39,124
Which means that
all these snacks

480
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:42,269
and song binders are for us.

481
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,363
Oh. Yes.

482
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:47,508
The low turnout is the perfect
opportunity to discuss symptoms.

483
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,127
In your recent surgeries
with Dr. Glassman,

484
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:52,901
do you recall observing
any balance issues,

485
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,576
tremors, or motor weakness?

486
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:01,821
That sounds like
the perfect option.

487
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,092
How soon can you do
the shunt procedure?

488
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:07,486
I'll try to schedule
it for tomorrow.

489
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,826
I've had a strange year myself.

490
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:19,339
Eleven months ago,

491
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:20,708
I was attacked

492
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,945
and paralyzed from
the waist down.

493
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:26,997
I thought it was permanent.
Almost everyone did.

494
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:34,222
At first, all I wanted
was to walk again.

495
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,960
I was ready to risk my life
to get back to the old me.

496
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:41,665
But as time went on,

497
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:47,334
I started to appreciate
my new life, my new self.

498
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,897
I started a new relationship

499
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,029
that wouldn't have
happened otherwise.

500
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:58,275
In many ways, my life improved.

501
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:01,724
You recognize you walked
in to tell me this story?

502
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,996
I only agreed to do the surgery

503
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,525
once I knew my life
wasn't at risk.

504
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:09,451
And even then, I had doubts.

505
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,551
I liked who I'd become.

506
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:14,457
I wanted to hold on to her.

507
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,622
I'm not...

508
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,916
losing my mind...

509
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,979
all over again.

510
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,385
You don't strike me as
someone who's lost her mind.

511
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,316
That covers the thrombectomy.

512
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:52,513
In February, you
assisted on a...

513
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:56,318
Okay, I'm playing the
pregnant lady card.

514
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:58,739
We're going, Shaun.

515
00:26:58,764 --> 00:26:59,765
Okay.

516
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,698
Thank you. Goodbye.

517
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,228
I should head out, too.

518
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:10,145
- Early morning.
- Yeah.

519
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:17,360
Maybe focus on being
a first-year resident

520
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:21,223
before adding party
planner to your resume.

521
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:25,882
The catering may have
been a bridge too far.

522
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,492
Yeah.

523
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:33,671
I bounced around growing up.

524
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,225
Different schools,
cities, countries.

525
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,401
But, um, wherever we were,
my parents had a big house,

526
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:46,578
and I knew how to throw a party.

527
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:53,100
Closest I'd get to
feeling like I fit.

528
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,299
Old habits die hard, I guess.

529
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,853
Fitting in takes time.

530
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:06,349
But I never have, anywhere.

531
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,628
Maybe not everyone

532
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:14,387
finds their place.

533
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:21,714
Daphne is getting
septic. We have to go.

534
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,855
Morning.

535
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,390
Hello.

536
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:30,559
Mm.

537
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:33,995
You should not have that.

538
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:36,446
I'm permitted 12 ounces
a day. Experts agree.

539
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:39,909
Yes, but that was brewed
when I woke up at 3:30 a.m.

540
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:43,771
You make it through the videos?

541
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:46,307
Yes, and integrated
the observations

542
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,117
Doctors Kalu and
Allen made last night

543
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,643
regarding possible
glioma symptoms.

544
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,059
I am now ready to present Dr. Glassman
with the revised evidence,

545
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:57,720
which is very compelling.

546
00:28:57,852 --> 00:28:58,853
Mm.

547
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:05,561
Thankfully, your infection is
responding to the antibiotics.

548
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:08,704
The infection started
around your dialysis port.

549
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:10,466
That could easily happen again.

550
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,811
The renal artery bypass
is still an option.

551
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,629
It's too risky.

552
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:17,973
So is sepsis.

553
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:22,578
Thank you, Doctor, but I'll
settle for being alive.

554
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,187
You shouldn't.

555
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,568
You deserve more than that.

556
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,770
I know you've had a whole
life of feeling sick

557
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:34,364
and stuck and repeating
the same old, bad patterns,

558
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,183
but your past does not have to
tell your future where to go.

559
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,206
You can choose a different path

560
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:45,099
and who you're gonna be on it.

561
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,595
And let your
daughter do the same.

562
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:55,942
Prague is beautiful
in the spring.

563
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:36,332
We've scheduled the shunt
placement for this afternoon.

564
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,340
And that whole
speech last night?

565
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:42,768
I stand by it, but
it's your decision.

566
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,833
I've been waiting for the
old me to come back, and...

567
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,428
That person may
not exist anymore.

568
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,708
And...

569
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:05,450
maybe I should be
okay with that.

570
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,233
Do the tet repair.

571
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,163
Releasing
the proximal clamp.

572
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,964
What made Daphne
change her mind?

573
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:36,037
Dr. Allen has a way of
getting through to people.

574
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,325
Blood flow looks obstructed.

575
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,872
There's a kink in the graft.

576
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:47,389
We can undo it, but most
likely, it happens again.

577
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:55,396
We could anchor the bypass
off of the aorta instead.

578
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,476
At that angle, less
chance of a kink.

579
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,440
Could work.

580
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,447
- Extending the incision.
- Sternal saw.

581
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:22,558
Starting
the sternotomy.

582
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:26,015
O2 dropped to 78.

583
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,404
- 65.
- She's having a tet spell.

584
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,667
Give her 500 cc fluid
bolus and 100% oxygen.

585
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,469
Giving a mini bolus to
increase pulmonary flow.

586
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:41,044
O2 sats are 50.45.

587
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,619
Come on, come on.

588
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,000
Give her more oxygen
and up the opiates.

589
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:49,638
It has
stopped registering.

590
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:09,542
O2's rising.

591
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,955
Heart rate's stabilizing.

592
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:18,780
She was in prolonged
gross hypoxia.

593
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,723
That could extend
cognitive deficits...

594
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,653
or worse.

595
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:26,346
We won't
know until she wakes.

596
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:28,387
Let's get her on bypass
before she has another one.

597
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,896
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:36,030
To a successful
renal artery bypass.

599
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:38,834
Cheers. Facilitated
by moving speech

600
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,536
from a wise and
persuasive surgeon.

601
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:43,572
Mm, with a great
surgical save by a guy

602
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:46,474
who's about to have some
life-changing tacos.

603
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,608
Okay.

604
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:53,015
Mm! Oh, my God.

605
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,617
Okay, these are
amaz... You're amazing!

606
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:58,319
Told you. Blue corn tortillas.

607
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,729
Mm-hmm. I can get used to this.

608
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,995
- You have some lettuce there.
- Oh.

609
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,665
- No, no, no, mirror image.
- Mm.

610
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:10,899
Now?

611
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,568
- No.
- No laughing.

612
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:13,811
No, right, right, right. Very...

613
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,336
Very serious matter.

614
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,986
Here. Um, yeah.

615
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,245
Oh.

616
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,956
Just a little bit more.

617
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,962
- We should go.
- Mm.

618
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,004
- Yeah.
- Um, we need to get back early for Daphne's post-op.

619
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,920
Yeah, right. Um, let's go.

620
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:55,670
The bypass went smoothly,
and post-op labs look good.

621
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,223
We expect a full recovery.

622
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,865
How are you feeling, Mom?

623
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:02,321
I'm...

624
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:06,258
Breathing.

625
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:09,045
Kind of feels like the
first time in my life.

626
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:14,299
The post-op swelling from the
tonsillectomy has gone down.

627
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:16,990
You're finally breathing
without any obstruction.

628
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,012
You'll need to stay on top of your
medications and follow-up visits,

629
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,640
observe some dietary guidelines,

630
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:24,402
but the discharge
plan lays it all out.

631
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:27,067
I'll be there to help, Mom.

632
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
No.

633
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,194
You won't.

634
00:35:38,557 --> 00:35:40,765
You need to live your own life.

635
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:47,615
But I... I will
accept FaceTime calls.

636
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,101
And once I recover,

637
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,970
I'll come visit.

638
00:35:57,225 --> 00:36:00,298
I hear that Prague is
beautiful in the spring.

639
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:05,820
That sounds like a plan.

640
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,598
Mm, things not go
well with Glassy?

641
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:21,899
He returned the files
with a note saying

642
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:25,300
he did not look at them
and does not intend to.

643
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:27,506
I'm sorry. He probably...

644
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:29,577
It was a mistake to leave them
for him to read on his own.

645
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:33,510
Once I reorder the files, I will go to
his office to review with him in person.

646
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,476
He made it pretty clear he
doesn't want to see them.

647
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,937
But he doesn't know
about the new evidence.

648
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,897
Maybe he doesn't want to know.

649
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:42,685
Cancer survivors have to live
with that uncertainty that...

650
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,118
Knowing is better
than not knowing.

651
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:49,728
If he's not ready
to look at this,

652
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:51,827
you can't force him.

653
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,446
Maybe he's scared, Shaun.

654
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:58,785
And I think maybe
you're scared, too.

655
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,441
We're about to have a baby,

656
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:04,910
you're about to be a dad,

657
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,345
and I think you're
worried about family,

658
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,304
and Glassman is a part of that.

659
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:13,951
But if you keep pushing,
you risk damaging

660
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:17,031
one of the most important
relationships in your life.

661
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:27,498
Hey.

662
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

663
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,908
I've been thinking,

664
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,084
and I need a break
from our coffees.

665
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:40,812
Dalisay...

666
00:37:40,837 --> 00:37:42,861
I don't think dinner's
a good idea either.

667
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:46,294
So we have a different point of
view about hospital business.

668
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:48,487
That doesn't change the
way I feel about you.

669
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:50,937
On or off the clock,
I'm the same person.

670
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:54,259
To me, if you don't
value what the nurses do

671
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:57,449
enough to treat us like
a resource to invest in,

672
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,283
not a line item to be cut,

673
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:01,864
how much can you care about me?

674
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:04,823
And to be honest,

675
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:07,487
if that is your point of view...

676
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,025
it undercuts the
respect I have for you.

677
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:25,957
Harper Louise Decrane,

678
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,254
March 30, 1994.

679
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,400
And do you know why you're here?

680
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:33,466
For my heart issues.

681
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:38,138
I had another tet
spell, didn't I?

682
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,605
We'll need to
conduct more tests,

683
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,983
but your speech and
memory seem intact.

684
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:46,043
And with regard to your heart,
we expect a full recovery.

685
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,970
And with time, you may recover your
full cognitive abilities as well.

686
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:51,682
Maybe.

687
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:57,579
But for now, I'll just
focus on being here.

688
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:14,506
<i>"It's the greening of the trees</i>

689
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,181
<i>That really gets to me</i>

690
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:21,513
<i>When all the shock
of white and taffy</i>

691
00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:24,854
Leave the pavement strewn
With the confetti of aftermath

692
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,227
<i>The leaves come</i>

693
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,337
<i>Patient, plodding</i>

694
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,544
<i>A green skin growing over
Whatever winter did to us</i>

695
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,267
<i>A return to the strange
idea Of continuous living</i>

696
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,889
<i>Despite the mess of us</i>

697
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,097
<i>The hurt, the empty..."</i>

698
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:48,374
Shaun, what?

00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:52,526
Lea thinks that because
I'm going to be a dad,

700
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,536
I am worried about my family.

701
00:39:56,915 --> 00:39:58,383
Okay.

702
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:01,819
She also thinks you are scared.

703
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,356
I'm not scared,
Shaun. I'm fine.

704
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:07,806
She says if you don't want to
do the scan, I should let it go.

705
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:12,984
She...

706
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,876
is right.

707
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:20,174
Good. Thank you.

708
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:23,926
I am scared.

709
00:40:37,255 --> 00:40:38,864
Dr. Glassman...

710
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,881
I am asking you to do the scan

711
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:49,558
because...

712
00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:55,064
the data and the
evidence are sound...

713
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:01,712
and because...

714
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,922
it would be hard
to lose my father

715
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:13,211
just as I am about
to become one.

716
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,195
Do the scan for me.

717
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:37,972
Shaun, I'll do the scan.

718
00:41:56,067 --> 00:42:00,013
<i>"'Fine then, I'll take
it' The tree seems to say</i>

719
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:04,049
<i>A new slick leaf unfurling
Like a fist to an open palm</i>

720
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,086
<i>'I'll take it all'"</i>
