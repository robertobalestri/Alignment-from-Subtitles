You didn't tell the nurse

Didn't anyone check

Shaun, do me a favor, please,
and... And step outside
and meet me in the hall?

418
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,307
Mr. Cho,

419
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,675
the important thing is that
your vitals are normal now,

420
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,078
and there won't be
any long-term effects
as a result of the medication.

421
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,214
I'll be right back.

422
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,121
You didn't have time
to get a clear history?

423

425
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,494
I warned you about this,
didn't I?

426
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,930
You were stressed
and then you stressed him.

427
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,499
Okay, I would
feel less stressed
if you were moving faster.

428
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,000

to esmolol

431
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,540

been so slow to get

531
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:23,930
No, he used a ball launcher

532
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,632
to fire a basketball
at his stomach.

533
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,899
Yeah, my followers
love that stuff.

534
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,301
You have
a wandering spleen.

535
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,671
The ligaments holding
it were likely weakened
from past trauma.

536
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,006
The impact from the ball
caused it to break away.

537

Oh, snap. Can you
e-mail me those pics?

That's dope content

539
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,646
L-Later.

540
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,614
You're not getting adequate
blood flow to the spleen.

541

We need to get you
into surgery now.

542

Sweet. Hey, can you guys
film this for me?

543
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:51,390
Urine samples
from the dosed
are inconclusive.

544

Any food updates?

545
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,829
No-go on the ribs
and the pasta salad.

546
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,501
In your extensive
tripping experience,

547
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,303
do people
usually talk crazy

548
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,072
or reveal their
true feelings?

549
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,239
Both.

550
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,441
Though often
they're related.

551
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,477
Yeah, Park's
definitely acting crazy.

552
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,012

dancing on tables?

Both?

00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,354
Great.

556
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,124
We just moved in together,
and now he's rambling

557
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,659
about how opposites
don't attract.

558
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,662
Or shouldn't? I...

559
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:32,131
You know the word rambling
can refer to horny horses?

560
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,004
Maybe he's just nervous
about change.

561
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,140
Park doesn't get nervous.

562
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,709
Well, it's either
completely irrelevant

563
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:43,843
or something you two
need to have

564
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,845
a very serious talk about.

565
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,849
Isn't Dr. Gentry vegan?

566
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,453
Yes.

567
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,155
That takes out chicken,
mac and cheese, and Jell-O.

568
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,358
The sweet potatoes.

569
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,426
Whose dish was that?

570
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,329
That's impossible.

571
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,998

I followed it exactly.

00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,867
Interesting.

573
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,802
And did you help him?

574
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,405
You think
I did something
to his dish?

575
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,007
Maybe you thought
it'd be funny.

576
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,711
That makes no sense,
which isn't surprising

577
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,780
because you're tripping.

578
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,215
But I'm not,
and I remember

579
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,551
you put a bag labeled "organs"
in the shared fridge

580
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,020
and changed Dr. Riley's
license plate to "IMPOTENT."

581
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,657
Those were harmless pranks,

582
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,593
unlike dosing a hospital.

583
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,395
I'm sorry... Pause.

584
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,432
When exactly was
this Prank Master era?

585
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:43,936
It wasn't an era.
It was just some stuff I did
my first few years here.

586
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,037
Oh.

587
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,039
So you were different then?

588
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,042
Or are you just morphing
into different people

589
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,644
depending on
who you're talking to?

590
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,946
Do you have
other personalities

591
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,181

592
