1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:06,140
Ethicure. Devoted
to an improved, accessible,

2
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:09,677
for-profit, state-of-the-art
healthcare experience.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,680
An experience we curate

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,149
via our Three Pillars
of the Ethicure mission.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,853
Pillar one, our hospital.

6
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:23,657
A new color palette
designed to create
a sense of well-being.

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,026
Cutting edge technologies.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,029
Faster testing
and imaging results.

9
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,864
And countless new
surgical innovations.

10
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,102
Pillar two, our doctors.

11
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,738
We want you healthy and happy,

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,543
so if you look
under the table,
you will find,

13
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,478
custom fitness trackers,

14
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:48,048
Ethicure scrubs,

15
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,584
along with
a few other goodies.

16
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,654
We'll also be introducing
new well-being incentives

17
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,357
and protocols designed
to encourage teamwork

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,426
and mutual respect.

19
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,195
Bosses have first names, too.

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,466
Which leads us
to pillar three.

21
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,001
At Ethicure,
we do not treat patients.

22
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,903
We serve clients.

23
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,839
So we will be seeking
their feedback

24
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,508
at every stage
of the Ethicure experience,

25
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,312
because a happy client
is a referring client.

26
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,150
My name is Salen.

27
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,352
Welcome to
the Ethicure family.

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,723
I really want to break this.

29
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,559
Our jobs no longer depend
on saving lives,

30
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,361
but how many smiley faces
get punched.

31
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,129
It's cute.
<i>Thank you!</i>

32
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:38,132
She's just
incentivizing niceness.

33
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,235
You of all people
do not want to be rated
by how nice you are.

34
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,272
I can't fake saving lives,
but being nice?

35
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,274
Way easier to game.

36
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,276
It counts your steps,
your pulse ox,

37
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,280
monitors when you sleep,
warns you
when you're stressed,

38
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:55,583
and stores
a thousand playlists.

39
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,051
If it vibrated,
I'd marry it.
Jordan.

40
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,888
Ethicure knows
where we are,
what we're listening to,

41
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,090
how we're sleeping,
maybe even
who we're sleeping with.

42
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,626
It also tracks paranoia.

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,261
You're fine
with all of this?

44
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,596
I mean,
it's great if you are,

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,098
but change is sometimes
tricky for you.

46
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,966
I was concerned,

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,736
but Ethicure's changes
seem reasonable
and data-driven.

48
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,571
I think we should start
by picking a cake.

49
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,407
You prioritized the cake,

50
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,242
over the date,
the venue,
the caterer...

51
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,076
I like cake.

52
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,213
I've compiled a list
of the most popular ones.

53
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,714
What is
your favorite cake?

54
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,616
Whatever you think
our guests will like.

55
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,451
There is no such thing
as bad cake.

56
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,753
Whew.
Take a good look.

57
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,555
You won't be
seeing much of me
for a while.

58
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,559
I'll be very busy turning
a good program into a bad one.

59
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:39,627
Yeah.

60
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,398
Shaun.

61
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,601
Shaun.

62
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,339
Oh.

63
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,173
Love you.

64
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,211
She's hemorrhaging.

65
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,946
Ultrasound to
assess etiology.

66
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,848
Hanging blood and fluids,
starting pressers.

67
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,519
The baby's placenta
is covering the cervix.

68
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,187
The baby's brachycardic.
Mom needs C-section, STAT.

69
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,694
You'll need to stay here.

70
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,363
Can't let her
out of my sight, Doctor.

71
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,664
She's doing life
for murdering her first baby.

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,582
I'm up there
for two gallbladders.

73
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,517
Do you know
I completed my residency?

74
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,218
Blame SurgiMatch.

75
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,020
I mean, I wouldn't have
put you on the schedule at all

76
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,690
until you at least knew
where the bathrooms were.

77
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,958
Oh, come on, <i>guapa,</i>
look at all this stuff.

78
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,396
I'm a kid in a candy store
and I'm starving to death.

79
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,064
Please don't call me <i>guapa</i>
at work.

80
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,933
Yes, Audrey.

81
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,001
Bosses have
first names, too.

82
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,838
What do you think of her?
I'm not a fan

83
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,673
of an algorithm
telling me what to do.

84
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:00,841
This thing
did a great job

85
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,243
filling up my dance card
for the next week.

86
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,212
She knows what I like.

87
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,781
Good to have you on board.
Glad to be here.

88
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,883
Not all of our dance cards
are full.

89
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,752
Mind if I tag along
on your morning rounds,

90
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,387
maybe show me
where the bathrooms are?

91
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,955
Sure.

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,390
Let's cha-cha.

93
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,596
I looked up her case.

94
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,097
Abby Clemmis was charged

95
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,334
with poisoning her baby
with antifreeze.

96
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,404
She pleaded not guilty
and got pregnant again
before the trial.

97
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,072
But when
she was convicted,

98
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,308
her boyfriend,
like everybody else,
stopped believing her.

99
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,710
Oh, boo-hoo.

100
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,912
Stay focused.
You're now being timed.

101
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,514
All part of the
productivity metric.

102
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,856
Forget the timer.
It takes as long as it takes.

103
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,394
I like knowing
how long it takes.

104
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,733
It was probably
postpartum depression.

105
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,469
Doesn't make the baby
any less dead.

106
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,604
But we might have
a little sympathy.

107
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,139
Because women are helpless
victims of our hormones?

108
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,241
Like people who should be
treated rather than punished.

109
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,810
What's your favorite cake?

110
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,315
Lea and I need to pick a cake
for our wedding.

111
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,750
Angel food cake.

112
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,786
Packing peanuts
have more flavor.

113
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,489
Anything with
cream cheese frosting.

114
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:22,790
I'd eat dog poop
with that on it.

115
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,927
Oh, please, uh, don't let me
distract you.

116
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,267
So, Salen,
it's great to see you again.

117
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:36,269
I loved how
you kicked the tires
on this place.

118
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,205
Nice due diligence.

119
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,584
What a beautiful sound.

120
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,154
Discharge them.

121
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,957
Uh, we have a 48-hour
post-op monitoring policy.

122
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,026
And now we have
a new policy.

123
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,894
As soon as they're stable,
you'll discharge them,

124
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,631
to make way
for other clients in need.

125
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,206
This is Madeline, came in
experiencing dizziness

126
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,543
and severe nausea
after running
in a college track meet.

127
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,210
And winning the 100 meter.

128
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,513
Urine analysis
and abdominal X-ray
were normal.

129
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,015
I could try a G.I. cocktail
to rule out gastritis.

130
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,684
Sit back here.

131
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,188
Any pain here?

132
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,323
I just set a state record.

133
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,925
It's heat exhaustion
and dehydration.

134
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,727
You sprint in full face?

135
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,729
I doubt my makeup could run
faster than I do.

136
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,498
I ran track in college.

137
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,533
Mmm?
I found the makeup

138
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,968
really helped.

139
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,202
You feel well enough
to step up on the scanner?

140
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,537
Yeah.

141
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,142
Inset your hand here.

142
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,245
<i>Scanning.</i>

143
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,449
It even knows
what you had for breakfast.

144
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,017
Perfusion's good,

145
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,052
pulses are strong.

146
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,988
Not surprisingly, you're in
top physical condition.

147
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,255
I told you, it's just...

148
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,027
She's hypoxic!

149
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,663
We need to suction
and protect her airway.

150
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,011
Meggie, my baby...

151
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,278
She's fine.

152
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,880
Seven pounds, three ounces,

153
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:30,383
and, uh, the lungs
of an opera singer.

154
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,786
Can I see her?

155
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,155
Just a peek through a window,
anything...

156
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,857
That's not possible.

157
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,726
We're gonna start
processing your discharge.

158
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,130
After we run a few more tests,
just to be safe.

159
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,035
I know you're feeling
overwhelmed right now,

160
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:52,606
and I'm sure you'll be
experiencing anxiety, sadness.

161
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,242
If you do suffer
from postpartum depression,

162
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,077
you'll need to get help.

163
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,213
I sure didn't have that
with Troy.

164
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,284
Those were the most wonderful
days of my life.

165
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,926
So, that means I'm either
a victim or a monster.

166
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,363
Pick a side.

167
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,073
We stopped the bleeding,
but your CT confirmed

168
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,309
a lesion in your lung.

169
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,912
Which may be benign,
but we have to do a biopsy
to know for sure.

170
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,848
If I had a lesion
in my lung,

171
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,516
wouldn't that
be slowing me down?

172
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,753
The rest of your lung
is healthy
and compensating very well.

173
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,989
Any history of lung disease
in your family?

174
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,991
I don't know.
A medical history can help

175
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,126
dictate diagnostic
and treatment options.

176
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,695
Can we contact
your family?

177
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,164
No, um...
my parents are...

178
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,532
They're...
Your mother's here.

179
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,469
Are you okay, Madeline?

180
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,373
That's not my mother.

181
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,575
My parents died
two years ago.

182
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,520
I was a toddler when she
gave me up for adoption,

183
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,922
and then went back
to Cameroon...

184
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,158
I didn't give you up.
I was deported.

185
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,560
I let you stay in America
so you could
have a better life.

186
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:27,034
Welcome back. I worked
in Cameroon for a while.

187
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,203
Is it okay if Esther gives us
some medical history?

188
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,939
Does anyone in your family
have high blood pressure?

189
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,142
I do.
Is that the problem?

190
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,377
I told her
she had to watch
what she eats.

191
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,545
She won't listen to me.

192
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,113
And why should I?

193
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,749
I barely know you.

194
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,083
Showing up
at my track meets

195
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,985
doesn't make you
a mother, Esther.

196
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,187
What about high cholesterol?
No.

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,089
In Cameroon,
you don't call elders

198
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,158
by their first name.
Okay.

199
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,761
And you don't show everyone
all your goodies.

200
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,029
Your "parents"
didn't teach you respect.

201
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,869
Abby needs
"a few more tests"?

202
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,537
You just don't want
to send her back to prison.

203
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,273
If she'd been getting
decent healthcare,

204
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,209
they would've caught
the placenta previa long ago.

205
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,080
So if I can delay
sending Abby back there,
I will.

206
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,048
We're discharging her
as soon as possible.

207
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,053
Look at this.

208
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,290
Hypotonia?

209
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,160
She's taking
very little nutrition.

210
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,097
Maybe ultrasound her
for a G.I. tract obstruction?

211
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,432
We could change the formula.
She might just be
a picky eater.

212
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,402
Good point.
I'll try that.

213
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,304
Right after the ultrasound.

214
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,977
Aaron.

215
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,478
Ooh, fishing flies.

216
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,280
Please don't touch.

217
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,782
It's harder
than brain surgery.

218
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,784
Ow!

219
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,825
Your absence
at the presentation
this morning

220
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,626
could be interpreted
as a lack of support.

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,829
You think?

222
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,665
When we first met,
you were a fake patient,

223
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,200
and now you're
a hostile corporate raider.

224
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,136
This hostile
corporate raider

225
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,271
saved your hospital
from being turned into condos.

226
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,806
I resign.

227
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,342
And I hate
your new logo.

228
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,215
You've got
a very loyal following,

229
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,752
many of whom will be very
opposed to this takeover.

230
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,486
You leaving could have
a snowball effect.

231
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,458
My board of directors...
and I

232
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,993
think it's important
for you to stay on.

233
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,995
So you can
draw on my expertise?

234
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,329
Or because
you want a puppet?

235
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,800
Either way,
you've got decent leverage.

236
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,471
Normally, I'd be offering
stock options,

237
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,041
salary incentives,
definitely a larger office,

238
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:51,011
but I suspect
none of those will work.

239
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,016
So maybe, despite it
being a money hole,

240
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,819
I'll just keep
your clinic open.

241
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,153
How's that?

242
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,658
Think about it.

243
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,258
Your baby's not
getting enough nutrition.

244
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,528
Her ultrasound was clear.

245
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,196
I think Meggie needs
her mother's milk.

246
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,186
Hey.

247
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,922
Hey, sweetie.

248
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,069
The biopsy confirmed

249
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,305
the mass in your lung
is malignant melanoma,

250
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,408
stage four.

251
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,578
Your PET scan shows
it's also in the lymph nodes

252
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,015
of your neck, abdomen,
and pelvis.

253
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,288
We'll remove what we can

254
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:45,425
and follow up with molecular
and immunotherapies,

255
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,960
but...

256
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,164
The prognosis isn't good.

257
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,969
Even with all
targeted treatments,

258
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,205
you're unlikely to live
more than 12 months.

259
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,473
No.

260
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,742
I'm healthy.
I'm strong.

261
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,377
I'm so sorry.

262
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,248
Pray, Madeline.
We have to pray.

263
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,649
God will work through
these doctors.

264
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,351
No!

265
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,187
I can't be dying.

266
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,455
I'm going to nationals.

267
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,864
This can't be right.
It's a mistake.

268
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,940
Stop praying!

269
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,077
Stop pretending like
you care about me.
You left me.

270
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,046
I do care.
I love you...

271
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,482
No! My real mother
loved me and accepted me.

272
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,851
I am your mother,
and right now, you need...

273
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,187
No, I don't need
anything from you.

274
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,655
You're nothing.

275
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,690
Please go away.

276
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,113
She's vomiting. Cyanotic
and O2 stats are plummeting.

277
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,414
She's tachycardic.

278
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,848
Intubate.

279
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,357
CBC, BMP,
stool sample, and echo.

280
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,758
And a tox screen
for the mother.

281
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,228
What's with the tox screen?
The mother's fine.

282
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,534
I didn't change
the baby's formula.

283
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,503
I let Abby
breastfeed her.

284
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,071
I'm wondering if there's
something in that breast milk

285
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,372
that made the baby sick.

286
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,108
More likely
it was antifreeze.

287
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,010
Right. She smuggled antifreeze
into the hospital,

288
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,311
from prison,
under armed guard?

289
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,979
It'd be insane.

290
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,380
Like people
who poison their babies.

291
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,556
We'll be using
a basic Ranked-Choice Vote.

292
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,458
It's not as nuanced
as the Kemeny-Young Method,

293
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,926
which minimizes the sum

294
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,495
of the Kendall Tau distances
to the voters' lists,

295
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,233
but I decided that would be
too confusing for you.

296
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,800
Intralesional injection?

297
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,569
Madeline's melanoma
is too widespread.

298
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,304
Only used for
locoregional disease.

299
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,306
This carrot cake is amazing.
Mmm.

300
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,975
How about
peptide vaccine?

301
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,411
Very high risk for immune
attacks against normal tissue.

302
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,214
Ugh. Does anybody really like
red velvet cake?

303
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,982
It reminds me
of a dumb model,

304
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,684
it's delicious-looking
but not worth the calories.

305
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,586
Mmm.

306
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,422
Complete lymph node
dissection.

307
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,790
The lymphedema
would be intolerable.

308
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,261
People die here, too,
you know?

309
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,064
It's my first day.
I haven't learned that yet.

310
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,631
Wait, there's no way
this thing knows
I'm eating dessert, right?

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,502
I have been
thinking about cake
all day.

312
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,742
Oh, don't let me
interrupt you.

313
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,611
You already have.

314
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,246
And since you won't be invited
to my wedding,

315
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,648
you don't get a vote.
Or cake.

316
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,188
You have
an interesting affect.

317
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,822
Are you on
the autism spectrum?

318
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,861
Please fill out
your ballot.

319
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,963
I'm neuroatypical myself.

320
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,832
ADHD.
Mmm.

321
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,167
Okay.

322
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,540
You should look at
Engineered T Cell therapy.

323
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,055
They're all good.
That's very unhelpful.

324
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,657
I've polled 12 people.

325
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,226
The cakes that got
the most "loves"

326
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,661
also got the most "hates,"
and the only cake
that no one hated

327
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,995
is one
that no one loved.

328
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,233
Why aren't you working?

329
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,567
'Cause I'm tasting cake.

330
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,339
Shaun, I...

331
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,407
I have to tell you,
I'm...

332
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,042
I'm thinking
of taking a break,

333
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,944
of moving on.

334
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,045
On to fishing?

335
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,548
Maybe. Maybe not.

336
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,517
Uh, probably not.
I don't really like fishing.

337
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,852
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

338
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,520
Are you sad about Debbie?

339
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,223
Yeah.

340
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,925
Yeah, I am.
But you know what?

341
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,928
She wasn't happy,
so it's probably for the best,

342
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,798
and right now, I just
think I want to take
some time for myself.

343
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,900
You want to be alone?

344
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,336
I like people.

345
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,438
I just think
I need to be around
different people.

346
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,607
Different from me?
No. No.

347
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,577
I just think I need
a big change, you know?

348
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,212
Well, there are
plenty of changes here.

349
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,646
Yeah, none that I like,

350
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,148
except maybe
the iced coffee,

351
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,383
surprisingly good
for a cafeteria.

352
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,389
How are you coping?

353
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,260
I need you to help me
pick the right cake.

354
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,961
Shaun,
it's your wedding.

355
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,864
Be selfish.
Pick the cake
that you like.

356
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,737
I've got no wife.
I've got no kid.

357
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,840
I'm soon to have no job.

358
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,342
And I could get
really depressed,

359
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,643
but I'm not gonna do that.

360
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,946
I'm gonna embrace it.
I'm gonna embrace freedom.

361
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,949
And for once in my life,
I'm not gonna care
about anything else.

362
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,587
I'm glad you have
such a positive outlook.

363
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,423
You didn't help
with the cake.

364
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,734
We've scheduled your surgery,
after which, we'll start you

365
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,803
on an aggressive course
of molecular
and immunotherapy.

366
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,874
So you'll make me
sicker first,
and then I'll die.

367
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,344
This could offer you several
more months of healthy l...

368
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,812
Engineered T Cell therapy.

369
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,583
It's an experimental
treatment

370
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:47,987
that teaches
your immune system
to fight the cancer.

371
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,622
Your body could cure itself.

372
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,629
You're off my case.

373
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,131
The technology's here.

374
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,668
The trial is available.
Why not use it?

375
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,237
You were there
to observe and learn,
not diagnose and treat.

376
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,572
You're not her doctor.

377
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,807
She doesn't have
specific mutations

378
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,376
for most molecular
therapies to work...

379
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,777
He offered her a treatment

380
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,012
that wasn't approved
by me, you, or the FDA.

381
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,382
That's a violation
of protocol,
not to mention, it...

382
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,650
The Wi-Fi's good
in here, right?

383
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,653
Just need to answer
some e-mails.

384
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,560
Oh, please,
continue your discussion.

385
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,034
Sorry for
the overstep, Marcus,

386
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,539
but I do feel T Cell therapy
is a more effective option.

387
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,743
Well, Mateo, the trials
were isolated,

388
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,679
small sample,
and not very encouraging.

389
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,117
Infection could kill her
way before the cancer would.

390
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,989
And what about the patient?
What does she want?

391
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,429
It was presented to her
as a somewhat
magical solution.

392
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,696
Sh...
I like magic.

393
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,634
Did you want to weigh in?

394
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,637
Oh, no.
I'm... I'm not a doctor.

395
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,705
I do have two
doctorates, though,

396
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,507
neurotech and data science.

397
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,110
Not helpful. Right.

398
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,722
Give the client
what she wants.

399
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,495
This is my case.

400
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,296
It doesn't have to be.

401
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,909
Abby's tox screen
is clean.

402
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,811
Whatever the baby got, she
didn't get it from the mother.

403
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,146
At least not
accidentally.

404
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,483
Sometimes, telling the guilty
from the innocent

405
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,784
is harder than you think.

406
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,388
It just got easier.

407
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,758
There are traces of antifreeze
in the baby's blood.

408
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,671
Doctor.

409
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,974
How's Madeline?

410
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,377
The Chief of Surgery
took over her case.

411
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,613
She's in
the very best of hands.

412
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,182
Can I see her?

413
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,820
I don't think she's ready.

414
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:40,727
I made a huge sacrifice
when I left her in America.

415
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,195
I never thought
she'd be so ungrateful.

416
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,199
Those people turned her
against her culture,

417
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,835
against me.

418
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,271
But that's my fault.

419
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,708
I let her go.

420
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:02,515
You gave Madeline up
out of love.

421
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,384
Don't let regret
blind you from
seeing how wonderful she is.

422
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,223
And as for the people
who made her that way?

423
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:14,827
Be grateful for all
the sacrifices they made.

424
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:28,207
I used to be
a lot like you.

425
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,943
If I was like you,

426
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,812
Esther would love it.

427
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,514
Don't let
the white coat fool you.

428
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,483
I have some ink, too.

429
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,717
I just keep it covered
at work.

430
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,520
My mother doesn't
like it, either.

431
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,857
My mom was
a total hippie.

432
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,260
She didn't care
if I painted my face blue.

433
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,730
She just wanted me
to be happy...

434
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,603
no matter what else
was going on.

435
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:59,872
Do you think she'd want you
to go through this alone?

436
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,382
I'm here
for another look.

437
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,588
You came home
after I went to bed
and left before I woke up.

438
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,123
It's this re-programming.

439
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,458
It's so frustrating,
I may start punching things.

440
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,796
Make a list.

441
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,733
Of every single step that is
required to complete your task

442
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,067
and then cross off each...

443
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,002
Shaun, this isn't about
a heavy workload.

444
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,839
It's about doing something
that I know
is a waste of time.

445
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,608
But you still need
to do it,

446
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,276
and this will
solve your issue.

447
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,545
I don't want a solution.

448
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,813
I don't need a solution.
I just want to vent.

449
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,314
Okay.

450
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,684
It is very difficult

451
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,452
to find a cake
that everyone likes.

452
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:47,920
Oh, I get it.

453
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,224
N-No.
I don't want to vent.

454
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,826
I just want a solution.

455
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,962
I wish I had one for you,
Shaun, but I don't.

456
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,430
Fresh out of solutions.
The solution well is dry.

457
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:03,936
Y-You always tell me
to use my words

458
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,773
and explain how I'm feeling,
but I did that,

459
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,308
and I think it
only made you
more upset.

460
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,111
You're right.
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,351
And...you have just solved
my problem, so thank you.

462
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,698
Your baby's still
in critical condition,

463
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,833
but we're now treating her
for ethylene glycol poisoning.

464
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,537
We found antifreeze
in her blood.

465
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,773
We're forwarding
this information
to the authorities.

466
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,479
You can't let this happen.

467
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,981
Not again.

468
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,685
Don't let Meggie die,
please.

469
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,326
BP's dropping,
heart rate's crashing.

470
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,227
Crash cart!

471
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:12,404
That's an Ethicure smile.

472
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,175
She might have had
a uterine tear

473
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,844
in the wake
of her C-section.

474
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,612
We'd see it
on the ultrasound.

475
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,413
Ah.

476
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,849
Ah. Badges are gonna have
bigger photos,

477
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,317
so we need bigger smiles.

478
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,920
Coag profile and CBC
rule out D.I.C.

479
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,355
Bowel perforation?

480
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,757
Park's exposure was...

481
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,424
You can do
better than that.
Just...

482
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,796
Sunshine!

483
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,066
Next.

484
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,736
Park's exposure was perfect,
as were my sutures.

485
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,937
No perforations.

486
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,238
Now, just imagine

487
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,408
you live somewhere
perpetually warm and sunny.

488
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,744
Wait, you do.

489
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,946
Work with what you got.

490
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,749
Overdistended uterus
and atony?

491
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:59,251
Consistent with time of onset,
clinical history,

492
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,187
and the fact
that we can't stop
the bleeding.

493
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,955
Yeah, she needs
a hysterectomy.

494
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,057
So she never gets pregnant
again? Win-win.

495
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,061
Win.

496
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,629
She's guilty, Park.
And I'm gonna prove it.

497
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,965
How?
I'm gonna ask her.

498
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,070
Salen.
Hi. Uh, I'm Lea.

499
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,139
We met in the server room
a few days ago.

500
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,008
You were pretending
to be a patient,

501
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,812
which I feel was dishonest
and manipulative

502
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,079
You don't like me.
Duly noted.

503
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,981
No, no,
I just think it's important

504
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,784
for people to explain
how they're feeling.

505
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:34,486
I did judge you, but I have
noticed positive things,

506
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,356
like more efficient
sharing of external EHRs

507
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,192
and a streamlined system to
fast-track hospital transfers.

508
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,063
So perhaps I was being too
harsh... Are we going in a...

509
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,932
Just moved up
to grudging respect.

510
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,634
And I hope this isn't headed
for fawning admiration.

511
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,938
No. The programming
I'm working on
is complicated, redundant,

512
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,439
and, quite frankly,
pointless.

513
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,474
I can design something
much better.

514
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,578
How long have you been
programming?

515
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,849
Four years. Ish.

516
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,855
You went to U Pitt,
got your degree
in three years,

517
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,823
designed and built
cars, desktops,

518
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:14,293
and entire coding systems
from the ground up.

519
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,828
And the ransomware attempt
that you thwarted

520
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,129
saved this place
a fortune.

521
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:22,134
And I love that you don't
come from I.T. theory.

522
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,736
You obviously don't come
from sales, either,

523
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,372
because you really don't know
how to pitch yourself.
Yeah.

524
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,875
But I'd love to hear about
this better program.

525
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,043
You wanna grab
a kombucha?

526
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,344
Yeah.

527
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,946
I-I would love that.

528
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,417
This anesthetic cocktail
of Versed and Pentothal

529
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,019
makes people
tell the truth.

530
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,661
Abby? I have
a few questions for you.

531
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:52,598
Not talking to you,
you stone-hearted bitch.

532
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,166
It's working.

533
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,538
Abby, do you know
what happened
to your babies?

534
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,177
Do you know
why they got sick?

535
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,082
'Cause I'm a bad mother?

536
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,550
Because you gave them
antifreeze.

537
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:18,190
Because I couldn't
protect them.

538
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,194
Abby,

539
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,064
did you kill
your first baby?

540
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,968
I could never
hurt my babies.

541
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,205
I'm their mommy.

542
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,649
These scrubs have
very rough seams.

543
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,341
Do you think Audrey would have
made a different decision

544
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,243
if I hadn't been in the room
last night?

545
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,248
Do you?

546
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,419
I know she has a personal
interest in Mateo's success,

547
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,155
because
he's her boyfriend.

548
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,790
And I think
how he appears to me

549
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,758
is important
to that success, no?

550
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:36,135
Audrey is a highly principled
professional and a great boss.

551
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,772
I like you.

552
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,059
You re-ran
all the baby's tests?

553
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,628
Using gas chromatography
analysis.

554
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,163
In case
we missed something.

555
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,298
Good call.

556
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,802
The baby's still
in critical condition.

557
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:13,472
If it is antifreeze,
why isn't she getting better?

558
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,907
I have no idea.

559
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,511
Same, same, same.

560
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,317
I've solved it.

561
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,189
We will stack
all five varieties

562
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,524
and serve
a quadruple-tiered cake.

563
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:35,127
Yes, four. Not five.

564
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,463
Five flavors, four tiers,
because Devil's food

565
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,298
and red velvet
are actually both chocolate.

566
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,967
The only difference is
one uses natural cocoa

567
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,468
and the other uses
Dutch-process cocoa,

568
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,370
which is alkalized
with potassium carbonate.

569
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,339
A very minor
molecular difference.

570
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,645
They're not the same.

571
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,687
A very minor
molecular difference.

572
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,921
It's not antifreeze.

573
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,256
It's propionic acid,

574
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,692
which appears
identical to antifreeze

575
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,860
on all tests
except gas chromatography.

576
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,332
Propionic acid
is made by the body,

577
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,101
if that body
happens to be afflicted

578
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,236
with
methylmalonic acidemia,

579
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,370
which is
a genetic condition.

580
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,073
Her first baby
probably had it, too.

581
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,109
It was Abby's
breast milk,

582
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,376
not because it contained
a toxin,

583
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,345
but because
it contained proteins

584
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,280
that triggered
production of the acid.

585
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,382
She is innocent.

586
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:48,434
They said
I might find you in here.

587
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,670
Something about
the big doughnut
I find very calming.

588
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,443
You're here
to accept my offer.

589
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,413
I used to be
a pretty decent poker player.

590
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:02,481
You developed a tell.

591
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,318
How much am I increasing
the clinic budget?

592
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:07,419
Double.

593
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,724
If that's what it costs
to keep you engaged.

594
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,994
Oh, no. No. You don't have
enough money for that.

595
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,330
The clinic can run
perfectly fine without me.

596
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:21,033
So can everything else
in this place.

597
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:25,137
I plan on taking my role
as puppet very seriously.

598
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,407
So what do I get
for my money?

599
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,610
Exactly what you asked for...
my support.

600
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:35,447
I plan on smiling and nodding
through this transition,

601
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:38,050
and nary a negative word
will cross my lips.

602
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,252
That's a much more passive
interpretation of "support"

603
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,520
than I had in mind.

604
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,922
Mmm. I'm not the only one
with a tell.

605
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,460
Welcome to
the Ethicure family.

606
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,239
We got all of the tumor.

607
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,541
And based on
the T Cell response
to your tumor cells,

608
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,176
we're very optimistic.

609
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,505
The day I gave you away,

610
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,508
I put you
in the prettiest
pink dress

611
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,911
and tied bows
in your hair.

612
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,218
I stared at you,

613
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:49,955
trying to memorize
every curve
of your little face.

614
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,530
I started to cry,
but you,

615
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:03,302
you, my strong
<i>petite fille,</i>

616
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,704
wiped the tears
from my face.

617
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,076
"Don't cry, <i>Maman.</i>

618
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,044
"Don't cry."

619
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,386
I gave my heart away
that day,

620
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,255
and over time,
I grew to hate
the people who took it,

621
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,958
who took you.

622
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,773
But without their love
and their sacrifice,

623
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,576
you wouldn't be
the amazing girl
that you are,

624
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,580
and I love them
for that.

625
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,791
Maybe where I come from

626
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,261
has a little bit to do
with how great I am.

627
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,400
Maybe we can be friends.

628
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,605
Work our way up to...
<i>Famille.</i>

629
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,979
I would like that
very much.

630
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:30,489
Tell me about
your <i>maman.</i>

631
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,799
It wasn't antifreeze
making your baby sick.

632
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,535
She has
a metabolic disorder,

633
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,804
which we're
treating her for now.

634
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,306
Meggie's gonna be
just fine.

635
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:05,324
We think
Troy had the same thing.

636
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,493
You were a victim.

637
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,060
We've let the authorities
know that, too.

638
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,501
I'm sorry, Abby.

639
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,622
Congratulations.

640
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,790
I hear the results of your
procedure were very promising.

641
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,559
You two
make quite a team.

642
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,894
Thanks.

643
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,232
Do you have an office?

644
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,667
Maybe.

645
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,769
I remember my assistant
saying something about that.

646
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,037
Uh, do you know
what happened

647
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,073
with Bernice Fisher
and Derrick Bell?

648
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,109
Your surgeries
from yesterday.

649
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,779
I rescheduled them when
I took over Madeline's case.

650
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,116
Did you schedule Derrick
at San Jose General?

651
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,785
Because that's
where he's being treated now.

652
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,524
And what about, uh,
Stanley Ferlin,

653
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,426
Kelly Jarnigan,
and Thelma Sewell?

654
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,228
Those are my consults, and
I'm seeing them all tomorrow.

655
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:20,932
Wonderful.
Except Kelly was awaiting
cancer biopsy results.

656
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,968
Twenty-four hours
is a lifetime
to put that off.

657
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,239
So you're comparing
scheduling issues

658
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,975
to saving
a young woman's life?

659
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,744
All of our clients'
experiences matter, Mateo.

660
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,451
I understand
your license is provisional.

661
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,800
Who you writing
the article with?

662
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,167
I mean, T Cell therapy
on melanoma,

663
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,769
it's kind of a big deal.

664
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,140
But, you know, I got to assist
on two appies, a chole,

665
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,377
and a hip replacement,
so...there.

666
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,779
Not a lot of steps.

667
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:10,716
I just hit 11,000.

668
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,283
Mmm.
That's impressive.

669
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:13,652
Mmm-hmm.

670
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,956
'Course it's no 22,378.

671
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,958
It doesn't measure steps.

672
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:20,959
It measures how many times
you move your wrist

673
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,995
in rhythmic motion.

674
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,633
So you log a quarter-mile
anytime you have
some "me time"?

675
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,167
I haven't had any time
for that, either.

676
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,736
Mmm.

677
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,505
I just strapped it
to a dialysis pump.

678
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,373
That's clever.
Mmm.

679
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,576
It's also cheating.

680
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,010
It's only cheating
if the rules have merit.

681
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,817
Vive la revolution.

682
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,994
Regrets are for when
you make a mistake,

683
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,396
not for when you do
the right thing.

684
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,534
I can handle Dr. Andrews.

685
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:10,876
After we took his case,
made him look bad?

686
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,212
Andrews is gonna "supervise"
the hell out of you.

687
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,615
I'm not worried.

688
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,484
You know why?

689
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,520
Because, <i>guapa,</i>

690
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,857
I get to see you
every day,

691
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,427
and that makes
everything wonderful.

692
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:47,946
I solved
our cake problem.

693
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:51,249
We serve them all?

694
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,719
Kinda brilliant, Shaunie.

695
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:56,722
I am
quite proud of myself.

696
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,624
I solved my problem, too.

697
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:01,359
I pitched my program idea
to Salen, and she loved it.

698
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,296
Mmm...

699
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,599
This soap is different.

700
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,168
And I'm proud of you, too.

701
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,338
You've done an amazing job
with all these new changes,

702
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,574
especially those scrubs,
which you look super cute in.

703
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,609
What? No.
They're itchy.

704
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,545
We'll wash them,

705
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,412
try some unscented
fabric softener.

706
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,882
Okay, this soap
won't come off.

707
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,283
Okay, no rush.

708
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,452
Paper towels?

709
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:30,321
Oh. I think
they got rid of them
for sanitary reasons.

710
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,092
No! No.

711
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,794
No.

712
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,029
No. S-Stop it.
No. Okay.

713
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,164
Okay, Sha... Oh.
No.

714
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,166
Stop it.

715
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,868
I-I can't, Shaun. Breathe.
Stop it. No, please stop it.

716
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:43,935
It'll be okay. If you just
step away from it...

717
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,804
No. Please. S-Stop it!
Yeah. It's okay.

718
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,506
Shaun?
Stop it! Stop it!

719
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,743
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You're gonna be okay.
Shaun.
