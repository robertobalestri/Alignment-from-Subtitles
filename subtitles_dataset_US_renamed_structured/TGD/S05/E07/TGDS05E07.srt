1
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:09,277
This might be
the first place we've visited
that feels right.

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,979
That's good.

3
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,447
But, Shaun,
we really need to

4
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,449
talk about something
non-wedding related.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,932
Oh, it's perfect.

6
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,968
Yes, and it is the only venue
available on our date

7
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,037
that meets
all our criteria.

8
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,906
I'll stand
at the altar.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,174
You walk down
the aisle.

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,542
Okay.

11
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,662
The fireplace tile,
is that original?

12
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,231
Uh,
I have no idea.

13
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,398
Well,
let's say it is.

14
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:05,866
If you want to up
the curb appeal,

15
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,335
maybe a fresh coat of paint,
some landscaping...

16
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,469
"As-is"
is just fine.

17
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,703
How soon can we
sell the place?

18
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,773
We'll get multiple bids
on day one.

19
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,907
Oh, great.

20
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,579
Hi, Aaron.

21
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,586
Shelly Carroll,
Ethan Ray Realty.

22
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,155
Ilana Reeves, ex-wife.

23
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,096
We should drop off
this agreement

24
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,865
with our deposit check
tomorrow.

25
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,100
Once I explain the issue
to the pastor,

26
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm sure he will replace
the problematic floorboards.

27
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,974
Shaunie, there's something
I really need to tell you.

28
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,509
S-Stop!

29
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,112
I'll call 911.

30
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,085
Hello,
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

31
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,453
Where are you hurt?

32
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,222
It's my hand.

33
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,924
Your fourth and fifth
fingers are broken.

34
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,459
If you have
no other injuries...

35
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,361
Shaun! Over here!

36
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,971
Hello, hi,
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
Are you injured?

37
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,474
My leg's trapped.

38
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,575
My chest hurts
when I breathe.

39
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,579
How far along
is your pregnancy?

40
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,582
Twenty-six weeks.

41
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,519
Do you think
my baby's okay?

42
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,987
I have no way
of knowing...

43
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,390
...but you have tachycardia
and your jugular is distended,

44
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,158
which are signs of
a cardiac tamponade.

45
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,594
If I don't drain it,
you'll die before
the paramedics arrive.

46
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,644
Sorry about the mess.

47
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,184
Uh, Debbie talk you into
a fresh start?

48
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,321
No, no.

49
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,824
Um, we didn't exactly
work out.

50
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,161
Oh, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,796
Yeah, me, too.

52
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:21,001
But I am moving to
a small town in Montana,

53
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,871
which, hopefully, you know,
will be good for me.

54
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,111
Aaron,
I need your help.

55
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,647
It's my husband,
Sunil.

56
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,216
He's dying.

57
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,656
What's your name?

58
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,224
Alma.

59
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,559
Alma.
Hi, I'm Lea.

60
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,061
Is there anyone
you need me to call?

61
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,798
Uh, um, no.
My... My boyfriend's
out of town.

62
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,834
What are you gonna
do with that?

63
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,069
A subxiphoid
pericardiocentesis.

64
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,306
An echo-guided one
would be better,

65
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,675
but I don't have a J-tipped wire,
or an echo machine.

66
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,511
Maybe we should wait
for the paramedics.

67
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,346
Alma,
you can trust him.

68
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:11,685
My...chest...
is...exploding.

69
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,195
Okay, hold.

70
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,685
You are very lucky.

71
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,487
We usually don't drive
to work this way.

72
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,092
His diagnosis is
Lewy Body Dementia.

73
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,294
Oh.

74
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,729
How long has he had
the symptoms?

75
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,130
It began
two years ago.

76
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,901
Insomnia, muscle weakness,
agitation.

77
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,572
Recently, he's started having
bouts of confusion.

78
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,376
We found an experimental trial
that uses deep brain stimulation

79
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,945
to slow cognitive
deterioration.

80
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,615
Would you look at it,
see if it's worth it?

81
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,852
There are so many
more doctors

82
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,154
with more experience in
this field than I have.

83
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,257
Aaron, I... I need somebody
who's gonna give me the truth,

84
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,961
so we don't waste
what time we have left.

85
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,902
How many clients
have been referred

86
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,103
for elective procedures
from the clinic?

87
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,471
Forty-three.

88
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,239
Those satisfied clients
will lead to more.

89
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:43,176
And the automated intake screens
have cut labor costs by 8%.

90
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,212
But the nurses don't like it.
They think they're next.

91
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,049
Handle them right,
they'll get over it.

92
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,484
If you have specific
thoughts on that,

93
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,185
I'd love to hear them.

94
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,121
Maybe over lunch?

95
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,891
Morgan, you excel at
striking the right balance

96
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,060
between enthusiasm
and obsequiousness.

97
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,161
Thank you.

98
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,930
Instead of lunch,

99
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,032
how about you and Alex
have dinner with Marcus and me?

100
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,300
Marcus...

101
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,335
Marcus Andrews?

102
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,803
It'll be a hoot.

103
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,743
Twenty-three-year-old
pregnant female,

104
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,545
blunt chest trauma
from a car accident.

105
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,680
I performed a subxiphoid
pericardiocentesis

106
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,982
at the scene
with a gas siphon.

107
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,383
Cool? Is the baby...

108
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,385
Fetal heart rate is normal,
no signs of distress.

109
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,320
Mother became hemodynamically
unstable en route.

110
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:28,889
She needs surgery
for internal bleeding.

111
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:32,426
Okay, keep rolling.
Keep rolling!

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,462
We're gonna do
a couple of tests

113
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,997
to get a sense of
your cognitive state,

114
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,600
and then we're gonna
throw you in the MRI,

115
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,469
the big donut,
very loud,

116
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,605
to see if you're right for
the deep brain stimulation.

117
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,839
Any questions?

118
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,008
None.

119
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,810
What I know or don't know
about the medicine

120
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,545
will not change
the outcome.

121
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,246
A patient who doesn't think
they know more than their doctors

122
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,215
is rare these days.

123
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,151
Implicit social contracts
are my field of study.

124
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,087
They're the agreements
we make daily,

125
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,254
often without
even realizing.

126
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,227
But perhaps that's
a conversation for another...

127
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,434
Who are you?

128
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,538
Why are we here?

129
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,606
Sunil? Sunil?

130
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,773
Uh...

131
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,274
You're right where
you're supposed to be.

132
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,744
Take a deep breath.

133
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,548
Tell me
their names.

134
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,787
Pavan.

135
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,557
Reema.

136
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,058
And little Raj.

137
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,395
Good.

138
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,600
Some spells pass a little
more quickly than others.

139
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,335
I... I think
I'm okay now.

140
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:49,770
Sunil.

141
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,471
Hmm?

142
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,940
Do you remember
why you're here?

143
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,911
Because I'm dying.

144
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,515
Let's get started
with those tests.

145
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,756
Sunil's MRI shows
no contraindication

146
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,923
to deep brain
stimulation.

147
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,992
Initial labs
look good.

148
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,094
He's a great
candidate.

149
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,129
Is the coat hanging in
my closet
your "good" blazer?

150
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,232
It's my only blazer,
so, yes.

151
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,101
Get it dry-cleaned.

152
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,803
For our dinner with
Andrews and Salen.

153
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,573
As intriguing as
that pairing is,

154
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,439
dinner's a hard pass.

155
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:27,808
Not an option.

156
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,777
But compensation
is fair.

157
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,712
We can finally binge
The Wire.

158
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,814
Your first offer doesn't get
you off the couch, and...

159
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,248
Wait,
Andrews and Salen?

160
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,684
Game respects game.

161
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,285
And sometimes
sleeps with it.

162
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,987
Tickets for you and Kellan
to a UFC fight in Vegas.

163
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,122
Still no.

164
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,057
But save that thought
for his birthday.

165
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,726
Salen and Andrews?

166
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,328
They may have one soul
between them.

167
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,464
Any sign of
motor weakness?

168
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,333
He's gonna have to
tolerate the head frame.

169
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,235
Here's
the cervical spine MRI.

170
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,806
We could replicate
the DBS trial on site.

171
00:08:58,939 --> 00:08:59,873
I'd be happy to
coordinate.

172
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,575
Oh, that's very
kind of you.

173
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,343
Are you sure
you're gonna have time

174
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,546
while you overhaul my clinic
into an Ethicure profit center?

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,481
Oh, and by the way,
I'm gonna need my office back.

176
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,349
I hope
you don't mind.

177
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,321
Parathyroid looks off.
Hmm.

178
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,189
Is that
an ectopic lesion?

179
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,558
He's had a history
of renal stones.

180
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:19,827
I don't...

181
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,763
What were his calcium
and PTH levels?

182
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,932
They were only
mildly elevated.

183
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,566
Nothing that triggered
for the workup.

184
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,803
What are you
thinking?

185
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,908
I'm thinking this may not be
Lewy Body Dementia.

186
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,854
Repairing the ventricular
tear with Prolene sutures.

187
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:50,023
No remaining
arterial or major bleeds.

188
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,726
Good. I'd prefer not to
have to open her belly.

189
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,595
I would like both of you
to wear socks to my wedding.

190
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,266
No shoes.
Just socks.

191
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,903
Lea and I found
a nearly perfect church,
but the floor squeaks.

192
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,006
Should make for
some interesting pictures.

193
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,407
No.

194
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,742
No way
you are robbing me

195
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,411
of a chance to show off
my new Bruno Maglis.

196
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,381
Also, wet and stinky feet are
not in Lea's dream wedding.

197
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,651
That's...
probably true.

198
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,820
Last suture is in.

199
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,789
Dr. Allen,
how's the baby?

200
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,023
Heart rate
is stable.

201
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,558
Okay. Next step,
get her down to imaging.

202
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,961
We need a surgical plan for
these pelvic fractures

203
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,262
before they cause
any more bleeding.

204
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,107
Aaron! Aaron!

205
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,144
I didn't expect a miracle,
but thank you.

206
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,713
He's not
out of the woods yet.

207
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,047
He still has
a lesion.

208
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,949
Okay, hopefully benign,
hopefully removable.

209
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,617
I heard you.
Really?

210
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,120
Most people stop listening
after they hear the very bad news,

211
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,387
or, in this case,
the very good news.

212
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,423
Okay, the nuclear study
this afternoon, I got it.

213
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,590
What happened with
Debbie?

214
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,731
Why did my impulsive,
whirlwind marriage

215
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,833
to a gun-toting barista
not work out?

216
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,901
Hmm.

217
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,737
You're hurt.
Do I look hurt?

218
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,838
I just saved a man.

219
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,039
I know how you
hold onto things.

220
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,440
And I know how you try
to fix things

221
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,942
and you try to fix
everyone.

222
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,810
I'm okay.
Talk to me.

223
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,511
'Cause I doubt very much
you're talking to anybody else.

224
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,220
I was myself, and up close
and personal,

225
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,122
Debbie didn't like
what she saw.

226
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,959
She...

227
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,729
She said I was
controlling and selfish.

228
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,299
Did you tell her
she was right?

229
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,501
Well, yeah,
'cause she was.

230
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,136
It didn't help.

231
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,338
What's in Montana?

232
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,142
Pine trees
and cowboy boots and

233
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,644
change for me.

234
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,681
In Montana,
no one knows me,

235
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,784
and I have no history,

236
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:01,321
and no one has
any expectations of me.

237
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,357
You've done this before.
After Maddie.

238
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,693
That's not fair.

239
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,161
I know.

240
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,364
But my therapist
would say you're

241
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,866
"pulling a geographic."

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,167
Has your therapist
met me?

243
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,173
I have to go prepare
for Sunil's procedure.

244
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,815
The safest path
is external fixation.

245
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,283
We'd use a metal frame to
stabilize the fractured bones

246
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,285
until your baby
is ready to be delivered.

247
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,821
You'd need three weeks
of bed rest,

248
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,089
and you'll likely develop
debilitating arthritis.

249
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,724
There's a significant chance
you will never

250
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,292
have full mobility
ever again, bu...

251
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,594
I have grad school.
A job. This baby.

252
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,530
That can't be the only option.
No, it's not.

253
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,267
I was going to tell you,
if we do a C-section now,

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,102
we could do
an internal fixation,

255
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,770
which would greatly
improve your chances

256
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,973
of walking
without assistance.

257
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,109
Though it does increase
the risk of complications

258
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,211
associated with
premature birth.

259
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,281
So I either never
walk right again,

260
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,050
or I jeopardize
my baby's life?

261
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,785
Yes.

262
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,855
You have to decide.

263
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,194
My boyfriend,

264
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,229
at first, he didn't
want to keep our girl.

265
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,132
But then
he came around to it.

266
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:23,070
We said that we'd
figure it out together.

267
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,638
Then he signs up for
this month-long research trip

268
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,241
off the Gulf of Alaska,
and here I am.

269
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,513
I can't choose between
myself or my baby.

270
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,418
No, you have
to choose.

271
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,322
I can't.

272
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,796
Dr. Glassman,
I'm glad you're back.

273
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,630
Lea and I
have a problem.

274
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,965
I heard.

275
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,266
The floor squeaks.

276
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,036
At the church?

277
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,872
Is that it?

278
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,975
No. I also have a patient who
won't decide on a surgical plan.

279
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,276
Have you talked
to Lea?

280
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,844
She is no doctor.

281
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,479
No, I don't mean
about the patient.

282
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,682
Shaun,
I am not gonna be around.

283
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,119
I'm... I'm moving.

284
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,187
I'm selling my house,
and I'm moving...

285
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,189
...to Montana.

286
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,195
Oh.

287
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,670
Will you still be
my best man?

288
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,306
Yeah, of course.

289
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,410
Then you should
give me your advice.

290
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,846
Shaun, you don't
need my advice.

291
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,614
Sometimes I do.

292
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,816
You don't like to
give it to me anymore.

293
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,187
Lea and you
are partners now.

294
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,721
You can...
You can talk to her,

295
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:52,259
and Lea has a whole lot
of stuff she's gotta
talk to you about.

296
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,394
And you'll work it out,
without me.

297
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,344
Sharks tickets.

298
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,615
Doesn't being together mean that
we have an unspoken agreement

299
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,616
that when I need a date,
you're it?

300
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,817
No.

301
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,855
The lesion has
an irregular shape,

302
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,357
and it's extending into
the carotid sheath.

303
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,362
It's a malignant carcinoma,
and it's invasive.

304
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,203
Hey, I thought you
were working late.

305
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,139
I am going back,
but first,

306
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,110
you and I need to make
a decision about the church
and the squeaky floor

307
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,745
and something else
entirely.

308
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,848
Dr. Glassman said you have
things you need to tell me.

309
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:05,032
Uh, I didn't go
on a business trip
a couple weeks ago.

310
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,137
I went to Montana
to find Glassman

311
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,239
and convince him
to come home.

312
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,744
Because I was really
worried about you.

313
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:21,581
What were
you worried about?

314
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,617
There have been so many changes
at the hospital,

315
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,387
and I know that's been
hard for...

316
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,257
Not because of my...
I know.

317
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,792
Not because of your ASD,
but because

318
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,064
change is hard.

319
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,132
And then
your patient reviews,

320
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,134
and I knew you were
struggling with them.

321
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:44,537
I was, but then I improved
my interaction techniques,

322
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,473
and my scores went up.

323
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,811
That's not what happened,
Shaun.

324
00:16:55,448 --> 00:17:00,187
I omitted some of
the patient reviews.

325
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,689
Just the ones where
people said really mean stuff.

326
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,459
That's why your scores
went up.

327
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,673
I told you I didn't
want you to.

328
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,442
I know.
I'm so sorry.

329
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,611
I just got so worried,
and I wanted to protect you.

330
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,314
And I thought, if I could
just help you, I...

331
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,882
What you did
was very wrong.

332
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,017
I know.

333
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,485
I am truly so sorry.

334
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,287
No.

335
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,293
Your apology is
not accepted.

336
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,510
The lesion in your neck
is cancerous,

337
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,248
and it has grown
very quickly.

338
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,583
I am suggesting
a non-surgical approach,

339
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,919
one with targeted therapies
and radiation.

340
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,657
It should give you
a few more good years

341
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,025
before debilitating
symptoms set in.

342
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,727
I'm very sorry.

343
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,531
There's no way of
removing it?

344
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,600
It's attached to
the carotid artery.

345
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,568
It's too dangerous.

346
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,538
Um...

347
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,474
Thank you, Aaron.

348
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,043
That's more than we hoped for
when we came to you.

349
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,956
I was here all night
with Dr. Allen.

350
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,893
We have not come up with
a better surgical solution.

351
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,562
Your choices from yesterday
remain the same.

352
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,266
How is she?

353
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,135
Normal
fetal movement.

354
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,438
Heart rate is 140.

355
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,574
That's good.

356
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,576
Mm.

357
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,215
I talked to Matt.

358
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,883
He's making his way back,
but it'll be a couple of days.

359
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:14,086
He says whatever I decide to do,
he will support it.

360
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,190
Which isn't really
helpful right now.

361
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,659
No, it's not.

362
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,594
You need to
make a decision.

363
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,968
He shouldn't have gone,
but we needed the money,

364
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,604
and it was
a great opportunity.

365
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,506
But mostly,
I feel like it was

366
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,376
a reason for him
to be somewhere else.

367
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:45,618
He says one thing
but does
something different.

368
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,455
How do you know if
he loves you?

369
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,659
He does.

370
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,430
But someone can love you
and still let you down.

371
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,468
That doesn't
seem right.

372
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,503
No.

373
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,137
No, it doesn't.

374
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:08,074
Knowing what to expect
of others is difficult.

375
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,043
People can be
very unreliable.

376
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,548
That's why I always
wanted to be a doctor.

377
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:19,252
Science and biology and
medicine are very reliable.

378
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,054
I like that.

379
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,662
She's relying
on me.

380
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,672
I need to do
what's best for my baby.

381
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,976
Go ahead with
the external fixation.

382
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,953
How would you rate the new
self-serve, self-pay system?

383
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
Four stars.

384
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,856
Not five?

385
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,091
I prefer to be stingy
with my top rating.

386
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,929
Last night was a five.

387
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,533
So it was
even better than

388
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,100
a convenient way to
buy a smoothie?

389
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,538
Hey, what are you doing
Thursday night?

390
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,706
I invited Morgan and Alex
to have dinner with us.

391
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,610
A double date?

392
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,913
I didn't realize
we were going public.

393
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,782
We're both
consenting adults.

394
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:23,750
What's to hide?

395
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,120
As the boss, you are free
to do what you like.

396
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,559
As a partner,
that's not the way it works.

397
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,495
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,797
I should have asked you
before I told anyone.

399
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:47,073
Marcus, you're smart and funny
and almost too good-looking,

400
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,108
and your socks don't just
match your sweaters,

401
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,744
they elevate your whole aesthetic.

402
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:55,782
And I told Morgan because
I'm excited about you.

403
00:21:58,785 --> 00:21:59,919
About us.

404
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,558
I'll make the reservation.

405
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,835
There's a surgical solution
here, isn't there?

406
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,904
No, no, no.
Not a safe one.

407
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,939
But you've built your career
on doing surgeries

408
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,374
that most doctors think
are too dangerous.

409
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,176
Yeah, because, to quote you,
I am an insufferable egomaniac.

410
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,112
But that's
who we came to see,

411
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,548
and now I'm getting some
surgeon who's gonna
run off to Montana

412
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,849
in the guise of becoming
a decent human being?

413
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,284
Okay, uh, criticize me,
yell at me if you like.

414
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,521
I understand you're upset.
All those late nights

415
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,756
where you were tackling
the most impossible cases,

416
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,625
exhausting
every possible angle.

417
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,027
You come alive in surgery,
more than you did in...

418
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,330
There are other surgeons.
There are other hospitals.

419
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,767
I have done everything
I know how to do
to help you and Sunil.

420
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,002
I am sorry
if that's not enough.

421
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,806
I think you're scared.

422
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,842
Of what?

423
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,411
Failing.

424
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,812
Of failing me again.

425
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,216
Yeah, I wish
that were true.

426
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,688
It's Sunil.

427
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,159
I need to get out of here.

428
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,694
Don't you see
what's happening?

429
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,395
Sunil, Sunil.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Sunil, Sunil.

430
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,530
Stand by
with a sedative.

431
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,865
Ahead of you.
Just trying to get close.

432
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,166
You're right where you're
supposed to be, honey.

433
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,968
Take a deep breath.

434
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,836
All right, tell me...
tell me their names.

435
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,106
Tell... Tell me their...
Tell me the...

436
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,541
I don't know you!

437
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

438
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,213
You got him?
I got him. I got him.
I got him.

439
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,748
Oh...

440
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,150
I got him. I got him.

441
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,418
Are you hurt?

442
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,856
I'm okay.

443
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,598
My patient chose
to prioritize her baby.

444
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,332
We did
the external fixation.

445
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,334
She's resting comfortably, and
you need to correct my scores.

446
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,405
I can't restore
the data.

447
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,073
You are very smart.

448
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,076
You can
figure out a way.

449
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,879
Shaun, I apologize,

450
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,782
but I... I can't undo
what's been done.

451
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:14,286
Lea, the scores reflect
my work and me.

452
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,055
No, it didn't.

453
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,457
The algorithm ignored
what's best in you.

454
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,027
No, it should be
the same for everyone.

455
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,895
The data has to be
corrected.

456
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,533
I can't, Shaun.
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,670
Then you need to
tell Salen.

458
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,739
That's a terrible idea.

459
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:34,473
There is
no other option.

460
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,042
Shaun, I could
lose my job.

461
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,109
You broke the rules.

462
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,079
Maybe you should
get fired.

463
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,990
I'm fine, really.

464
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,224
Humor me.

465
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,627
Pupil response
is normal.

466
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,965
I'm sorry
about before.

467
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,301
I was so frustrated.

468
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,671
I... I appreciate everything
that you've done.

469
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,973
You owe us nothing,

470
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,941
and you've gone
out of your way to help.

471
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,111
Here's some Naproxen.

472
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,181
It'll help with
the pain and soreness.

473
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,019
I don't blame you anymore.

474
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,755
For Maddie...
No, p...

475
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:23,923
No, don't.
Please stop.

476
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,524
Don't do that.
I need you to hear this.

477
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,465
For a long time,
I did blame you.

478
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,502
I could barely look at
a picture of Maddie

479
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,606
without being reminded
about how angry I was,

480
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:46,579
and how angry I was at you
trying to replace her with Shaun.

481
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,048
Shaun wasn't meant to
replace Maddie.

482
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,083
My God.

483
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,985
Nobody can.

484
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,694
Becoming a part of Sunil's family
has brought me peace.

485
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,831
They're my whole world.

486
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,839
And I'm so glad
you found Shaun.

487
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,254
You're right,
I am scared.

488
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,260
If I operate on Sunil
and he died,

489
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:40,099
I'd be responsible for you
losing someone you love.

490
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,106
Again.

491
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,086
I'll take another look
at the imaging.

492
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,723
I can't promise
anything.

493
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,926
Who knows, maybe this egomaniac
can come up with something.

494
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,239
She's having severe
abdominal pain.

495
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,675
BP's 73 over 49.
She's hypotensive.

496
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,844
There's uterine bleeding
from a placental abruption.

497
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,746
It's a delayed reaction
to the crash.

498
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,314
Her choice was moot.

499
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,117
Okay, page Dr. Lim to the OR
for an emergency C-section.

500
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,098
We're ready.

501
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,770
I love you.
I love you, too.

502
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,296
Hey.

503
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,700
What are those for?

504
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,369
I know how mad you were
when these disappeared
from the vending machine.

505
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,506
Salen's
health-conscious revamp

506
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,508
was not a victimless crime.

507
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,443
I drove 20 minutes
to a gas station to
get those for you.

508
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,145
This is the bribe?

509
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,014
No,
it's just chips.

510
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,418
And a declaration

511
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,054
that I will respect
the boundaries you've set.

512
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,723
You don't have to
do dinner.

513
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,325
I'll survive.

514
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,163
I assume Salen will be
picking up the check?

515
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,168
I don't love
your ambitious streak,
but I do love you.

516
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,737
I'll be your arm candy
for the night.

517
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,813
How long until we have
access to start the C-section?

518
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,514
A few more seconds.

519
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,117
BP's 70 over 55.
Heart rate 109.

520
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,919
Fetal tones?

521
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:15,087
Present, but we saw D-cells
on the tracing.
The baby is stressed.

522
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,823
Once the baby is out,
we will immediately begin

523
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,058
an in-fix pedicle
screw rod fixation.

524
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,692
She'll walk fine.

525
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,728
We'll need a two and
a half millimeter drill bit

526
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,196
and titanium screws.

527
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,267
We're clear.
ChloraPrep and scalpel.

528
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,076
BP and heart rate
stable.

529
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,379
Carcinoma's
in the cross hairs.

530
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,215
"Be quick, but don't hurry,"
as John Wooden used to say.

531
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,218
Starting resection.

532
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,022
Suction.

533
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,958
That's a lot
of bleeding.

534
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,792
Yeah, well, we're
poking around
the carotid.

535
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,127
It's to be expected.

536
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,929
How's he doing?

537
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,631
BP's 64 over 42.

538
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,603
Do you see
any vascular feeders
you can clip?

539
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,805
No.

540
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,075
Tumor has completely
invaded the artery.

541
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,145
We're gonna have
to move fast.

542
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,414
Mother's BP is still dropping.
50 over 37.

543
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,449
Hang another two units.
Extending uterine incision.

544
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,554
Okay,
here she comes.

545
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,630
Dr. Murphy, Dr. Allen,
deliver the placenta.

546
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,765
Check for uterine bleeding
before beginning
internal fixation.

547
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,403
Dr. Lim, Apgar's three.

548
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,670
The baby's in distress.

549
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,774
She's not oxygenating.
We need to intubate.

550
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,776
Dr. Murphy, with me.

551
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,279
Get a blood gas.

552
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,683
Bagging 100% oxygen.

553
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,290
Baby is acidotic with
a pH of seven.

554
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,431
No improvement in vitals
or oxygen sat.

555
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,498
Check the tube's
positioning.

556
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,239
ET tube is in
the correct position.

557
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,207
Equal breath sounds
on both sides.

558
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,743
This doesn't
make any sense.

559
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,295
The baby has
a congenital heart defect.

560
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,698
The patent ductus arteriosus
is closing.
That is causing hypoxia.

561
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,733
We need to open the duct
and oxygenate her blood.

562
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,335
Call the pharmacy
for PGE, stat.

563
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,624
Start the PGE at 0.1.

564
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,864
BP's 61 over 42.

565
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,133
Tumor's hypervascular.

566
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,267
I can't see
a damn thing.

567
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,568
There's too much
blood.

568
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,270
Should we stop the bleeding
and abort the resection?

569
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,343
No.

570
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,778
Tubing... clear plastic
surgical tubing.

571
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,588
Baby isn't pinking up.

572
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,958
PGE is in.
IV looks good.

573
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,229
V-tach.
Starting compressions.

574
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,168
What if it's not
a heart defect?

575
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,940
We're gonna
occlude the carotid,

576
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,310
blocking the blood until we
can cut the damn thing out.

577
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,546
He'll stroke out.

578
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,481
That's what
the plastic tube is for.

579
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,417
I'm gonna build
a shunt bypass,

580
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,419
keep the blood flowing
to the brain.

581
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,089
Suction.

582
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,295
Apply the clamp.

583
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,672
Dissecting scissors.

584
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,826
Ugly little thing.

585
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,064
Okay.
Stand by with the patch.

586
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,068
Let's clean it up.

587
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,972
No obvious
metabolic disorder.

588
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,275
No evidence of head trauma
or pneumothorax.

589
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,444
No mucus plug
in ET tube.

590
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,479
No transient tachypnea
in the newborn.

591
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,117
The PGE is
the right dosage...

592
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,518
What?

593
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,819
Oh.

594
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:14,986
Shaun, what?

595
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,389
It's expired.

596
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,259
Call the pharmacy.

597
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,527
We need more PGE,
but from a different lot.

598
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,899
The PGE is expired.
We need...

599
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,505
The pharmacy says
we don't have another lot.

600
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,506
Our entire supply
is expired.

601
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,876
Prep for
catheterization.

602
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,545
We might be able to keep
the PDA open with a stent.

603
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,048
Stop!

604
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,416
Alprostadil!

605
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,052
We need to run PGE
at 0.1 micrograms.

606
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,721
Tell the pharmacist to mix
10 vials of 50 micrograms
of Alprostadil

607
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,690
with 10 milliliters
of saline solution.

608
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,461
Mix 10 vials
of 50 micrograms
of Alprostadil.

609
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,728
He says that's
the wrong medication.

610
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,532
Where are you going?

611
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,534
It'll be faster
if I do it myself.

612
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,216
Uh, you know this is
for erectile dysfunction?

613
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:18,950
Yes.

614
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,287
Alprostadil is
the same drug as PGE

615
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,954
but in a different
concentration.

616
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,658
We need to run the IV at
0.056 milliliters per minute.

617
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,028
That will give the baby
0.1 micrograms per
kilogram per minute.

618
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,564
Pushing 0.1.

619
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,573
Restarting
compressions.

620
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,646
Mucous membrane's
still blue.

621
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,548
Oxygen saturation's
not registering.

622
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,583
We just need to
give it more time.

623
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:56,255
Hold compressions.

624
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,861
Pulse not palpable.

625
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,331
No, push 0.2
of the solution.

626
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:06,265
Restarting
compressions.

627
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,337
Dr. Murphy.
No.

628
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,738
Push 0.2.

629
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,406
Dr. Murphy,
the baby is flatlining.

630
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,474
No. There's nothing more
we can do.

631
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,942
No, I can save her!
Shaun.

632
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,100
Time of death, 18:23.

633
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,560
Sunil's recovering
very nicely.

634
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,297
Just, no exercise or,
you know,

635
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,532
strenuous activity
for the next six weeks.

636
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:18,970
Thank you.

637
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:31,082
Don't go to Montana.

638
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,185
You still need Shaun.

639
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,555
He makes you better.

640
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:03,949
Hang up.

641
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,152
I need to
call you back.

642
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,221
We just lost a baby,
because this hospital
wasn't prepared.

643
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,691
The medication
we needed was expired.

644
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,226
All of it.
No back-up batch.

645
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,531
Did the money you saved
pay for your water wall?

646
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,969
In my 15 years here,

647
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,738
nothing like this has
ever been allowed to happen.

648
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:30,842
This hospital's priorities...
your priorities

649
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,178
are upside down, and today,
that killed someone.

650
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,184
How's the mother?

651
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,521
Recovering.

652
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,756
She won't be conscious
for a few hours.

653
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,761
I'll make sure and have
a grief counselor
standing by.

654
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,764
And call your lawyers,
too.

655
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,136
When she finds out
that her baby died

656
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,771
because of
expired meds...

657
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:03,308
Dr. Lim, until we've done
a thorough M&M

658
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:05,644
and identified what changes
need to be made,

659
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,214
discretion is in
everyone's best interest.

660
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,320
Are you suggesting
we not tell her the truth?

661
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,989
I'm suggesting we all
have exposure.

662
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,791
You, the residents.

663
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:24,696
Audrey,

664
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:27,799
this is a tragic day.

665
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,002
But we cannot allow
a single event

666
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,304
to derail
everything we do here.

667
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,957
Salen made cuts.

668
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,725
We're... We're
behind on inventory.

669
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,127
It just...

670
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,629
It... it fell through
the cracks.

671
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,898
Expired.

672
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:03,702
Expired.

673
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,404
Expired!

674
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,273
Expired!

675
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,208
They're all useless!

676
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,677
Shaun.
No!

677
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,545
Shaun, stop, stop, stop, stop!
They're all... No!

678
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,881
It wasn't your...
It wasn't your fault!
N-N... Please! Please! No!

679
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,584
There's nothing more
you could have done!
No, you lied to me!

680
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,051
I can't trust you!

681
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,988
And I can't marry you.

682
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,094
Shaun.
Shaun!

683
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,235
You're hyperventilating.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

684
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,837
Look at me.
Look at me.

685
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,872
Look at me.

686
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,874
Take a deep breath
now, okay?

687
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,143
Take a deep breath.

688
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,377
There you go.

689
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,079
You can talk to me.

690
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:49,548
Dr. Glassman,

691
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,586
you... you are a...

692
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,723
An awful best man

693
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,026
and a terrible mentor.

694
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,595
You said you would never
abandon me, but that's a lie.

695
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,396
A lie.

696
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,098
That is a lie!

697
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,968
Why is everyone
lying to me? Why?

698
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,971
You should have been
running the hospital!

699
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,973
If you had, the baby
would not have died!

700
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:23,915
Okay.

701
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:45,303
I'm here.
I'm here.

702
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,371
