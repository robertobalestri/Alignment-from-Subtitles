1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,403
Previously on
The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,739
I omitted some of
the patient reviews.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,108
That's why your
scores went up.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,077
I am truly so sorry.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,112
Your apology is
not accepted.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,715
Page Dr. Lim to the OR
for an emergency C-section.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,417
The baby's in distress.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,452
We need to open the duct
and oxygenate her blood.

9
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:19,953
Call the pharmacy
for PGE, stat.

10
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,789
Oh.
What?

11
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,191
It's expired.

12
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:25,826
Pulse not palpable.

13
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:26,860
Restarting
compressions.

14
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,163
Push 0.2.

15
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,431
Dr. Murphy,
the baby is flatlining.

16
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,665
No.
There's nothing
more we can do.

17
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,201
No, I can save her!
Shaun.

18
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,838
We just lost a baby
because this hospital
wasn't prepared.

19
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,907
The medication
we needed was expired.

20
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,477
Salen made cuts.

21
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,945
We're... We're
behind on inventory.

22
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,046
Expired.

23
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,582
Shaun, stop,
stop, stop!
They're all... No!

24
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:49,683
It wasn't your fault!

25
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,051
There's...
You lied to me!

26
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,221
I can't marry you.

27
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,656
Okay.

28
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,797
I'm right here.
I got you.

I am so sorry for what
you all must be going through.

49
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,199
I can assure you
I've begun an extensive review

50
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,768
of pharmacy
inventory policy,

51
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,404
and I will do everything
in my power to make sure

52
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,606
that nothing like this
ever happens again.

53
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,976
If there's anything
that you need...

54
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,712
Counseling,
paid time off,

55
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,814
just someone to talk to...
I'm available.

56
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,116
Thank you.

57
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,889
As I'm sure you know,
a lawsuit is a possibility.

58
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,759
We need to use the utmost
professional discretion

59
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,027
in our communication
with the baby's mother.

60
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,631
We're all very aware
of our professional
responsibilities.

61
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,637
I just felt
a reminder never hurts.

62
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,376
Whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't.

63
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,843
She's gonna lecture us

64
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,212
on professional
responsibility?

65
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,382
A baby's dead because
of her narcissistic need

66
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,417
to be a "disrupter"
instead of an administrator.

67
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,218
You're furious,
I get it.

68
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,186
Take a day off.

69
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,721
Take a personal day.

70
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,055
Let her make
the first move.

71
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,058
She is who she is.

72
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,928
Which is the owner
of this hospital
and your employer.

73
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,863
And she has
more experience

74
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,199
in corporate and legal
matters than you,

75
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,001
and if you go up
against her
in a fit of rage,

76
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,235
you're gonna suffer
the consequences.

77
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,273
I'm taking her down.

78
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,090
I was surprised
you were gone when I woke up.

79
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,261
I'd hoped
we could've talked before work.

80
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,696
I don't want
to talk.

81
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,468
You said you didn't
want to marry me.

82
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,003
You can't drop a bomb
like that and expect me
to just accept it.

83
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,542
I know you're hurting,

84
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,077
and... And I want
to be there for you.

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,446
I don't need your help.

86
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,548
Shaun,
stop it, please.

87
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,283
I made a mistake.

88
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,420
But that can't just
erase everything
we've been through.

89
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,456
You can't have
totally changed
how you feel about me

90
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,723
over just one incident.

91
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,927
Mmm.

92
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,197
It wasn't just one.
It was three.

93
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,468
You lied about
your trip to Montana,

94
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,436
falsified
my performance rating,

95
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,037
and refused to
make things right

96
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,408
by correcting my scores
or telling Salen
what you'd done.

97
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,079
I can't marry you.

98
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,747
That doesn't
make any sense.

99
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,783
We love each other.

100
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,251
We can figure out a way
to work this out.

101
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,527
I'm going to help
Dr. Park in the ER.

102
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,507
Male, 32,
single car M.V.A.

103
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,041
I'm so sorry.

104
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,810
Please tell me
I didn't hurt anyone.

105
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,344
For the tenth time,
all you messed up
was yourself,

106
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,279
your car, and a tree.

107
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:49,316
He has an open comminuted
tib/fib fracture.

108
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,919
And by the smell,
I'm guessing
an off-the-chart B.A.C.

109
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,353
I thought
she really liked me.

110
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,790
But she just wanted
to be friends,
like all the rest.

111
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,926
I'm such an idiot.

112
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,994
Just a fat,
disgusting loser.

113
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,362
Decent pulses.

114
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,997
He'll need IV
antibiotics and surgery

115
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,699
to I and D the wound
and repair the fracture.

116
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,301
The leg can wait.
GCS is 13.

117
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,570
Need head and trauma
CT pan scans

118
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,771
to rule out
closed-head injury.

119
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,139
Let's get him
to imaging.

120
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,910
He's right.
He's an idiot.

121
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,045
A very lucky one.

122
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,981
Go ahead
and take a seat.

123
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,349
Actually, I can't.

124
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:26,019
Uh... I... I had surgery
a couple weeks ago

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,921
in Brazil.

126
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,824
They call it
a Brazilian Butt Lift.

127
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,362
I know,
it's totally vain,

128
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:39,366
but my whole life,
I've been unhappy
with my shape.

129
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,335
Um, I've tried everything.
Diet, exercise,
waist trainers.

130
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,539
But I'm 33-years-old,

131
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,174
and every time
I look in the mirror,

132
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,409
I can still hear the kids
in school calling me...

133
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,746
Tater Tot
or SpongeBob.

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,347
You don't have to justify
your decision to me

135
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:55,716
or any other doctor.

136
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,017
I'm here to help you.

137
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,255
She has severe
surgical site infections

138
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,757
with multiple abscesses.

139
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,259
Gluteal fat grafting's not
as easy as it looks.

140
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,028
Not something you
want to try to save
a few bucks on.

141
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,396
She didn't go to Brazil
to save money.

142
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,764
She went to prevent
being mocked

143
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,065
and judged by
her own friends.

144
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,667
She didn't need
to go at all.

145
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,935
There's nothing wrong
with her belly
or her butt.

146
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,036
Well, there's
nothing "wrong"

147
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,170
with your hair,
either,

148
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,707
but you spend oodles
of time and money on it.

149
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,809
You're hilarious
and spend just as much

150
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,777
on your skincare
and manscaping.

151
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,579
This is fun. I wish
I had some popcorn.

152
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,214
As it is,
it's a waste of time

153
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,582
our patient
doesn't have.

154
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,150
Get CTs
with contrast
to gauge

155
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,019
the size and depth
of the abscesses,

156
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,353
then schedule her for surgery
to incise and drain.

157
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,788
On it.

158
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,089
My skin looks good,
though, right?

159
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,996
Could you do
me a favor?

160
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,599
I need all the
documents related to
Ethicure's takeover.

161
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,535
I'm doing some work
on regulatory responses

162
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,069
and need info
from the contracts.

163
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,838
Not exactly my area.

164
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,173
But I'm sure
Salen has copies
of all that stuff.

165
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,675
I don't want
to bother her.

166
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,109
She's pretty
swamped today.

167
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,911
I'm pretty sure
it's backed up
on the server.

168
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,913
Okay.
Thanks.

169
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,248
I'll print them out
for you.

170
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,817
You can just e-mail them.
Mmm, better if I don't.

171
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,853
Whatever your
real reason is
for wanting them,

172
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,755
I'm sure you don't want
Salen to know.

173
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,489
Paper copies
will be harder
for her to trace.

174
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,527
Thank you.
Yeah.

175
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,932
Hi, Alma.

176
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,171
I'm Salen Morrison,
the CEO of Ethicure.

177
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,775
I just wanted
to personally
offer my condolences.

178
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,412
I don't have children.

179
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,948
I can't even begin
to comprehend
the depth of your grief.

180
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,856
I probably
shouldn't be doing this.

181
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,158
My head of legal
is gonna freak,
but I don't care.

182
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,459
You deserve to know.

183
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,732
Dr. Lim and Dr. Murphy
were both truly heroic

184
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,634
in their attempts
to save your baby's life.

185
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,172
But there was an error
made by one
of our pharmacists,

186
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,976
which caused Dr. Murphy
to briefly administer

187
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,444
an expired medication.

188
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,881
He quickly realized and
corrected the mistake,

189
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,150
and it's unlikely
it had any effect,

190
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:12,986
but it was a mistake,

191
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,990
which we take
full responsibility for.

192
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,694
The pharmacist
feels horrible.

193
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:21,995
He's already resigned.

194
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,064
Oh, my God.

195
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,903
Ethicure will cover

196
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,371
all of your
medical expenses,

197
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,075
provide counseling
for you or for anyone

198
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,644
in your family
who needs it.

199
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,081
And I've authorized
an immediate
payment of $200,000

200
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,482
for your
pain and suffering.

201
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,923
I'm... I'm not sure
what to say.

202
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,024
It's the least
we can do.

203
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,034
I just need you to sign
a short consent form.

204
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,070
So our accounting
department can
issue the payment.

205
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,190
If anybody should
be fired here,
it should be you.

206
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,392
I warned you.

207
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,227
I told you that something
like this would happen

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,228
if you went ahead
with the changes.

209
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,930
Hmm.

210
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,965
That's not how
I remember it.

211
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,967
You do realize
that I have notes

212
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,136
from every meeting
we ever had,

213
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,637
copies of every e-mail?

214
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,509
What I realize is
you've never
sued anyone before,

215
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,780
while I've sued
and been sued by
my co-founders, banks,

216
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:51,084
billionaires, and the guy
who used to prune
my rose bushes.

217
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,554
Which is why I have
multiple lawyers
on retainer.

218
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,089
So if I were you,

219
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,759
I'd stop threatening
and start negotiating.

220
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,798
I want my job.

221
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,100
I deserve it.

222
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,669
No, you don't.

223
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,338
Because you
killed a baby.

224
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,308
So you're gonna
take your severance

225
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,978
and agree to a legally
enforceable promise

226
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,715
to go away
and keep
your mouth shut.

227
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,800
No sign of any
intracranial bleed

228
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,367
or injury to
chest or abdomen.

229
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,936
We should brief Lim
and get him to the OR

230
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,237
for the surgery
on his leg.

231
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,175
That silence
mean you agree?

232
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,178
Mmm?

233
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,080
Oh.

234
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,415
I was distracted.

235
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,952
You're right.

236
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,487
We'll need to do
two surgeries...

237
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,989
A prophylactic fasciotomy

238
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,191
and then stabilize
the tib/fib fractures.

239
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,060
Whatever you think
is best.

240
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,103
You want to talk?
Mmm, I already said...

241
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,807
I mean about what happened
last night in the pharmacy.

242
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,913
No.

243
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,715
Talking about it
won't change anything.

244
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,722
You know, I've never
seen him like this before.

245
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,925
It's like I'm suddenly
a totally different
person to him.

246
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,861
Yeah, give him
some time.

247
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,562
Have you
talked to him?

248
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,796
Yeah.

249
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,165
And what did
he say?

250
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,299
I don't know.
He... He's Shaun,
you know?

251
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,934
What's he gonna say?

252
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,403
Sometimes men
need more time
to get over stuff.

253
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,439
Okay, that is
both sexist
and wrong.

254
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:27,740
He's totally
cut me out.

255
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,042
He refuses to
talk to me at all.

256
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,377
Well,
he's stressed.

257
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,346
You know,
he's retreating
into medicine.

258
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,948
You're using that
as a metaphor,

259
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,250
but he literally
ran away from me

260
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,718
in the cafeteria
this morning.

261
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,923
Okay, I'll talk to him.

262
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,424
Thank you.

263
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,631
Excuse me?

264
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,167
You're Phil Hall's
doctors, right?

265
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,268
Yes.

266
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,004
Apparently
only family
can see him,

267
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,872
but the nurses said that
if I talked to you,
that maybe...

268
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,274
Are you the woman
who told him she just
wanted to be friends?

269
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,845
He told you that?
Yes.

270
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,281
That's why he got so
drunk and crashed
his car into a tree.

271
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,750
Oh, my God.

272
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,487
Could you at least
tell him that I'm here

273
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,324
and that I care about
him and that I hope
he's gonna be okay?

274
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,660
We can tell him.

275
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,295
But it won't make him
feel any better.

276
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,299
We'll tell him.

277
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,844
The abscesses are huge.

278
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,947
And multiloculated.

279
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,482
The surgeon probably
tried to inject
too much fat.

280
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,651
There doesn't
appear to be any
intra-abdominal

281
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,886
or pelvic
involvement yet.

282
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,155
She should've hid
from her friends

283
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,689
in Beverly Hills,
not Brazil.

284
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,325
Or just learned to love
the body God gave her.

285
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,894
You two really have such
strong beliefs about
aesthetic surgery

286
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,396
or do you just get off
on arguing with each other?

287
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,665
He doesn't believe
strongly in anything.

288
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,133
Just likes
to provoke me.

289
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,835
I just want to get
you to open your
mind a little.

290
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,971
You know, not be
so judgmental.

291
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,674
I'm the judgmental one?

292
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,643
Mr. "I never date a guy
who drives a sports car,

293
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,947
"can't dance, or who
doesn't like
'The Golden Girls'"?

294
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,748
I get the car and the dancing,
but "The Golden Girls"?

295
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,352
I'm not gonna date
a total moron.

296
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,355
My chest
is starting to hurt.

297
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,260
It feels like something's
squeezing my...

298
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,761
Petechial rash
on the neck and...

299
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,063
Oh!

300
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,700
BP's crashing.
She's hypoxic and agitated.

301
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,867
We need high-flow oxygen.

302
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,470
Muscle injuries

303
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,206
are actually not
as severe
as I expected.

304
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,940
The fact
he was so drunk
probably helped him.

305
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,875
Kept the arteries
from thrombosing.

306
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,777
Need more saline
in the pulse lavage.

307
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,379
I'm not surprised
he got friend-zoned.

308
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,282
You see the woman
in the waiting area?

309
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,084
That's who he was
drowning his
sorrows over?

310
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,553
Mm, bit out
of his league.
Yeah.

311
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,488
You don't think
a woman like her

312
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,126
could ever fall in love
with a guy like him?

313
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,461
Eh, it's possible,
if he was rich
or a rock star.

314
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,365
So you think all women
are greedy and shallow?

315
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,367
Humans are
greedy and shallow,

316
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,002
and it's silly
to pretend we're not

317
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,404
just because it's nicer
to talk about
the world that way.

318
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,440
Saline's clear.

319
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,908
No bleeding,
no sign of
muscle necrosis.

320
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,144
Good job.

321
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,247
Dr. Lim, you got a page
from Lea Dilallo.

322
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,748
Tell her
I'm on my way.

323
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,351
Place the ex-fix
to stabilize
the fractures for now.

324
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,019
We can do
a more extensive
reconstruction

325
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,320
after the swelling's
gone down.

326
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,788
Murphy can take
lead on that.

327
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,425
Murphy, you hear me?

328
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:36,996
Yes.

329
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,810
That was fast.
It was actually
incredibly slow.

330
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,113
I had to route
the downloads
through a proxy

331
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,316
and print at different
nurses' stations to
stay untraceable.

332
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,784
Thank you.
Hold on.

333
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,152
These too.

334
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,790
You said
you wanted everything.

335
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,992
It came out to over
4,000 pages.

336
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,460
Damn it.

337
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,762
What exactly
are you looking for?

338
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:12,965
I'm not sure.

339
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,121
Looks complicated.

340
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,824
He has a severe
comminuted fracture

341
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,058
with significant
bone loss.

342
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,228
The standard ex-fix
puts him at high risk

343
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,562
for deformity
and malunion.

344
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,435
Hey, Shaun, I...
I know you know
that I'm on your side,

345
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,237
no matter what.

346
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,139
But for whatever
it's worth,

347
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,673
I think you and Lea
make a very
good couple.

348
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,508
No, I don't want to
talk about Lea.

349
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:57,510
Why?

350
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,517
Why?

351
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,690
Dr. Park says
women are shallow.

352
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,159
He said that about Lea?

353
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,461
She's never dated anyone
like me before.

354
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,431
Okay, Shaun,
Lea might be flaky
and impulsive,

355
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,533
but, my God,
she's not shallow.

356
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,670
She made a mistake,
Shaun.

357
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,172
Give her a break.

358
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,107
I have to go.

359
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,250
Some of
the injected fat got
into your bloodstream

360
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,186
and embolized
to your lungs.

361
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,887
We can treat them
with medication.

362
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,555
But blood thinners
will make the surgery

363
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,091
on the abscesses
too risky.

364
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,327
We need to delay repairing
the aesthetic surgery

365
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,429
until after we fix
the clots in your lungs.

366
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,731
How long
will that take?

367
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,132
At least a few days.

368
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,103
And even with
broad spectrum
antibiotics,

369
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:00,173
the infection could
spread and damage
your glute muscles.

370
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,574
Possibly even cause
necrosis.

371
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,311
You mean
like dying flesh?

372
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,845
We'll do everything
we can to...

373
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,615
No way. I...
I don't care
how risky it is.

374
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,151
I want my butt
fixed first.

375
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,755
If we don't reduce
the clot burden to
your lungs immediately,

376
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,657
the complications
could be life-threatening.

377
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,194
You said you could
do them both.

378
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,764
You want to risk your
life to avoid an injury
to your butt?

379
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,766
Yes.

380
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,501
I already took
a huge risk.

381
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,304
I traveled halfway
around the world to fix
the way I look,

382
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:34,274
and there is no way
I'm gonna go
backwards now.

383
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,678
But what Dr. Reznick
is recommending

384
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,813
isn't going backward.

385
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,617
It's making the best
out of an awful situation.

386
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,023
You said you wouldn't
judge me.

387
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,427
I told you
what I want.

388
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,662
Are you gonna
help me or not?

389
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,465
Yes.

390
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,236
Aspirate
the superficial
collection,

391
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,871
start blood thinners,
and schedule her

392
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,506
for a surgery
first thing
in the morning.

393
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,357
Your friend's
first surgery went well,

394
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,559
but he needs to stay
under observation

395
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,661
until we finish
stabilizing
his leg fractures.

396
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,498
Can I see him?

397
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,867
No. But Dr. Park told him
what you'd said.

398
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,171
Thank you.
I'll come back tomorrow.

399
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,713
Why could you never
be more than just
friends with him?

400
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,250
Um...

401
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,587
Phil is
a really great guy.

402
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,690
I do love him.

403
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,827
I even tried
for a while.

404
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,930
I thought I could get
past it, that I was
being shallow.

405
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,733
But it's how
I feel.

406
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,869
I shouldn't
just settle.

407
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,384
This is...

408
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,897
She doesn't
own the place.
At least not yet.

409
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,832
By law, the State
Attorney General

410
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:43,069
has to approve the
change from non-profit
to for-profit status.

411
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,572
That hasn't happened,
which means the
deal's not closed.

412
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,773
That doesn't make
any sense.

413
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,275
She's been
running the place
for months.

414
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,943
These
acquisitions
take time.

415
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,479
The buyer
has to take control

416
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:55,147
before the regulatory
requirements are finalized.

417
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,150
And one requirement is,
"For-profit status

418
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,052
"cannot adversely affect
the obligation

419
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,489
"to serve
the community interest."

420
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,090
And there's no
way the A.G.'s
gonna agree

421
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,992
that killing babies
"serves the
community interest."

422
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,329
Okay, but why are
you telling me?

423
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:13,766
Because while I know
what she did, I don't
have written proof.

424
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,504
Well, I'm sorry.
I, um...

425
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,906
I took the severance.
Agreed to a non-disclosure.

426
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,674
Then give it
back and...
And tear it up.

427
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,112
She fired you for
something she forced
you to do,

428
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,481
made you the scapegoat
for everything she's done

429
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:31,117
and will continue to do
if you don't stop her.

430
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,585
If we don't stop her.

431
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,854
I have a wife
and two kids.

432
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,690
I... I need to know
that I can get another job.

433
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,392
And what about
sleeping at night?

434
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,028
Don't act like
you've never made
a compromise,

435
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,864
done something at work
that you thought was wrong.

436
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,099
We all make compromises.

437
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,603
But I know you believe
this is a lot
more than that

438
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,205
because you're
a decent man,

439
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,576
a father trying
to do right
by his kids.

440
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,845
But what happens
when they ask you why
you changed jobs?

441
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,981
Will you tell
the truth,

442
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,816
or will you look your kids
in the eye and lie?

443
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,861
Okay.

444
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,830
What do you need?

445
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,211
You think
Morgan's right?

446
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,849
That we constantly argue
because we like it?

447
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,554
No. It's part
of the job.

448
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,856
We have to kick
the tires
on every idea.

449
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,358
But we don't have to
kick each other.

450
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,529
We?

451
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,498
You're the one who said
my skin looked like
the Crypt Keeper's.

452
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,267
I was obviously joking.

453
00:23:55,401 --> 00:24:00,106
You were obviously
annoyed because
I expressed an opinion.

454
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,141
My problem is not you
expressing your opinion.

455
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,943
It's that you attribute
all of mine
to a personal flaw.

456
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,079
Maybe growing up
where you did,

457
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,948
you weren't exposed to
a lot of strong women.

458
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,453
And maybe growing
up where you did,

459
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,623
it's common to insult
people's mothers.

460
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,057
I didn't say anything
about your mother.

461
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,526
Have you ever even met
a Hasidic woman?

462
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:20,860
Is there a problem?

463
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,194
No.
No.

464
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,063
Then why are you
still in here
and not in the OR

465
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,397
getting our patient
positioned for surgery?

466
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:27,900
Sorry.
On it.

467
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,476
I can't stop
thinking about
what Monica said.

468
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,078
Who's Monica?

469
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,548
Lea thinks I'm not
good enough
to be her husband.

470
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,616
Is that the issue?
Because that's ridiculous.

471
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,485
No, it's not ridiculous.

472
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,621
She told me before
that we could never be

473
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,623
more than just friends
because of my ASD.

474
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,059
And now she knows
she was wrong, right?

475
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,326
No.

476
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,463
She saw me save a patient
from a collapsed building,

477
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,131
which shouldn't
have made her
realize anything

478
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,767
because she already
knew I was a good doctor

479
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,434
who could save patients.
Shaun...

480
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,137
And she wanted
you to come back
from Montana

481
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,939
so she wouldn't be
burdened with me
on her own,

482
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,075
and she changed my
client satisfaction scores

483
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,943
because she thinks
I can't succeed by myself.

484
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,011
That's not quite true.
Yes, it is.

485
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,713
Okay.
I don't want
to be married

486
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,015
to someone who is just
settling for me,

487
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,050
especially because
all her other boyfriends

488
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,887
were just drummers
and jerks and...

489
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,488
Okay, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

490
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,523
Sit down.

491
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,125
Shaun, sit down.
Okay.

492
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,398
Lea is not settling.

493
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,302
You're... You're
hardworking and honest

494
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,305
and loyal and brilliant,
and she's lucky
to have you,

495
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,773
and she damn well
knows it.

496
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,311
Shaun, sometimes
when people
love us, they...

497
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,546
They want to help,
and they help
at the wrong time

498
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,982
and for the wrong reasons
in the wrong way.

499
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,484
But Lea loves you.

500
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,854
She loves you.

501
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,197
Okay.
I have to go.

502
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,473
Okay, for your
surgery, we'll be
inserting screws

503
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,575
and a series of
circular rings with
connecting rods...

504
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:17,509
Is Monica still here?

505
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,946
No, she went home
last night.

506
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,948
Connecting
rods between...

507
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,383
She waited all day,
obviously cares
about you.

508
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,087
That's just pity.

509
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,389
Which makes me feel like
an even bigger loser.

510
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,424
Stop it.
You did something
irresponsible,

511
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,293
but you're not a loser.
You wouldn't understand.

512
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,030
You're good-looking,
muscular.

513
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,432
I'm sure you were always
a great athlete.

514
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,835
If she's that superficial,
would you have
fallen for her?

515
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,139
Maybe she's afraid
of committing.

516
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,941
If you back off,
let things develop,

517
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,076
maybe she'll change
her mind.

518
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,750
You really think so?

519
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:58,885
It can't hurt to try.

520
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,221
She won't change
her mind.

521
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,424
And you don't think
she ever will.

522
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,428
He said there's no
way a woman who
looked like her

523
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,130
would ever love a guy
who looked like you.

524
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,968
Connecting rods
between each
circular ring.

525
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,171
What the hell
are you doing?

526
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,907
You... You were
lying to him.

527
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,408
No, I was trying to
cheer him up,

528
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,244
which is not only
nice but medically
beneficial.

529
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,279
Look, I understand
you're going
through some stuff,

530
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:28,614
but if you're not
able to get
your head straight

531
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,382
and focus on the job,

532
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,551
you need to let
someone else
do this surgery.

533
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,787
I can focus fine.

534
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,461
I did it.

535
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,230
Found exactly
what we need
to get rid of her.

536
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,998
You found $52 million?

537
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:46,999
We don't need
to buy her out,

538
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,100
because she hasn't
bought us.

539
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,036
Not yet.

540
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,670
And once the A.G. gets
the information

541
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,472
I convinced Fremes
to turn over,

542
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,042
she never will.
Fremes the pharmacist?

543
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,244
He signed an N.D.A.
He... He took a check.

544
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,678
Which he regrets.

545
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,647
He's willing to pass
up the money
and come forward.

546
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,916
Well, that's very
heroic of him,
but it's irrelevant.

547
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,685
The A.G. isn't
gonna blow up
this deal.

548
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,121
We have proof
that she was
warned her policies

549
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,724
would endanger patients,
but she forced them
through anyway.

550
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,664
Let me get this straight.

551
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,301
You're gonna rely on
someone who's already
signed an N.D.A.,

552
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,371
who's taken money,
not to mention that Salen

553
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,140
has top-dollar lawyers
and lobbyists who
are gonna argue

554
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,210
that the baby didn't die
from expired meds

555
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,680
but from a car crash
and premature delivery

556
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,149
and a pre-existing
cardiac condition.

557
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,321
Look, I... I...

558
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:46,158
I agree with you that
Salen should not be
running a hospital.

559
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,128
But there isn't an
A.G. in America who
would take this on.

560
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,329
Unless it comes
from you.

561
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,070
Fine.

562
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,238
We'll go in
on our own.

563
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,550
Bleeding's
not as bad as I'd feared.

564
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,886
We need
great hemostasis

565
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,721
so there's no unsightly
fluid collections.

566
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:16,823
Definitely don't
want that.

567
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,359
No, we definitely don't.

568
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,428
This isn't the first
time you let your
personal feelings

569
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,031
about aesthetic surgery
impact patient care.

570
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,299
Patients have
a right to make
their own decisions,

571
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,101
but they also deserve
my honest opinion

572
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,903
of the risks and benefits.

573
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,106
Honest and professional.

574
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,942
Which means based on
the medicine,

575
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,043
not your personal bias.

576
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:43,215
Patients deserve to benefit
from their surgeon's
life experience.

577
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,388
And clearly felt
comfortable enough to
make her own decision.

578
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,391
He's right.
They make a good team.

579
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,333
She's hemodynamically
unstable. End-tidal
CO2 plummeting.

580
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,869
Did we cause
a venous air embolism?

581
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,072
No, it's not air.
She's thrown more
pulmonary clots.

582
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,639
We need mechanical
thrombectomy, STAT.

583
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,313
Adding an additional
Schanz screw.

584
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,182
Dr. Park,
can you add
more traction

585
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,649
to facilitate
fracture reduction?

586
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,251
How's that?

587
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:20,920
Perfect.

588
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,054
Dr. Lim,
you've got a call.

589
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,255
I'm a little busy.

590
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,556
It's Dr. Fremes.

591
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,993
He says it's urgent.

592
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,161
The meeting's
already set.

593
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,997
No, I... I understand
that she's worried,

594
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,999
but your kids need a father
they can look up to,

595
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,633
someone they can
be proud of.

596
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,335
No. No, no.
It can't just be my word.

597
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,170
I need your...

598
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,842
Spineless prick.

599
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,448
Her pressure's dropping.

600
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,984
Increase vasopressors
and limit fluid
overloading.

601
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,586
These damn fat clots
are harder to aspirate
than a blood clot.

602
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,389
Can you use
a stent retriever?

603
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,391
No, it's better to just
go with a larger bore
aspiration catheter.

604
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,060
Should we stop
what we're...
No, keep going.

605
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,294
No reason
to back up now.

606
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,801
Got it.

607
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:10,937
Come on.

608
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,704
Hold on.

609
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:15,574
Hold on.

610
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,312
Got you,
you little bastard.

611
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,450
She's crashing!

612
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,485
Gotta be more
in her heart.

613
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,254
Let's run an echo,
optimize pressers

614
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,655
for her cardiac
parameters,

615
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,323
and prep her femoral
for cerebral angio.

616
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:39,231
The surgery
was a success.

617
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,201
Dr. Lim let Dr. Park
and I do it almost
all on our own.

618
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,239
You want to go out and
have a drink tonight?

619
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,942
Do you really think Lea
realized she was wrong
about my ASD?

620
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,180
Were you just lying
to cheer me up?

621
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,015
Have I ever lied before?
Oh, yes.

622
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,917
Okay. I'm not lying.

623
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,954
Mmm.

624
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:07,159
Okay. I used to let
Robin Johnson
copy off my test.

625
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,927
She'd tell me
how cute I was.

626
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,063
But Michelle Plasse
told me Robin would
make fun of me

627
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,898
behind my back.

628
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,367
Both seemed nice
but one of them
was lying.

629
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,902
Shaun, you're not
a kid anymore.

630
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,272
But I'm still weird.

631
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,807
Yes, you're weird.

632
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,876
I'm weird.
Everyone's weird.

633
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,778
Everyone feels weird
at some point.

634
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,382
Everyone feels ugly
or stupid or old
or whatever it is.

635
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,821
That doesn't
help at all.

636
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:38,790
I know.

637
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,603
What's wrong?

638
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:55,141
If you can still speak
and see us... Nothing.

639
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,408
You had us
very worried.

640
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:00,112
We had to remove
multiple clots
from your heart

641
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:01,413
and brain
during surgery.

642
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,782
But now...

643
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,653
We were able to
debride the gluteal
abscesses.

644
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:11,157
We won't know for
sure until we see
how you heal, but...

645
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,393
Doesn't look like
there'll be
any visible scarring

646
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,427
or deformity.

647
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,299
Thank you.

648
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,637
I don't understand.

649
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,140
You told my associates
that you and Dr. Fremes

650
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,741
had actual evidence.

651
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,611
And now not only
do you not have
any documents,

652
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,012
you don't have
Dr. Fremes.

653
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,982
Because he was
intimidated into silence
by Salen Morrison.

654
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,617
Into silence?

655
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,786
Or into taking
responsibility
for his own actions?

656
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,489
I don't understand
how a mistake
made in an OR

657
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,857
or a hospital pharmacy
could possibly
be the fault

658
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,659
of your parent
company's CEO.

659
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,229
She sidelined our president
and began inserting herself

660
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,630
into medical decisions.

661
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,999
She consistently reduced
the quality of care

662
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,867
to boost
Ethicure's profits.

663
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,704
Dr. Lim, I get that
these takeovers

664
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,872
may involve policy changes
that you don't approve of...

665
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,642
If she started her own
for-profit hospital,

666
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,877
she'd have every
right to run it
however she saw fit.

667
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,647
But she didn't do that.
She bought ours...
Aa non-profit.

668
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,383
Which means
she's legally obligated

669
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,452
to serve the community,
the whole community,

670
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,287
not just patients
with premium insurance.

671
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:17,356
And you have
a responsibility

672
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,691
to make sure that
means something.

673
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,660
That it's not
just fine print
in a contract

674
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,894
no one will ever read.

675
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:26,064
I agree.

676
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:30,102
But do you
have any actual
evidence of fraud

677
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,504
or criminal activity
done by Salen Morrison?

678
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,507
I have a dead baby.

679
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,678
And that is Salen
Morrison's fault.

680
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,681
And I guarantee
this is gonna happen
again and again

681
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,517
if you don't step in
and do what only
you can do to stop it.

682
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,791
Let me think,
and I'll get back to you.

683
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:56,962
Thank you.

684
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,202
Dr. Murphy
did a great job.

685
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,672
You've a long
road ahead

686
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,240
and probably
a few more surgeries,

687
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:11,076
but it looks
very good.

688
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,880
You have no nerve
injuries and both
bones in your shin

689
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,548
have been stabilized
with good alignment.

690
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,452
Did Monica come back?

691
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,389
No.

692
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:28,894
Good.

693
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,596
I don't need her pity.

694
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,131
And you were right.

695
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,133
She obviously
wasn't gonna
change her mind.

696
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,568
Maybe you should
change yours.

697
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,972
I get the feeling
that you also
care a bit too much

698
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,574
about how your
dates look,

699
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,543
how they make you look
to other people

700
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,213
instead of how they make
you feel about yourself.

701
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,782
Is that your way of
telling me that because
I'm fat and ugly

702
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,318
I should only
date women
who are the same?

703
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:53,585
I don't think
you're fat or ugly.

704
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,088
But if you want
to find someone

705
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:58,590
who loves you more
than just a friend,

706
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,193
you need to start
loving yourself.

707
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,500
Just get out
and leave me alone.

708
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,603
Let the nurse know
if you need more
meds for the pain.

709
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:20,779
What're you looking at?

710
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,116
I just... I told you,
just... Just get out.

711
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,622
Dr. Park is right.

712
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,625
You should listen
to him.

713
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,374
I can't
believe it.

714
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:54,012
We actually saved
her lungs, her brain,
and her ass.

715
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,681
That's a triple play.

716
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,384
She's lucky she didn't
end up with major
organ damage.

717
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,218
She was lucky
to have us.

718
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,296
The way we fight
all the time at work?

719
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,331
That's how it is with me
and my oldest brother.

720
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,233
He drives me insane.

721
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,468
But I love him.

722
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:23,342
He also thinks a beard
makes him look taller.

723
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,178
That was unkind
and uncalled for.

724
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:29,247
Or the truth.

725
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:40,926
Hello?

726
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:42,761
This is she.

727
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:48,199
Thank you. I...
I really appreciate
your taking the time.

728
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,274
No, actually,
I don't understand.

729
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,644
Good night.
How was your meeting?

730
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,116
What meeting?

731
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,652
Your meeting
with the A.G.

732
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:49,160
I've always been
open with you, Audrey.

733
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,464
Tried to help
you understand
what it is

734
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:53,999
I'm trying to
accomplish here.

735
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:59,438
And you went behind
my back and tried
to destroy it all.

736
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,010
I'm never gonna
forget it.

737
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,971
I don't want
to cancel
our wedding.

738
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,808
We love each other

739
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:42,380
and are good
for each other.

740
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,516
And I forgive you for
lying about your
trip to Montana

741
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,017
and changing my scores.

742
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,519
I know you were just
trying to help me.

743
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:50,822
Thank you.

744
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:01,667
Did you want
Dr. Glassman
to come back

745
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,903
so you wouldn't have
to take care of me
on your own?

746
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:09,841
I wanted him to come
back because
he cares about you.

747
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:12,611
And I know
that you care
about him, too.

748
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,447
I don't need you to
take care of me.

749
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,249
I know. And I don't
mean to smother you.

750
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,151
I... I just want
to help you

751
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,688
and be there for you.

752
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,860
Do you believe I'm not
good enough for you?

753
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,063
That you're not
good enough?

754
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,364
What're you even
talking about?

755
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:36,134
You told me once
that you could
never be

756
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,303
in a relationship with me
because of my ASD.

757
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,474
Is that what you think?

758
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,209
It's what you said.

759
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,478
Yeah, a long time ago.

760
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,514
Are you seriously
telling me
that you don't see

761
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,248
a difference in how
I feel about you?

762
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,717
That I haven't
grown at all?

763
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,685
Our relationship
hasn't grown?

764
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,087
Shaun, all I was trying
to do is help someone
that I love,

765
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,890
to be there for you
like you've been
there for me.

766
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,693
But you just can't seem
to see it that way,

767
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,829
no matter how many
times I've tried.

768
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,164
I mean, is every mistake
I make going
to be something

769
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,799
that you hold against
me forever?

770
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,602
No, I...
I am forgiving you.

771
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,604
No, I don't need you
to forgive me.

772
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,973
And I'm done.

773
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,308
I'm... I'm done
apologizing
for helping you

774
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,477
and caring about you
and whatever
else I'm doing

775
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,047
that you seem to find
so unbearable.

776
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,116
Yes. No... No,
that's not what I said.

777
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,653
No. What you're saying
is that I'm not good
enough for you.

778
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,454
That's actually
not true...

779
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,322
And if that's what
you feel, then fine.

780
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:32,824
Maybe we shouldn't
get married.

781
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,427
Mmm-hmm.
And you know what?

782
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,664
Maybe we shouldn't even be
living together,

783
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,932
so I'm gonna get
out of your way. Totally.

784
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,804
And you can sleep
in your own bed tonight,

785
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,205
and first thing tomorrow,

786
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,707
I'll start looking
for a new place to live.
