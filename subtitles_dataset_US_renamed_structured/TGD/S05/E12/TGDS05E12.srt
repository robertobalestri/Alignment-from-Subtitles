1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,220
Oh, my God!
Shaun!

2
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,572
You're masturbating.

3
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,661
I thought you left.

4
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,316
I could catch the next bus
if you would like
to have sex now.

5
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,621
No... No, thank you.

6
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:02,801
But you were...

7
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,587
I'm good, and it's late.

8
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,373
Okay.

9
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:17,294
Oh, my God.

10
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:21,820
Mariel Torres, 31, fever,
BP 124 over 83.

11
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:24,171
Fainted coming
off a plane at SFO.

12
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:25,737
Fiance said she's had
a persistent cough,

13
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,174
pain in her chest
and abdomen.

14
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:28,175
How long has she had
these symptoms?

15
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,524
Months, on and off.

16
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,569
I kept telling her
to go to a doctor.

17
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,355
Soft and non-tender,
no distention
or guarding present.

18
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,531
Uh...Isaac, what's...
what's happening?

19
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:38,141
Ms. Torres, I'm Dr. Lim.

20
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:39,882
You're at
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

21
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,231
You collapsed
at the airport.

22
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,451
I'm... I'm not covered.
My insurance lapsed.

23
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,193
We can fast-track
your access

24
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,803
to St. Bonaventure's
uninsured program.

25
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,326
Any recent stressors?

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,806
I've been traveling a lot
for work.

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,155
Deep breath, please.

28
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,854
She's a photographer.

29
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:58,074
She documents immigrant
communities across California.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,685
I tagged along
this last trip.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,731
He keeps me sane.

32
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,561
Rales and rhonchi, decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.

33
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:07,692
We need a chest X-ray.

34
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,304
Hey.

35
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:13,263
We got this.

36
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,223
You and me.

37
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,664
What do you do for work?

38
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:25,057
Uh, I am one
of the research professors

39
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,756
of the Jane Austen project
at Stanford.

40
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,150
I imagine you sit a lot?

41
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:33,065
Well, it would be unethical
to read a first edition

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,415
of Sense and Sensibility
standing up.

43
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:37,722
That explains why you're
in so much pain.

44
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,115
You have
severe hemorrhoids.

45
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,685
Well... Can you give me
a salve or something?

46
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,601
This is...beyond salve.

47
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,432
They seem like
a cool couple.

48
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,216
They seem fine.

49
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,783
Torres imaging
come through yet?

50
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,914
Not yet.

51
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:59,091
Supportive,
fun, loving,

52
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,442
but not in a gross,
performative way.

53
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,313
You picked up a lot
in two minutes.

54
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,967
Sounds like someone
wants a boyfriend.

55
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,839
I have been considering
venturing out of Hookuptown

56
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:09,798
for something more serious,

57
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,453
which requires finding
someone to get serious about.

58
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,715
That does tend to be
the hard part.

59
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,499
Well, that's why I've decided
to raise the bar,

60
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:19,590
only date guys
that check all the boxes.

61
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,418
So, your plan
is to be more open
by being more closed?

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,291
The images are in.

63
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,989
I want to be
more intentional about it,

64
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:30,645
find someone who gets me,
but also challenges me.

65
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,950
Instead of getting diverted

66
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,039
by whoever has
the hottest profile pic.

67
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,693
Two nodules
in the left lung,

68
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,042
one in the upper lobe,
one lower.

69
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,308
That doesn't look like
pneumonia.

70
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,484
That looks like cancer.

71
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:02,242
Hi.

72
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,554
So, about this morning,

73
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,078
when you came home
and caught me, you know...

74
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,432
Boosting my own morale...

75
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:24,786
I used to boost my own morale
a lot before we got together.

76
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,309
But I don't anymore

77
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,919
because we usually have
very satisfying sex.

78
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,356
Yes, we do.

79
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,922
Absolutely, we do.

80
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,881
Did you need a boost

81
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,143
because we haven't had sex
in nine days?

82
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,799
I didn't know
we were counting.

83
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,540
Our average
is every 2.3 days.

84
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,980
It has been
a stressful few months.

85
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:48,331
If you wanted
a morale boost,

86
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,072
why didn't you want me
to do it for you?

87
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,509
No, it's... it's not that.

88
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,642
I-I just... I don't know.

89
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,253
I woke up
and had a few minutes

90
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,863
and wanted
to take the edge off.

91
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,565
Is it...the same
as when we're together?

92
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,044
No.

93
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,395
It's...different.

94
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,658
It's definitely not as good,

95
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,051
but it is...faster.

96
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,575
Oh, I can go faster.

97
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,968
No, Shaun.

98
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,101
Boosting my own morale

99
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,711
is not a substitute

100
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,584
for being with you, ever.

101
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,586
And I did try
to get things going

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,848
a couple times
last week,

103
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,937
but you were busy.

104
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,592
You didn't ring
the cowbell.

105
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,333
It wasn't
cowbell worthy.

106
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,204
We agreed
if we were off course,
we'd ring the cowbell.

107
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,901
We are not off course.

108
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,816
We're having a dry spell,
and it will blow over.

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,517
That is a lot
of weather terms.

110
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,171
I'm not sure they apply.

111
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,392
Yeah.

112
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,183
Anorectal ailments are one
of the oldest recorded
medical conditions.

113
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,968
One early remedy
was to burn them off
with hot coals.

114
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,841
We can remove
yours surgically,

115
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,800
but we need to
do it right away.

116
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,889
Isn't there some way we could
schedule it for next week?

117
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:10,413
Your hemorrhoids
have already ruptured.

118
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,415
You're at risk
of serious complications.

119
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,025
Oh.

120
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,114
The surgery is now routine
and effective.

121
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,464
No hot coals.

122
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,335
But the recovery
can be quite painful.

123
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,076
You'll need a special diet
and sitz baths.

124
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,208
No exercise or exertion,
including sex,

125
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,601
for six to eight weeks
post-op.

126
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,081
No sex? Why?

127
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,126
The wounds need time
to heal.

128
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,954
We can get you on the schedule
for later today.

129
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,437
The X-rays show two nodules
in your left lung,

130
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,264
possibly cancerous.

131
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,615
We'll know more
after the biopsy.

132
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:39,660
It's a simple procedure.

133
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,662
Um, the... the biopsy...

134
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:44,186
Is covered
under the uninsured program?

135
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,057
It all is.

136
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,277
And we'll run a few labs
and get you started on fluids.

137
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,626
Is this arm okay for the IV?

138
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,846
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,456
Listen, Mari,
I was on the phone
with your insurance.

140
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,979
What? W-Why?

141
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,938
To save you the hassle.

142
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,766
Sorry,
I need you to hold still.Oh. Sorry.

143
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,246
You... You shouldn't
have called them.

144
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,248
Why not?
We need to get this
sorted out.

145
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:08,210
Mari, whatever is going on,

146
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:10,691
you can tell me.

147
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,785
Um...

148
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,745
My insurance didn't lapse.

149
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,008
I, uh...I lost it.

150
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,011
Because, um...

151
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:31,581
I'm undocumented.

152
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,026
Brenna?

153
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,986
W-Where is our patient?

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,553
She's not in the bathroom,

155
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,077
and her clothes and personal
belongings are all gone.

156
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,557
Code green.
We have a runner.

157
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,741
I checked the whole
second floor. No Brenna.

158
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,570
She's not in the cafeteria
or the lobby or the gift shop.

159
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,223
We should check
all the exits.

160
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,051
Lea and I haven't had sex
for nine days.

161
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,970
Lenore,
the gift-shop cashier,

162
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:15,277
she recommended
light bondage.

163
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,540
Dr. Park suggested
a romantic bubble bath,

164
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,281
but Lea and I don't agree
on water temperature.

165
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,849
You both are busy.

166
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,460
Have you tried
scheduling it?

167
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:26,810
Reliability is sexy.

168
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,555
I think we found her.

169
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,657
All right,
time for your biopsy.

170
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,572
I'll have her back
in about an hour or so.

171
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,402
I should drop the bags off
at the apartment.

172
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,883
Isaac, can we please
talk about this

173
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:56,623
before I go
into my procedure?

174
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,061
We've been together
two years.

175
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,323
I was gonna tell you.

176
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,150
When?

177
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,326
The wedding?

178
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,550
I promised myself that
if marriage
were ever on the table

179
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,552
for real,
that I'd tell you,

180
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,902
but when you proposed,

181
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,252
my DACA renewal
had just been rejected.

182
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:20,124
And it really
freaked me out.

183
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,129
It was, uh...

184
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,134
It was all because of a stupid
marijuana DUI on my record.

185
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,008
Another thing
you've been hiding.

186
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,402
It was years ago.

187
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,449
Cops pulled me over
for a tail light.

188
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,321
They searched
and they found edibles,

189
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:45,410
and they arrested me
for driving high,

190
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,194
which I wasn't.

191
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,072
Okay, let's get her
some humidified oxygen.

192
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:01,339
I was...

193
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,037
I was trying
to get it expunged.

194
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,429
Breathe into this.

195
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,654
I'm gonna go.

196
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:31,718
I can get rid of that
for you.

197
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:37,201
There's blood in her sputum.

198
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:43,730
You're bleeding
from your lungs and airway.

199
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,296
Let's get to the O.R.,
stat.

200
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,781
I'm sorry I ran.
I know I need surgery.

201
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,043
You're scared.
I understand.

202
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,307
No, it's not just that.
I have this date

203
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,353
that I've been waiting
a really long time for.

204
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,224
And a rain check
poses a problem?

205
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,881
I am...

206
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:07,536
A virgin.

207
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,192
I am 45 years old
and I have never had sex.

208
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,499
Because of your religion?

209
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,240
Honestly, I don't know.

210
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,201
I mean,
freshman year in college,

211
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,551
I-I made
this really detailed list

212
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,944
of what I wanted
in a boyfriend,

213
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:26,294
and then I fell madly in love
with my work.

214
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,425
For a while, I thought
I wasn't having sex

215
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,124
because I was obsessed
with Jane Austen.

216
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,780
It's commonly believed
that she was a virgin
when she died.

217
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:36,696
She was obsessed
with her work, too.

218
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,785
I n--
I never stopped looking.

219
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,745
But every year
that I waited,

220
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,704
it just got harder
to imagine telling someone

221
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,923
I'd met a couple times
over coffee or drinks

222
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,534
that I...
had never had sex.

223
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,102
I just...

224
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,541
I just felt so ashamed.

225
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,456
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

226
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,372
Well, okay.

227
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:04,941
Tell me about this date.

228
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:06,943
Really?

229
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:07,770
Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,294
Okay. Um...

231
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:12,601
His name is Viktor.

232
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,213
He's an old friend
from college.

233
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,301
Glaciologist.

234
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,042
Oh.Yeah.

235
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:22,611
And he's usually in Antarctica
or the Arctic Circle,

236
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:27,442
but he's visiting San Jose
for two days.

237
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,098
I was so scared to ask.

238
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:32,403
I thought
he would laugh at me.

239
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,801
But he just said
he would be honored.

240
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,849
You've waited a long time.

241
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:43,719
I have.

242
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,636
And if I don't do it now,

243
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,334
then w-what if I never...

244
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,773
I'm not having the surgery
until I have sex with Viktor.

245
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,345
Lea and I haven't had sex
in nine days.

246
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,436
Okay.

247
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,918
Um...
nine days isn't a thing.

248
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,878
It is something.

249
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,098
You said you and Debbie
had a very good sex life.

250
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,708
I would like to know
all your secrets.

251
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,188
I said that?

252
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,889
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

253
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,370
Okay. Uh...

254
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,548
I got to test drive
a Testarossa once,

255
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:31,811
a Ferrari, an '86.

256
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,813
Oh, my God.
Beautiful car.

257
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,424
Got my friend to get us
a track at Thunderhill.

258
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,078
I get into the car...

259
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,558
Leather interior,
stunning detail.

260
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,560
I mean,
this car is ready.

261
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:45,389
And I kick it into gear,
and it stalls.

262
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,478
I kick it into gear again,
and it stalls again.

263
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:48,828
It's jerking back and forth.

264
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:51,743
I'm destroying
this $200,000 machine.

265
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:55,225
Why? Because the pedals
are too close together.

266
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,184
I'm...
I'm stepping on the brake

267
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,402
and the accelerator
at the same time.

268
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,059
Are you saying
that a Ferrari

269
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,322
will not cure my dry spell
with Lea?

270
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,063
No.

271
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,936
I'm trying to explain
this sex book

272
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,417
that Debbie gave me
called Come As You Are.

273
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,941
See, uh,
according to the book,

274
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,595
people think of it
as a sex drive, you know,

275
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,119
and that's too simple.

276
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,773
There's also a brake
and an accelerator.

277
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,428
Dr. Glassman? The new
nursing schedule is a mess.

278
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:25,734
Hawks and I have some ideas
to make it better,

279
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:26,996
if you have time today?Okay, I think...

280
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,172
I think
Dr. Andrews is your guy.

281
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,827
If I could get time
on his calendar, I'd ask him.

282
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,090
Fine. Um, if he doesn't get
back to you in a week,
then come back to me.

283
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:37,789
Uh...

284
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,447
Accelerating is
all the things that rev...

285
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,320
...the engine.

286
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:47,712
Oh.

287
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,975
All right. Listening,

288
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,021
chocolates,

289
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,416
listening a lot.

290
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,287
And braking is everything

291
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,246
that... that gets
in the way of good...

292
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:01,335
You know, sex.

293
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,381
Stress and work
and insecurities

294
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,167
and jealousy and stress.
Yes?

295
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:11,301
Sorry to interrupt, but we are
having major crackage problems
with the BioGlass pipettes.

296
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,216
Isn't that
a President thing?

297
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,307
I have had issues
talking to him after
the last couple months.

298
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,961
I'll send you an e-mail,
fill you in on all the issues.

299
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:19,788
I look forward to that.

300
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,794
Car.

301
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,970
Do you do
regular maintenance?

302
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,799
Are you, you know, talking
and communicating and...

303
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,715
Oh, talking, texting.

304
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,717
But mostly about work.

305
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,327
Okay.

306
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:40,504
So, maybe
a little bit less braking,

307
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,419
a little bit
more accelerating.

308
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,030
You know,
when you get home tonight,

309
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,248
leave your work
at the door.

310
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,597
Go inside,
put on some music,

311
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:47,947
light some candles,
not too many.

312
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,165
You don't want to make
an announcement.

313
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,036
How many?

314
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,038
Nine.

315
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,127
And no weather channel.

316
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,046
Okay.

317
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,265
I...will try.

318
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,397
I have to get back
to work.

319
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,313
Okay.

320
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,185
Got a minute?

321
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,623
There's the bleeder.

322
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,321
Cauterizing.

323
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,584
This nodule's
caused a lot of damage.

324
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,847
It's too bad she didn't feel
safe coming to a hospital.

325
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,632
Mm. One of my aunts
was undocumented.

326
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:22,807
She never let
her guard down.

327
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,679
With anyone.

328
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,855
Inserting mini-forceps
into the tract.

329
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,510
But hiding it
from your fiance?

330
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,860
Doesn't exactly bode well.

331
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,341
Ah, you're really ready
to judge this relationship,
aren't you?

332
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,125
First, they're "supportive,
fun, and loving,"

333
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,563
now it's built on betrayal.
There's the nodule.

334
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,652
Advance a little further.
Then we can take the sample.

335
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,090
Which suggests that you
might be lacking experience

336
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:45,482
with long-term
relationships.

337
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,658
The one thing they never are
is simple.

338
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:53,142
The capsule's tough
for a pulmonary nodule.

339
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,578
The inside's friable,
crumbly.

340
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,320
That's not cancer.

341
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,322
It's fungus.

342
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,455
And we just released it
into her bloodstream.

343
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,074
What if we just let her
go home to see Viktor?

344
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,597
It's one night.

345
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:17,340
Dr. Allen,
she has grade four

346
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,907
internal
and external hemorrhoids,

347
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,691
which have
already ruptured.

348
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,128
If it happens again
while she's home,

349
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,607
she's at risk
for severe blood loss.

350
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,307
I should tell her
about my first time.

351
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,183
I vowed
that under no circumstances,

352
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,098
I would be a virgin
when I went to college.

353
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,405
Senior prom,
my high school boyfriend and I

354
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,059
finally decided to take
that last big step past...

355
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,715
"Heavy petting."

356
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,414
Afterwards,
all I could think was,
"I preferred the petting."

357
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,851
Mm, no second time
without a first time.

358
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,724
Let's bring Viktor here.

359
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:54,943
Afterwards,
we'll do the surgery,

360
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,032
and if she has a rupture,

361
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,078
there's no safer place to be
than in a hospital.

362
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,997
The hospital has rules
against alcohol,

363
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,913
illegal drugs,
patients running in socks,

364
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,699
but there is nothing
about consensual sex.

365
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,575
It's an illness
commonly known
as Valley Fever.

366
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,273
It's endemic to soil
in the Southwest.

367
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,450
Our immediate concern is,

368
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,408
the fungus is now
in your bloodstream.

369
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,931
If an infection takes root
in your brain or spine,

370
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,585
that could be fatal.

371
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,891
We're gonna treat you
with an anti-fungal

372
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,588
called amphotericin B.

373
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,242
It can be pretty intense.

374
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,592
The side effects
include nausea,
violent chills,

375
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,203
high fever, convulsions.

376
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,683
Has Isaac been back?

377
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,557
Um, we haven't seen him.

378
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,691
We'll do what we can to
alleviate any discomfort.

379
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,434
Get the infusion ready.

380
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,921
Yeah?

381
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,183
You're appointment only
now?

382
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,490
It's fine.

383
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,796
I had to establish
boundaries,

384
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,624
at least until the hospital's
on firmer financial ground.

385
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,018
Huh.

386
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,281
There's a whole lot
of broken glass in the lab.

387
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,371
Is that a metaphor?

388
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:18,809
Yeah, and there's a whole lot
of broken glass in the lab.

389
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,508
It's a supplier issue.
Apparently news to you?

390
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:22,857
My assistant also
filters requests

391
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:23,945
before they hit my desk.

392
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,512
Allows me to focus

393
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:26,861
on the bigger
post-Ethicure adjustments.

394
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,689
Huh.Now, is there a reason

395
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,386
for this...delightful,

396
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,388
if unscheduled visit,
because...

397
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:33,998
St. Bon's
needs a softball team.

398
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,478
There's a hospital league.

399
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,698
$650 covers a roster of 16.

400
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,657
The team
covers bats and gloves.

401
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:41,789
It'll be good for morale.

402
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:43,312
You know,
I heard something

403
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:46,663
about you playing softball
in Montana.

404
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:47,751
What was your average?

405
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,058
.394 and trending up.

406
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,320
Hm.

407
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,934
Fine. The hospital can cover
registration fee and uniforms.

408
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,675
Gloves and bats
are on you.

409
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,286
Next time,
make an appointment.

410
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:18,391
Dr. Wolke?

411
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,784
Sorry to interrupt.

412
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,873
I'm just swiping left again.
Please, interrupt.

413
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,788
I saw Ms. Torres
is going on ampho-B.

414
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,268
Can we get her fiance back

415
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,226
so she has
some emotional support?

416
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,577
Uh, we tried.
He's not responding.

417
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,797
Pretty lousy time
to ghost.

418
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:37,323
Maybe, but I get it.

419
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,672
You "get" taking off
when someone needs you?

420
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,589
She lied to him for years.

421
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,200
She hid things,
for pretty clear reasons.

422
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,072
It's still
a violation of trust.

423
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,291
That can take a while
to get over.

424
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,902
Give him some time.Great empathy for him.

425
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,556
Meanwhile, your patient
is about to be
in a lot of pain,

426
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,731
and you're judging her.

427
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,777
I'm treating her.

428
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,214
It is not my place to do
couples therapy. Or yours.

429
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,564
If you don't have compassion
for her, Dr. Wolke,

430
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,610
then maybe someone else
should handle her care.

431
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,351
And you can go back to
polishing your Tinder profile.

432
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,181
I have to hang her meds.

433
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,582
You went all out.

434
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:21,410
Mm-hmm.

435
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:22,629
You didn't have
to bring those.

436
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,152
I stole them
from the chapel.

437
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,675
Oh.God works
in mysterious ways.

438
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,330
Are you in any pain?

439
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,158
No.
Lying here, I'm totally fine.

440
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,377
It only hurts
when I walk around,

441
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:35,119
but what about tomorrow,
when Viktor's...here?

442
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,600
I got you covered.

443
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:40,647
Tylenol,
a little Lidocaine cream.

444
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:41,604
Should do the trick.

445
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,913
You know, my mom had
the sex talk with me

446
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,175
when I was
in the fifth grade.

447
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,611
She showed me
The Joy of Sex,

448
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,961
you know, that book
from the '70s.

449
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,963
Lots of...hair.

450
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,098
And, uh, when I asked her
to explain the pictures,

451
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,883
she got really awkward
and then started to cry.

452
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,453
That's not
very sex-positive.

453
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,063
Well, she said she was upset
because I was so young

454
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,066
and I was asking
all these questions.

455
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,026
I just ended up
rubbing her back
and making her a cup of tea.

456
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,896
Oh.

457
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,771
After wanting this for so many
years, why am I so scared?

458
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,341
Being intimate with someone
feels vulnerable,

459
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,125
no matter how many times
you've done it.

460
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,432
That's why it's special.

461
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,957
It will be an adventure...

462
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,960
Your adventure,
on your terms.

463
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,179
Have fun,

464
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,964
tell him what you want,

465
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,531
and lube is your friend.

466
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,968
Oh, my God.

467
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,930

setting the mood.

Mm. On my last trip,
Imperial Valley.

505
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:01,325
They're beautiful.

506
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,068
So...relaxed.

507
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:07,549
Just a bunch of friends
hanging out.

508
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,769
Yeah.

509
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,859
There are so many images
out there of the, uh, plight

510
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:16,079
of the undocumented,
like we're just
some sad story.

511
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,082
I wanted to show
how we really are...

512
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,563
Cracking jokes,
laughing,

513
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,826
a bunch of badasses.

514
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,395
Oh, not that I feel that way
at the moment.

515
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,788
Oh!

516
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:29,876
I can call Isaac again.

517
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:32,661
Don't bother.

518
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:37,361
If he doesn't see
how scary this all is,

519
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,190
if he can't support me,
then I don't want him here.

520
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:54,335
When I was in high school,

521
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:57,643
I had a chavrusa...

522
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:58,905
A study partner.

523
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,691
I totally fell for him.

524
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,563
His close textual readings
were super sexy.

525
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,653
We grew up Hasidic.

526
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:12,440
Micah was the first person
I told about being gay...

527
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:14,747
And my first kiss.

528
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:17,619
He said he was gay, too.

529
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:22,276
That according
to two verses in Samuel,

530
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,147
so were
King David and Jonathan.

531
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,847
Like I said,
close textual readings.

532
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:28,978
Next level.

533
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,157
Micah said
we should be open.

534
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:36,856
We should
tell our families.

535
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,164
I was scared, but I did,

536
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,950
And my dad...

537
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,736
...lost it.

538
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,394
Our home
just...imploded.

539
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,180
But Micah backed out.

540
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,575
He said
he couldn't do it.

541
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,535
I lost my family

542
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:08,017
and never spoke
to Micah again.

543
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,847
He cut you off?

544
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,196
I cut himoff.

545
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:18,724
He reached out to me,
but I... I was so angry.

546
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,771
He betrayed me and...

547
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,470
Broke my heart.

548
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,953
And then I realized
how terrified

549
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,520
he must have been, too.

550
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:35,784
And how...

551
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,222
Alone he must feel now.

552
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,184
I miss him.

553
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:52,714
O2 falling.

554
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,108
Is this from the ampho-B?

555
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,239
No.

556
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,547
EKG steady.It's not her heart.

557
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:06,119
The area around
the nodule ruptured.

558
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,816
Your lung has collapsed.
We need to get her to the O.R.

559
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,563
Completing
final muscular suture.

560
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,217
Lung is
reinflating nicely.

561
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,741
Let's finish
closing her up.

562
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,569
Dr. Lim? Who's talking to me?

563
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,092
This is Nurse Martel.

564
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,267
Her renal panel
just came back.

565
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:26,705
How bad?

566
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:29,272
B.U.N. 30, creatinine 4.

567
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,059
Thanks
for letting us know.

568
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,063
It's impacting
both her kidneys.

569
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:38,499
We need to get that nodule
out of there.

570
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,066
Now?No.

571
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,285
There's still too much fungus
circulating in her blood.

572
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,939
She needs around round
of ampho-B

573
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:46,594
to clear as much fungus
as we can.

574
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,422
Then we can do
the kidney surgery.

575
00:28:58,998 --> 00:28:59,694
Are you Viktor?

576
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,828
Brenna showed me
your picture.

577
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,482
I'm Dr. Allen.Pleased to meet you.

578
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,397
Perhaps you could point me
toward the gift shop?

579
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,269
I wanted to get something
for Brenna.

580
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:10,879
What kind of a date
shows up empty-handed?

581
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,663
Most of them.

582
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,144
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.
Give her these.

583
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,103
Chocolate contains tryptophan
and Phenylethylamine,

584
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,365
which will help to elevate
your moods.

585
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,241
Oh, they are very good.

586
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,330
Okay, please get started.

587
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,028
As soon as you are done,
we can do the procedure.

588
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:32,335
Oh, uh, I owe it to Brenna
not to rush.

589
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,512
Definitely worth the wait.

590
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:45,000
You're here.

591
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,742
Uh, bearing
slightly used chocolates.

592
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:53,182
Uh, Dr. Murphy says they...
they will improve our mood,

593
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:55,054
w-which
I hope won't be necessary.

594
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,232
Always the gentleman.

595
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:05,716
Are you sure
this isn't too strange?

596
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,850
Uh, well, making love
in a hospital is strange.

597
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:14,638
And surprising
and... and completely unique.

598
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,597
Exciting.

599
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,992
I'll be outside,
guarding the door.

600
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:22,429
Try not to be too loud.

601
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,398
Yo.
See you on the field.

602
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,228
I gave you your team.
My involvement ends there.

603
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,318
You're a baller, right?

604
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,233
You played in college.

605
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,235
Yeah, I also ate instant ramen
for breakfast.

606
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,150
I need a shortstop,
a field general,

607
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:49,543
a boss of the infield.
You're perfect.

608
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,545
I'm busy being
the actual boss.

609
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,155
You're busy
being a bad boss.

610
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,768
You isolate yourself
from your own staff.

611
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,379
They don't like you.

612
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:00,902
Especially since
this business with Salen.

613
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,515
I've got bridges to build.
I'll get there eventually.

614
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:08,170
I'm offering you a bridge
to build right now.

615
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:09,911
Show them
you're on their team.

616
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,086
Maybe they'll help you
right the ship.

617
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,740
I know.
Mixed metaphor.

618
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,960
And by the way,
maybe they'll stop
bothering me

619
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,744
with their problems
every five minutes.

620
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,242
Let's have sex.

621
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,373
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

622
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,462
Shaun! Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!

623
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,160
Okay.

624
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,465
Are you okay?

625
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:46,295
Spontaneity
is not the solution.

626
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,384
No.

627
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,038
Sorry.

628
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:51,474
Okay.

629
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:00,440
Maybe we could try

630
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:04,226
more of a...
planned surprise next time.

631
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,576
That is a good idea.

632
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,404
We should have
a sex schedule.

633
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:09,492
Jordan recommended it.

634
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,886
Did you mention
my morale boosting?

635
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,453
N-No.

636
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,237
Lea,
that is very personal.

637
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:16,499
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

638
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,592
The...
The sex schedule... sorry...

639
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,899
It just feels like
the ultimate buzzkill.

640
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,554
Okay.

641
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,296
Lou the janitor mentioned
something called a sex swing,

642
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,561
but the installation
sounds very cumbersome.

643
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,216
Even allowing for foreplay,
Viktor should be finished.

644
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:42,090
Uh...

645
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,751
God.

646
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,971
This feels worse
than the last time.

647
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,322
The nausea, the pain...

648
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:58,280
We have to clear
as much fungus from your blood

649
00:32:58,454 --> 00:32:59,281
as possible
before surgery.

650
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,161
I got your message.

651
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,860
Thanks for coming back.

652
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:16,559
You lied to me.

653
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,651
I don't know
what's going on anymore.

654
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,350
Or what to trust.

655
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,135
Of course you don't.

656
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:30,356
I didn't give you
a chance.

657
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,404
I didn't trust you,
and I should have.

658
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:41,062
You don't have
to forgive me,

659
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:44,587
but I-I hope you...
You understand...

660
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,592
...why I hid from you.

661
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:16,054
Seriously, I thought
they'd be done by now.

662
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,189
This is
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

663
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:25,933
Help.

664
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:32,853
Mm.

665
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:33,723
Um...

666
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:39,077
What happened?

667
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,426
Well, um, we finished...

668
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:42,906
Both of us.

669
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,820
Yay.

670
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,345
Um, but we...

671
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,696
Um...he's...I-I-I seem to be stuck.

672
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,352
Oh, you must have
vaginismus.

673
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,049
What?

674
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,746
Your pelvic floor
is having a muscle spasm,

675
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,617
and it's holding...Oh!

676
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:58,879
Shaun.

677
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,751
It's very rare in humans,

678
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,753
but it is common
in mammals who need
to ensure fertilization.

679
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,281
Once your pelvic walls
relax,

680
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,545
everything should go
back to normal.

681
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,982
Oh, my God.

682
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,811
I am so sorry.
You came to do me a favor,

683
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,422
and now we're literally stuck.No, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

684
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:21,684
This is a beautiful choice
you made.

685
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,341
And now that I know that
we're gonna be okay, uh...

686
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,170
It's actually quite nice.

687
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,130
Yes, it is.

688
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,787
That was...

689
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,400
Lovely.

690
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:57,981
Mm.

691
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,898
I owe you an apology.

692
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,683
It's okay.

693
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:05,206
The ice packs
are really helping.

694
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,121
Not that.

695
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,689
I'm sorry
for brushing you off.

696
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,778
You've been trying to get us
out of this dry spell,

697
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:12,605
and I've done nothing.

698
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,784
About the sex schedule...

699
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:21,266
My parents used
to have one.

700
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:25,531
They used to mark
our kitchen calendar
with "S.T."

701
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,489
They claimed it was
for "Steak Tonight,"

702
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:29,709
but we didn't have steak
that often.

703
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:33,408
We finally realized it stood
for... "Sexy Time."

704
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:35,976
Oh.

705
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:40,633
I-I don't want my sex life
to be like my parents'.

706
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,768
But they have been married
for 42 years.

707
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,467
Yeah, they have.

708
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,035
They seem happy.

709
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,037
I think it is nice that they
still want
to touch each other.

710
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,216
I need to go remove
some hemorrhoids.

711
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,791
We removed the nodule,
and your kidney function
is improving.

712
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,795
A few rounds of ampho-B
to go, but we think
you're in the clear.

713
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,104
Thank you, Dr. Park.

714
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,196
We'll get through this.
All of it.

715
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,417
And I won't freak out again.

716
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,505
I'll step up.

717
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:31,945
I'm sorry.

718
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,816
Sorry it took me so long.

719
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:37,472
You and me?

720
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,999
Yeah. You and me.

721
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,360
How did I do?

722
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,405
The surgery was a success.

723
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,146
And as long as you follow
the recovery protocols,

724
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,452
you should have
no further problems.

725
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:05,152
Look who I found
in the gift shop.

726
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,155
I wanted to see
how you were doing,
and, uh, give you these.

727
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:11,114
Aww.

728
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,379
And ask
if you might be open
to another visit next month.

729
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,687
There's a polar microbes
conference in San Francisco

730
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:22,082
that I, uh,
was considering attending.

731
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:24,519
I'd love that.

732
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:37,532
Cafeteria closed
while you were in the O.R.,

733
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,186
so I sat a couple
of meal trays aside.

734
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,362
Oh, my God.
I'm starving.

735
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:42,885
Thank you.

736
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,453
And...

737
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,891
Thanks for the push.

738
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,376
We've got grilled salmon.

739
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,596
Can be a little dry,

740
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,207
although Ms. Shenoy in 314
seems to like it.

741
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:01,817
Mm.Penne pesto.

742
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,777
Sounds promising, I know,
but lower your expectations.

743
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:07,649
Oh.And finally,

744
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,216
the humble-but-classic
grilled chicken.

745
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,652
Mm.

746
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,219
Even my 5-year-old niece
loves it,

747
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,568
and she's got the palate
of a 5-year-old.

748
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,441
I would have gone
with the pesto.

749
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,094
I could tell.

750
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:19,313
I'm sold.

751
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:20,575
Hit me
with that chicken.

752
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:21,924
You got it.

753
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,105
Unless we head over
to Tres Reyes,

754
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,369
upgrade
to insanely good tamales.

755
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,944
Are you...asking me out?

756
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:44,643
In, like, a date-y way?

757
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,168
Looks like it.

758
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,474
Wait.

759
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:51,432
You're gay?

760
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:54,435
Nothing gets by you, huh?

761
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:06,534
An upgrade to insanely good
tamales sounds perfect.

762
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,630
All right, Reznick!

763
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:16,457
Way to battle.Aw!

764
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:21,462
Park, you're up!
Allen on deck.

765
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:24,247
I got some intel.
First up is a fastball,
followed by a change-up.

766
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,511
Yeah, that's
because he doesn't
have anything else, man.

767
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,687
His curve ball's a disaster.Good to know.

768
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:31,907
All right. You got this.Dilallo, in the hole.

769
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:34,170
Oh. It's 7:45.Yeah.

770
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:35,781
Sorry. Gotta go.

771
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:36,695
What do you mean,
you gotta go?

772
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:37,913
You're... You're
the cleanup hitter.

773
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:38,827
We are on a schedule.

774
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,440
Go, Park!

775
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:44,398
Oh!

776
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,226
Strike!Ah!

777
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,575
Oh, that's a ball!
That was high!

778
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:49,577
0-1!

779
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,839
Nice turn on
that double play last inning.

780
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,320
Thanks.

781
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,540
If only you could handle
our schedule
with the same skill.

782
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,240
1 and 1.

783
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:01,850
You got some ideas?

784
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:02,938
Actually, yeah.

785
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,120
I'm listening.

786
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,735
Oh!

787
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:19,520
Go, Park! Yeah!
Good job, man!

788
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,740
Park!

789
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,317
It just feels
a little weird.

790
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,583
Like we're on the clock,
you know?

791
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:41,716
I would offer you a chocolate
to help you relax,

792
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,240
but I gave them away
to Viktor.

793
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:46,155
Who's Viktor?

794
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,028
A very nice Arctic explorer
who came to the hospital

795
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:50,072
to have sex
with my patient.

796
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:51,900
Oh.

797
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,381
How full service.

798
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,385
It was remarkable.

799
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,344
His penis got stuck
in my patient's vagina.

800
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,394
No, it didn't.

801
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,830
Oh, yes, it did.

802
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,092
No.

803
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:11,224
It did.

804
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:20,581
Come here.

805
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,237
Oh.
