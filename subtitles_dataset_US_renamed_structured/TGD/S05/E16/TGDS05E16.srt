Uh...

29

First
we were neighbors,

30
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:41,535
then we became friends,
then roommates.

31
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:45,072
We bonded over our love
of pancakes and karaoke.

32
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:48,176
And before we knew it,
we were having our first kiss.

33
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,677
We were drunk
from tequila,

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,612
and I vomited
immediately after.

35
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,880
Yeah.

36
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,915
And Lea said
we were just friends,

37
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,785
and she said that was all we
could be because of my autism,

38
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,621
and I thought she was
superficial and prejudiced.

39
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,956
But I was wrong about her,
and she was, too.

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,559
She could be happy

41
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,763
So she asked me
to marry her, and I said yes.

42
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,432
You sure did.

43
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,733
I have to go.

44
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,734

You don't want to be blurred.
It'll be fun.

50

We'll be the younger,

Only a select few make it

61
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,139
through this rigorous
five-year residency,

62
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:55,343
which traditionally
culminates with a test

63
00:02:55,476 --> 00:03:00,448
to see if those residents
are prepared to be attendings.

64
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,716
Did I say "rigorous" twice?
I can take that again.

Uh, don't... Don't worry.
You're doing great.

Dr. Murphy and Dr. Park,

68
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,961
today each of you
will be put in charge
of a surgical case

69
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,665
and evaluated based
on your O.R. performance,

70
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,133
your ability
to delegate responsibility,

71
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:23,771
to manage junior residents,
and think on your feet.

72
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,806
The next surgical cases
that come through the E.R.

73
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,040
will be all yours.

At least 10%
total body surface area.

78
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,121
I see areas
of second-degree burns,

79
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,291
forehead, scalp, and cheek
with associated burn blisters,

80
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,293
likely mid-to-deep dermal
partial thickness burns.

81
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,028
Send blood for CBC, urea,
electrolytes, lactate,

82
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,996
and get EKG
and chest film.

83
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,901
Okay, give one milligram
of Dilaudid.

84
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,437
Dana, it's okay.
We're giving you something
stronger for the pain.

00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,607
Start IV antibiotics.
Capillary refill is sluggish.

44-year-old firefighter,

No burns.
He saved a woman
from the fire,

92
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,400
then he got pinned
by a beam.

93
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:27,601
Sir, please go
to the waiting room.

94
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,202
We'll keep you updated.

He's tachycardic
and hypotensive.

98
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,650
Could be bleeding
into his abdomen.

99
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,251
Give me the ultrasound.

100
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,519
Give me the ultrasound!

101
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,925
Intraperitoneal hemorrhage.

Shaun

He views the world
a bit differently

108

a little bit differently.

109
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,421
But we accept him
just as he is.

Luckily,
