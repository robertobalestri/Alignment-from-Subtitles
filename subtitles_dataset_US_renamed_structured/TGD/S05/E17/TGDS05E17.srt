183
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,081
Ninety-four.

184
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,551

very expensive.

185

a new laptop.

You sure about that?

187
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,891
An eternal symbol
of the unbreakable
bond of love

188
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,325
versus
a faster processor?

189
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,930
Anything?

190
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,431

There's just too many
tortuous vessels.

Right. So, what else
do we have?

Removing the kidney
is the safest option.

Putting him on dialysis
for the rest of his life?

286
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,003
It may be our only option.

287
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,172
Dialysis in Guatemala...

288
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,874
Lucho would be
institutionalized.

289
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,410
You need to come up
with a better plan.

290
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,615
I like going through
the posterior wall.

291
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,584
It gives us
the best access
to the tumor.

292
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,386
We'd be cutting through
a massive amount of tissue.

293
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,188
Wouldn't that seriously
weaken his heart muscle?

294
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,823
Not as much
as the tumor will.

295
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,658
Hey. Making any progress?

296
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,961
Uh, you tell me.

297
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,063
Hmm. It'll decrease
his cardiac output.

298
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,065
Not as much
as the tumor will.

299
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,133
It's the same surgical plan
that I came up with.

300
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,302
Which is why
I've looked into
a non-surgical plan.

301
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,237
M.T.O.R. inhibitors.

302
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,073
Proven effective
at shrinking small tumors

303
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,507
like the one
in Lucho's heart.

304
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,942
Those meds
take months to work.

305
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,443
Months that
Lucho will have

306
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,079
because the heart surgery
won't have killed him.

307
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,514
His heart will still
be stressed during
the other surgeries.

308
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,283
He could have
a cardiac arrest
on the table.

309
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,151
Which is why we'll have
a non-surgical team,

310
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,354
Morgan and Asher, in the O.R.
watching for any arrhythmias.

the correct answer.

359
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,042
Okay, we're all done here.

360
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,777
Let's close him up.

361
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,346
Lea chose
our wedding theme.

362
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,415
She texted me
a picture of what
I'm supposed to wear.

363
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,485
It is called
The Gosling.

364
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,788
Ooh, very debonair.

365
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,324
The cummerbund looks
very restrictive.

366
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,525
Oh.

367
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,994
And that hairstyle
requires a lot of gel.

368
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,130
I hate gel. It makes
my head feel tight.

369
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,332
Well, then you need
to tell Lea

370
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,000
so the two of you can
figure something else out.

371
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,437
What do you think,
Dr. Glassman?

372
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,609
I think if, 30 years ago,
my wife had asked me
to wear that suit,

373
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,843
I probably wouldn't
have married her.

374
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,080
And if Debbie
had asked me
two years ago,

375
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,048
I probably would have
laughed her right
out of the room.

376
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,650
So I don't have
to wear the suit?

377
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,219
No, you don't
have to wear it.

378
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,121
I'm just saying that...

379
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,991
I don't know,
maybe my marriages
would have turned out

380
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,093
a little bit differently

381
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,495
if I had, you know,
worn the suit.

382
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,968
You think Lea
wouldn't want to know
how you feel about this?

383
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,471
It's your big day,
Shaun.

384
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,544
BP is 201 over 123.

385
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,579
He's having
a seizure!

386
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,852
The brain tumor
is obstructing CSF flow,
causing seizures.

387
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,356
It needs to be removed
as soon as possible.

388
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,491
After we remove
the kidney tumors.

389
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,228
If we go into his brain
while his kidneys
are impaired,

390
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,063
we risk hypertension,
AML rupture, cerebral edema.

391
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,498
If we go into his kidneys

392
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,267
while his brain
is under pressure,

393
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,236
then we risk
brain herniation, stroke,

394
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,870
anoxic brain injury.

395
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,905
Only in the case of
serious blood loss.

396
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,407
Have you seen
his tumors?

397
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,243
There's gonna be
some serious blood loss.

398
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,677
Well, we think
we have a better plan.

399
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,114
We ligate the feeding artery
before tumor resection.

400
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,715
And, if we do
the kidney surgery first,

401
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,152
we also
minimize the risk
of S.I.A.D.H.,

402
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,520
which could very easily lead
to long-term heart damage.

403
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,589
So, brain first,

404
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,991
safer, but more likely
to leave him compromised.

405
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,293
Kidneys first,

406
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,529
riskier, but more likely
to lead to a full recovery.
