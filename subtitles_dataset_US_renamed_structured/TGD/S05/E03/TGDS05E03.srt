1
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,094
You okay?

2
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,396
I stamped and addressed
all the Save the Date cards.

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,231
I hope two months' notice
is enough.

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,201
The wedding planning books
all said four to six is best.

5
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,503
You definitely
could have waited
until you had a day off.

6
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,305
I couldn't sleep.

7
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:38,806
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,144
I know change
is hard for you.

9
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,881
Salen's changes are not hard
because of my ASD.

10
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,017
The new soap, hand dryers,
and scrubs

11
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,053
are all inferior
to what we had before.

12
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,023
Now I have to bring
my own soap
and paper towels.

13
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,659
I've seen you adapt
to things before.

14
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,662
Like the toilet paper
and how I cut avocados.

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,698
She uses the same stuff
at her other hospitals,

16
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,101
and the staff
apparently likes them.

17
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,138
I need to show her
my evidence.

18
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,005
I'm sure Salen
has her own evidence.

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,707
She's all about
collecting data.

20
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,176
I'm not wrong.

21
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,044
I didn't say you were.

22
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,248
Maybe you should see
what the others think first.

23
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,450
If the studies
prove I'm right,

24
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,084
what others think
doesn't matter.

25
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,853
To you, yes,

26
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,822
but she installed smile-frown
buttons in every room.

27
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,860
To get Salen
to change her mind,

28
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:36,029
you need to think about what's
important to her, not you.

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,766
That is...

30
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,101
Good advice.

31
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,536
Uh, thank you.

32
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,872
You're welcome.

33
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,408
And thank you
for taking care of these.

34
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,043
I will mail them out today.

35
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,547
This is so exciting.

36
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,550
Yes, it is.

37
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,759
Well,
you signed a year lease.

38
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,729
Might be worth buying a couch,
putting some art on the wall.

39
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,731
The art I like
I can't afford.

40
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,201
And you didn't like
watching TV in bed?

41
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,239
I definitely liked
not watching TV in bed.

42
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,576
At least get
a damn coffee maker.

43
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,577
Si, Jefa.

44
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,681
Andrews is tu jefe now.

45
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,049
Mmm, suerte la mia.

46
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,586
I know it's been a while
since you've been supervised.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,358
I've got enough on my plate
dealing with Salen,

48
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,159
so please...
Make it work.

49
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,663
I've worked with
trust fund donors
and dictators.

50
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:44,898
I can manage Andrews.

51
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,171
** Oh, what
a beautiful morning

52
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,807
** Oh, what a beautiful day

53
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,476
Somebody's
in a good mood.

54
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,611
Just had my first
personal training session

55
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,112
in our new fitness center.

56
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,981
I highly recommend Rafael.

57
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,384
Cute?
Very.

58
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,019
And he knows
just how hard to push
when stretching you out.

59
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,822
I'll stick to
working out at home.

60
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,824
Where he can pretend
he's Rocky Balboa.

61
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,159
More like Soo Woong Lee.

62
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,262
Salen would probably install
a heavy bag if you asked.

63
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,397
She seems eager
to upgrade the amenities.

64
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,433
She's eager for a reduced rate
on our health insurance,
which a gym gives her.

65
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,435
And you prefer
she pay more?

66
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,136
After she's done
with the paint
and window treatments,

67
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,338
the cuts will come.

68
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,806
You're complaining about
upgrades you agree with

69
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,375
because you're
annoyed about cuts

70
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,409
that haven't
even been proposed?

71
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,544
If you're so optimistic,

72
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,645
why were you tossing
and turning all night?

73
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,648
I was hot,
and I hate your mattress.

74
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,217
Don't you have
an ACL to repair?

75
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,660
It was in the low 60s
last night.

76
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,432
I got tacos
on the way home,

77
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,666
and then I couldn't...

78
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,837
You know,
while we were in bed.

79
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,906
I am still in so much pain
and totally bloated.

80
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,210
Would you fart
in front of a boyfriend?
Absolutely no.

81
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,546
I'm all for being real,
but not that...

82
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,383
Good morning.

83
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,719
We were just saying...

84
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,153
How much we love
the gym. It's...

85
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,355
Stop talking.

86
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,861
I had
an inspiration
in the shower.

87
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,563
I never wait
to jot down a good idea.

88
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,897
All right.

89
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,034
First time I sleep over
at a guy's place,

90
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,036
in the morning,
while he's in the shower,

91
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,705
I go in, take a seat
on the toilet, drop a deuce.

92
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,975
Really separates the men
from the boys.

93
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,948
We need some help
over here!

94
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,752
27-year-old male.
Severe craniofacial trauma.

95
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,119
Non-responsive.
Breathing's shallow.

96
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,422
Need an airway cart
and ICP bolt set-up.

97
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,057
He get hit by a car?

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,525
His front tire got caught
in a drain grate.

99
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,394
Flew over the handlebars
and crashed face-first
into the curb.

100
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,762
His mouth
is full of blood.

101
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,296
We need to secure his airway
before we lose it.

102
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,947
I need to get a brain
and face CT.

103
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,817
We're also going to need
3-D CT recon scans.

104
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,455
To create a stereolithographic
model of the two...

105
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,557
Actually three surgeries
he'll need

106
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,459
to repair his mandible,
nasal bones, frontal sinus,

107
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,561
and skull and the orbital
blowout fractures.

108
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,763
Damn. That's gonna be awesome.

109
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,601
That we get to help him.

110
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,939
It's also going to be
some very cool surgeries.

111
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,012
Thank you.

112
00:05:58,726 --> 00:05:59,960
Surgery number one
will be a creation of

113
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,629
a submental airway.

114
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:02,763
The new soap smells awful

115
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,997
and it takes
too long to rinse.

116
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,699
Do you agree?
I like it.

117
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,635
Surgery number two
will be an ORIF

118
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,503
to repair his
nasoorbitoethmoid frontal bone

119
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,971
and sinus fractures.

120
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,206
And the jet air hand dryers
are too loud,

121
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,876
and they aerosolize germs,
increasing their spread.

122
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:16,977
They're better
for the environment,

123
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,979
and if you've
washed properly,

124
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,313
there shouldn't be
any germs to spread.

125
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,682
Okay, you're wrong.

126
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,717
I'll show you the research
before I talk to Salen.

127
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,786
The third and final surgery
will be ORIF

128
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,555
of the bilateral
mandible fractures, ZMC,

129
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,989
and complex repair
of all orbital fractures

130
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,091
with free tissue transfer,
customized miniplates,

131
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,493
and PEEK implants.

132
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,961
This is gonna
be awesome.

133
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,363
You're gonna talk to Salen
about the hand dryers?

134
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,365
And the soap and scrubs.

135
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,534
Start prepping him
for the submental airway

136
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:41,835
while I brief Dr. Lim.

137
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,841
There's new soap?

138
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,249
The device was implanted
into my skull two years ago.

139
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,851
And you're still
experiencing the seizures.

140
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,020
No.

141
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,023
For the first time in my life,
I'm able to go on walks alone,

142
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,627
drive a car, actually interact
with clients at work.

143
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,663
Well, if it's working so well,
why does Dr. Karlson
want to take it out?

144
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,398
The company that
made the implant

145
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,566
wants to turn it off.

146
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,704
That doesn't
make any sense.

147
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,438
They can't force her
to have it removed.

148
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,640
Yeah, but they can stop

149
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,575
the software updates
it needs to work,

150
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,611
which could make her seizures
even worse.

151
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,213
The implant's
an experimental prototype.

152
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,281
Worked only for a tiny
percentage of patients,

153
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,651
which makes it not profitable
enough to continue support.

154
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,385
That's absurd.
It's evil.

155
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,888
It's capitalism.

156
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,090
Karlson's right.
It has to come out.

157
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,426
But he's wrong that going back
to the old meds

158
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,961
is her best
treatment option.

159
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,663
What if we swapped
the RNS device

160
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,031
for a vagal nerve
stimulator?

161
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,065
She already had one.
Didn't work.

162
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,936
I was thinking laser
interstitial thermal therapy.

163
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,605
Would only be
partially effective.

164
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:52,973
She was having
50 seizures a day.

165
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,709
"Partially" can make
a big difference in her life.

166
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,111
Not big enough.

167
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,414
What about combining
multiple subpial transections

168
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:05,519
within the eloquent cortex
with intraoperative ECoG

169
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,621
to resect the adjacent
seizure focus?

170
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:11,224
That would be complex,
and being even
a few millimeters off target

171
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,293
could leave her
a hemiplegic.

172
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,596
Could happen...
If another surgeon
was doing it.

173
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,301
I'm confident with you at
the helm, we can pull it off.

174
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,306
Trying to "manage up"

175
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,609
is not the way to get an idea
approved by me.

176
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,112
But I'll never
turn down a good idea

177
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,647
because it was
presented poorly.

178
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,184
And it's actually
a great idea.

179
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,722
I see
you've scheduled a surgery

180
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,856
that has no billing code

181
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,758
because it's never
been done before.

182
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,526
Yes,
the client consented,

183
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,528
and we've already gotten
insurance pre-approval.

184
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,997
Fantastic.
Have you also
run it past legal?

185
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,967
Why would we do that?

186
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,002
Because we could get sued
and it sounds risky.

187
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,739
Is there a Plan B?

188
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,374
There isn't
a comparable option.
Not even remotely?

189
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,577
Well, as is usually the case,
there is a less risky option,

190
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,179
but would also
be less effective.

191
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,915
Seems better
to start with an approach

192
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,717
that leaves us
with less liability.

193
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,989
But as long as it's covered
by insurance...

194
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,658
It's your call.

195
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,094
That was weird.

196
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,696
More like
totally inappropriate.

197
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,030
Hold up.

198
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,566
She's not even a doctor.

199
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,768
She is our boss.

200
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,569
So we're gonna
tell the patient,

201
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,105
"Sorry, that surgery we just
told you about isn't happening

202
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,539
"because we're afraid
you'll sue us"?

203
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,909
No. We're gonna do
exactly as we planned

204
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,811
after we get Salen
on board.

205
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,246
Salen needs to stay
in her lane.
No, you do.

206
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,448
We've got time, right?

207
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,651
There's no harm in you and I
doing a bit more research

208
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,586
while he works on Salen.

209
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,054
Keep me posted.

210
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:24,958
Great, let me
just finish this up,

211
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,426
and then I can meet you
in 10.

212
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,896
You've got a client scheduled
for three surgeries,

213
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,031
one of which includes
custom prefabricated

214
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,400
polyetheretherketone
implants.

215
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,168
All this for a guy
who fell of his bike?

216
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,205
Actually, better make that 20.
Mmm-hmm.

217
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,307
He didn't fall,
he crashed face-first

218
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,343
into a cement curb
at over 30 miles an hour.

219
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,813
And PEEK implants
are the gold standard

220
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:46,947
for facial
reconstruction.

221
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,682
Hmm, no doubt.

222
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,851
Problem is, your client's
got Aluminum insurance,

223
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,654
so anything that's not fully
covered we can't offer him.

224
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,357
He can't be transferred.
There's too much brain edema.

225
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,993
And without the PEEK,
he'll have vision deficiencies

226
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,461
and difficulty
eating solid food.

227
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,431
Mmm.
That's unfortunate.

228
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,266
W...

229
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,169
I seem to remember
this impassioned speech

230
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,004
about how your struggles
with healthcare

231
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,940
inspired you
to start Ethicure

232
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:16,176
and how dedicated you were
to improving the system.

233
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,645
For people who make
responsible choices.

234
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,113
He's an adult
with a good job

235
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,682
who thought a $10,000
European road bike

236
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,017
was a better investment

237
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,452
than a premium
health insurance plan.

238
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,987
He was wrong.

239
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,823
And decisions
have consequences.

240
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,834
Salen won't let us ...

241
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,970
Can I help you?

242
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,071
Oh, hello.
Where's Nicole?

243
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,305
She's been reassigned.

244
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,507
I'm Ellen,
Aaron's new executive aide.

245
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,443
And he's unavailable
at the moment.

246
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,879
Can I ...
Where is he?

247
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,046
As I said,
he's unavailable.

248
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,314
Can I take a message?

249
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,849
Yes. Salen told Dr. Lim

250
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,650
everything we do needs
to be covered by insurance,

251
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,520
so Dr. Lim told me to prep our
patient for his first surgery

252
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,691
while she ties to get
the polyetheretherketone
implants covered.

253
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,927
Was that two "ethers"?
Is there a space?

254
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,130
Okay, Dr. Glassman
needs to change things back

255
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,164
to the way
they were before.

256
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,601
Okay, I'll make sure
he gets that message.

257
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,169
Good.

258
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,704
And, uh,
what's your name?

259
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:20,140
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

260
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,443
Dr. Glassman will know
if you just say Shaun.

261
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,086
You try drinking every meal
for the rest of your life

262
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,055
through a straw.

263
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,258
No, no,
don't put me on hold.

264
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,593
Your day
going any better?

265
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,163
Park and I
just spent two hours
debating the merits

266
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,132
of surgeries neither of us
believes we should do

267
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,566
because I already
came up with

268
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,401
what Andrews thinks
is a "great idea."

269
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,737
But Salen thinks
it's too risky,

270
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,372
and Andrews
won't do anything

271
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,408
without her
unqualified support.

272
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,579
So you're mad
because your boss
likes your idea

273
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,315
and wants to do it
but won't do it right away.

274
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,051
Think maybe
your real problem

275
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,452
is that you're not
used to having a boss?

276
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,589
Could you try not being right
all the time?

277
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,404
Your pushback forced me
to think of this differently.

278
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,006
Magnetoencephalography.

279
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,277
Brain scan
before the surgery.

280
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,811
It'll help give us
an accurate picture

281
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,513
of where Jenna's seizures
are starting.

282
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,982
And we may be able to do
the surgery

283
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,583
entirely using
laser ablation,

284
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,385
which would significantly
reduce the risk.

285
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,020
Cool.

286
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:42,755
Let me know
what you find out.

287
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,394
Marcus.

288
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,462
Thanks for coming
to me.

289
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,574
I'm gonna have to go with
"Vitality Puffs."

290
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,575
Mmm.

291
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,812
How's wedding planning
going?

292
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,480
Not bad.

293
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,983
Ugh, tastes like a toenail
dusted with stevia.

294
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,021
And "not bad"
sounds pretty bad.

295
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,490
When I went to mail the
Save the Dates this morning,

296
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,859
I found one
addressed to Shaun's mom,

297
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,861
who he hasn't talked to
since his dad died.

298
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,296
Could be messy.

299
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,632
I want the day to be about
our future, not the past.

300
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,234
I don't want
to reopen old wounds

301
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,236
and, and risk him
melting down

302
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,303
right before
I walk down the aisle.

303
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,473
I sound so selfish.

304
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,641
I should just send it.

305
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,376
You do sound selfish.

306
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,278
Which is fine.
It's your wedding.

307
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,547
But it's his wedding,
too.

308
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,949
And do you think
he'd hesitate to tell you

309
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,484
if he didn't want
your mom there?
No.

310
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:48,288
But he's already so stressed
with all the changes here.

311
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,190
You've never handled Shaun
with kid gloves.

312
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,691
No need to start
coddling him now.

313
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,026
Mmm.

314
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,464
Do you fart
in front of Shaun?

315
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,267
Uh, doesn't everyone
stop holding them in

316
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,135
after, like,
the third date?

317
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,738
I like to be seen as sexy.
It keeps the spark alive.

318
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,176
When I first moved in
with Shaun,

319
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,144
I convinced him
to order in atomic wings,

320
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,113
and I got
terrible diarrhea.

321
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,116
But Shaun prescribed
the perfect mixture

322
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,884
of Pepto
and ginger root.

323
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,688
It was disgusting, but I was
also totally vulnerable,

324
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,356
and that can be
a turn-on, too.

325
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,493
Not in the moment.

326
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,694
Long term.

327
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,262
But you think the man

328
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,064
who happily helped you
with your explosive diarrhea

329
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,865
can't handle your opinion
about his estranged mom?

330
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,341
So this is
where you're hiding.

331
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,176
It's my home.
It's not a safe house.

332
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,880
Your home that has a phone
you're refusing to answer.

333
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,551
You okay?

334
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,986
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great.

335
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,555
Always wanted a bit more time
to perfect my dovetails.

336
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:04,097
I have an issue with
a patient's insurance company.

337
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,199
Could use some
presidential clout.

338
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,900
I have
presidential clout?

339
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,639
Do you even want to know
what the problem is?

340
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,642
You want to do everything
you can
for an underinsured patient,

341
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,777
and Salen wants to do
as little as possible

342
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,879
for a client
who can't pay.

343
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,815
Okay, fine.

344
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,984
I'll call
the insurance company,
but it's not gonna help,

345
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:29,256
and Salen
will come down on you
like a bat out of a barn.

346
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,824
Since when are you
so defeatist?

347
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,427
Since I was defeated.

348
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,307
You have a minute?

349
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,742
Mmm.

350
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:50,677
Yes.

351
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,985
When I went to mail
the Save the Date cards, I...

352
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,120
It won't work.

353
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:05,358
There's nothing
as good as the PEEK.

354
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,859
Shaun, could you take a break
for just a minute?

355
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,231
We agreed
we would each make

356
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,067
our own invite lists,
but I'm...

357
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,968
Everything is worse.

358
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,737
The dryers are loud
and distracting,

359
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,306
the soap smells terrible,

360
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,973
and I can't properly repair
my patient's face.

361
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,680
Hey.

362
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,048
You're brilliant.

363
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,483
You'll figure it out.

364
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,224
It's time to go stabilize
his airway.

365
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,137
We're gonna
turn off the implant

366
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,838
so we can get a look
at your brain

367
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,873
while you're
having a seizure.

368
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,743
It's gonna help us figure out
the safest surgical approach.

369
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,858
Got the submental
airway stable.

370
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,226
Let's close.

371
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,428
2-0 vicryls.

372
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,264
Do you want
the air conditioning
turned up, Murphy?

373
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,398
Yes, please.

374
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,932
It's already freezing
in here.

375
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,568
I'm wearing
long underwear

376
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,703
so I won't feel the synthetic
scrubs against my skin.

377
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,905
Placing a stay suture.

378
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,241
And the elastic ankles
ride up my legs.

379
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,643
Careful, don't want
to put too much tension.

380
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,745
You all must agree
the new scrubs

381
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,714
are incredibly
uncomfortable.

382
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,116
Maybe a bit,
but they do look better on me.

383
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,118
Oh, I kind of
like them, too.

384
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,054
I think the new scrubs

385
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,491
are the least offensive change
Ethicure's made.

386
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,626
Oh, yes,
the hand dryers are worse.

387
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,495
I hear they're
shrinking the chapel

388
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,963
to make room
for VIP birthing suites.

389
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,965
Well,
they can invest the profit
in patient care.

390
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,968
Having a place
for families to pray

391
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,870
is an investment
in patient care.

392
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,172
It's not a good one.

393
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,907
Encouraging people
to waste their time

394
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,343
begging some magic man
in the sky for help?

395
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,512
That's not a good use
of finite resources.

396
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,579
Silk ties.

397
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,484
What if we didn't need
three surgeries?

398
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,420
What if we could
do it in two?

399
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,355
We could contour mesh
ourselves

400
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,090
and use an SCA flap instead
of a free tissue transfer.

401
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,160
That will let us fix the upper
and midface, orbit,

402
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,595
and mandible
all at the same time.

403
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,498
That would be
a much more risky surgery

404
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,167
and still doesn't get
the PEEK implants covered.

405
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,002
It would save us
almost $90,000.

406
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,171
Which could cover the cost
of the PEEK.

407
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,606
Salen wouldn't
have a problem

408
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,041
if the total cost
remains the same.

409
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,943
Good idea.

410
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,611
Like the
entrepreneurial spirit.

411
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:45,084
Can someone wipe the sweat
off my forehead?

412
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,963
Her previous seizure
frequency was 50 a day,

413
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,198
so we should be seeing what
we need within the next...

414
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,300
She's seizing.

415
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,501
...two seconds.

416
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,904
Two epileptogenic zones.

417
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,039
Three.
Four.

418
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,908
Her seizures
have gotten worse

419
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,543
since the device
was implanted.

420
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,845
And your great surgical idea
just got even riskier.

421
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,557
Maybe Salen was right.
It is too risky.

422
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,460
No. With 50 of those a day,
she'll have to quit her job,

423
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,228
stop seeing
her friends.

424
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,699
She needs this,
and we can still do it.

425
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,001
We have a client who
needs surgery even
more than we thought

426
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,869
and a boss who was worried
about the risks

427
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,405
that are worse
than we thought.

428
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,841
So who's it gonna be,
the boss or the patient?

429
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,677
I reject your premise.

430
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,879
We can still
do your surgery,

431
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,448
and I'll get Salen
to support it.

432
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,385
Are you afraid of Salen?

433
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,454
No, I'm not afraid.
It's her hospital.

434
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,389
Then you need
to come back to work

435
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,858
and help me stop her
from making
all these terrible changes.

436
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,259
What I need to do
is stomp on grapes.

437
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:04,464
I'm gonna stomp grapes and,
and make Zinfandel,

438
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,066
a jammy and peppery
Zinfandel.

439
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,436
They're very hard
to come by.
Okay.

440
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,604
Looks very unpleasant.

441
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,272
It's really not.
It's really a lot of fun.

442
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,574
You want to try?

443
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,209
Mmm... No.

444
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,845
It's just grapes.
You like grapes.

445
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,647
Not to walk on.

446
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,049
Why don't you jump in
and give it a try?

447
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:26,085
If you don't like it, then you
can step right on out again.

448
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,087
Okay?

449
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,089
Take off your shoes
and socks.

450
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,458
Roll up your pants.

451
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,625
Okay.

452
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,600
There you go.

453
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:44,771
Come on.

454
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,177
Whoop.
There you go.

455
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,279
Hmm.

456
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,747
There you go.

457
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,651
Just ... No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

458
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,119
Get into a rhythm.
Okay.

459
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,155
Okay, ready?
One and two.

460
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,324
Hold on.
One, two.

461
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,326
One, two.

462
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,862
One, two.

463
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,964
Now one and a-two.

464
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:14,100
No, no, no.

465
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,802
No, it's okay.
No! No!

466
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,737
No, I got you. I...
Don't do that.
No, I...

467
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,973
No, thank you.
I told you
I don't like it,

468
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,776
and I don't believe
you like it, either.

469
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,318
You don't love tying flies
or woodworking

470
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,853
or walking on grapes.

471
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,823
But you used to love
doing your job.

472
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,010
I hear I'm not the only one
with a Salen problem.

473
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,813
And I hear
Jordan solved yours.
This time.

474
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,182
She's not unreasonable.
Just has other priorities.

475
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,452
She has one priority,
making money.

476
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,655
People play the roles
you cast them in.

477
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:11,357
Make her an adversary,
that's how she'll act.

478
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,760
That why you cast Mateo
in the role of resident?

479
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,827
Hoping he'll play along?

480
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,130
If your boyfriend
has a problem

481
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,633
with the way I'm managing
our client, or him,

482
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,401
he can speak
to me directly.

483
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,339
Rendon and Andrews,
two alphas.

484
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,008
How's that going?

485
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,243
Gas still keeping you up?

486
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,846
If you want to keep a secret,
don't talk about it at work.

487
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,584
I've seen the lacy bras
you've been wearing

488
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,051
since Mateo showed up.

489
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,587
You obviously agree
with the importance

490
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,455
of maintaining
sex appeal.

491
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,224
Undergarments are a choice.
Digestion isn't.

492
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,393
But you can choose when
and where to let 'em rip.

493
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,395
This isn't about farts.

494
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,165
You're afraid that Park
won't be as turned on
by the real you

495
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,102
as he is by the facade
he started sleeping with.

496
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:06,445
Hey. Clever idea in the OR.
Wish it had been mine.

497
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,881
Of course, surgery won't be
as fun as Shaun's
would have been, but still.

498
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,283
What?

499
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,652
You must think
I'm pretty stupid

500
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,286
to waste my time
talking to "a magic man."

501
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,155
I-I don't think
you're stupid,

502
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,390
but I do think praying
is a waste of time.

503
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,193
It's just my opinion.

504
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,929
Doesn't make it
any less offensive.

505
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,432
Look, I'm sorry
that you're offended.

506
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,434
That's not an apology.

507
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,970
And I'm sorry
that you're upset
that I won't apologize

508
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:35,107
for saying prayer
is pointless,
but... It is.

509
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,576
So you're gonna
double down.

510
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,245
If you're going to
insist on...

511
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,918
We need O-neg,
a central line kit,

512
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,987
fluids, pressers, and
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

513
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,558
He's in hemorrhagic shock.
The wound's infected.

514
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,299
We can't risk
combining surgeries now.

515
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,535
Risk of septic shock
is too high.

516
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,836
Our plan won't work.

517
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,172
Maybe if we wait?

518
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,440
Once the antibiotics have
cleared the infection ...

519
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,677
He doesn't have time.

520
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,681
We need to reduce
the deformities
before they ossify,

521
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,383
and my original plan
was better.

522
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,219
But Salen
won't let us do that.
We need something new.

523
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,622
Like a miracle, maybe?

524
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,158
I thought we were friends.
We are.

525
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,794
Then why do you keep
going out of your way

526
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,295
to insult the things
that matter to me?

527
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,297
I'm not offended by
your devotion to religion.

528
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,800
Why should you be offended
by my devotion to atheism?

529
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,168
That's not even
the same thing.
Stop talking.

530
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,370
You're wasting time
on an irrelevant issue

531
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,272
and distracting me.

532
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:43,275
Mmm, but constantly fussing
about the scrubs

533
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,977
and the soap in the bathrooms
is relevant?

534
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,348
Nice, Asher.
Trivialize his autism.

535
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,883
Because you haven't
offended enough people.

536
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,953
ASD doesn't
make me irrational.

537
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,555
The changes are
objectively worse, okay?

538
00:25:58,591 --> 00:25:59,826
I'm sorry, Shaun.

539
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,330
See?

540
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,665
How hard was that?

541
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:16,175
A retired neurosurgeon
taking up woodworking's cute.

542
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,177
Winemaking's
a sad cliche.

543
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,546
But abstract painting?

544
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,380
That's a cry for help.

545
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,682
Jealous?

546
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,851
No.

547
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,586
But props.
You clearly outfoxed Salen.

548
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,221
What'd you give her?

549
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,657
Anything I might
be able to trade?

550
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,925
You thought coming to my house
and insulting me

551
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,561
was a good intro
to asking for help?

552
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,130
You'd be helping a woman
with a severe
seizure disorder.

553
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,732
Doing it for
the desperate patient

554
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,868
seems more believable
coming from Lim.

555
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,237
Is the surgery
covered by insurance?

556
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,606
Yes.
Okay, then Salen
can't stop you.

557
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,408
Which you obviously
already knew,

558
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,477
so this isn't about
helping a patient.

559
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,014
It's about getting help
to keep the new boss
off your back.

560
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,849
You're an accomplished
professional.

561
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,450
You can handle it
yourself.

562
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,925
What's this supposed to be,
anyway?

563
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,727
A sailboat.

564
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,363
It's not supposed to
be anything.

565
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,399
It's supposed to
help me forget

566
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,568
how much
I miss working with you
so closely every day.

567
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,071
Well, you're welcome back
anytime.

568
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,007
Come on, clearly,

569
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,242
you're bored
out of your mind.

570
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,576
But it must feel good
to have people

571
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,078
driving over
to your house

572
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,579
begging you
for pearls of wisdom.

573
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,316
Yeah.
I feel like a real hero.

574
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:46,498
Salen, I think I may have
approached things
the wrong way.

575
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,269
Obviously,
we're not adversaries,

576
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,304
and I agree we need to
be fiscally responsible.

577
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,509
I ran a credit check
on our client.

578
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,312
He makes six figures,
lives in Palo Alto...

579
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,014
7%.

580
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,150
The average amount
hospitals collect

581
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,651
from out-of-pocket
medical expenses.

582
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:08,054
More importantly,
when I make a decision,

583
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,621
I expect my team
to carry it out.

584
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:10,957
Not try to subvert it

585
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,291
by having Glassman
run to the insurance company.

586
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,766
When you took over,
you made a commitment

587
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:23,970
to the board and to the state
to be an asset
to the community.

588
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,672
The Ethicure system
prioritizes efficiency

589
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,541
because that's the best way
to deliver top-quality care

590
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,310
with our finite resources.

591
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:35,047
Pursuit of profit
drives innovation.

592
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,316
Innovation creates
the treatments

593
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,586
that you and I both want
and our clients need.

594
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,056
Sucks for Bob, but the more
money this place makes,

595
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,624
the more people
we can help.

596
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,741
Marcus?

597
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,510
The test didn't go
the way we'd hoped.

598
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,013
In fact, it...
You can skip
the minutia.

599
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,783
I still think you should agree
to do Mateo's surgery.

600
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,286
You understand
the business of medicine.

601
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,188
I understand the mind
of a surgeon.

602
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,157
We need to feel like heroes
sometimes,

603
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,092
especially surgical jocks
like Mateo.

604
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:23,562
Give him one inefficient
miracle surgery,

605
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,033
and he'll happily
give you 50 high-billing
knee replacements.

606
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,207
Not everyone's on board
with the changes
you're making here.

607
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:38,377
You'll need allies.

608
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:46,352
I'll back
Mateo's miracle.

609
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,921
And tomorrow, you're both
on knee replacements.

610
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,731
I cannot do this.

611
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,134
It sucks,
but we have no choice.

612
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,970
We'll do
everything we can.

613
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,137
As long
as it's covered.

614
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,572
Yeah,
and send him home maimed.

615
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,875
I'm not talking about
the surgeries.

616
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,244
I can't wear
these scrubs.

617
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,014
It was too hot
with long underwear,

618
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,617
but the feeling of them
on my skin is much worse.

619
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,419
I'm going to change.

620
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:56,989
Okay.

621
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,905
Okay, please...

622
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,374
Please!

623
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,885
Uh, Shaun, I'm kind of
in the middle of something ...

624
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,587
The American Society
of Microbiology,

625
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,357
Mayo Clinic,
Clinical Microbiology.

626
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,325
All show the use
of paper towels

627
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,061
results in lower rates
of contamination

628
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,462
than jet air dryers,

629
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,030
and foaming soaps
are less concentrated,

630
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:39,231
which reduces
effectiveness.

631
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,067
Added fragrances increase
allergic reactions,

632
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,734
and synthetic fabrics
can be abrasive

633
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,171
and contribute
to microplastic pollution.

634
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:46,438
Shaun,
we talked about this.

635
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,642
Okay, you made these changes
without asking us first

636
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:55,047
because you're not trying
to help us
or protect patients.

637
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,916
You're doing it to save money,
and it's wrong!

638
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,051
Shaun...
Okay?

639
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:00,452
You're wrong.

640
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,221
I'm so sorry.
He's just really passionate.

641
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,522
You're wrong!

642
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,390
It's okay.

643
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,027
You're right.

644
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,095
Okay.

645
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,762
I didn't ask
the staff here.

646
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,364
But I did ask
other experts,

647
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,900
whose research proves
I'm not wrong.

648
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,935
But that doesn't
mean you are.

649
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:20,039
Mmm, we can't both
be right.

650
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,273
Yes, we can.

651
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,242
Because some doctors
are different.

652
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,676
And sometimes...

653
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,654
Your ASD gives you...

654
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,357
No! No, thank you.
It's not my ASD.

655
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,591
Yes, it is.

656
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,127
But if you'll
just let me finish,

657
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,795
I was going to assure you
that I'm not dismissing you.

658
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,932
I value
your unique perspective

659
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,468
because my ADHD gives me
a unique perspective.

660
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,605
You could be a great asset
to this hospital,

661
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,974
but only if I'm able
to recognize

662
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,144
that one size
may not fit all.

663
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,079
It's not the size
of the scrubs.

664
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,650
I'll have maintenance put back
the old soap and paper towels

665
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,418
in the residents' locker room
and break room.

666
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,623
And you can go back
to wearing your old scrubs.

667
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,292
But just you.

668
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,100
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

669
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:33,945
Shaun?

670
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,817
I have to go.

671
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,396
Ligate the right
sphenopalatine.

672
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,231
We need
an ultrasonic scalpel.

673
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,166
Where have you been?
We've been paging you.

674
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,735
I get to keep
my old scrubs.

675
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,671
Also, we can create
an osteomyocutaneous flap,

676
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,408
so we won't need
the customized PEEK implants.

677
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,376
It should be strong enough
to allow him

678
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,012
to have full vision function
and eat normally.

679
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,181
That's pretty brilliant.

680
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:10,682
And fully covered
by his insurance.

681
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,850
I know.

682
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,685
I also convinced Salen

683
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,787
to put the old soap
and paper towels back.

684
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,356
Nice work.

685
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,857
Who needs
the ultrasonic scalpel?

686
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,992
Me.
Wolke, you're with me.

687
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,761
Allen, help Murphy
harvest the graft.

688
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,040
Planting grapes?

689
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,243
Mammoth sunflowers, actually.

690
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,677
They're supposed to be
12 feet tall.

691
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,212
Oh, that's cool.

692
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:42,681
I'm fine.

693
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,316
Yeah, I wasn't even
gonna go there.

694
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,551
Oh, yes, you were.

695
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,819
Yeah, I was.

696
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,421
But only after we talk
about Shaun first.

697
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,589
He's fine, too.

698
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,258
No, he's really
concerned ab...
He's fine.

699
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:53,459
He's got a new fiancee.

700
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,060
He's got a new boss.

701
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,462
Mmm-hmm.
He's planning a wedding.

702
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,096
He's anxious.
I would be, too.

703
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,898
Which is exactly why
I don't want to stress
him out even more.

704
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,868
Okay.

705
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,404
Listen, Shaun gave me
the Save the Dates to mail,

706
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,905
and I found one
addressed to his mom.

707
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,944
Okay, that's interesting.
But not unreasonable.

708
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,747
I know, but I want the day
to be about us.

709
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,684
Our future.
Our happiness.

710
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,552
I don't want to feel like
I need to protect him.

711
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,822
Am I wrong?

712
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,124
Am I being unfair?

713
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,827
Selfish? Paranoid?
Feel free to step in anytime.

714
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,098
Trying to decide whether
I should plant randomly

715
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,966
or in rows.

716
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,635
That's it?
You're not gonna help?

717
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,038
No, I'm not.

718
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,914
More retraction.

719
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,317
We'll use the periosteal
to elevate
the craniotomy flap.

720
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,432
That can go
in the recycling bin.

721
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,403
Park and I
will use motor mapping

722
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,805
to ID the border
of the eloquent cortex.

723
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,107
I'll lead up the ECoG
to guide the resection.

724
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,115
Sorry.

725
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,318
I shouldn't have questioned
your motives.

726
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:29,988
The way you managed Salen
was...impressive.

727
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,323
Thank you.

728
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:32,891
I've learned a few things

729
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,560
about how to deal
with administrators.

730
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,028
And when it comes down
to us versus them...

731
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,129
I'm a surgeon.

732
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,913
As we expose the buttresses
of the midface,

733
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,047
Murphy,
I want you to...

734
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,049
Enable reduction
with 3-D control

735
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,651
followed by
rigid fixation.

736
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:00,686
Exactly.

737
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:04,756
Buttress looks too fragmented
to stabilize.

738
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,058
You should remove more bone
and then graft between...

739
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,060
No, I shouldn't.
Yes, you should.

740
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,829
The malar projection
isn't...
Stop it.

741
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,833
Not the work,
the sniping.

742
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,868
You're not just colleagues.
You're friends.

743
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,372
You know
religion hurt him.

744
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:22,641
It's what separated him
from his family.

745
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,376
That's the context
for his disdain for it.

746
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,678
And you know her prayers
aren't pointless

747
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,780
if they offer her comfort
from the pain in her life

748
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,115
that's just as significant
as yours.

749
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,452
And if that's
not reason enough,

750
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,021
then you will stop this
out of your
boundless commitment

751
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,255
to making my life easier.

752
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,757
Right?

753
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,047
Um, why haven't you
started yet?

754
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,415
We started
over five hours ago.

755
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,083
And finished.

756
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,086
Your post-resection ECoG
and neuro exam were perfect.

757
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,294
Thank you.

758
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,971
That was amazing.

759
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:31,643
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,747
Sincerely.

761
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,784
Up for a drink?

762
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,853
Tequila.

763
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,821
Stat.

764
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,257
Okay.
Okay.

765
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,395
Now, isn't this something?

766
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,730
It's a small world
in Argentina, isn't it?

767
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,499
Isn't it?

768
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,266
Why did you marry him?

769
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,135
My husband's
a very attractive man.

770
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,637
You all right?

771
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,539
Yeah, fine.

772
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,040
What was that word again,
Johnny?

773
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,675
You married him
for his money.

774
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,177
Actually
I'm not.

775
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,181
Much better.

776
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,352
Oh, thank God.

777
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,190
Now isn't that an amazing
coincidence?

778
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,138
** Now, if you need me,
call me

779
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,806
** No matter
where you are

780
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,475
** No matter how far

781
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,343
** Don't worry, baby

782
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:39,711
** Just call my name

783
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,414
** I'll be there
in a hurry

784
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,382
** You don't
have to worry

785
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:48,720
** 'Cause, baby, there ain't
no mountain high enough

786
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:52,558
** Ain't no valley low enough

787
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:56,027
** Ain't no river wide enough

788
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:59,397
** To keep me from
getting to you, babe

789
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,066
** Remember the day **

790
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,200
A toast.

791
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,104
To me.

792
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,907
I had faith in myself,
spoke my mind,

793
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,842
and got everything
I asked for.

794
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,612
Totally.
I'm proud of you.

795
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,848
** Ain't no valley
low enough

796
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:20,852
** Ain't no river wide enough

797
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,989
** To keep me from
getting to you, babe **

798
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,925
** If you're ever
in trouble **

799
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,026
Shaun...

800
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,263
I didn't mail
the Save the Date
card to your mom.

801
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,801
Mmm.

802
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,368
Because I don't want
to invite her.

803
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:40,305
Hmm.

804
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,441
I feel like you two still
have a lot to work through,

805
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:47,245
which you should, but I want
our wedding to be fun.

806
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,081
I don't want to complicate it
with any pain from the past.

807
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,083
** Ain't no valley
low enough **

808
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,888
The wedding books said
I had to invite her.

809
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:57,889
Were they wrong?

810
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,860
Maybe in this case.

811
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,462
** If you're ever in trouble,
I'll be there on the double **

812
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,732
Would you be okay
not having her there?

813
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:09,334
** My love is alive **

814
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,903
Yes.

815
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,906
Very.

816
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,109
** If you ever need
a helping hand

817
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,045
** I'll be there
on the double

818
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,881
** As fast as I can

819
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,816
** Ain't no mountain
high enough

820
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,652
** Ain't no valley low enough

821
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,419
** Ain't no river wide enough

822
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:29,988
** To keep me from you

823
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,057
** Ain't no mountain
high enough

824
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,659
** Ain't no valley low enough

825
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,794
** Ain't no river wide enough

826
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,929
** To keep me from you

827
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:41,466
** Ain't no mountain
high enough

828
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,501
** Ain't no valley low enough **

829
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,941
You were right.
I should have listened to you.

830
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,943
And Andrews.

831
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:55,681
Oh, your confidence is
just one of the things
I like about you,

832
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,850
especially when it allows you
to admit that I'm right.

833
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,820
And what are
the other things?

834
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,023
Oh, should I tell you
or show you?

835
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:17,969
I'm surprised
he'd agree to that.

836
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,672
I'm sure he didn't.
