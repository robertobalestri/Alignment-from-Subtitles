1
00:00:02,176 --> 00:00:05,875
Banana blueberry
with a hint of cinnamon.

2
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:08,095
I think
it's my best yet.

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,401
Hm.
I like chocolate chip...

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,534
Mmm....with syrup.

5
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,579
I like eating pancakes
in bed.

6
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,668
Do you want to
have sex again?Yes.

7
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:17,887
Do you want to finish
the pancakes first?

8
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:20,498
Yes.Me too.

9
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,937
We are very good
at pretending to be married,

10
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,114
but we are very bad
at getting married.

11
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,377
I don't want to
do it anymore.

12
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,075
Not the marriage,
the wedding.

13
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,599
I don't want any more
dress fittings or guest lists.

14
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,384
I just want to be married.

15
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:41,128
Shaun...

16
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:43,521
...we have 45 more minutes
of our fake honeymoon.

17
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,088
No work.

18
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,962
There is an opening at
the courthouse tomorrow
at 4:30.

19
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:56,839
Cheese, no.
Peppers, yes?

20
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,928
Perfect.

21
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:06,022
Is that him?

22
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:07,458
Based on the last
three voicemails,

23
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,287
he's calling about
the restraining order I filed.

24
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:13,682
How are you feeling?Like my future is a dark,
formless void,

25
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,945
which makes it
full of possibility.

26
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,816
Like a one-bed,
one-bath rental.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,210
You've only been here
a few days.

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,517
Which is a few days longer
than anyone should crash

29
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:23,083
on their boss's couch.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,782
Thank you, Audrey.

31
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,131
Thank you.

32
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:32,222
Why am I watching you
make a smoothie?

33
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,311
You're watching me dance
while I make a smoothie.

34
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:35,921
It's not a smoothie
if it has tequila in it.

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,923
It's a spinach and flax seed
margarita.

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,099
Hey!
And it makes you dance.

37
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,622
Mm.

38
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:42,189
Okay, listen...
No.

39
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,320
Too much butt, though.

40
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:44,147
Think about the butt.

41
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,670
Asher?

42
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,201
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:01,904
Meet my parents.

44
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:18,007
Steph Lewis, 35.

45
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,183
She had a brainstem stroke
nine years ago

46
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,099
that left her paralyzed
from her face down.

47
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:24,622
I still have
10% movement in three fingers

48
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,190
so don't sell me short.

49
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:30,802
W... How'd you type that
so quickly?

50
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,456
I have eight different
pre-programmed phrases

51
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,327
to put people at ease.

52
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,419
She's had four serious bouts
of pneumonia

53
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,160
in the last few months.

54
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,814
Um, she's taken levofloxacin
for the infection

55
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:45,643
and glycopyrrolate
for the trach secretions,

56
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,950
but she still has high fever,
decreased energy,
night sweats.

57
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,822
He's so sexy
when he talks medical.

58
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:52,172
The pneumonia
caused scar tissue,

59
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,303
which is compressing
her lung.

60
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,218
She needs surgical
decortication.

61
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,089
That's a pretty aggressive
approach.

62
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,004
Surgery comes
with serious risk,

63
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,485
recurrent air leaks,
respiratory failure, sepsis.

64
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,574
And giving round after round
of antibiotics

65
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,272
is only going to make
the infections harder to...

66
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,448
Hello.

67
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,673
I want the surgery.

68
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,809
I know the risks.
I'm sick of feeling crappy.

69
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,213
I have terminal
lung cancer.

70
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,215
Doctors say I have
less than a year

71
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,217
and no good surgical options.

72
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:43,310
I'm... So sorry.

73
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,442
We're not here
for sympathy.

74
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:48,663
God, in his wisdom,
gave us a son

75
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,535
who would grow up to be
a doctor for times like this.

76
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,408
He will work a miracle
through you.

77
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:09,988
I can't do lunch today.
I have a job interview

78
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,599
with New York Medical Center.

79
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:12,991
I didn't know you were
considering positions

80
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,515
on the other side
of the country.

81
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm not. I just want to
get multiple offers

82
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,127
so I can leverage a better one
from St. Bon's.

83
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,434
Makes you look in demand.

84
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,262
Uh, I'd rather look like
I want the job I have now.

85
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,481
Oh, hello.

86
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,570
Hi.Yes.

87
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:30,052
Um, thank you so much
for your gift, whatever it is.

88
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,010
We are returning it.

89
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,664
We're getting married
at the courthouse tomorrow.

90
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,449
And since neither of you
are invited,

91
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,234
Weddiquette.org said we're
supposed to return the gift.

92
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,105
Excellent. I can exchange it
for store credit.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,151
That's exciting.

94
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,153
They're getting married where
people pay parking tickets.

95
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,589
What about
a destination wedding?

96
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,765
Hmm. We're good.

97
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,680
I have to go.
We are going to be

98
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,856
husband and wife
in 30 hours and 27 minutes.Mm. Mm.

99
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,513
Stage four lung cancer

100
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:57,906
which has invaded
the chest wall.

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,908
Six rounds of chemo.
The treatment has caused

102
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:01,692
severe anemia and colitis.

103
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,912
Your hair is flatter.

104
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,870
We need a CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis,

105
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:08,395
CBC, blood cultures,
and an EKG.

106
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,875
I will review your results
with Dr. Andrews,

107
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,356
and we will try to find
a treatment to help you.

108
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,966
God bless you,
Dr. Murphy.

109
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,968
Okay, thank you.

110
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,715
Can you guys cool it

111
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:25,890
with the blessing people
in the name of God?

112
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,631
This is
a secular hospital.

113
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,372
It's called
Saint Bonaventure.

114
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,637
Mr. and Mrs. Wolke,
I'm Jerome.

115
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,552
We met briefly
this morning.

116
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,466
I'm gonna draw some blood.

117
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:38,903
Jerome is...

118
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,384
A nurse.

119
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,518
Jerome is your nurse.

120
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,350
The surgery went well.

121
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,612
We removed
all of the scar tissue,

122
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,701
and the lung expanded
completely.

123
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,964
Thank you.Mm.

124
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,014
Why can't she
move her hand?

125
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,284
Steph, can you blink
when you feel something?

126
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,030
What's going on?

127
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,950
Will it come back?

128
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,258
I don't know.

129
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,144
I read your letter

130
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,625
a few months ago.

131
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,540
I sent it six years ago.

132
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,980
I wasn't sure I wanted to hear
what you had to say.

133
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,810
But it was nice.

134
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,860
I just wanted to tell you
about the family.

135
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,214
I'm not a part
of the family anymore.

136
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:15,217
You made that very clear
when I left.

137
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,610
You chose to leave.

138
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:23,921
We wanted you to stay,
wanted to help you.

139
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,575
You're not the only one
who struggles

140
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:29,057
with finding
the right path.

141
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,581
We all must sometimes choose
to deny our flesh.

142
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:37,500
You're right.

143
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,722
I did make a choice.

144
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,854
I could follow your rules,

145
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,031
or I could love and accept
who I am.

146
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:52,950
I chose which one
mattered more...

147
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,691
And so did you.

148
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,307
Are you okay?

149
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,570
Take a deep breath.

150
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,055
I need some help!

151
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,239
CT shows the chest wall tumor
has grown.

152
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,024
He's bleeding into
the thoracic cavity,
and it is collapsing his lung.

153
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:24,895
He needs surgery
to stop the bleed now.

154
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,157
His blood cell counts
are too low.

155
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,855
Maybe we should do an echo
to see if his heart

156
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,247
is stable enough for... No. There isn't time.

157
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:30,771
Get consent from your mother,
and I will start

158
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,860
prepping your father
for the embolization.

159
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:33,904
The anesthesia
must have caused

160
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,210
a drop in
Steph's blood pressure

161
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,864
and completed
her previous injury.

162
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,169
Then her best bet's
eye-tracking technology.

163
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,389
That'll be great,

164
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:41,738
as long as she only wants
to speak one word a minute.

165
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,174
Well, she'll get
the hang of it.

166
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,785
After months of training.

167
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,048
Well, it's better than
what she has now.

168
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,528
How'd the interview go?

169
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,573
Mm. Great.

170
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:52,096
The head
of internal medicine

171
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,620
is basically me
10 years from now.

172
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:55,622
We loved each other.

173
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,885
And her department just got
a SPORE grant.

174
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,277
Sounds like
you're interested.

175
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,452
It sounds like I'm answering
your question.

176
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,193
Oh, with enthusiasm.

177
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,413
Wha... What am I gonna do
with a second blender?

178
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,764
Yeah, I got you a blender.

179
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,072
Open it.

180
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,378
Weddiquette says I can't.

181
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,729
That's dumb.
Just open it.

182
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,255
Oh, I can't.

183
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,082
Just open it.

184
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:26,696
Mm.

185
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,232
I really love it.

186
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,539
Mm-hmm. The photo's
just a placeholder

187
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,107
until you get the real
wedding pics.Mm.

188
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,109
But that dress
looked amazing on you.

189
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,154
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,158
This was fun.Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,353
Your blood pressure
looks good.

192
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,921
No fever
or sign of infection.

193
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,183
We should be able to start you
on eye-tracking tomorrow.

194
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,274
W... We tried that before.

195
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,320
It can take a while
to get used to.

196
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:33,894
No, no, the camera's
facing the right way
this time.

197
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,897
I promise.

198
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,986
This is the living room.

199
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,077
Also the dining room, kitchen,
guest room, and office.

200
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,169
All conveniently located
in these 400 square feet.

201
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,520
And it's all ours!

202
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,358
Someone's phone's ringing.

203
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,969
I know.

204
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,884
Park.

205
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:09,059
We can give Steph
her voice back.

206
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,457
Advance the catheter to
the right fourth
intercostal artery.

207
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,379
He got this scar teaching me
how to ride a bike.

208
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,860
I was going too fast.
I didn't know how to
brake yet.

209
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,689
He caught me.

210
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,255
We both ended up
with stitches.

211
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,261
Delivering
the embolic agent.

212
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,525
My dad taught me
how to tie a tie.

213
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,572
He was a minister who wore
his Sunday best

214
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,356
every day of the week.

215
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,359
When he died,

216
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,275
I wore his suit jackets
every day for a year.

217
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,324
My dad was my first
chemistry teacher.

218
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,936
We baked together every
weekend on a quest to find

219
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,765
the perfect oatmeal
chocolate chip cookie recipe.

220
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,211
I'm cold.

221
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,778
Fluid is cloudy.

222
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,303
He has a malignant
pleural effusion.

223
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,176
Can we drain it?

224
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,613
It will keep coming back

225
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,181
and spread the cancer
everywhere in
his chest cavity.

226
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,100
Your father's prognosis
was wrong.

227
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,841
He only has
a few weeks to live.

228
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,333
You have weeks.
Maybe days.

229
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,293
But likely weeks.

230
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,599
We'll continue
to drain the fluid

231
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,862
and try to find a surgery
that will give you more time.

232
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,695
God has privileged us
with great miracles.

233
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,351
And He will again.

234
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,357
Shabbos.

235
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,669
The Jewish holy day of rest
begins tonight.

236
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:25,369
God and I plan to do
just that...

237
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:26,370
Rest.

238
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:28,982
Okay, let's...

239
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,901
We'll implant electrodes
on her sensorimotor cortex,

240
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,859
which will decode
her brainwaves.

241
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,948
All Steph has to do
is try to speak,

242
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,384
and the receiver relays
the signals,

243
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,256
which are translated
into speech.

244
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,084
It's brand-new technology

245
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,216
that's only been done
successfully a couple times.

246
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,827
It's new technology that would
give Steph not just a voice,

247
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,220
but her voice back.

248
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,483
By uploading audio files taken
before the stroke, we can...

249
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,312
But Steph can't handle another
life-threatening surgery.

250
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,836
The eye-tracking device will
allow her to communicate...

251
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,317
Right now,
they've got nothing.

252
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,232
They love each other.

253
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,147
You're pushing false hope
because you see Steph

254
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,845
as nothing but a burden.

255
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,457
I'm trying to give them
some quality of life.

256
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,372
You're risking her life
because you can't imagine

257
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,417
making that kind of sacrifice
for another person.

258
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,418
Park's right.

259
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,727
It's risky.
But it's not false hope.

260
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,381
Let's take it to them,

261
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,774
without any hint of whatever's
going on between you.

262
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,180
No one is coming into

263
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:38,616
a patient's room
to turn on the TV.

264
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:43,099
And this way,
I can ensure it.

265
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,890
Okay,
if you want him to breathe
through Shabbos,

266
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,326
I suggest you leave those
plugged in.

267
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,721
Hi, family.

268
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,681
Hello.How's your pain?

269
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:00,943
It's nothing
I can't handle.

270
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:08,733
Will you join us for Shabbos,
Dr. Allen?

271
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:13,913
Uh, I'd love to,

272
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,611
but I should be researching
how to save your life.

273
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,482
Am I dying tomorrow?

274
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,660
Then Shabbos
is more important.

275
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,793
From sundown to sundown,

276
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:29,232
we devote a day to joy
and God.

277
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,495
How can I say no to God?

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,950
I was projecting
and overreacted.

285
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,300
An interview is
just an interview.

286
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,910
They offered me the job.

287
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:28,308

288

289
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:38,013
Prayer for the sick,
for his father.

290
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,974
You want me to pray to a God
I don't believe in?

291
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:51,331
Why can't you honor me
in my last days on Earth?

292
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,375
These aren't
your last days.

293
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,898
You told me...

294
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,117
We're finding
a surgical solution.

295
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,388
I am dying.

296
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,302
I have accepted that.

00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,651
Yosel.

298
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,047
I'm sorry, Miriam.

299
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:21,665
What I want is
to go to God at peace.

300
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,410
I want you to come home.

301
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,979
Be with me and your mother

302
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,242
and your brothers
and sisters.

303
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,257
It's sad.

304
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,960
I want to be your son...

305
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,701
Almost more than
I want to be myself.

306
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,010
But I can't.

307
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,156
This is who I am.

308
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,724
And this is my boyfriend.

309
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,488
You have been acting
differently.

310
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,316
Is it because you think

311
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,448
it will make your parents
like you more

312
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:52,408
if you act more...
More...

313
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,584
Straight?Mm.

314
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:59,023
I think they'd like me more
if I actually was straight.

315
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,938
My parents would have
liked me better

316
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,984
if I didn't have autism.

317
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,899
But your dad
is not like my dad.

318
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,118
Your dad came to see you.

319
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,685
Mm.

320
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,297
The effusion fluid is
reaccumulating

321
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,169
faster than
we can drain it.

322
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,173
The tumor's like a faucet
we can't turn off.

323
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:21,785
It's spraying cancer-water
everywhere.

324
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:25,006
That is
an interesting simile.

325
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:40,848
We can't turn it off,

326
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:42,066
but we can give it
nowhere to go.

327
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,765
Hm.

328
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,507
By injecting the pleural
cavity with a slurry of talc,

329
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,857
inflammation and scarring
will fill up the space,

330
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,468
clogging up
the tumor and giving
it nowhere to leak fluid into.

331
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,340
And after you heal
from the surgery,

332
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,559
we'll try an experimental
targeted immunotherapy.

333
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,387
It should give you a year,
maybe more.

334
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,694
Ko vay hashem
Yah-chalifu Koach.

335
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:03,349
How long is the recovery?

336
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,615
You will have to
stay in the hospital

337
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,618
for at least one week.

338
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,577
What are the chances
I'll survive it,

339
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,797
the surgery, the treatment?

340
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:20,366
There are risks of both,
but we're confident...

341
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,065
I don't want to die away
from home and my family.

342
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,509
We're giving you
more time.

343
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:34,293
Please take it.

344
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,129
Okay.

345
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:46,914
Okay.

346
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:49,873
Baruch hashem.

347
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:05,846
Excuse me.
I have flowers for...

348
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,500
Someone else
can take them.

349
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:15,377
Exposing the sensorimotor
cortex of the left hemisphere.

350
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:19,381
Electrode array is prepped
for implantation.

351
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:22,079
I heard Morgan got a job offer
in New York.

352
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:25,648
Yeah.Tough call for her.

353
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,869
As long as she's at St. Bon's,
she'll be seen as

354
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:31,350
the doctor who used to be
a surgeon but
can't be anymore.

355
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,919
5-0 prolene on a castro
to suture the dura.

356
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:42,361
The AI will take samples from
a variety of cortical regions

357
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,927
that are used
in speech processing,

358
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:45,625
and the predictive analytics
should...

359
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,844
Would you work faster if you
didn't explain every step?

360
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,455
Mm.

361
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,457
To have and to hold,

362
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:54,460
to honor, to treasure,

363
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:58,464
to be at his side
in sorrow and in joy,

364
00:22:58,638 --> 00:22:59,290
in the good times
and in the bad...

365
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,383
...and to love
and cherish always.

366
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:06,602
I love you.

367
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,699
You're being a jerk.

368
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,484
You think I'm being a jerk
to the people
that want me to be

369
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,964
the godly, straight person
I never was?

370
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,928
For the two years
I've known you,

371
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:32,411
you have been cute and funny
and clever

372
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:36,023
and caring and sensitive.

373
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:41,942
Suddenly, your parents show up
and you're just angry.

374
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:42,986
I think I have
every right to be.

375
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:47,817
Why do you think
he came here?

376
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,297
So I could save his life

377
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,255
and send him back
to his real family.

378
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,998
Asher, he would have
found a reason

379
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:58,349
to get on that plane
if you were a car mechanic.

380
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:01,135
He came here for peace.

381
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,006
Not a miracle cure.

382
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,403
We have
two minutes in total

383
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,492
at the courthouse
to say our vows.

384
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,842
My vows are 26 seconds
if I'm talking slowly,

385
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,584
which I might because
it is an important moment.

386
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,630
Is one minute and 34 seconds
enough time for you?

387
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,896
Lea?Sorry.

388
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,551
Yeah, it is.

389
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:26,856
You don't sound happy.

390
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,730
Do you not like
Jordan's wedding gift?

391
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,471
No, it's beautiful.

392
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:34,560
It's just a reminder
that I'll never

393
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,171
wear a real wedding gown
at my dream wedding.

394
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:40,130
That's kind of a bummer.

395
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:43,569
Have you changed your mind
about the courthouse?

396
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:46,441
No. In those dreams,

397
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,400
you are the only constant,
Shaun.

398
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:52,491
Just the two of us,
that's enough for me.

399
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:04,546
Shaun?I'm confused.

400
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,417
Okay.

401
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,768
I think I'm getting
mixed signals.

402
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,465
Well, that's a good thing,
isn't it?

403
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,642
Is it?
It doesn't feel like it is.

404
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,297
Well,
you don't normally pick up
on non-verbal cues, right?

405
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:18,647
That's quite a leap.

406
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,170
Lea says she's disappointed

407
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,172
that we are having our wedding
at the courthouse,

408
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,565
but she also says
she wants to

409
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,785
have our wedding
at the courthouse.

410
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,178
Not quite as big a leap
as I thought, but...

411
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:29,571
I want to respect
what she wants,

412
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,618
but I also want to respect
her disappointment.

413
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,098
How, How,
How do I do both?

414
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,796
Oh, boy.

415
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,362
People don't always
know what they want.

416
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,799
But they should.

417
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,844
Especially
if it's a wedding.

418
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,498
Yeah, they should.

419
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,111
Let me think about it.

420
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,112
Excellent.

421
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,255
He wants to die.

422
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,127
He's scared.

423
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,347
I think he's at peace.

424
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,392
He wants to go home,
be with God.

425
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,135
You should let him.

426
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,139
You want me to take
moral advice from you?

427
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:20,448
You gave that up when...

428
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,059
I lost my morality
when I lost my religion?

429
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,279
Without God, there can be
no objective...

430
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,194
My compassion?
My decency?

431
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:28,804
You don't really
believe that.

432
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:34,593
Samuel 1 31:4.

433
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,465
"When Saul saw himself losing
to the Philistines,

434
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,510
"he threw himself on his own
sword to avoid
being captured."

He's...

437
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:44,994
He is the one suffering.

438
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:45,908
He gets to decide.

439
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,868

442

This is your father.

443
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:00,183
This is suicide.

444
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,881
You know there's a difference
between actively taking a life

445
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,796
and passively
letting it go!

446
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,885
And you know that doesn't
let us simply give up.

The principle...

448
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,018
If you cared about
principle,

449
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,194

I remember,
my sophomore year of college,

514
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,376
my boyfriend dumped me,

515
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,725
said it was
the honorable thing to do

516
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,335
because he was sleeping
with my roommate.

517
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:03,165
Wrecked me.

518
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,385
Three weeks later, I thought,
"Wow, I am so over that jerk."

519
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:09,084
Three months after that,
I thought,

520
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:11,695
"Wow,
I can't believe I thought
I was okay after three weeks.

521
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,784
"But now I'm doing okay.

522

"I'm gonna be fine,
back up on my feet."

523
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,877

524
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,183

obviously different.

525
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,360

wiser.

526
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,623
So maybe you are ready.

527
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,451
But on the other hand...

528
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,804

and right now,

529
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:35,284

I'd be honored
to do you that favor.

532
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,476
I need those.

533
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,887
Well, that won't do.

534
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:15,063
Will that do?No. Not at all.

535
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,024
We are going to
throw you a wedding.

536
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:21,156
A proper wedding.

537
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,941
No. We decided
not to wait...

538
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,551
Now. Here.

539
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,179
Surprise.

540
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:16,690
You need a haircut.

541
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,406
I love you, son.

542
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,806
Goodbye, Dad.

543
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,284
I got you something.

544
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,764
I would assume so.

545
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:32,374
You are invited
to a wedding.

546
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,072
It would be rude
not to.

547
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,203
Yes.

548
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,167
These were passed down from
my great-great-grandparents.

549
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,169
This was supposed to be
for Maddie.

550
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:54,657
I'm glad you two will be
wearing them both.

551
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,318
Was your father
a good father?

552
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:06,365
He did his best.

553
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,497
Was he good?I don't know, Shaun.

554
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,846
I... I loved him, I guess.

555
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,892
Okay, but was he good?

556
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,633
Shaun, I'm clearly trying
to avoid this question.

557
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,591
My father's not around
to defend himself.

558
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,419
You know?I know.

559
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:20,074
Can we go fishing again
sometime?

560
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:21,684
I thought
you hated fishing.

561
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,345
I'm cold.

562
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,913
And wet.

563
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,697
And very bored.

564
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,223
It'll be a good memory.

565
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,323
My father is
a very good father.

566
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,327
Is?

567
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,723
I love you,
Dr. Glassman.

568
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,731
I love you, too,
Dr. Murphy.

569
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:17,740
Maybe we should go with
the clip-on.

570
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,700
Hmm.

571
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,528
Oh.

572
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:26,662

to be given the training

573
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,361
to save lives.

574
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:32,668
But I don't think
I've ever felt
luckier than I do right now.

575
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:34,540
Shaun Robert Murphy,
