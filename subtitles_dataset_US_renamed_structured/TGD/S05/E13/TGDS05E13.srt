1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:05,005
'80s night should
be banned.

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,740
You had a blast.

3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,609
I didn't say
it wasn't fun,

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,645
but that decade
was a crime against fashion.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,781
Tonight's club
is my pick, my vibe.

6
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,083
Ooh, which is?

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,218
Sophisticated ladies.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,952
I can work with that.

9
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,126
Shaun?
Hmm?

10
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,395
Sure you don't feel
left out?

11
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,530
I use the time to study
less invasive

12
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:30,631
bowel resection
techniques.

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,836
Please be home by 11:30.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,571
Hm.

15
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,473
He's got you on
a curfew?

16
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:42,210
Sex schedule.
Our window
ends at midnight.

17
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,219
It's like I slept
on gravel.

18
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,154
Well, that explains
your snoring.

19
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,356
Your mattress
should be burned.

20
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,365
It's time to end
the sleepovers

21
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,933
and for you to ditch
the bachelor pad.

22
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,237
You asking me
to move into your place?

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,105
I'm asking you to move
into a new place...

24
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,508
With me.

25
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,549
No neutral zone
to run to after a fight.

26
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,519
Making up's
the best part.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,088
Well, it can't hurt to look.

28
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,868
This is Trent,
his mother, Carrie.

29
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,103
Signs of severe infection
on his left index finger.

30
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,238
I'm ordering a CT.

31
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,073
Sutures are inconsistent
and crude.

32
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,208
It's a minor upgrade.

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,878
I installed a magnet
in my finger.

34
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,718
Were you having trouble
holding forks?

35
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,919
It's body art.

36
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,955
Yeah, he's 17,
immune to common sense.

37
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,825
Art seems like
a poor descriptor

38
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,794
given the ugliness
of the infection.

39
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,629
The more appropriate term
is "biohacking."

40
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,901
I put Neosporin on it and took
ibuprofen for the swelling.

41
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:14,802
That's worked before.

42
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,770
Before?

43
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,071
Show them.

44
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,586
Hmm.

45
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,503
You wanted to see me?

46
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,072
Dr. Glassman,
this is Kayla Quinn.

47
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:55,008
She's been diagnosed
with major depressive
disorder

48
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,344
as well as chronic
neuropathic pain

49
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,646
from a neck injury
six years ago.

50
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,014
The pain and depression
are besties,

51
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,150
uninvited guests
that travel together,

52
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,819
make it so I can't work,
can't get out of bed,

53
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,187
can't even think.

54
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,658
That's why I'd like to do this
before their next visit.

55
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,463
An anterior cingulotomy
seems like the...

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,399
Excuse me.

57
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,172
She is a smart,
charming, successful
woman whose life...

58
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,540
Nice ambush.

59
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,509
She's had over a decade
of therapy,

60
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,378
five classes
of anti-depressants,

61
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,545
and non-invasive
neuro-modulation,

62
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,582
including C.E.S.
and full-on E.C.T.

63
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,550
She's desperate
for real relief

64
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,751
from her pain
and depression,

65
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,653
and she's well aware
of the risks.

66
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,393
Get me a complete medical
and psychological history

67
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,194
and a couple of residents.

68
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,662
We're just gonna
talk about it.

69
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,569
Not sure who's
struggling more,

70
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,238
the overwhelmed,
super-critical mom

71
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,441
or the sad,
self-harming teen.

72
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,643
Trent called it
an upgrade.

73
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,480
He's not trying to self-harm,
he is trying to self-improve.

74
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,048
Well, whatever
the terminology,

75
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,584
he cut into his finger
with an X-ACTO knife.

76
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,253
Okay. His technique
was primitive,

77
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,889
but considering
he lacks formal training

78
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,792
and used only one hand,
I am impressed.

79
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:19,693
Don't be.

80
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,732
Bony marginal erosion.

81
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,400
If the infection spreads,
he could lose that finger.

82
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,770
For starters.

83
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,611
It's the modern equivalent
of a lobotomy.

84
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,313
"Modern" being
the operative word.

85
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,915
We'd be burning lesions
into a key brain center.

86
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,651
That could alter
her personality,

87
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,918
impair
cognitive function...

88
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,420
Her depression
and reoccurring
acute pain

89
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,621
are already doing that.

90
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,658
Cingulotomies are effective
in 67% of patients

91
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,892
with Kayla's symptoms.

92
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,961
With a 20% chance
of adverse effects,

93
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,364
like loss of creativity,
it could be a big deal.

94
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,431
This is Kayla Quinn.

95
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,470
She launched
her own company
at the age of 18,

96
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,805
made millions designing
scrunchies and bangles.

97
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,474
I discussed this
with her.

98
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,241
Her focus
is quality of life.

99
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,910
Now, I'm sure
she feels that way now,

100
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,445
but once it's done,
it can't be undone.

101
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,949
Are there any alternatives
that Kayla hasn't tried

102
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,418
or should try again?

103
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,590
Okay.

104
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,292
Let's do the surgery.

105
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,500
Wait, possible amputation?

106
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,101
The infection

107
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,136
is in the bone
beneath the magnet.

108
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,772
It would have been better to
have brought him in sooner.

109
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm a single mom.

110
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,646
Trent... Trent's father
isn't in the picture.

111
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,780
You made sure of that.

112
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,050
I got divorced last year.

113
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,886
Trent and I
were adjusting.

114
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,589
But then he started
hanging out with
these idiot biohackers.

115
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:56,857
Thanks, Mom.

116
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,161
We should remove
the infected implant

117
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,597
and start Trent
on IV antibiotics.

118
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,799
What about
the other implants?

119
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,000
Shouldn't you
take them all out?

120
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,803
No! The other implants
aren't infected.

121
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,805
Okay. This is not a decision
you get to make.

122
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,511
Once a patient is 16,
it is hospital policy

123
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,212
not to perform a surgery
that's been refused

124
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,115
unless that surgery is
medically necessary.

125
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,385
Leaving in
the other implants

126
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,522
means Trent's still
at risk for sepsis
and septic emboli.

127
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,426
Dr. Wolke is correct.

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,828
With your consent,
we can physically compel

129
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,998
the surgical removal of
all your son's modifications.

130
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,366
Good luck.
I'm outta here.

131
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,668
Trent.

132
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,837
Trent!

133
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,478
This is much easier
than chasing him.

134
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,848
Head frame is secure.

135
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,416
Stand by with
the Gamma knife.

136
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,525
Dr. Glassman,
please stop what you're doing.

137
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,663
This is Justin Quinn,
Kayla's conservator.

138
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:13,000
I have full authority
over my sister's
medical treatment,

139
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,635
and I won't allow
this surgery.

140
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,849
Kayla sees
her psychiatrist weekly,

141
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,450
and I check in
with her daily,

142
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,285
but clearly,
this is not

143
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,488
a weekend getaway
at a cabin in Tahoe.

144
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,190
A chance e-mail from
our insurance tipped me off.

145
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,227
She's never lied
to me like this.

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,162
I was 12
when my parents died.

147
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,931
My memories of them
don't seem real,

148
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,100
just clips
from a movie.

149
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,103
It was
our grief therapist who first
diagnosed her depression.

150
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,906
I was 22
and so out of my depth.

151
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,743
Justin and I
used to do
everything together.

152
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:56,910
It was us
against the world.

153
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,648
I called him Bro-dad.

154
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,316
She was
such a creative kid,
so talented.

155
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,520
She just had a vision
and wanted to run with it.

156
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,455
Who knew scrunchies
and glitter bangles
could be a business?

157
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,057
Just took off.

158
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,793
Eighteen years old,
all that money
and no guardrails.

159
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,496
She was out of control.

160
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,466
Clubs every night,
the booze, the drugs...

161
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:25,305
I couldn't help her.
I couldn't stop her.

162
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,941
It was during a blackout that
I fell and injured my neck.

163
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,945
Everything just got
worse after that.

164
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,616
The arrests piled up,
underage drinking,
possession, DUI.

165
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,485
I thought she was
going to prison.

166
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,320
The judge agreed to
a diversion program...

167
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,922
She's nearly O.D.'d twice.

168
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,156
...called me
a danger to myself.

169
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,892
The judge ruled
she was incompetent.

170
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,459
Put my brother in charge
of everything.

171
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,198
He took away my life.

172
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,035
The conservatorship
saved her life.

173
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,177
All I needed
to piss off my parents

174
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,780
were fishnets
and heavy eyeliner.

175
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,916
Of course
you were a goth.

176
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,684
How many times
did you see The Cure?

177
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,552
Four.

178
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,988
Robert Smith was, like,
leader of our tribe.

179
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,258
Every lonely teen
needs a tribe.

180
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,330
I was lonely,
but I was not a rebel.

181
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,166
My rebellion
was just being honest.

182
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,636
My family
preferred the lie.

183
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,171
Meanwhile Trent is
damaging his relationship

184
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,373
with his mom
and his body.

185
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,309
That is not his fault.

186
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,577
She is his mother.

187
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,279
Mothers should
try to understand
their children.

188
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,016
Nice thought,
but teenagers are asses.

189
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,519
Scientifically proven.

190
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,122
Their prefrontal cortex
is underdeveloped,

191
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,658
leading to
excessive risk-taking

192
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,159
and lack of impulse control.

193
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,394
Margins in
the soft tissue look good,

194
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,296
but keep an eye out
for the infection.

195
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,464
Let's close.

196
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,682
Mr. Quinn.

197
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,086
Your sister's suffering.

198
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,588
It's a roller coaster
with her,

199
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,757
good days and bad days.

200
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,660
But your solution is to
fry part of her brain.

201
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,429
She could
lose her creativity,
her personality.

202
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,965
Her pain,
her depression.

203
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,466
Maybe.
Those other doctors
ran me through

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,102
the risks
and the numbers.

205
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:39,306
What if I could show you
how Kayla's issues are
hard-wired in her brain?

206
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,075
An fMRI could demonstrate
how the part of Kayla's brain

207
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,812
that handles emotional
and pain response

208
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,479
is functionally
abnormal.

209
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,282
It'll assure you that
"frying her brain"

210
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,252
means only frying
the part of her brain
that isn't working.

211
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,356
And it'll get you both
off of the roller coaster.

212
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,393
The scan's harmless.

213
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:09,970
Okay, do it.

214
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,849
I've got it. Oh, see?
I can spin it around.

215
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,350
I need to do
a post-op exam.

216
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,555
Oh. You have modifications.

217
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,290
I'm Dixie.

218
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,760
My right hand got messed up
in a car accident.

219
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,529
I had RFID chips put in so
I could unlock my front door,

220
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,432
store my medical info,
and do some
pretty cool tricks.

221
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:44,571
Are you attracted
to Dixie?

222
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,008
Are you concerned you'll
be less attractive to her
without your implants?

223
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,143
We're just friends.

224
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,645
I host a monthly
biohacker meet up,

225
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,147
and Trent's
become a regular.

226
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,349
The only people
who get me.

227
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,719
You found your tribe.

228
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,392
Incision sites look good.
Right wrist please.

229
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,897
It was not
until I came to work
here at St. Bonaventure

230
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,499
that I felt like
I was part of a community.

231
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,534
I've read about implants
that can operate prosthetics

232
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,903
and an
occipital lobe electrode

233
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,671
that receives visual images
for sightless people.

234
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,908
Oh, these technologies
are very exciting.

235
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,275
It's so cool, right?

236
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,111
I was thinking I should
be an engineer

237
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,879
and I can design tech
for people like Dixie.

238
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,480
Oh.

239
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,050
How's he recovering,
Dr. Murphy?

240
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,885
Hmm, oh, hello.

241
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,720
The surgeries went well.

242
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,857
Finger looks free of infection
and bacterial cultures
remain negative.

243
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,961
We still need to do an MRI
to assess his joints,
but I'm optimistic.

244
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,763
Great. Then once I'm 18,
I can get all my mods back in

245
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,098
by the pros who did Dixie's.

246
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,468
Meaning the tattoo artist
at the strip mall.

247
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,941
Tattoo parlors require
a public health permit.

248
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,877
Yes, that would be
much safer than
doing it himself.

249
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,217
Rain check for tonight.

250
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,886
Surgery?

251
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,724
A new patient reminded me
I need to spend more time
on my business ideas,

252
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,593
less time on the dance floor.

253
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,528
I see a sparkle in your eyes.
What is the product?

254
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,070
My ingestible sensor
that monitors gut bacteria

255
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,737
as it travels through
the GI tract.

256
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:27,340
Gross yet cool.

257
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,641
How are you gonna
collect the data?

258
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,610
Ideally,
real-time monitoring.

259
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,980
I'm looking at wireless
open-source programs.

260
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,747
You could
connect the sensor

261
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,216
with a smartphone
via Bluetooth.

262
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:40,353
That would be amazing.

263
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,655
But that code would be pretty
complicated to write.

264
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,259
Not for...me.

265
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,198
You'd have time for that
on top of your IT work?

266
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,934
Says the second-year
resident looking to disrupt
the med-tech business.

267
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,103
Ah.

268
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,805
I wouldn't be able to pay you,
at least not up front.

269
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,974
We could divvy up
the spoils.

270
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,249
75%, 25% final offer.

271
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,850
Hell yes, partner.

272
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,619
Welcome aboard.

273
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,789
Put this
on your calendar...

274
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,059
May 2025,
yacht shopping.

275
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,627
Okay.
Yes!

276
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,198
Dr. Murphy?

277
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,169
Please stop
encouraging Trent.

278
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,605
Your interest
in his body modifications

279
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,307
comes across
as an endorsement.

280
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,376
Oh, I am interested.

281
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,345
Why would I pretend
that I'm not?

282
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,148
Not so long ago,
we were talking about
amputating fingers.

283
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,750
Someone has to talk
some sense into my son
before he does this again.

284
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,822
I'm happy to have
a chat with him.

285
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,560
He seems to connect
with Dr. Murphy.

286
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,396
If you talk to him,
he might listen.

287
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,101
I...would not be
very good at that.

288
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,545
Kayla,
next I'm gonna ask you
a series of prompts

289
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,547
to help us map
your brain activity.

290
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,548
I'll do my best.

291
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,085
Think of a nice memory.

292
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,686
Something from
a happy time.

293
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,591
You didn't like any
of the apartments
I sent you?

294
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,195
As predicted,
altered limbic activity

295
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,796
in the connections
to the cingulate cortex.

296
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,432
The apartments
are okay.

297
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,334
I'm shocked you're
so easy to please.

298
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,769
You're such a quibbler.

299
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,539
"Hate art deco."
"Low ceilings equal doom."

300
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,075
"Berber carpets
hurt my feet."

301
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,544
Well...

302
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,713
Kayla, now I need you to think
of an unpleasant memory.

303
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,384
Take it as a compliment
that I'm so picky.

304
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,254
Picky's fine,
passive not so much.

305
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,388
Send me some links.

306
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,959
More abnormal connectivity.

307
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,764
We're getting
motion artifacts.

308
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,433
She's moving around.

309
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,800
Kayla, can you try
and hold still?

310
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,306
I'm sorry.
Can we please stop?

311
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,607
Kayla? Where does it hurt?
Mm-hmm?

312
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,609
Everywhere.

313
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,912
It's back.

314
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,261
You never came to bed.

315
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,595
We were supposed to have sex.

316
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,829
Sorry.

317
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,132
Our sensor keeps
running out of power

318
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,468
halfway through
the digestive tract.

319
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,038
It's not on the schedule,
but we could have sex now.

320
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,606
I have to shower.

321
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,674
I shower first.

322
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,647
Okay. I will be flexible
and make you coffee.

323
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,183
Thank you.

324
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,335
Good morning.

325
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,747
How's Kayla?

326
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,584
In pain and on the edge of
a full depressive episode.

327
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,654
I upped her gabapentin
and started a low-dose
ketamine IV.

328
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,389
Smart.

329
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,724
Hmm.

330
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,060
You know we'll have to
get her off the ketamine

331
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,263
before we take another shot
at finishing the fMRI.

332
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,203
Do you not want to
move in with me?

333
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,872
I've been busy.
I have other patients.

334
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,242
Allow me to present
multitasking.

335
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,777
Look at that.
Three-bedroom,
two-bath,

336
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,712
courtyard building
with a pool.

337
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,048
We'd have a guest room for
Kellan, a shared office,

338
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,084
and it's 10 minutes
from the hospital.

339
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,887
Well, looks like
the master bedroom window's
overlooking the courtyard.

340
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,189
I know. Nice.

341
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,657
Not nice. Loud.

342
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,464
Then show me one
you do like.

343
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, hell no.

344
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,202
I'm gonna
update the brother.

345
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,737
You paged me?

346
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,173
Good morning, Shaun.

347
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,540
Lea and I missed
our sex night.

348
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,808
It is not a good morning.

349
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,543
Agreed.

350
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,381
Mine started with
a distraught mother

351
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,884
whose son
you refused to advise
against biohacking?

352
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,887
What he chooses to do
when he is 18 is up to him.

353
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,455
True, but you
could advise him

354
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,924
against the dangers
of further mods.

355
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,494
Trent enjoys
the connections
he has made

356
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,462
in the biohacking
community.

357
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,898
You really think
the emotional benefits
of belonging

358
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,633
outweigh
the physical dangers
for this kid?

359
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,936
Teens do many
dangerous things.

360
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,605
If he injured himself
skateboarding,

361
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,940
should I advise him never
to skateboard again,

362
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,775
which could alienate him from
his skateboarder friends?

363
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,578
Is there a potential
for medical harm?

364
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,480
Yes.

365
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,748
Then remind
your patient of that.

366
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,084
You have no trouble
being honest.

367
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,658
I'll do it, only
because you're my boss.

368
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,660
Case in point.

369
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,205
Justin's refusing to let me
finish Kayla's fMRI.

370
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,773
He thinks her being
in the hospital

371
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,941
is what triggered
this latest episode.

372
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,610
He...
He's totally dug in.

373
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,779
It's a judgment call.
Legally, it's his judgment.

374
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,981
I need you to talk to him,
get him to change his mind.

375
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,183
Because?
You're the surgeon.

376
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,452
If medicine could
persuade him,

377
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,953
we'd be in
surgery right now.

378
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,221
So I should just
give up?

379
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,489
I don't know.
Do you want to?

380
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,957
No!
Okay, then don't.

381
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,991
Go find another tactic.

382
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,193
Okay.

383
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,632
No, no, no.
I do the surgery,
you do the selling.

384
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,637
Okay, fine.

385
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,241
Look at it this way.

386
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,979
The brother has been
cleaning up after his sister
for years, right?

387
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,983
So instead of trying
to change his feelings
about the surgery,

388
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,652
maybe change his feelings
about his sister.

389
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,394
Future modifications
could result in sepsis,

390
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,630
severe arthritis,
pseudo-tumor formation,
nerve damage and paralysis.

391
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,232
Suddenly you're a guy
in a drug commercial...

392
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,736
"Side effects include
insomnia, rash,
dry cough, and death."

393
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,006
Sounds like
my mom got to you.

394
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,574
She tried.

395
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,343
It didn't work,
but then she went
to my boss.

396
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,677
That did work.

397
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,283
I think that it is nice
your mother cares about you.

398
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,685
Mine did not.

399
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,856
Mine used to.

400
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,528
My dad used to
travel a lot for work.

401
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:05,732
He was always off
pitching to investors,
conferences in Vegas.

402
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,200
And me and my mom
would hang out
all the time.

403
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,703
Every weekend,
she would take me
to the Boardwalk.

404
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,905
Never said no,
no matter how many times

405
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,674
I wanted to
ride the Cyclone.

406
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,543
The Cyclone
made me nauseous.

407
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,112
Now she's just
working all the time.

408
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,714
And whenever
we're together,
she's angry.

409
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,717
Never stops nagging me.

410
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:30,357
She doesn't
like you biohacking.

411
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,258
I don't think she'd like
anything I do.

412
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,098
Ohh, aah.

413
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,633
Is it your finger?

414
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,134
No, it's my wrist.

415
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,640
Kayla's biggest trigger
isn't being in the hospital,

416
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,642
it's your control
over her life.

417
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,311
I reviewed her
history in detail,

418
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,313
and over
the last five years,

419
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,115
Kayla's major depressive
episodes coincide

420
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,317
with major
life decisions

421
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,753
that you've made
on her behalf...

422
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,955
Changing meds
and moving homes,

423
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,624
making decisions
for the business.

424
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,693
You're saying
this is all my fault.

425
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,697
She's saying that being
in charge of my own life
would be better for me.

426
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,799
Until you get drunk or O.D.

427
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,736
That was years ago.
I'm not that person
anymore.

428
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,104
Because I've been
protecting you.

429
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,572
Because
the conservatorship works.

430
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,776
That argument means
I'll be in this forever.

431
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,613
If I'm doing well,
it proves you right.

432
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,148
If I'm a mess,
proves you right.

433
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,685
I'm tired of this, Justin.

434
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,688
I'm tired
of living the life
that you want me to.

435
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,858
You pick out my doctors,
you search my cabinets,

436
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,560
you test my urine
for drugs.

437
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,161
We can talk about relaxing
some of those things.

438
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,563
No! No.

439
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,498
I'm done negotiating
over my own life,

440
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,834
of having what
you think is best
rammed down my throat.

441
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:48,968
Kayla...
Think acting
like this is gonna

442
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,503
change my mind
about the surgery?

443
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,538
It shouldn't have to.
It's my life!

444
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,172
It's my messed-up brain!

445
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,175
This place is bad for you.
I need her discharge papers.

446
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,177
Stop telling her what to do!
Stop telling everyone
what to do!

447
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,812
Kayla, please...
Shut up!

448
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,014
I need 10 milligrams
of Haloperidol.

449
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,683
Stop it. Shut up.

450
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,668
The LED light
you've installed
in your right wrist

451
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,336
has irreversibly
damaged the joint.

452
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,673
You will never
regain full function
in your hand.

453
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,009
You'll need
physical therapy

454
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,580
until you can compensate with
your non-dominant hand.

455
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,415
Damn it, Trent.
How many times
did I tell you?

456
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,817
Thousands, okay?

457
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,919
But I'm such an idiot,
and I never listened.

458
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,387
I never said
you were an idiot.

459
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,755
I said to stop
hurting yourself.

460
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,224
Maybe some
family counseling
could help?

461
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,226
No, she's the only one
who needs counseling.

462
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,661
She's the one
who failed as a parent.

463
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,196
Your choices
are not my fault.

464
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,164
But I'm stuck
with yours.

465
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,666
Like how you
tossed Dad out.

466
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,367
He walked out on us.

467
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,077
I didn't want you
to hate him.

468
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,749
I hadn't realized that
the alternative was hating me.

469
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,891
Your father
was a schemer.

470
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,930
He kept flitting from one
big idea to the next,

471
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,999
chasing fantasies instead of
taking care of responsibility.

472
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,901
That's a lie.
You're a liar.

473
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,939
He was a self-absorbed
narcissist

474
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,641
who cared more
about himself than us.

475
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,043
That's not true!
Trent...

476
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,911
Leave me alone!
Get out!

477
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,248
Get out!

478
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,100
Lidocaine to numb you.

479
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,369
I figured you'd want me
to feel every stitch.

480
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,741
I'm used to being
the bad guy.

481
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,342
Bad guys don't
give up their lives

482
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,511
to care for
their little sisters.

483
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,946
Thanks for seeing that.

484
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,217
You feel that?

485
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,759
People idealize
what it's like
being a kid,

486
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,961
but, really,
childhood blows.

487
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,564
Being told what to do,

488
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,634
where to go,
how to behave.

489
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,171
Spoken like someone
who had a terrible childhood.

490
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:43,342
It wasn't my wheelhouse,
or my parents'.

491
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,916
Kayla's first try
at growing up,
she flamed out.

492
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,751
Doesn't she deserve
a second shot?

493
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,455
Maybe.

494
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,992
Leave it to Kayla to choose
elective brain surgery
for a maiden voyage.

495
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,763
Scares the crap
out of me.

496
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,333
Tell her that.

497
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,944
Jerome's
birthday is coming up.

498
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,511
I need to find him
a great gift.

499
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,013
Please don't distract me.

500
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,816
I am looking for a surgical
solution for Trent's wrist.

501
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,818
That's valiant,
but he's about
to be discharged.

502
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,755
I need a gift that says
"I'm really into you,"

503
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,290
but, mm,
without overdoing it.

504
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,726
We could attempt
a partial wrist fusion.

505
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,962
Not for another year.
Trent's still growing.

506
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,832
Jordan mentioned
you have some super cute
race car pajamas.

507
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,868
I could get
Jerome a pair.

508
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,871
They are classic cars,
and I'd prefer not to discuss
my sleepwear at work.

509
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,974
We could give Trent
a course of Methotrexate
to combat...

510
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,809
He'll adjust
to the bad wrist.

511
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,978
The bigger problem
is that mother and son

512
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,813
act like they
hate each other.

513
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,048
I have no idea how
to fix that.

514
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:59,618
He's managing
his feelings by turning
himself into a cyborg.

515
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,321
Trent is not
becoming a cyborg...

516
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,105
But maybe he could!

517
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,917
I can fix Trent's wrist.

518
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,353
This experimental surgery
uses a customized implant
to replace his wrist joint.

519
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,654
He will have
full use of his wrist.

520
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,090
Also, he will
be very happy,

521
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,759
because he'll have
a one-of-a-kind
body modification.

522
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,728
E-Experimental?

523
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,429
Would it be covered by
our insurance?

524
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,998
Mm, n-no.

525
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:48,000
I-It is quite expensive.

526
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,971
Which means I'm getting
a second mortgage
to pay for it.

527
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,674
If Trent keeps getting
other modifications,

528
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,676
could that cause problems
with this device?

529
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,516
Yes, his body could
reject the implant.

530
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,852
Okay, but...
Thank you...

531
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,221
Trent should
be able to follow
the post-op regimen,

532
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,057
including
no further modifications.

533
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,760
Or he'll keep seeing it
as a cool hobby

534
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,428
which allows him
to stick it to his terrible
and controlling mother.

535
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,135
I can fix
your son's wrist...

536
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,607
...with your consent.

537
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,517
No.

538
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,568
Looks like our sensor's
gonna poop out
before it gets pooped out.

539
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,138
Maybe if we take another look
at the component specs.

540
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,707
I have drawn up
a list of house rules
that apply to Dr. Allen

541
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,575
when she is working
at our apartment.

542
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,978
One, no work
on scheduled sex nights.

543
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,246
I can get down
with that.

544
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,048
Two, no brushing teeth
in the kitchen sink.

545
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,582
Agreed.

546
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,184
Three, do not wear perfume.

547
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:13,920
Four, do not speak
in a loud voice.

548
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:14,921
Five, please avoid
eye contact.

549
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,722
Shaun...
I'm not finished.

550
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,025
Avoid eye contact?
Mm...

551
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,193
Yes.

552
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,734
Shaun, do you not like
having me at your apartment?

553
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:33,005
I don't like having
anyone other than Lea
at the apartment.

554
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,741
With Lea, I feel safe.

555
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,778
I am not obligated to
follow the guidelines
around social interactions.

556
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,981
By the time
I'm done with work,

557
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,283
I have had enough
of following guidelines.

558
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,118
Shaunie, I never knew.

559
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,722
We can work
someplace else.

560
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,624
The apartment
is half Lea's.

561
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,394
I am very happy
she has found
a friend and partner.

562
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,597
Dr. Allen...

563
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,072
...you are part
of my tribe.

564
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,241
You are welcome
in our home.

565
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,013
As long as you
follow the rules,
including,

566
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,149
six, I am allowed
to ignore you
when you are there.

567
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,504
Does it ever feel to you like
we go round and round,

568
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,974
but we always find our way
back to this same, sad place?

569
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,945
I remember when we
first got here.

570
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,614
You were 12

571
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,783
on a school field trip
to the Municipal Garden.

572
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,988
And I got there
and watched you
sketch roses.

573
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:57,289
So confident,

574
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,525
at peace,

575
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,728
innocent.

576
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,968
Then I had to tell you
Mom and Dad were dead.

577
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:14,306
I swore that I'd do
everything I could

578
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,308
to keep you from being hurt
like that again.

579
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:20,779
I know you're just
trying to protect me.

580
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,219
I'm protecting me, too.

581
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,328
I've been so scared
that I could lose you.

582
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,542
During the fMRI,
Dr. Reznick asked me
to think of a happy memory.

583
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,680
Silvertop, Nevada.

584
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,215
Yeah.

585
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:59,551
You and me on that river
in the canoe.

586
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,919
That cabin
was such a dump.

587
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,089
It was.

588
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:04,690
And we were only there
'cause I screwed up

589
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,425
and forgot to sign you up
for that camp.

590
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,726
Camp Capistrano.

591
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,361
Yeah.

592
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,498
That was the first summer
after Mom and Dad died.

593
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:13,865
You had an excuse.

594
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:16,935
That was a good trip.

595
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,405
Best vacation
I ever had.

596
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,077
I want that again.

597
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,046
We can always go back.

598
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,248
Not the trip.

599
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,650
The freedom,

600
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,221
that happiness

601
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,090
without the next bout
of pain and depression
landing over me.

602
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,430
This is my chance.

603
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,434
Please let me take it.

604
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,313
Okay.

605
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,797
I'm dying to take
this next step with you.

606
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,200
Says the guy who's
sandbagging the search.

607
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,601
It's the money.

608
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,442
Between
Kellan's college tuition
and my med school debt,

609
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,810
there's not much left
at the end of the month.

610
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:34,980
And on top of that

611
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,448
my credit's a mess.

612
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,352
This is just
about money?

613
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,454
Just?

614
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,191
If you can't afford it,
I got you.

615
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,460
I pay my own way.
Always have, always will.

616
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:51,163
Your financial issues
are no reason to put
our plans on hold.

617
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:54,633
An easy thing to say
when you've never had
to worry about money,

618
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,468
but some of us have had to
live in the real world.

619
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,640
And if you had
the money and I didn't,

620
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,675
you wouldn't want to
improve both our situations?

621
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,013
This isn't about
the real world.

622
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,115
It's about your pride.

623
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,496
I have your prescriptions
and therapy referrals.

624
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,199
I can do it.

625
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,501
Then do it.

626
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,076
I'm guessing this
is my fault, as well.

627
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,180
Okay.

628
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,849
The way you behave
is very confusing
and frustrating.

629
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,651
It doesn't make sense at all.

630
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,486
You criticize
every choice Trent makes

631
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,388
and never ask
why he's making them.

632
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,856
See?

633
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,424
You deliberately
made choices you knew

634
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,725
your mother
wouldn't approve of,

635
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,027
and then were very angry
when she didn't approve.

636
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,230
Even he thinks you took
your biohacking too far.

637
00:34:58,364 --> 00:34:59,898
She's been mad at me
since Dad left.

638
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,433
Oh, that's not true.
Yes, it is.

639
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,101
You don't like me.

640
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,737
You don't
like my friends.

641
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,038
I don't understand
your friends.

642
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,540
You never tried to.

643
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,909
You're just mad at me
because...

644
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,045
You're stuck with me.

645
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:25,257
I have been mad,
but not at you,

646
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:26,725
at your father
for leaving.

647
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,764
Afraid I couldn't take care
of you or support us.

648
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,068
You were so hurt
when your father left.

649
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:40,038
All I wanted to do
was make you feel better,
but I just...

650
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,042
I was too damaged

651
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,947
and jealous of
your new friends,

652
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,749
when I should've
been grateful.

653
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,586
But I was afraid of
losing you to them.

654
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,589
After all,
you like them.

655
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,493
You're my mom.

656
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,030
I'm not supposed to
like you.

657
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:11,770
Come here.

658
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:24,115
Can I do the surgery now?

659
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,789
You are gonna
like this.

660
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,628
Time to prep you
for surgery.

661
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,700
Before I go, um...

662
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,513
I got a little inspired.

663
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,919
I'll hang on to them
for you.

664
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,226
Ready?

665
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,228
Yeah.

666
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,583
Carpal resection
looks good.

667
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,352
What did you say
to change Carrie's mind?

668
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,122
I'm not sure.

669
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,691
I tried to understand them.

670
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,429
Maybe you could do
me and my father next.

671
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,698
Carpal and radial bones
prepped for the upgrade.

672
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:53,104
I'd say you
get the honors.

673
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:56,375
Resolving conflict
is a crucial skill
for an attending.

674
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,976
Nicely done.

675
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,720
Placing carpal ball onto
the distal component.

676
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,562
For the next few days,
expect some headaches
and fatigue,

677
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,764
but the post-op symptoms
should quickly pass.

678
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,734
Kayla, how do you feel?

679
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,772
Strange.

680
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,175
Something's missing.

681
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,250
The pain.

682
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:44,756
And I think I'm still me.

683
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,228
Bro-dad.

684
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,601
** You were listening to
The Dark Side of the Moon

685
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,669
** I could barely
see your eyes...

686
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,705
We have to
go see a judge.

687
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,542
** Psilocybin
in a hotel room...

688
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,777
It's time I was just
your brother.

689
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:14,753
** I'll be your brightside
Baby, tonight

690
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,188
** Tonight...

691
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:21,860
The arthroplasty
fixed Trent's wrist
like I said it would.

692
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,929
You will need
significant therapy,

693
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,997
but your prognosis
is good.

694
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,866
And you better
take this seriously.

695
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,869
Take your meds,
do your rehab.

696
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,806
Invite that friend of yours,
Dixie, over for dinner.

697
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,508
Really?

698
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,477
Well, she seems
interesting.

699
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:45,350
These are the schematics
of your wrist implant.

700
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:48,219
The engineering specifications
are quite interesting.

701
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,958
Thanks, Dr. Murphy.

702
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,894
** You're stranded
on the bridge

703
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,030
** You're crying for your kids

704
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:04,603
** I'll be your brightside
Baby, tonight

705
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,337
** Tonight

706
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,373
** Tonight...

707
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,108
I'm glad my key
still works.

708
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,412
It was about my pride.

709
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,749
And I used that
as an obstacle,

710
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:19,150
instead of
being honest with you.

711
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,188
I'm sorry.

712
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:32,030
It's a big step,
but let's keep talking.

713
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,234
I'm sure I'll get
over myself, in time.

714
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,103
Can you do it
in a month?

715
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,742
Because I found a house
that I love.

716
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,045
Gorgeous.

717
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,379
Mm.

718
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,516
And at that price,
it should be.

719
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,851
I would be very grateful
for a studly roommate

720
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,385
who could cover
the utility bills.

721
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,587
What about rent?

722
00:40:57,022 --> 00:41:00,692
I was thinking services
rendered, like...

723
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,464
Shirtless lawn mowing,
shirtless pool cleaning,

724
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,900
shirtless meal prep.

725
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,103
Well, certain studly men
would argue

726
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,472
if we don't start on
equal footing,

727
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:15,907
it'll never be
our house.

728
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,412
It'll be our home,
because we'll make it that.

729
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,455
A pool?
What about a hot tub?

730
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,328
Our power issue
is a software issue.

731
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:40,799
Because your data domain
requirements mandate

732
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,468
a specific chip that
requires way more power
than we can actually...

733
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,179
** I could see it in the air

734
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:59,751
** Every word was like smoke
from a cigarette...

735
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:04,022
What if the sensor
had bad manners?

736
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,857
Shuts down when
it needs to rest,

737
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,292
ignores what
doesn't matter.

738
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,561
It works, it rests,
it works, it rests.

739
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,362
We could extrapolate
between the data points.

740
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:12,964
That could double
the sensor's life.

741
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,234
You're pure
inspiration, Shaun.

742
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,469
I am ignoring you.

743
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,338
** I'll be your brightside
Baby...

744
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:25,110
** Tonight, tonight

745
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,478
** Tonight **
