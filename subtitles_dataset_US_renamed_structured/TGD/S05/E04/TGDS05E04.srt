Sorry, why am I here?

178

Uh...

179
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,934
There's something wrong
with my lungs.

180
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:24,938
Are you dying?

181
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:26,940
Probably.

182
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,145
You waited
until you were dying
to call me?

183
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,082
And, what?
Forgive you?
No.

184
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,951
Do you even feel bad
about what you did?

185
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,688
For hurting you?

186
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,756
Yes, of course.

187
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,699
I wanted to keep in touch
with you.

188
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,066
You said it was too painful.

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,534

No.

says there's
a potential match.

191

Why are you here?

192
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,690
Walt spent four years
researching Holly's illness,

193
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,726
outsmarted every doctor.

194
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,328
No high school degree,
but slept five hours a night

195
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,764
while taking every pre-med
course at a junior college.

196
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,666
My dad's the best doctor
I've seen.

197
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,003
What made you think it was
visceral myopathy, Walt?

198
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,172
Well, I figured it out
last week.

199
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,808
Holly started having
trouble peeing, and...

200
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,410
That's just one data point.
It's not enough.

201
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,513
And her mom died a couple
of days after childbirth.

202
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,150
Complications from
her bowel perforating.

203
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,186
And visceral myopathy is
genetically based.

204
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,058
Treat Walt like
a consulting physician.

205
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,426
Involve this man in all
medical discussions.

206
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,962
Let him watch surgeries.

207
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,429
Hell, give him
a fitness tracker.

208
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:01,802
Excuse us.

209
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,738
Okay.

210
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh, he is not
a doctor.

211
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,744
20 doctors dismissed me
and my very valid questions

212
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,545
before I was diagnosed
with scleroderma.

213
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,048
Good ideas are good ideas,
no matter the source.

214
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,085
We should involve him after
we talk among ourselves

215
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,753
like we do with all
patients' families.

216
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,388
I don't see any advantage

217
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,857
other than further enshrining
doctors' elitism.

218
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,292
I don't want
to have to
pull my punches

219
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,394
when discussing
that girl's
possible outcomes.

220
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,029
He's been through hell
with her.

221
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,231
We can be honest
with him.

222
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,901
And via our Twitter feed,
we can share
an inspiring story

223
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,469
of how a father's expertise
supplemented our doctors'...

224
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,271
He's not an expert!

225
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,975
Just because
we haven't found
his blind spots

226
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,476
doesn't mean we won't.

you will.

229

230
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:58,291
I do not like this at all.

It's a direct order from our
boss, so I plan to love it.

be condemned
to the walk of atonement

We go in using the interop
biopsies as a map,

we'd resect the most
damaged areas.

and my thoughts
are useful.

270
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,037
We could put her on
Rituximab.

271

I've only heard it used
for cancers

272

disorders.

273

But it's been shown
to increase motility
in kids by 30%.

274
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,545
It's an interesting idea.

275
00:12:58,678 --> 00:12:59,947
It's a bad idea.

276
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,549
She could have a severe
infusion reaction,

00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:03,817
cause more damage,

278
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,919
leading to a much more
drastic surgery later.

279
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,021
Or it will alleviate
her symptoms
