1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,443
Home run!

2
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,528
Open wide,
Glass-wipe!

3
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,829
This one's comin' at ya!

4
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,698
Hey, Jerry!

5
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,201
You haven't
driven anyone home
since junior prom!

6
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,702
Ha-ha!

7
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,438
Whoo! You tell him, Glassy!

8
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,814
Whoo! Whoo!

9
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,459
Lea,
what are you doing here?

10
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,627
Is Shaun all right?

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,929
He's fine.
Basically.

12
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,264
"Basically"?

13
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,333
Well, he's been
trying to reach you.

14
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,700
You missed
your tux fitting.

15
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,369
Are you here
to take my measurements?

16
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,239
Shaun is really
struggling right now.
He's been calling you.

17
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,073
Struggling? Really?

18
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,075
You came all the way
out here to Montana

19
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,877
because he's struggling?

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,380
Wasn't he struggling over the...
the billboard thing, right?

21
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,449
Turns out, he didn't
need me at all, did he?

22
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,051
So you figure he's
never going to need you?

23
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,220
What are you gonna do?
Run away? Stay here?

24
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:27,621
I'm not running away.

25
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,690
I'm hitting .394,
batting cleanup
for the Devil Dogs.

26
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,824
Why?

27
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,025
Yo, Doc!

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,394
We're just headed
to the Stick & Steak.

29
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,728
You and your friend
coming with?

30
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,366
My friend was just leaving,
but I'll be right there.

31
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,601
Shaun's fine.
You're fine.
I am fine.

32
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,170
I'll call him tonight.
Go home.

33
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,275
Lea is on
a business trip.

34
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,543
She's gone until Sunday,

35
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:50,544
which means I can
spend the weekend

36
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,180
reviewing the latest
case reports.

37
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,548
I can't allow that.

38
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,049
Morgan's on call
this weekend.

39
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,085
You and I are going out...
pizza and a movie.

40
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,588
Two de facto bachelors
looking for trouble.

41
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,723
I don't like loud movies.
Or trouble.

42
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,392
We'll pick a quiet one.

43
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,559
Or olives, mushrooms,
or anchovies.

44
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,329
But other than that,

45
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,331
that sounds like
a lot of fun.

46
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,201
Unstable level one trauma.

47
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,035
25-year-old male,
fell 30 feet

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,904
from scaffolding.
...open.

49
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,072
Massive head trauma,
multiple fractures.

50
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,108
BP is 50 over palp.

51
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,477
You go.
Bilateral tib-fib injuries.

52
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,146
Femur fracture
of the right thigh.

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,148
Belly is distended,
tense, and bruised.

54
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,483
He has internal bleeding.

55
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,485
He's lost 40%
of his blood volume.

56
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,221
Apply pressure
to the open wound.

57
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,488
He's O-neg.
We need six units

58
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,890
and a rapid infuser, stat.

59
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,792
There's too much blood
in his abdomen to see.

60
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,295
We need a portable CT
before...

61
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,197
He's in respiratory failure.

62
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,598
Crash intubation tray!

63
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,246
Hi.

64
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,183
Playing helps with
attention, working memory,

65
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,418
and processing speed.

66
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,619
Mm.

67
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,656
I can make the clinic
profitable.

68
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,327
A woman in
my barre-cardio class

69
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,763
is the health insurance
manager for a media company.

70
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,198
They're looking for another
health provider.

71
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:22,202
Could mean
3,000 insured clients
if we win the contract.

72
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,637
Give me her name
and I'll get it done.

73
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,873
I'd like to close the deal.

74
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,677
And then, I would like
full control of the clinic
and its budget.

75
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,648
Holding onto
your leverage.
Smart.

76
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,353
Let's see
what you can do.

77
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,837
Severe brain contusions.
Multiple rib fractures.

78
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,672
Blood in the right
pleural space.

79
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,941
He has a massive
hemoperitoneum.

80
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,211
Grade five liver lac.
Spleen is pulverized.

81
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,479
Lumbar spine fractured.

82
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,281
Right kidney's
unsalvageable.

83
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,383
Pressure's falling,
and he's maxed out
on vasopressors.

84
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,718
Try T.X.A.

85
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,258
Is he an organ donor?

86
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,894
I don't know,
but it's not relevant,

87
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,896
because I am not
going to let him die.

88
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,515
Attention on the concourse,

89
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,783
this is your final
boarding call.

90
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,055
Dr. Park?
Park: Hi, Val.

91
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,458
Hi.

92
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,726
We've got a patient in the ER
who's severely injured,

93
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,728
and he's O-negative.

94
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,632
And the heart?

95
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,800
Seems to be healthy.

96
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,903
The patient is an adult,
but not a big guy.

97
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,204
Oh.

98
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,607
Do you think
it'll fit Ollie?

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,742
I think so.

100
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,910
But I need you
to bring him in

101
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,545
for another CT to be sure.

102
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,686
W-we're just about to leave
for Ollie's Make-A-Wish trip.

103
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,120
We've got
a cardiology team

104
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,256
and a very accommodating
paleontologist.

105
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,061
And other hearts
have fallen through.

106
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,764
This trip won't
happen again.

107
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,767
Not with the amount
of time he has left.

108
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,275
Should we get on
this plane, or not?

109
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,780
Bring him in.

110
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,584
Okay.

111
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,490
We managed to slow
your son's bleeding,

112
00:05:56,624 --> 00:06:00,160
but Brandon has a lot
of internal injuries,

113
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,997
so we won't know
the full extent
until we look inside.

114
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:04,965
Do you have any questions?

115
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,366
No.

116
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,868
You've been very clear.

117
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,739
We're ready to move him
to the operating room,

118
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,306
so I'll find you
when I know more.

119
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,978
Can I talk to my son?

120
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,380
Before the surgery.

121
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,215
I'm sorry, uh,

122
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,485
he's been unconscious
since his fall.

123
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,858
I-I promise, I will
take you to see him

124
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,225
as soon as he's
out of surgery.

125
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,173
After vision
and hearing exams,

126
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,375
I'll do a full
occupational health screen.

127
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,043
And I would do that for
every one of your employees.

128
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,011
Hmm.

129
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:57,851
Rest your chin
here, please.

130
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,723
Cucumber water
is a nice touch, too.

131
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,425
Never had
this test before.

132
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,094
You don't wear glasses.

133
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,996
Most places wouldn't
bother with this test.

134
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,031
Hmm.
Do you see a dot anywhere?

135
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,000
Yep, right in the middle.

136
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,434
Where's the dot now?

137
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,538
Nowhere.

138
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,040
Nothing in
the upper left corner?

139
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,109
No.

140
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,313
How about now?
Upper right?

141
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:28,549
No.

142
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:32,886
Okay.

143
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,597
It seems like
you have deficits

144
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,265
in your peripheral
visual fields.

145
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,070
According to this test,
you're going blind.

146
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,011
It's an optic nerve tumor.

147
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,513
A craniotomy could
get rid of it all,

148
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,081
but it'd stop the blood supply
to the optic nerves,

149
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,950
and she'd still go blind.

150
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,753
An endoscopic
endonasal approach

151
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,487
would avoid those
blood vessels.

152
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,623
She'd keep around
60% of her vision.

153
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:13,293
I need to do
better than 60%.

154
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,663
Is this about the client,
or the big fat contract

155
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,297
she might bring
to your clinic?

156
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,966
Glassman's basically gone.

157
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,367
I see a vacuum.
I want to fill it.

158
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,502
I thought you wanted
to be a doctor.

159
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,440
Last week, you told me
I shouldn't expect you

160
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,676
to become more ambitious.

161
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,143
The reverse is also true.

162
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,117
This could clear
the tumor

163
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,087
proton beam radiotherapy
with a synchrotron accelerator.

164
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,221
It's experimental.

165
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,290
Never been done on
an optic nerve tumor.

166
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,227
Got to go.

167
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,769
That's the last piece
of this kidney.

168
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,338
Hemoglobin's 6.

169
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,207
I don't like his BP,
either.

170
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,409
I can't fix this liver lac
without risking a major bleed.

171
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,612
We're almost out
of O-neg.

172
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,680
Isolate
the vascular pedicle.

173
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,348
O-O-Okay.

174
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,652
You know, his dad's in
the waiting room.

175
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,822
Think there might be
some unresolved issues.

176
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:15,856
Well, if we can
get Brandon through this,

177
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,891
maybe they'll
make amends.

178
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,893
My dad and I set aside
a lot of our issues

179
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,795
after his
cancer diagnosis.

180
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,430
Maybe my dad will get cancer
and we can bond.

181
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,433
You know,
other than one letter,

182
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,301
I haven't heard from him
in five years.

183
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,837
What did it say?

184
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,404
Don't know.
Never opened it.

185
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,976
Oh! We need more
suction and laps.

186
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,678
Where's it coming from?
There.

187
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,346
His vena cava ruptured.

188
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,014
Clamp it and pack
all four quadrants.

189
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,484
Crickets are
high in protein.

190
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,227
Marcus,
my needs are simple.

191
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,730
You gotta smell good.
Oh.

192
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,165
You gotta know
I love my work,

193
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,533
and I'm not gonna
apologize for it.

194
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,403
And you absolutely gotta be up
for trying new things.

195
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,189
Noted.

196
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,428
So, how is your newest thing
coming along?

197
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,063
Our hospital.

198
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,400
A few problems
in radiology.

199
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,068
We're spending too much
in the pharmacy.

200
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,571
And how well
do you know John Colson?

201
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,073
Head of Pediatrics?

202
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,742
Good doctor, good administrator.
Why?

203
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,213
He won't sign his Ethicure
employment agreement.

204
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,981
Don't know if I can
afford to lose him,

205
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,083
and I don't know if I can
afford to keep him
for what he's asking.

206
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,755
You signed your Ethicure
contract without any pushback.

207
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,956
What sold you?

208
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,458
I'm up for trying
new things.

209
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,235
How do I get
one of those hats
in my size?

210
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,602
Dr. Park!

211
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,707
I knew you'd find me
a new heart.

212
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,744
Uh, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

213
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,011
But first,
how do we get ready

214
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,479
for a dunk
in the giant donut?

215
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,513
With a little donut?

216
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,050
Jelly?

217
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,117
You rock.

218
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,070
When are you gonna stop
stalking me?

219
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,371
When you agree
to come back to San Jose.

220
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,313
It's his patient
satisfaction scores.

221
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,882
How bad?

222
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,016
Is his job at risk?

223
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,150
Well, no.

224
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,987
Okay.

225
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,522
Because I omitted some
of his negative reviews
to bring his scores up.

226
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,723
You did what?

227
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,060
Sorry.

228
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,096
There's no way
this was Shaun's idea.

229
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,864
No.

230
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:14,401
He... He didn't even
want me to talk to Salen.

231
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,169
Did he agree to this?
Does he even know about it?

232
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,405
No.

233
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,009
So, instead of telling him,
you decided to come see me?

234
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,078
When did you get so unethical
and condescending?

235
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,679
You're infantilizing him.

236
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:28,681
These scores,

237
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,683
the way Salen
runs the hospital,

238
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,552
this could really hurt him.

239
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,254
Hurting him any more than
you're hurting him right now?

240
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,690
I kn... I know.

241
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:38,859
I...

242
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,095
So, what do you
want me to do?

243
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,563
You want me to go back
to San Jose

244
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,998
and co-sign your crap?

245
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,699
This isn't about me.
It is.

246
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,968
It's about Shaun.
It's about you.

247
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,103
It's your fiance.

248
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,272
Your responsibility.
Your mess.

249
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,474
Go home.

250
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,376
And clean this up.

251
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,029
No leaks.

252
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,265
The graft is holding
and the bleeding is stopped.

253
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,133
We still have to deal
with his brain edema.

254
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,701
How's his intracranial
pressure?

255
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,838
31.

256
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,007
It's even higher than it was
before we started surgery.

257
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,608
Run an EEG.

258
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,314
Slow waves.

259
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,250
Burst suppression pattern.

260
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:40,653
Minimal activity.

261
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,558
He's in a coma.

262
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,297
Brandon is in a coma.

263
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,569
We're trying to relieve
the pressure on his skull

264
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,171
to try to help
his brain recover.

265
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,475
And how long will that take
for it to recover?

266
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,646
It's... It's
hard to say.

267
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,813
Um...

268
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,620
What's more likely,
given the extent of his injuries

269
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,358
is that it won't.

270
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,696
And he will progress
to brain death.

271
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,578
I thought about
calling him this week.

272
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,216
So we could
work through some stuff.

273
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,350
Yeah, those are...

274
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,122
...tough calls to make.

275
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,057
We haven't talked
in about two years.

276
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,861
Since he dropped out
of Annapolis.

277
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,599
Instead,
he was gonna be a

278
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,735
drummer.

279
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,644
Your dad must be
very proud of you.

280
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,046
Uh...

281
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,182
He wanted a rabbi.

282
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,683
A st-straight rabbi.

283
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,586
I failed at both,

284
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,290
so he disowned me.

285
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,400
I really need to talk
to my son again.

286
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,404
We're trying everything we can
to make that happen.

287
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,598
Knock, knock.

288
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,935
Did you see the proposal
I sent you about Nira's treatment?

289
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,504
Yes.

290
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,173
Very ambitious.

291
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,941
And also quite expensive.

292
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,278
If the proton beam
radiotherapy is successful,

293
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,481
we'd save 100%
of Nira's vision.

294
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,049
We'd definitely win
the company's contract.

295
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,456
Reasonable
medical decision.

296
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,592
Bad business decision.

297
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,094
The cost of the equipment
and treatment

298
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,861
is several hundred
thousand dollars more

299
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,130
than the value
of that contract.

300
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,466
You have a perfectly
acceptable treatment

301
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,169
that's FDA approved,
covered by her insurance,

302
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,105
and saves her life

303
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,608
while preserving 60%
of her vision.

304
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,178
I'm fairly certain
that's all you need
to secure the contract.

305
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,747
Our client deserves to know
all of her options.

306
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,984
You're her doctor.

307
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,553
Do what you think
is right.

308
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,226
But our deal only stands

309
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,294
if you make
the clinic profitable.

310
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,236
It's gonna fit like
a heart-shaped glove.

311
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,006
Let's see how much excess fluid
you're lugging around, Ollie.

312
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,580
Well? No salt
and no soda all week.

313
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,715
And did you know
the brontosaurus had

314
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,417
a 300-pound heart?

315
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,253
Imagine what that
sounds like.

316
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,088
Probably like
"ka-boom, ka-boom!"

317
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,059
Check this out.

318
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,261
It's my new lucky charm.

319
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,896
It's a triceratops toe.

320
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,500
It's, uh, 65 million...

321
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,835
...years old.

322
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,070
Is your chest
hurting, Ollie?

323
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,612
I need a nurse
and the ECMO team, stat!

324
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:46,159
Oh, this doctor
in Boston used

325
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,795
an external drain
to lower pressure
in the brain.

326
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,064
Never mind.
The patient died.

327
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,268
Well, maybe we can try
to relax brain pressure

328
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,636
with a hemicraniectomy.

329
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,739
He wouldn't survive
that surgery either.

330
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,974
Made any progress
with your patient?

331
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,110
Not yet.

332
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,813
H-Have you discussed
organ donation with his family?

333
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,115
No.

334
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,284
In his fragile state,
his organs won't last long.

335
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,089
Shaun, this is a tragedy
no matter how it ends.

336
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,525
You are breaking
the rules.

337
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,026
My patient is getting weaker
by the minute.

338
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,861
Stop.

339
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,331
An organ recipient's doctor

340
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,666
is not allowed
to communicate with
a potential donor's doctor.

341
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,601
I am talking to you
as a friend.

342
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,506
You can't save everyone.

343
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,775
If your patient is gone,
let me save mine.

344
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,818
Go away, or I will
report you to UNOS,

345
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,455
and you'll lose your
transplant privileges.

346
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,227
Hey, Shaun.
You're late.

347
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,497
Yeah, the plane
was late and cramped

348
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,933
and devoid of refreshments,
and I'm starving.

349
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,234
You ready to get
some pancakes?

350
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,370
I need to fix
my neurophysiology test.

351
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,538
Okay, well, uh, great.

352
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,507
Can we do it
while we eat?
No.

353
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,874
I answered this one
correctly.

354
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,843
Check my work.
I understand that it's not...

355
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:44,844
Check my work.
not a perfect score, but...

356
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,313
Check my work, please.
Check it.

357
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,448
Question 5.
Okay, okay.

358
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,217
Yeah.

359
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,687
It should be A, but, uh,
it could also be C.

360
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,757
But the internal
carotid arteries branch.

361
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,029
It is worded
a little strangely.

362
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,464
I would have
gotten it wrong, too.

363
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,265
Yes, Professor Fontaine
is wrong.

364
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,401
You need to tell him that.

365
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,702
I'm not gonna
tell a professor

366
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,004
to rewrite
his test question.

367
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,240
But he is wrong about
how blood flows

368
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,775
into the supratentorial brain!

369
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:16,876
So what, Shaun?

370
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,011
It's just a test,
and I'm starving!

371
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,648
You go eat.

372
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,883
I'm going to see
my professor.

373
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:24,784
Shaun.

374
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,722
The internal
carotid arteries.

375
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,328
I don't see any issues
in that area.

376
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,631
You wouldn't, if there is
a very small dissection

377
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,933
hidden by all the swelling
and other damage.

378
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,635
Stents could
increase circulation

379
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,938
to his supratentorial brain,
which might wake him up!

380
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,543
Nira?

381
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,014
I found a surgery.

382
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,250
It's not only going
to remove the tumor

383
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,787
from behind your eyes,
it will also be able to save...

384
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,158
...60% of your vision.

385
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,764
Oh, thank you.

386
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:21,441
There it is...
a tiny tear in the carotid.
Good catch, Dr. Murphy.

387
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,679
But there's a clot.

388
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,582
The stent could
expand the clot,

389
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,183
which could kill him.

390
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,919
Not if we
break up the clot

391
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,921
with therapeutic heparin.

392
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,189
We'd be risking major bleeds
in all his organs.

393
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,792
If we don't give him heparin,
he will end up brain dead.

394
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,697
During my residency,

395
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,699
we had a woman die
on the table.

396
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,536
Healthy organs,
no contact info.

397
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,803
No one was saved that day

398
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,772
because we didn't know
if she was a donor.

399
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,641
I thought we weren't
supposed to consider

400
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,142
organ recipients
when treating patients.

401
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,144
We're not.

402
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,179
Right up until the point where
what we're doing is futile.

403
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,317
It is not futile.

404
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:09,255
This has a 1% chance
of helping Brandon.

405
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:15,995
Start the heparin drip.

406
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,850
I'm sorry, Val.

407
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,763
My boy spent his entire life
in hospitals.

408
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,568
Getting poked and tested

409
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,436
and promised things
that never came.

410
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,875
And all I wanted
was to give him
just one perfect day.

411
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,517
Just one.

412
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,433
Here's your hot mocha.

413
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,001
Dr. Colson.

414
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,269
Glad I ran into you.

415
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,437
Let me get this.
I got a favor to ask you.

416
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:32,905
My usual.

417
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,373
In that case,
I'm having a muffin.

418
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,111
You know, my friend Joanne,
she flew in from Seattle.

419
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,747
You got a minute to
chat with her,

420
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,881
give her the lay
of the land?

421
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:42,915
She's sitting
right over there.

422
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,185
She's interviewing
for your job.

423
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,254
She's a great
pediatrician.

424
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,689
I'm not sure what you heard,
but I'm not going anywhere.

425
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,490
Wait...
Uh, thank you.

426
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,926
I... Oh, I'm sorry.

427
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,461
I heard that
you were moving on.

428
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,429
No, just renegotiating.

429
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,131
I thought...

430
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,600
I have to go.

431
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,768
Thanks for the muffin.

432
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,007
Excuse me.

433
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,108
Is this seat taken?

434
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,488
Your patient is in
multi-organ failure.

435
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,090
Yes, w-we are treating him

436
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,792
with plasma and platelets
to increase...

437
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,927
He has clots forming
on his heart valves,

438
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,862
which means his heart
is no longer an option
for my patient.

439
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,498
Okay, you are not
supposed to look at

440
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:33,833
my patient's
medical records.

441
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,367
It is a violation
of policy.

442
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:38,671
I wanted to see if his heart
was still an option.

443
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,140
Your Hail Mary surgery
didn't save your patient,

444
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,609
and it just killed mine.

445
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,896
Professor Fontaine said
my answer is wrong.

446
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,698
I'm sorry
to hear that, Shaun.

447
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,067
I'm going to talk
to the dean.

448
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,736
You need to come with me.

449
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,303
You're gonna go over the head
of your professor?

450
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,305
That might cost you more
than two percentage points.

451
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,540
He is wrong.

452
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:15,675
Well, he might be.

453
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:16,776
Then, why...

454
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,010
I got you something, Shaun.

455
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,379
Pick one.

456
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,850
Mm, I don't care
about these things.

457
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,184
Okay, I'll pick one
for you.

458
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,554
I don't do embroidery.

459
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,722
You can learn.

460
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,290
It's good practice
for your sutures.

461
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,195
Sometimes bad things
happen, okay?

462
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,765
Sometimes even
unfair things happen.

463
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,734
You know that
better than anyone.

464
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,870
And sometimes
you gotta let them go

465
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,205
and focus on the next thing,
the next challenge.

466
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,113
Are you not coming with me
to see the dean?

467
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,849
No.

468
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,418
You said you would
always be there for me,

469
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,519
to help me.

470
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,554
I am.

471
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,924
Go if you need to go.

472
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,259
I'll still be right here.

473
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,909
We need to talk
to Brandon's father!

474
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,913
I think we can save
Brandon's heart.

475
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,582
We can use
an embroidery technique.

476
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,419
In the 1900s, Alexis Carrel
perfected vascular suturing

477
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,653
using embroidery.

478
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,023
If we treat his valves
like blood vessels,

479
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,758
we might be able
to repair them.

480
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,459
You can save my son?

481
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,794
N-N-No.

482
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,129
We can only save
his heart.

483
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:46,966
For d-donation.

484
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,106
It's time to let go.

485
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,946
My son is not dead.

486
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,613
Only because of what
we're doing to him,

487
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,582
but he will be very soon.

488
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,184
It is futile.

489
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,119
No.

490
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,888
I nee... I-I need to talk
to my son again.

491
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,122
I-I need to tell him...

492
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,593
...s-so much. I...

493
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:18,831
I understand.
It's too late.

494
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,332
No, it's not.

495
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,568
Not for that.

496
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,404
Talk to him.

497
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,840
Say goodbye.

498
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:32,044
If something needs to be said,
it should be said.

499
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,220
Here you go.

500
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,493
Everything's so blurry.

501
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,961
That will improve.

502
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:53,933
But the tumor was
more complicated

503
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,502
than the imaging showed.

504
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,171
We were only able to preserve
50% of your vision.

505
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,241
I'm so sorry, Nira.

506
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:05,477
Don't apologize.

507
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,580
You saved my life.

508
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:11,583
I would be blind or dead
if you hadn't found
that tumor. It's...

509
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,925
I should run some
vision tests on you now.

510
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:20,192
I will go
get those prepped.

511
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,218
Remember when I bought you
that ham radio?

512
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,622
Whenever I was
stationed overseas,

513
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,791
we would send each other
messages in Morse code.

514
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,162
You picked that up
so quickly...

515
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,097
But...

516
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,137
Then,

517
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,141
you sent me
that message saying

518
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,010
that you wanted to be
a rock star.

519
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,114
And I, um...

520
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,152
I shot it down.

521
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,263
Everything you wanted changed.

522
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,333
I didn't understand it.
I...

523
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,836
I didn't know
how to help you.

524
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,175
I had a path laid out,

525
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,543
and you didn't want
to follow it.

526
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,848
I thought you were
rejecting me, s...

527
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,298
And now I know,

528
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,302
you were just becoming
your own man.

529
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,195
Goodbye, Brandon.

530
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,134
I love you, son.

No, thank you.

553
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,236
People have always
tried to accommodate
for Shaun's differences.

554
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,771
Compensate,
overcompensate...

555
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,506
I don't need
another lecture.

556
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,775
I was one of those people.
Mm.

557
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,211
It took me forever to get
to where you started.

558
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,381
Right, it's so easy for me.

559
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,715
It is.

560
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,750
You always treated Shaun
like a person

561
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,652
instead of a problem.

562
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,488
You always saw Shaun.

563
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,357
Why did you stop
doing that?

564
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,659
You left.

565
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,495
So, what?
So you panicked?

566
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,830
Yeah.

567
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,031
Maybe.

568
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,901
I don't...
I don't know.
It's...

569
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,471
We're getting married,

570
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,173
and he's not always easy,

571
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:02,908
and I'm pretty much
always a screw-up.

572
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,810
And...

573
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,012
It's just...
It's too much.

574
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,714
No, it isn't.

575
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,286
B-But you've always been there
to back me up.

576
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,688
You don't
need me anymore.

577
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:19,425
You're kind
and you're patient.

578
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,493
You're resilient
as all get-out.

579
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,329
You're the right person
for Shaun.

580
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,063
Shaun's the right person
for you.

581
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,233
If you can just trust that,

582
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:31,036
you will have
the most perfect,

583
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,504
imperfect marriage.

584
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,312
I kind of feel like
hugging you right now.

585
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,417
Hey.

586
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,818
You don't need me.

587
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:12,911
There's something
I want you to hear.

588
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,256
Ka-boom!

589
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,791
Sounds like
a 300-pounder.

590
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,103
No, no, no.

591
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:39,471
This is
your lucky charm.

592
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:40,572
Yes, yes, yes.

593
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,741
I don't need it anymore.

594
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:08,967
You wanted to see me?

595
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,170
Make yourself at home.

596
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,807
This is
Dr. Glassman's office.

597
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:18,477
You've earned it.

598
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,641
I found a very
interesting documentary

599
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,810
about the science
of storm clouds.

600
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,346
We should watch that
tomorrow night.

601
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,320
I'd like that.
I'll bring the pizza.

602
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,664
No olives, no mushrooms,
no anchovies, right?

603
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,065
Right.

604
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,667
Because they don't
taste good.

605
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,045
Is this payback?

606
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,680
No, a gift.

607
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,118
Worms have more protein
than crickets.

608
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,399
Then I'll take another.

609
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:49,868
I feel like celebrating.

610
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:57,242
Colson suddenly lost interest
in playing hardball

611
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,910
and signed his
employment agreement.

612
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,045
Hmm.

613
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,213
I assume you had
something to do with it?

614
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,482
Glad I could help.

615
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,228
You smell good.

616
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:24,970
You coming?

617
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,016
I came to give you this.

618
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,390
It's where
Brandon's organs went.

619
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:53,264
A secretary who's
a single mom of three

620
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,800
got his kidney.

621
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,968
A truck driver
with a vision problem

622
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,670
got his corneas.

623
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,839
A teenager with
a rare autoimmune disorder

624
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:01,973
got his ligaments.

625
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:05,544
And a young boy

626
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,178
got Brandon's heart.

627
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,782
He loves dinosaurs.

628
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,659
Brandon helped
all these people?

629
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,362
