1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:05,266
Think of these
not as a report card,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,965
but a window into the minds
of your clients,

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,664
their families
and support persons,

4
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:16,581
and also as a window
into yourselves.

5
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,062
To see your greatest strengths

6
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,064
and the areas where you have

7
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,894
the greatest opportunity
for growth.

8
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,897
First round of results
is already in your inbox.

9
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,203
Regular updates to follow.

10
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,647
Third highest
in the department.

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,649
Pretty good.

12
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,042
Second.

13
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:46,002
How'd you do?

14
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:47,743
Fine.

15
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,402
"Dr. Reznick
cares deeply about people."

16
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,317
"Sweet." "Kind."

17
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,145
"Thoughtful."

18
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,060
What do I have to do
to get that level of service?

19
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:01,496
Let me bill your insurance.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,674
You have six comments.

21
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:08,068
Four "OKs." Two "Goods."

22
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,895
I have 46.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,723
It's hard to live
in your long, sweet shadow.

24
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:14,074
I'll give you some pointers.
We could role play.

25
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:17,381
You could be the shirtless
and eager-to-please doctor,

26
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,383
and I'll be the
sexy-but-demanding patient

27
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,732
with a nasty
fungal infection.

28
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,395
Top five. Nice work.

29
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,267
Thank you.

30
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,618
But as Chief of Surgery,
wouldn't hurt to aim higher.

31
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,316
Speaking of which,
where's my numero uno?

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,623
Dr. Rendon.
Top of the class.

33
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:42,754
Oh, he was called away on

34
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:43,625
a medical mission
in Guatemala.

35
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,539
It was urgent.

36
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,410
Huh. Heroic.

37
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:47,672
When will he be back?

38
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,239
Should be just
a few more days.

39
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:52,416
In the future,
please let me know

40
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,678
about any extended
absences, hmm?

41
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,638
He can't make
our clients happy

42
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:57,639
if he's not in the country.

43
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,296
I have to go.

44
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:05,821
I had the lowest ranking in

45
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:08,215
the entire
surgical department.

46
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,826
I made five people
"very uncomfortable."

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,045
Seven patients
said I talked weird,

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,874
and one woman was "a little
creeped out" by my manner.

49
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,225
The algorithm has
some major blind spots.

50
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,227
I can make it better.
I'll talk to Salen.

51
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,230
No. The data reflects
actual opinions.

52
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:29,540
I will learn how to make
people feel comfortable

53
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:30,759
and improve my scores.

54
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:50,257
Rosa Castillo, 35,
needs immediate bypass surgery

55
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,084
for acute kidney failure.

56
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,608
She was treated
for renal artery stenosis

57
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,044
three years ago.

58
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,264
Looks like the stent failed.
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,962
This imaging is barely
readable. It's from 1985.

60
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,312
Try Guatemala.
Mateo sent her here.

61
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,227
They don't have the equipment
for a bypass.

62
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:07,056
Ms. Castillo.

63
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,797
I am Dr. Lim.
This is Dr. Wolke.

64
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:10,973
I heard
so much about you.

65
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,105
The Chief. La Jefa.

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,891
Oh. Well, hopefully,
we can have you in the O.R.

67
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:17,849
in the next couple of hours.

68
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:18,937
We already have
your medical history

69
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,983
from Dr. Rendon, which helps.

70
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,767
Teo told me I would
be in good hands here.

71
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,381
Uh, is that what all his
patients call him back home?

72
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:30,775
Probably just
the ones who dated him.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,437
Bruising of the jaw,
sublingual hematoma,

74
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,309
most likely
a parasymphyseal fracture.

75
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,963
It's just a little bump.
I'm fine.

76
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,531
You're not fine, Dad.
How did it happen?

77
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,011
Ah, some kids were horsing
around outside

78
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,491
when I was opening up.

79
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,928
He runs a hardware shop.
They attacked him.

80
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:55,583
It was an accident.

81
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,238
I fell off the sidewalk into
someone's side-view mirror.

82
00:03:58,412 --> 00:03:59,891
Your jaw's broken.

83
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,198
They pushed you
off the sidewalk,

84
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,982
told you
to not get them sick.

85
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,767
They were just
being stupid.

86
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,334
She's so sensitive.

87
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,031
Checking for abnormal movement
of the mandible

88
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,641
or any malocclusion.

89
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:11,947
Okay, we need
to file a report.

90
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,688
A report?
Why would I--

91
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,215
The fractured bone and
tongue are sliding backwards,

92
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,347
blocking his oropharynx.

93
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,262
We need to secure
the airway, now!

94
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,093
Placing the last
two-millimeter miniplate.

95
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,793
He must have been
in a lot of pain.

96
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,098
Good for you

97
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,404
if you can stay positive
after a hate crime.

98
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,931
Satisfactory occlusion
and fragment reduction.

99
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,151
Doctors Allen and Murphy,

100
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,022
let's remove
the temporary MMF.

101
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,590
Mr. Song and his daughter

102
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:49,071
see the same situation
very differently.

103
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,946
He's bradycardic.
Heart rate dropped to 35.

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,905
And hypotensive,
73 over 42.

105
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,385
Let's dial back
the sedation and opiates,

106
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,908
push one milligram
I.V. atropine.

107
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,657
Jordan: Maybe an adverse
reaction to the anesthesia?

108
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:10,527
We need to figure out
if there's

109
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,181
an underlying cardiac problem.

110
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,314
Get a post-op EKG,
echo in recovery,

111
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,141
and check for electrolytes.

112
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,405
And I need to figure out

113
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,884
how to get a good review
from both of them.

114
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,722
How's the water pressure?

115
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:36,074
Fine.
I decreased output by 5%.

116
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:39,295
Saves 150 gallons a month,
$17,000 annually.

117
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,300
Which, in three years
and five months,

118
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,084
will make up for
what you're about to spend

119
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,304
operating on
this new client,

120
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,089
whom Dr. Rendon gifted us.

121
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,091
Mateo's commitment
to patients

122
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,919
is the reason he's numero uno
in the department.

123
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,227
My concern isn't Mateo.

124
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,447
You allowed him to fly in
an uninsured patient

125
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,361
without informing me.

126
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:06,931
Do I still have the autonomy
to run my own department?

127
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,978
I hope you see yourself

128
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,893
as more than just
the head of one department.

129
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:15,462
You are a vital member
of the Ethicure family.

130
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,028
We have to work together,

131
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,726
all of us,
or we will all...

132
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,560
...falter.

133
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:32,957
The colors on these are wild.

134
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,872
Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,527
That yellow would look great
with your complexion.

136
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,268
Full-crested
double gerbera daisies.

137
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:42,053
Mr. Song has sinus rhythm
on his EKG.

138
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:45,143
Normal electrolytes, and
no abnormalities on the echo.

139
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,449
Which rules out a lot,

140
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,625
but not a P.E.
or small cardiac contusion.

141
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,496
Get a CTA chest.

142
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,282
Gerberas produce
excessive amounts of pollen,

143
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,023
which can
trigger migraines.

144
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,070
You don't need
to be here for this.

145
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,987
Text me.
Yeah.

146
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,381
Excellent point
about the gerberas.

147
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:06,687
Lucky me, working with such

148
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,732
a fabulous,
knowledgeable couple.

149
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,692
Mm, gerberas are notoriously
big pollen producers.

150
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:15,130
It's an obvious point,
not an excellent one.

151
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,828
You called Lea and me
"fabulous."

152
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,352
Are you using hyperbolic
language to make us like you?

153
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:24,052
Mm, I think the language was
pretty accurate, actually.

154
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,010
Hmm.
I'm trying to improve

155
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,186
my own client
satisfaction scores,

156
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,537
which are poor.

157
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:34,192
You received 97%
five-star reviews on Yelp.

158
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,803
Your methods must be
very effective.

159
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,631
Are you using hyperbolic
language to make us like you?

160
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,766
It's all about
appeasing and affirming.

161
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,160
Appease. Give the customers
what they want.

162
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,336
And affirm. Make them feel

163
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,990
that what they want
is wise and good,

164
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,079
which in your case,
it is very much so.

165
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,961
Rotating everything medially

166
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,007
to expose the renal vessels.

167
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:07,835
I got three lap choles

168
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,315
waiting for Dr. Rendon
on Wednesday,

169
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,839
little thank-you gift

170
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,971
for letting us operate
on his patient.

171
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,407
Well, might be Thursday
before he's back.

172
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,890
Sorry the humanitarian crisis
is screwing up your schedule.

173
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,068
There's a massive aneurysm
cutting off blood flow.

174
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,508
There's no way to get vascular
control for reconstruction.

175
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:29,857
We might be able
to do a bypass

176
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,511
from the aorta or iliacs.

177
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,904
There are several
aneurysmal segments

178
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,340
along the abdominal aorta.

179
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,429
This one's abnormal, too.

180
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,650
All of her arteries
are defective.

181
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,534
You should take me
on a date tonight.

182
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,361
Okay.It's a lecture

183
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,276
on leadership in medicine
by Dr. Chandra.

184
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,191
Recipient of two
NIH grants.

185
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,453
That's not a date.
That's homework.

186
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,064
Starting the scan.

187
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,761
There's a cocktail
party after.

188
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,808
How about we spend our time

189
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,766
doing that role playing
you suggested?

190
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,116
You know, minus the fungus.

191
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,118
The infection was the whole
motivation for my character.

192
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,166
Your guy's heart is fine.

193
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,515
Make sure
youbreak the good news.

194
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,125
Should bump up
your scores a notch.

195
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,176
The tests show
your heart function

196
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,786
and anatomy are normal.

197
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,571
The episode during surgery

198
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,616
was probably just
a minor anesthesia reaction.

199
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,531
You should be
good to go very soon.

200
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,577
Thank you, Dr. Allen.

201
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,060
We can stop by the police
station on the way home

202
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,540
so you can make a statement.

203
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,848
I told you,
no reports, no statements.

204
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,240
BP is 133 over 70.

205
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,460
Checking O2 sat.

206
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,855
Appa,these things
are underreported.

207
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,597
Our relatives,
our friends,

208
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,903
our people
are getting hurt out there.

209
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,862
"Our people."

210
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,386
It's not us versus them.

211
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,953
That doesn't help anyone.

212
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,432
You don't think
we're seen as different?

213
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,304
You wantto be seen
as different.

214
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,349
You rub people's
faces in it.

215
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,829
That's why you aren't
getting anywhere.

216
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:14,004
You don't have
a real job--

217
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,180
Community organizing
is a real job.

218
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,141
I am lucky to have such

219
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,969
fabulous,
knowledgeable clients.

220
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,102
Emily, you're right

221
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:28,323
about the importance
of recognizing problems.

222
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,717
Mr. Song, it is wise

223
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:31,892
to be concerned for your

224
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,415
daughter's
professional future.

225
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,248
Please, Appa.

226
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,206
Go with me
to make a statement.

227
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,860
It's important.

228
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,079
Not to me.

229
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,218
You're right.

230
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,656
Community organizing does
not sound like a real job.

231
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,396
It's a real job.

232
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,050
Heart rate dropped.

233
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,965
A-line shows a widened
pulse pressure reading.

234
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,665
Something
is wrong with my heart?

235
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,015
Respiration rate down,
trending apneic.

236
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,279
Cushing's Triad.

237
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,715
75 grams of mannitol.

238
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:17,241
Your heart is fine.

239
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:18,634
There's something wrong
with your brain.

240
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,471
It's invaded
the motor strip,

241
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,778
left temporal,
anterior corpus callosum.

242
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:33,823
Severe necrosis and edema,

243
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:36,826
and no way to see where
tumor ends and brain begins.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,262
It's inoperable.

245
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,919
I will definitely
get a bad review.

246
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,924
I need more time
to find a surgical solution.

247
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,625
But we also need to leave
for our tux fitting.

248
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,591
We were able to
bypass the renal artery

249
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,332
using one of your veins.

250
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,899
But new imaging showed

251
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:09,076
you have a condition called
Fibromuscular Dysplasia.

252
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,818
It's caused areas
of stenosis and aneurysm

253
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:14,777
in your heart, brain,
and other major vessels.

254
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:17,998
We can give you medication

255
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,043
to manage
the underlying condition,

256
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,610
but we'll have to do
another surgery

257
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,525
to repair
each of the aneurysms.

258
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,615
There are risks of stroke,
or major hemorrhage.

259
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,835
But without it,
it's only a matter of time

260
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,358
before one of these
aneurysms ruptures.

261
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,146
Um,

262
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:41,238
if anything goes wrong,

263
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,152
can you please let
Teo know?

264
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:45,895
He should be the one
to tell my family.

265
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,944
I wouldn't want them
to hear it from a stranger.

266
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,121
Of course.

267
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:03,086
We could use intraoperative
stimulated raman histology

268
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,262
to determine tumor tissue
versus normal.

269
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,611
Eh, if we
resect normal tissue,

270
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,439
we can't put it back in.

271
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,354
Drape is perfect
with your physique.

272
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,097
Intraoperative
MRI guidance

273
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:17,100
would help us achieve
gross total resection.

274
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,755
And risk resecting eloquent
cortex, with major deficits.

275
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,497
You look like a little boy.

276
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,934
The shoulder sag is awful.
Take it off.

277
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:28,459
That was neither appeasing
nor affirming.

278
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,113
But your reviews
are exceptional.

279
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,378
You can't just tell people
what they want to hear.

280
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,294
You've got to give them
the cold, hard truth.

281
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:41,211
I always do that, and people
don't give me good reviews.

282
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,039
You have to follow it
with a compliment,

283
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,259
which now,
thanks to your honesty,

284
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,390
they'll believe.

285
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,698
Very striking
with those eyes.

286
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:54,398
I...do believe you.

287
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:03,625
Yeah, hey, Shaun.

288
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,062
Um, sorry for not replying.

289
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,630
You're late
for the tux fitting.

290
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,633
Oh, yeah, um...

291
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,722
I'm in Montana?

292
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,724
We need to reschedule
your appointment.

293
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,944
When will you be back?

294
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,207
Well, I'm not so sure.

295
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:23,079
I'm heading towards
a little town called Paradise,

296
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,212
and I'm--

297
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:27,867
I'm thinking of hunkering down
there for a little while.

298
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,261
How about Wednesday,
12:00 p.m.?

299
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,221
Will you be done
hunkering by then?

300
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,440
Sure.
I'll see what I can do.

301
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,405
You are confirmed.
Goodbye.

302
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,712
We have to get back to the
hospital and talk to Mr. Song.

303
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,976
With only chemo and radiation,
you would die soon.

304
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,153
But I've found a way
to remove the tumor

305
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,024
using fluorescent light.

306
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,505
If we administer
5-ALA before surgery,

307
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,594
the cancer cells will turn
pink under the light.

308
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,161
Then we can resect those cells

309
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,989
and leave healthy
tissue unharmed.

310
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,426
You will likely have paralysis
on your right side,

311
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,558
but no cognitive
or speech impairment.

312
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:16,480
No.

313
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,483
I've always
taken care of myself.

314
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,010
Without this procedure,
you'd have a year at most.

315
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,143
I'd better
make it count, then.

316
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,146
No surgery.

317
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:44,291
Chicken pepian, from the place
down the street.

318
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,684
Mateo says
it reminds him of home.

319
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,034
Funny.
When he was "home,"

320
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,165
his favorite food
was pizza.

321
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,474
You're very kind.

322
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,084
I'm not sure
I would be this nice

323
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:56,912
to the ex-girlfriend
of my current boyfriend.

324
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,741
Mateo told you about us?

325
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,003
No, but you're his type.

326
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,528
Beautiful.
Smarter than he is.

327
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,228
And Dr. Wolke
let something slip.

328
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,316
Ah.

329
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,450
I can't quite
picture Teo here.

330
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:14,799
Everything is very

331
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,193
nice.

332
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,282
And shiny.

333
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:20,153
Mm.

334
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,546
Did you meet here?

335
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,333
No.

336
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,683
We met in Guatemala.

337
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,468
And then
he decided to move.

338
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:32,904
It was a little--

339
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,124
Romantic?

340
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,083
Crazy.
Yes.

341
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:40,216
He moves fast
when he knows what he wants.

342
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,566
We were practically living
together by our third date.

343
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,006
Were you together
a long time?

344
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,617
Six months, maybe less.

345
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,532
Long enough for me
to start imagining

346
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:52,359
what our kids
would be like.

347
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,711
But then there was
a war in Congo

348
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,018
or an earthquake in Haiti.

349
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,149
Someone, somewhere
needed him.

350
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,069
But I am glad he's found
a place to settle down.

351
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,814
I wasn't sure that would
ever happen for him.

352
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,388
You left me.
At the party?

353
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,129
I was tired and bored.
I went home.

354
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,436
Without saying goodbye.

355
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,916
I was about to introduce you
to Dr. Chandra.

356
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,266
I didn't ask you
to do that.

357
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,963
And I didn't ask you
to tell that guy from Stanford

358
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,443
that I've done
over 50 robotic surgeries,

359
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,793
or give that research fellow
my ABSITE scores.

360
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:19,968
It's calling mingling.

361
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,622
Felt more like
being pimped out.

362
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:24,146
What can I say?
You're a stud.

363
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,105
I'm fine. I'm good.
My scores are average,

364
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,977
and it's driving you crazy.

365
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,111
You're not average, but you
shy away from the spotlight.

366
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,679
You're a hot Korean
martial artist surgeon,

367
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,073
and your face
isn't on a poster.

368
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,118
Why do you think that is?

369
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:43,470
I just want you to reach
your full potential.

370
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,559
I mean, don't you want that
for yourself?

371
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,356
Rough night?

372
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,445
Not really.
Oh.

373
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,881
You know,
when I don't sleep well,

374
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,144
it's usually
anxiety about work

375
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,494
or why some hot guy
isn't texting me back,

376
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,887
or, oh, he sent his
ex-girlfriend to me for help.

377
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,715
I was up late
prepping for this surgery.

378
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,327
Yeah. Me, too.

379
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,589
I have moisturizer in my bag,
just, if you want it.

380
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,419
Where is she?

381
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,247
Rosa was stable,
so I transferred her

382
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,987
to County Hospital
this morning.

383
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,989
She's my patient,
and I'm your boss.

384
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,515
This is the right call
for our department.

385
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:29,994
She'll get the care she needs,
and as a non-profit--

386
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,475
Their team has
far less experience

387
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,347
with this kind of surgery.

388
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,479
I know this patient
is important to Mateo,

389
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:37,959
and he's important to you,

390
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,656
but we cannot allocate
our limited resources

391
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,223
based on personal feelings.

392
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:44,008
Oh, this has
nothing to do with Mateo.

393
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,054
You are risking
a woman's life

394
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,187
so you can crawl
further up Salen's ass.

395
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:53,235
I'm protecting
this department,

396
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,802
which is actually
your job.

397
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,241
Pedes just hired
three new nurses.

398
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,765
I got approval
for a portable X-ray.

399
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,333
When's the last time Salen
approved one of your requests?

400
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,335
This is a hospital,
not a swap meet.

401
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,641
It's her hospital.

402
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,949
I'm contacting County.

403
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,168
You can't
bring her back here.

404
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:15,257
I know.

405
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,738
What about a limited
temporal lobe resection?

406
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,219
Lower the risk
of future brain herniation?

407
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,568
Good for preserving
motor function,

408
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:22,873
but he'd likely lose speech.

409
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,747
Why is my dad still here?

410
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,009
He isn't
telling me anything.

411
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:33,797
Emily, the break room is
for surgical residents only.

412
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,974
Your presence is not only
prohibited, it is unwelcome.

413
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,367
You're distracting us from

414
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,455
trying to change
your dad's mind

415
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:40,282
and save his life.

416
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,812
That sweater is very striking
with your eyes.

417
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,445
You should talk to him.

418
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,058
So he can tell me
everything's fine?

419
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:18,059
He needs you.

420
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:33,466
I used to be a cop.

421
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,861
In part to try
and please my dad.

422
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,517
He was all about
being tough.

423
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,824
He always had this, uh,

424
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,260
wall up, you know?

425
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,830
He came over with nothing.

426
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,572
Didn't know the language.

427
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:56,227
He got by on very little
for a long time.

428
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:57,968
It took a while
for me to realize it,

429
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:01,145
but being tough
was just a survival strategy.

430
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,937
My dad came here
when he was 19

431
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,462
and went "from a socket wrench
and a couple bolts

432
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,856
to Number One Convenience
Hardware in the Bay,

433
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,466
no problem."

434
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:26,997
I get that he's strong
because he had to be.

435
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:33,047
And I get

436
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,919
that it helps him to deny how
the world sees us as "other."

437
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,445
But when you do that,

438
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,885
it can make people
who are struggling feel

439
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,017
messed-up and...

440
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,192
Alone.

441
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,681
Maybe he's protecting you

442
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,161
not because he thinks
you're weak

443
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:06,385
but because he'd rather take
on the world all by himself

444
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,342
than see you get hurt.

445
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,608
Your dad's a fighter,
Emily.

446
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,263
But so are you.

447
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,354
And he needs you
to fight for him right now.

448
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,405
Why haven't you
told your daughter

449
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,275
what you're going through?

450
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,199
When she was a little girl,
she'd help out at the shop.

451
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,508
Make a mess, more like,

452
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,074
disappear in the middle
of stocking fasteners.

453
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,556
I'd find her
hiding behind the counter.

454
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,864
Someone said
something mean,

455
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:51,995
made her feel bad.

456
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:58,524
That's... That's the world.

457
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:00,482
I sell hammers
to people who hate me.

458
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:05,705
I get their money,
they get their hammers.

459
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,359
I kept my head down,

460
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,536
built a life for our family,
for her.

461
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:16,280
So, when I'd see her upset,
I'd tell her, "Hey,

462
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,805
forget that guy.

463
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,067
Focus on
the next customer."

464
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,555
I don't want her to hurt.

465
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:32,340
I need to be strong
for her.

466
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:36,562
Mr. Song,

467
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:42,045
the best way to show your
daughter what strength is...

468
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,049
Tell her what
you're going through.

469
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,227
She's not the little girl

470
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,620
hiding behind
the counter anymore.

471
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,024
Mm.

472
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:07,462
I heard you're doing
Rosa's surgery at County.

473
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,638
I would like to assist.

474
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,338
You don't have any surgical
privileges at County.

475
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,605
And unless you want
to piss off the CEO,

476
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:20,910
you shouldn't do it anyway.

477
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,087
Maybe you shouldn't,
either.

478
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,747
You don't know when Dr. Rendon
is coming back, do you?

479
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,623
Before I got
into this program,

480
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,842
I had heard so much about you,

481
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:42,628
how you were smart
and talented and

482
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,848
tough and fair.

483
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,416
And at first, I was like,
"Oh, my God. Stop. I get it."

484
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,635
But...

485
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,639
But I didn't.

486
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:54,683
Until I met you.

487
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,644
Everyone who works for you

488
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,777
is a better doctor
because of it.

489
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:07,478
And I would hate

490
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,351
to see you put everything
you've worked for on the line

491
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:11,526
for someone who

492
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,617
isn't willing
to do the same for you.

493
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,019
Thank you.

494
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:33,940
Don't ever
give me advice again.

495
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:52,306
Whatever you and Jordan said
has improved the situation.

496
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,700
How did you do it?

497
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,919
I just affirmed
where Emily was coming from

498
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,835
and helped her see where
her dad was coming from, too.

499
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,446
That's what I
tried to do,

500
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,534
and it made them
both angry.

501
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,756
There's some
shared experiences.

502
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,499
Because you're both Asian.

503
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,501
American, yeah.

504
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:17,070
Both second generation,
similar fathers.

505
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,855
You're both outsiders.

506
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,859
Yeah.
I guess that's, uh...

507
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,601
Um, my dad

508
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,864
told me about the tumor.

509
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,476
Did you convince him
to accept the surgery?

510
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:37,612
The thought

511
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,570
of losing him terrifies me.

512
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:44,532
But he needs my support now.

513
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,230
Which means supporting
his decision.

514
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,799
Thank you for
helping me see that.

515
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,156
I was wrong.

516
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,768
What you and Jordan said
has made the situation worse.

517
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:14,127
My clients are finally
in agreement with each other.

518
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,433
But against me.

519
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:17,478
I'm sorry, Shaun.

520
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:22,701
I love the tuxes,
but where's Glassman?

521
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,138
Oh, he is "hunkering down"
in Paradise.

522
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,924
Dr. Park, Emily, and I
are all outsiders,

523
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,491
but I failed
to connect with her,

524
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,188
and Dr. Park succeeded.

525
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:34,103
To connect with people,

526
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,279
I need them to like me,
which they do not.

527
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,807
I need new strategies.

528
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:46,550
Shaun, I know you grew up
not feeling accepted,

529
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,030
you didn't have
many friends--

530
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,032
No. I did not
have any friends.

531
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,382
Maybe the scores
are bringing up

532
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,298
some of those
old, painful feelings?

533
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:59,955
The scores are
providing useful data

534
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,088
to help me
track my progress.

535
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,786
Many people like you.
Why do you think that is?

536
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,788
Shaun,

537
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,878
obsessing over
whether or not people like you

538
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:12,402
is a guaranteed trip
to Crazytown.

539
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,362
That is very easy to say
when you are likeable.

540
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,843
You're an amazing doctor,

541
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:21,020
which any functioning, decent
algorithm should recognize.

542
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:22,499
If I just talked
to Salen, I--

543
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,066
No. I don't want you
to do that.

544
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,851
It might be simpler.

545
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,940
Do you think I can't
improve my scores?

546
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:30,943
Of course not.

547
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,946
I know you can.

548
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,343
Mm. I have to go.

549
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,655
Securing the airway.

550
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,830
Give another two milligrams
Lorazepam.

551
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:50,789
What's happening?

552
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,358
The seizures and brain
herniation will only get worse

553
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,578
as the tumor grows.

554
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:00,363
All we can do now is keep him
in a medically induced coma.

555
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,976
Until the tumor kills him.

556
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:11,331
Without waking up first?

557
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:12,375
There's nothing
you can do?

558
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,423
You are his medical proxy.

559
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:22,081
Now, your dad
rejected surgery

560
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,386
when he thought
he still had time.

561
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,173
It's possible he'd make
a different choice now.

562
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,311
He made it clear
he didn't want

563
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:38,662
to live weakened in any way.

564
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,883
He'd hate me for choosing
the surgery for him.

565
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,232
I can't.

566
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:48,237
That is a very bad,
very irrational decision.

567
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:54,809
It doesn't matter
if your father hates you.

568
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:57,333
Being liked doesn't matter,

569
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,640
and worrying about that is

570
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:02,512
a guaranteed trip
to Crazytown.

571
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,427
What matters is
saving your dad's life.

572
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,133
Your watch is
a very nice shade of orange.

573
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:33,674
Teo's lucky to have you.

574
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,241
I told him he better not
screw this one up.

575
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,070
You talked to him?

576
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,376
Mm. Earlier today.

577
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,464
Only for a minute.

578
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:44,990
He said
he'll be back soon.

579
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:46,948
Hopefully.

580
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:49,995
The nurse will come by
in a couple minutes

581
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,126
to take you to the O.R.

582
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,789
Hello, Dr. Glassman,

583
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,617
you haven't accepted
the calendar invite

584
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:04,835
for the rescheduled
tux fitting.

585
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,967
Should I send another one?

586
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,447
Also, in attempting to improve

587
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,839
my performance
with my clients,

588
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,189
I have not many progress,
even though--

589
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,233
Dr. Murphy?

590
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:15,368
You were right.

591
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,981
Nothing matters
except saving my dad.

592
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,375
Do the surgery.

593
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,208
Ignore the part about
not making progress,

594
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,514
but please respond about
the calendar invite.

595
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:45,093
We got over 98%
of the tumor,

596
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,487
and your prognosis
is very good.

597
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,489
As expected,
we weren't able

598
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:50,751
to preserve
full motor strength

599
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,187
in your left arm and leg.

600
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,712
Who--

601
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:56,931
I told them to.

602
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,720
Appa,

603
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,548
I couldn't stand
to lose you.

604
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,379
I know you may
never forgive me

605
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:11,554
or speak to me again,

606
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:15,210
but at least I know
you're still here

607
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:16,298
on the planet with me.

608
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:29,572
That decision...

609
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,187
...took a lot of strength.

610
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,150
Good thing
my daughter's so tough.

611
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,241
Wonder where
I got that from.

612
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,784
Everything went well.

613
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,917
I was able to repair
each of the aneurysms.

614
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,614
We should have you home
in a week, maybe less.

615
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,617
Thank you.
Yeah.

616
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,105
How did it end,
between you and Mateo?

617
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,415
It's none of my business.

618
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,938
You don't have to answer that
if you don't want to.

619
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,636
He would go on medical
missions all the time,

620
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,160
sometimes with no notice.

621
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,468
I would wake up
and find a little gift,

622
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,167
like a book
or a bottle of wine,

623
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,169
and a sweet note.

624
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:47,607
After a few days,
or weeks,

625
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,652
he would come back,
and everything would be good.

626
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,441
And then one time,
he didn't.

627
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,884
I waited for a long time.

628
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,061
Too long.

629
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,458
Thank you.

630
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,212
You want to
get some dinner?

631
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,170
I make a fairly
average lasagna.

632
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:30,867
Ah, I have to finish this

633
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,218
proposal for
Dr. Chandra's lab.

634
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,220
Unless you want
to work on it together.

635
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:37,570
I'm good.

636
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:46,187
You know, the day
I handed in my badge,

637
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,711
my dad told me
I was weak.

638
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,062
And then he didn't say

639
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,368
anything else to me
for a year.

640
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,503
I was only able to do it
because of him.

641
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,724
I'd watched him make
tough choices my whole life.

642
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,295
It cost me a lot
to get here,

643
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:10,907
but I'm finally
in a good place.

644
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,300
I love my work

645
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:14,781
and my pain-in-the-ass
girlfriend.

646
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:23,006
I don't know if that's
"reaching my full potential,"

647
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,531
but I'm happy.

648
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,970
And I fought
too hard for that

649
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,450
to let anyone tell me
it's not enough.

650
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,411
Even the person
who makes me the happiest.

651
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,678
I'll eat the lasagna.

652
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,598
I need to know

653
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,339
at some point "good"
is gonna be good enough.

654
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,777
For you. For us.

655
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,043
I'm ambitious.
That doesn't mean I'm broken.

656
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:05,397
I think you're unhappy.

657
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:09,096
As long
as I've known you,

658
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,054
you've been reaching for
the next rung of the ladder.

659
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:14,362
Will it ever be enough?

660
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:15,641
Hi. You haven't
reached Aaron Glassman.

661
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,904
So I'll call you back.
Sometime.

662
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,775
Hi. It's Lea. Call me back.

663
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,386
And call Shaun. He needs you.

664
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,898
Did transferring that
young woman make you feel

665
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,032
crappy?

666
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:00,163
It was the right call.

667
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:06,909
Yeah.

668
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:08,911
Pretty crappy.

669
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:14,830
A few years ago,
a colleague made me take

670
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:16,745
one of those online tests that

671
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:17,790
tells you
if you're a sociopath.

672
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:18,921
Mm.

673
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,185
Oh.

674
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,709
I'm not.

675
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:25,928
I'm just committed.

676
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:32,108
Allowing feelings to influence
business decisions leads to--

677
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:33,066
Bad decisions.

678
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,112
Yes. Exactly.

679
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,158
You think like somebody
who knows how to be in charge.

680
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:44,207
So why aren't you anymore?

681
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,779
I made a good call.
The board made a bad one.

682
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,045
Would you like to have dinner?
With me.

683
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:02,138
Before you answer, you should
know that going out with me

684
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,097
will not benefit you
professionally in any way.

685
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,621
Or personally, maybe.

686
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:07,970
Who's to say?

687
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:10,712
And turning me down
will have no repercussions.

688
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,323
Feelings do not
influence business.

689
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:16,762
I can sign something
to that effect.

690
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,511
I'd love
to have dinner with you.

691
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:28,991
Excellent.

692
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:32,821
Do you like shawarma?

693
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,214
I know the best
shawarma place.

694
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:36,434
Oh, I love their chicken,

695
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,653
but I hear their lamb is also
very good,

696
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:39,959
though I don't eat lamb
anymore.

697
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,047
It makes me sad.

698
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:02,547
You have reached

699
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:03,722
the voicemail box of...

700
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,854
Dr. Mateo Rendon.

701
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,029
Please record your message.

702
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,075
Hi. It's me.

703
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,735
If you're coming back
for work,

704
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,258
I'll see you Thursday.

705
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:24,046
If you're coming back
for me...

706
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,528
...don't.

707
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:42,891
Ranunculus.

708
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:48,984
They have very low pollen,

709
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:52,118
and the colors
are also..."wild."

710
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,250
These are Delano Yellow.

00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:55,991
Gorgeous,

712
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:58,559
allergen-free,
they're perfect, Shaun.

713
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,735
Yes, we are celebrating
my success.

714
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,258
I received
a new batch of scores,

715
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:05,087
and they are elevated
2.3 points.

716
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:07,046
That's great.

717
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,743
Yes. It is.

718
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,528
My efforts
to improve my performance

719
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:13,269
have been effective
after all.

720
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:15,097
And no one said
I was weird.
