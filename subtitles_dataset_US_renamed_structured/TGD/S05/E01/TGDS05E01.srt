723
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,057
Ms. Morrison,
we'd like to insert a catheter

724
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:04,972
through your jugular vein
to your kidney.

725
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,061
That way, we can biopsy
the mass safely.

726
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,541
Okay.

727
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,412
Will you
be doing it?

728
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,197
Dr. Wolke will
be doing the honors,

00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,633

730
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,069

That's fantastic.

Can I meet her?

735
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,865
She's a little busy.

736
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,912
Dr. Murphy, can you identify
the superior vesical arteries?

737
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:33,131
Yes.

738
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,394
W-Why?

739
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,788
Salvage them.
It will ensure blood supply
to the distal ureter.

740
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:42,096
That will reduce the risk
of incontinence or fistula.
