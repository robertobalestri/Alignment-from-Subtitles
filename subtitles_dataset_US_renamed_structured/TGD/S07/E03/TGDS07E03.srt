1
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:07,376
Fifty.

2
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:10,078
Okay.

3
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:13,416
That should not
have been so hard.

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:14,450
You're getting old, Pops.

5
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,119
Thirty-one is not old.

6
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:17,587
It is in parent years.

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,787
They're like dog years.

8
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:20,689
Damn you!

9
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,525
Why won't you let us sleep?

10
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,293
We shouldn't curse
in front of him.

11
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:25,727
We didn't.

12
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:29,232
And he's obviously
gonna be a rock star.

13
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:32,602
So might as well get used
to hanging out with lowlifes.

14
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,271
He screams like Axl Rose.

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,640
And he's definitely a night owl.

16
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,109
Crying uses
the vocal-fold muscles

17
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,810
very differently than singing.

18
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:43,945
And lots of jobs work at night.

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,715
Janitors, truck drivers,
polysomnographic technologists.

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,818
All I know,
with those eyes and that smile,

21
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,454
no way he ends up in any job

22
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:54,990
that doesn't involve
being swarmed by supermodels.

23
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,791
Of whatever the hell
gender he prefers.

24
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,695
I think we may need
to get a swear jar.

25
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:03,899
Wouldn't work.

26
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:05,066
Ask my dad.

27
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:09,505
<i>I'm sorry.
I just don't get what the big deal is.</i>

28
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:10,705
I've never even met your niece.

29
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,806
Yeah, because you've turned down

30
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,708
every invite
to a family gathering.

31
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,043
Okay. I've just been
really busy lately.

32
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:16,646
Last time my brother
had a barbecue,

33
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:19,014
you went to a karaoke bar
with Jordan instead.

34
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:21,284
That is not true.

35
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:24,387
- It was an ax-throwing bar.
- Ash.

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,256
I've gone out of my way to be
sensitive to your family history.

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,224
Mine is different.

38
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:29,991
We're all super close.

39
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:34,062
And... And this is a big deal.
It's her confirmation.

40
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:36,731
I'm not asking you to go to the
church service. Just the after party.

41
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,066
I can't tomorrow night.

42
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,669
I have a ton of work
to catch up on. I gotta go.

43
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:44,072
Good morning.
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

44
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,609
This is Dr. Kalu and Doctor...

45
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,076
It smells like
a brewery in here.

46
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:50,413
Sorry. We had a party
at our fraternity last night.

47
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:52,847
Um, I was gonna shower,
but my roommates,

48
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,383
they insisted I go
to the ER immediately.

49
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:56,252
I-I can't hear
out of my left ear.

50
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:57,420
When did you lose...

51
00:01:57,553 --> 00:01:59,222
Miss Lukaitis is
one of our med students.

52
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,424
She is here to observe.

53
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:03,392
Med students
do not take patient histories

54
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:04,826
unless directed to.

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,128
I wasn't taking a history.

56
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,030
I see you got into
a fight last night?

57
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:11,467
No. It was...
It was a drinking game.

58
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,902
You take turns slapping
each other in the face

59
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,239
and whoever flinches,
they have to drink.

60
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:17,806
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,408
I woke up
with an insane headache.

62
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,545
I think I ruptured my eardrum.

63
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:24,913
I slapped my friend the other
day to treat his hemophobia.

64
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,549
It seemed safe, but I'm
probably not as strong...

65
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:28,618
There's bilateral otitis externa

66
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,220
and significant
cerumen blockage.

67
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,122
Cerumen?

68
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:35,857
Yeah, you have an ear infection
and a lot of earwax.

69
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,526
Oh.

70
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,695
Whoa. What happened here?

71
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:40,795
Ooh.

72
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,266
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just a bruise.

73
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,634
Take more than a slap
to cause that.

74
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,636
One of the guys in my fraternity

75
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,738
has one of those
foam-round shotguns

76
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,107
that the police use
for riot control.

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,643
Um, so we were testing it out
on each other.

78
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:55,810
- Mm.
- Mm.

79
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:58,013
Flush the ears with warm saline

80
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,914
and administer
polymyxin B drops.

81
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,850
Then get X-rays
to rule out a broken rib.

82
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,253
You can go with them.

83
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:06,021
I'd rather continue
to shadow you.

84
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,456
I already know how
to clear out earwax and...

85
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,758
Go with them.

86
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,661
43-year-old male,

87
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:13,329
hand and arm caught
in a meat grinder.

88
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:15,331
- Bay 6.
- Okay. Got it?

89
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:16,898
We got it from here. Thanks.

90
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:21,270
Can you move your fingers?

91
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:22,605
I-I'm not sure.

92
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:23,773
Get a BP cuff on his other arm.

93
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,341
How'd it happen?

94
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:27,510
- I manage a food processing factory.
- You got it upside down.

95
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,944
I was demonstrating
how to clean the meat grinder

96
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,148
when an apprentice butcher

97
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,483
decided to turn
the breaker back on.

98
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,319
I hate new employees.

99
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:37,852
Worse than worthless.

100
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,657
Oh, my God.

101
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,793
Get me an ortho-powered
driver with a 4 millimeter hex head.

102
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,828
Get the double-action rongeur

103
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,497
so you can use it
to pull off the grill.

104
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,547
Just skin and flesh.
I don't see any bone.

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,815
Oh, thank God.

106
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,987
He's just... new.

107
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,401
Thanks for the walk invite.

108
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:26,868
I keep planning to exercise,

109
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,238
but then I wake up feeling
like a broken-down old boxer.

110
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:30,773
Ugh, I know the feeling,

111
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,208
and I didn't even
go through childbirth.

112
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:33,676
Babies are damn hard work.

113
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,411
Yeah. Damn hard. Thank you.

114
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,447
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

115
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,183
I'm creating a living trust

116
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,585
to make sure
Eden's taken care of.

117
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:45,121
And I'd like to name you
and Shaun as Eden's guardians

118
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:46,288
if Park and I die.

119
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:47,423
Wow. I'm...

120
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:50,693
I'm flattered.

121
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:52,695
You and Shaun
are great together.

122
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:56,866
And given Eden's special needs,
you guys are a perfect choice.

123
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,435
Thank you.

124
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,237
That...

125
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,772
That means a lot to me.

126
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,141
And I'll talk to Shaun
about it tonight.

127
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:14,884
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,455
It's okay.

129
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:22,023
I got a few minutes till the
patient's sedatives take effect.

130
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:25,261
I've tried every antiemetic
I could find.

131
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,563
Even started wearing
this here wristband,

132
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,131
but nothing works.

133
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:34,068
I was a cop for 15 years
before med school.

134
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,472
Saw a lot of rookies lose
their lunch at a crime scene,

135
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,407
but never met one
who didn't get used to it.

136
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,941
It'll become
just part of the routine.

137
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:43,077
I just got to get
through this rotation.

138
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,650
Hey, if you want to sit
this one out, I'm fine.

139
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,553
You can hit the skills lab,
practice suturing.

140
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:54,723
Before I went to med school,

141
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:55,925
I was a D-1 tackle.

142
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,261
Two most important things
I learned is,

143
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,597
it's better
to give than to receive,

144
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,932
and quitters never win.

145
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:06,669
Good.

146
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:07,937
Then let's go save a hand.

147
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,884
What are you doing?

148
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,587
I mean, besides forgetting about
this morning's board meeting.

149
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,655
I didn't forget about
this morning's board meeting.

150
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,157
So we're still doing this?

151
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,459
No, I didn't skip
the meeting to prank you.

152
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,528
I did it to be here
for the delivery.

153
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:35,364
A gift for both of us.

154
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:36,265
Ta-da!

155
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,703
You prefer
to stay in your office, right?

156
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,371
And I'm certainly
not going to leave the clinic.

157
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,107
So I thought, why not convert
the president's office

158
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:46,375
into the president's lounge?

159
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,576
Sorry.

160
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,811
Co-Presidents' Lounge.

161
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,546
Oh, might as well
add a putting green

162
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,114
and a wine cellar
while you're at it.

163
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:54,149
I work better with a pool table.

164
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,551
Great.

165
00:06:55,684 --> 00:06:57,920
The board had a list of issues
they want addressed ASAP,

166
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,688
and since I <i>actually</i>
attended the meeting,

167
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:00,990
I get to divvy them up.

168
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:03,993
Your half.

169
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:09,498
He's a cutie.

170
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:10,666
He's a moron.

171
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:13,335
When I'm fantasizing
about him tonight,

172
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,205
I'm not gonna be picturing him
helping me study for bio-chem.

173
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:19,008
Uh, that is not something
we needed to know.

174
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,074
He's kind of got
a Peter Parker vibe,

175
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,944
which is exactly my type.

176
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,078
How about you guys?
What's your type?

177
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:26,815
Uh, we should
probably just focus.

178
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,784
I bet you like tall women.

179
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,519
- Uh-huh.
- Uh...

180
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:35,925
I like sweet, handsome,
caring, and, yes, tall <i>men.</i>

181
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,526
You're gay?

182
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,194
Right on.
Top or bottom?

183
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,529
Oh, wow. Charlie...

184
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:44,065
you're not in your med-school
study group, okay?

185
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,801
That is an inappropriate
question for a co-worker.

186
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,770
You could be fired.

187
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,138
Employers have to consider

188
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,873
my neurodiverse
communication style.

189
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,942
No one should be forced
to change who they are

190
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,543
to be considered
more professional.

191
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,812
Well, I'd suggest
checking in with HR.

192
00:07:56,946 --> 00:08:00,416
They may have a different idea
of reasonable accommodations.

193
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:03,118
People at work talk about
their relationships all the time.

194
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:04,653
Asking about someone's
relationship's

195
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:05,821
a little different
than asking about

196
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,389
their preferred sexual position.

197
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,024
The expression doesn't
refer solely to sexual positions.

198
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:10,091
No rib fractures.

199
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,062
But...

200
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,565
what is that?

201
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:22,605
The bleeding's stopped.

202
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:24,139
The blades are acting
like a tourniquet.

203
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:25,874
We need to get this hand out

204
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,676
before his fingers get necrotic.

205
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,913
What if we pull his arm while
manually turning the blades in reverse?

206
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,915
Could grind up
whatever's stuck even more.

207
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,083
We have to cut the machine open.

208
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:37,353
How? The Jaws of Life
are way too big,

209
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,922
and a saw could cut his arm
or overheat the metal.

210
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,224
Not if you irrigate
with cold saline as I work.

211
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:44,093
I'll go just deep enough
to weaken the metal,

212
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,494
and then we'll break it apart
with a rib spreader.

213
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,030
Brilliant.

214
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,465
Get me an ortho oscillating saw
with a metal cutting blade.

215
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:57,406
It's a very irregular shape.

216
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:01,944
Could be an intramural abscess
in his esophagus.

217
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:04,580
The contrast enhancement
wouldn't be so uniform.

218
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,449
Yes, that is true.

219
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,318
What about an esophageal cancer?

220
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,286
That would be unusual.

221
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,288
- He is very young and...
- A nonsmoker.

222
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,093
I'm confident
we can excise the mass,

223
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:20,295
but we need to do
an esophagogastroduodenoscopy

224
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:21,964
and biopsy first.

225
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:23,832
I have no idea what that is,
but it sounds awesome.

226
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,000
Please do it now.

227
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,506
Uh, Charlie?

228
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,974
Hmm?

229
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:33,776
Uh, it might be better trying
to be your authentic self

230
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,644
without repeatedly
interrupting your boss.

231
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:41,151
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.
I appreciate the advice.

232
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:46,955
I think you may need
to go deeper.

233
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,291
I can't risk popping through
and cutting the radial.

234
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:50,926
Park, he's bleeding again.

235
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,163
Should you do a vascular cut
down and temporary ligation?

236
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:54,563
No, it's been too long already.

237
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:55,731
We need to get this thing open.

238
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,104
- Come on. Give me a hand.
- I-I can't.

239
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:03,005
Yes, you can. Just close your
eyes. Pretend you're at the gym.

240
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,673
- Come on.
- Come on.

241
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,042
All right.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

242
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,613
Keep going. It's working.

243
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:13,082
- Pull, pull, pull!
- It's loose!

244
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:18,188
Lap sponges!

245
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,158
Severe contamination
of hand and forearm,

246
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,559
arteries are trashed.

247
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:26,395
Major vascular gaps,
radius and ulna are crushed.

248
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:27,730
Get the OR prepped.

249
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:29,398
We're gonna have to amputate it.

250
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,268
Advancing down
the esophageal lumen.

251
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:36,505
Do you have a boyfriend?

252
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:37,506
Yes.

253
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:41,211
Approaching
the gastroesophageal junction.

254
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:42,778
Is he tall?

255
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,013
Can we talk about this later?

256
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,216
Or not at all.

257
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,784
Doesn't make sense.

258
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,921
Dr. Kalu thinks
I'm being too intrusive,

259
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,623
but I'm actually trying
to establish a rapport.

260
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,492
I wasn't talking
about him or you.

261
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,294
I meant the mass.

262
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,262
It's gone.

263
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,440
This doesn't make sense.

264
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:10,007
That's exactly
what Dr. Wolke said.

265
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,943
The esophageal mass
was definitely on the X-ray.

266
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,446
And on the neck CT.

267
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:16,280
But nowhere on the endoscopy.

268
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,182
- Maybe we should repeat all the tests?
- No.

269
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:20,385
- We could...
- I can't concentrate

270
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:22,619
if you keep interrupting me.

271
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:23,754
I didn't interrupt you.

272
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,656
I asked you a question.
You said no,

273
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,191
so I attempted
to make a suggestion,

274
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,326
then you interrupted me.

275
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,695
Could you please just be quiet?

276
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:34,898
Okay.

277
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,869
Okay.

278
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,712
He's disoriented
and slurring his speech.

279
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:50,981
Phipps, do you know
where you are right now?

280
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:54,284
Um, I go
to San Jose State University.

281
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,687
He is disoriented,
but no longer slurring.

282
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,888
- It was worse before.
- Okay.

283
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,089
Squeeze my fingers.

284
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,193
- Right-side weakness.
- We should prep a bolus dose of TPA.

285
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,029
No, we should not do that.

286
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,431
Can you wiggle your toes?

287
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:07,865
But if he's having a stroke...

288
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,401
His speech is improving,

289
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,702
which makes a transient
ischemic attack more likely.

290
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,338
And you ordered a nurse
to prep an unindicated

291
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:14,938
and very risky medication.

292
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,908
- I didn't order her, just making a suggestion.
- Get out.

293
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,677
- What?
- You refuse to acknowledge you've made a mistake,

294
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,013
which wastes my time
and endangers our patient.

295
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:25,316
Please leave
the patient's room now.

296
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,287
We need a head CT-CTA
to confirm it's a TIA

297
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:32,022
and not a brain bleed or tumor.

298
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:35,125
Checking pupils.

299
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,269
Ligation and sectioning
of the viable arteries,

300
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:46,837
veins, and nerves complete.

301
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,005
Charriere.

302
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:55,846
I'll make the bone cuts
as distal as possible

303
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:57,114
- on the forearm.
- Dr. Park.

304
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,951
I gotta leave.

305
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,559
Maybe he should
sit this one out.

306
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,260
Bit of a worst-case scenario
for him.

307
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,296
I gave him the opportunity.

308
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,565
He turned me down.

309
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:24,509
Have you gotten Morgan's
fecal-sample fridge installed?

310
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,710
I thought the idea
was to divide and conquer.

311
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:29,146
You do your half
of the honey-do list,

312
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,013
and I do mine.

313
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,616
Yes, but just FYI,

314
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:34,118
Morgan needs
the fridge installed

315
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,321
before she starts screening
for the IBS trial.

316
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:37,455
Yes, I'm aware.

317
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:38,956
Then I assume you're also aware

318
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:40,958
that it needs
a new electric panel,

319
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:43,394
and that Gail has put a freeze
on all facility upgrades.

320
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,696
- Not my first rodeo.
- Okay.

321
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:47,164
And the other stuff on the list?

322
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:49,800
I plan to ignore.
You should do the same.

323
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,769
- You're advising I ignore the board?
- Yes.

324
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:55,839
Much of their complaints
are trivial in nature.

325
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,309
They'll either work themselves
out or disappear completely,

326
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,711
which is good for us, because
then we can do our actual jobs.

327
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,514
The current board
isn't as passive

328
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:03,814
as the one
you're used to dealing with.

329
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:06,417
The current board
has some newbies, yes,

330
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:08,620
and they're very anxious
to engage

331
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,888
and nitpick
over every little silly thing.

332
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,856
But you know what?
They'll learn. They always do.

333
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:15,527
I have
an actual patient waiting.

334
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,700
Are we going in for a head CT?

335
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,669
Doctors Wolke and Kalu are.

336
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,707
You shouldn't have raised
your voice to me like you did.

337
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,577
I spoke with an urgency

338
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,579
that was appropriate
to the situation.

339
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:36,447
It may be appropriate to some,

340
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:37,781
but as a person on the spectrum,

341
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:40,017
I don't do well when shouted at.

342
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,753
I did not shout.

343
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,054
I'm letting you know
the parameters

344
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:46,156
for communicating
with me effectively.

345
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,891
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

346
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,498
I'll go join
Doctors Wolke and Kalu.

347
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,222
No.

348
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:55,265
You will go to the skills lab

349
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,067
and study stroke protocols
and procedures

350
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,403
for handling a TIA.

351
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,484
I didn't do anything wrong.

352
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,388
We didn't have to
debride as much as I thought.

353
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,524
<i>And there's more than enough
palmar and dorsal flaps</i>

354
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:18,691
<i>to close the stump.</i>

355
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,560
- <i>Checking my work?</i>
- No.

356
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,462
<i>Just rubbernecking.</i>

357
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,996
<i>It's not every day
you get to see</i>

358
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,333
<i>a meat-grinder
partial radial amputation.</i>

359
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,534
<i>Thankfully.</i>

360
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,935
But if I was checking,

361
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:32,339
now that I have a better view
of the injured area,

362
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,773
the distal forearm
vessels and nerves

363
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:36,742
are actually better
than I expected.

364
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,177
<i>If you could bridge those gaps,</i>

365
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,980
<i>I'm wondering if you might
be able to reattach it.</i>

366
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:42,781
Ischemic time
is less than eight hours,

367
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:45,918
and that's best case,
which this isn't.

368
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,887
<i>Mm, not if there's
a blood supply.</i>

369
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,955
<i>You could graft it to his ankle,</i>

370
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,657
<i>keep it perfused</i>

371
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,593
<i>while you prep the forearm
stump for replantation.</i>

372
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:54,994
You could really do that?

373
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,029
We've built new ears
on forearms.

374
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,131
Wrist anatomy
is a lot more complex.

375
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,635
And if we spread
an infection to his leg,

376
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:04,371
he could end up losing
two limbs instead of just one.

377
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:07,139
<i>We could reduce the risk by
planting antibiotic beads in the wounds.</i>

378
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:08,341
Yeah, but not eliminate it.

379
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:10,843
<i>Your call.</i>

380
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,482
Prep and drape his left ankle.

381
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,716
<i>Want a second set of hands?</i>

382
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,553
<i>Absolutely.</i>

383
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:21,754
<i>But don't you
have a hospital to run?</i>

384
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:23,657
<i>That's what
co-presidents are for.</i>

385
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:28,727
CT-CTA doesn't show
any blockages

386
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,363
or atherosclerosis.

387
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:35,502
I'm starting to think this
might not be a stroke or a TIA.

388
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:37,002
The neuro symptoms didn't start

389
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,038
until after the esophageal mass
disappeared.

390
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,907
Uh, not true.

391
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,644
No, he came to the ER
with neurological symptoms,

392
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,379
a headache, and hearing loss.

393
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:47,980
Which isn't surprising,

394
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,783
given he let his idiot friends
slap him upside the head.

395
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:51,951
Mm.

396
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:53,152
Speaking of idiots,

397
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,688
you should go
to the confirmation party.

398
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,823
Jerome mentioned it.

399
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:00,594
It's one party.
You might actually have fun.

400
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,597
Look, you love Jerome, right?

401
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:06,633
Right. So what makes you think
you wouldn't like his brothers?

402
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,636
They play hockey.

403
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:10,970
Didn't Jerome play hockey?

404
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,405
Yes, as a kid,

405
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,608
and not in something
called the Beer League.

406
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,875
This isn't about hockey or
beer, is it? You're just afraid.

407
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,613
I am not afraid.
I'm actually... I'm very busy.

408
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:20,913
Or you're scared
they won't like you.

409
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,451
Or that it's the next big step
towards something

410
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:25,719
you're still not sure you want.

411
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:30,122
Thank you, Esther Perel,
but I know exactly what I want.

412
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,224
- Okay.
- Okay.

413
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:32,726
And I have it.

414
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,462
Well, maybe you should consider

415
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,597
making some sacrifices
to hold on to it.

416
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:47,540
Had a nice walk
with Morgan today.

417
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:49,775
She's preparing a living trust

418
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:53,647
and would like us to be Eden's
guardians if she and Park die.

419
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,014
Okay.

420
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:56,849
"Okay" you're fine
with that plan,

421
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:58,117
or "okay,"
you didn't hear a word I said

422
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,487
because you're still
obsessing about Charlie?

423
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,555
I'm fine with Morgan's plan.

424
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,624
I was thinking about Charlie,

425
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,293
not obsessing.

426
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,595
I can't work with her
constantly interrupting me.

427
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:10,697
She's a student, Shaun.
She's excited.

428
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:11,830
She's enthusiastic.

429
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,635
Why does it matter
if she is enthusiastic?

430
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,470
She makes a lot of mistakes.

431
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:20,139
Well, now's the time to make
mistakes. She's a med student.

432
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,309
Charlie refuses to admit
she's made them,

433
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:23,842
which means
she cannot learn from them.

434
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:25,345
Are you sure about that?

435
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:26,713
Maybe she's embarrassed.

436
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:28,381
Maybe you're being
a little bit too rigid.

437
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:30,483
You know, give her a chance
to work things out.

438
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,619
I have not been rigid.

439
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:35,187
You're being rigid right now.

440
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,325
Why don't you try being
a little more patient? Right?

441
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,563
I will...
try to be more patient.

442
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,164
Great. Let's eat.

443
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:54,049
Ulnar to posterior tibial
artery anastomosis complete.

444
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,221
Sutured the main dorsal
to the saphenous vein

445
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,292
and created
a fasciocutaneous flap

446
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,019
to provide temporary coverage.

447
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:03,131
Great.
Then I think we're ready.

448
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:04,897
Releasing the clamps.

449
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:18,398
Awesome.

450
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,524
Totally awesome.

451
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:29,211
I understand you have a bit of a
medical mystery on your hands.

452
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,480
Yes, it is very interesting.

453
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:32,680
How's your new med student?

454
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,217
She talks too much,

455
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,652
refuses to acknowledge mistakes,

456
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,220
and doesn't like
to read textbooks.

457
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,854
That does sound
like a challenge.

458
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:42,757
Dr. Glassman said
I should just be patient

459
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,326
and give her time to adjust.

460
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,361
Wrong.

461
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,863
Glassman's favorite way
to deal with a problem

462
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,033
is to avoid it and then hope
someone else solves it.

463
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,068
You need to tell her precisely
what you want her to do.

464
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,103
I have done that.

465
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,605
Well, do it again.

466
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,840
She's young and faces
communication challenges

467
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,776
that you need
to be sensitive to.

468
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,845
All her recommendations say
she's smart but stubborn,

469
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,649
which, if managed properly,
could be a great combination.

470
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:08,883
You of all people
should know that.

471
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,919
Uh, why should <i>I</i> know that?

472
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,392
Because you also arrived here
smart but stubborn.

473
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,028
You've become a great surgeon,
and she will be, too.

474
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:22,431
But for now, she's like a puppy
that needs to be trained

475
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:24,333
before all the bad habits
take hold.

476
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,767
So don't be patient,
be proactive.

477
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,708
Hmm.

478
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,910
There's no cyanosis,
severe edema, or venous stasis.

479
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:37,679
Looks great.

480
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:40,682
- It looks gross.
- Don't worry.

481
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,284
As soon as we clean up
all the damage to your arm,

482
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,818
it'll go back
to where it belongs.

483
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,121
Good, because
I'm gonna need both hands

484
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:47,456
to wring that butcher's neck.

485
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:49,291
Dr. Park?

486
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,636
What's wrong?

487
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:03,739
There's some cellulitis
at the forearm.

488
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,374
But don't worry.
You're on antibiotics,

489
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,442
and we'll watch it closely
until your next surgery.

490
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,248
Sorry. I'm running late.

491
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,250
It's like packing for
the Lewis and Clark expedition

492
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:16,817
every time
I leave the house now.

493
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:18,453
No worries.
I got you an Americano.

494
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:19,521
Thanks.

495
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,657
Shaun agreed. We're good to go.

496
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:23,659
One thing...

497
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,793
I named you and Shaun
as guardians

498
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:28,463
if both Park and I die,
but also if just I die.

499
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,167
Why wouldn't Park
be her guardian?

500
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:33,968
Don't tell me you guys
are on the rocks again.

501
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:35,604
No, things are great.

502
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,972
Actually, better than great.
They're fantastic.

503
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:39,675
So what's the problem?

504
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,109
The last thing I want

505
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:43,111
is for Eden to end up
with an ex-boyfriend if I die.

506
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:45,347
We've only been back together
a couple months,

507
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,947
so I'll revisit
the plan in a year.

508
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,550
Okay.
I'll let Shaun know tonight.

509
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,652
No, Shaun can't keep a secret.

510
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:53,921
I haven't told Park,
and I'm not going to.

511
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:55,190
Are you insane?

512
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:57,159
You can't lie to Park,
and I can't lie to Shaun.

513
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:59,127
It's not a lie. It's a secret.

514
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:00,895
And every marriage has them.

515
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,731
Uh, sure.

516
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,832
Like how much I spend
on hair color

517
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:05,900
and how often I use
his toothbrush,

518
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,369
but this is too big.

519
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:09,271
No, it's a tiny,
temporary detail

520
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:10,971
that's meaningless unless I die
in the next 12 months,

521
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:12,107
which isn't gonna happen.

522
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,744
Please, just take a few days,
think about it.

523
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,877
That's all I'm asking.

524
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:21,817
I'm not gonna
change my mind, but okay.

525
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:25,487
Head CT looks normal,

526
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,954
but the abdominal images

527
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:28,956
showed acalculous cholecystitis.

528
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:32,594
Hmm. That wouldn't explain
his neurological symptoms.

529
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,096
But it does explain the fever

530
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,098
and the abdominal pain
he has now.

531
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,067
We got another abdominal CT.

532
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,036
Gallbladder's dilated
with extreme wall thickening.

533
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:42,571
Looks like
it's about to rupture.

534
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:43,839
Doesn't make sense.

535
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:47,175
His most severe symptoms
have been neurological,

536
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:48,577
and neither the bruise
on his chest

537
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,846
nor the mass in the esophagus
was near the gallbladder.

538
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:56,251
Whatever the cause,

539
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:57,985
his gallbladder
needs to be removed.

540
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,854
Get him prepped.

541
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:04,126
Charlie?

542
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,862
We need to have a talk.

543
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,498
Please have a seat.

544
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:10,399
I'd rather stand.

545
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:11,867
When I'm nervous,

546
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,369
sitting makes me feel
uncomfortably constrained.

547
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,271
Okay.

548
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:19,441
You are still a student,

549
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:22,244
so it is normal for you
to be making mistakes.

550
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:24,079
I haven't made any mistakes.

551
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:25,614
You ordered a nurse
to prep an incorrect

552
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:27,682
and potentially
dangerous medication.

553
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:29,584
I didn't order her.
I made a suggestion.

554
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,753
And you talk too much,

555
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,702
often about things you shouldn't

556
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,457
and other times
when you shouldn't be talking...

557
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,384
I learn more
by discussing things

558
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:39,678
rather than reading a textbook
or attending a lecture.

559
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,960
I do not lecture,

560
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:44,032
and I can't do my job

561
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,056
if you are
always interrupting...

562
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:48,330
- At times, my speech pattern can be..
- You just did it again.

563
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:49,283
So did you.

564
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:52,267
Compulsive speech is a
characteristic of our neurodiversity.

565
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,718
Please s-stop talking.

566
00:23:54,743 --> 00:23:57,646
I am being proactive.

567
00:23:57,671 --> 00:24:01,494
I have precisely explained
my expectations.

568
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:05,287
You can't order me to do
something I'm incapable of.

569
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:06,546
I have a disability,
and the law...

570
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,697
I am trying to help you. Okay?

571
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,449
I... understand

572
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:20,416
that ASD is considered
a disability.

573
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:26,842
But I also know that you are
capable of being silent.

574
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:28,443
If you want to remain
on this case,

575
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,779
that is what I expect you to do.

576
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,814
You are to observe
and nothing else.

577
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:34,182
Do you understand?

578
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:37,452
Yes.

579
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:40,655
Good.

580
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:48,251
Now you can go join Dr. Wolke
and Dr. Kalu in the OR.

581
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:01,112
We've got adequate debridement

582
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:02,346
of the distal forearm stump.

583
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,848
This is gonna work.

584
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:05,049
Good call.

585
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,712
Hubank, any thoughts
on what suture to use

586
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:11,163
for our arterial anastomosis?

587
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:13,190
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

588
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:14,458
<i>Take your time.</i>

589
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:16,494
Look closely at the angle
we cut the vessels at.

590
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,163
I guess you could
suture the ends

591
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,698
with a 4-0 Prolene

592
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:22,867
<i>using an end-to-side formation.</i>

593
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,602
Nice idea.

594
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:27,304
End-to-end anastomosis
with parachute technique

595
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,906
would work even better.

596
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,514
I'm Dr. Reznick.

597
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:38,249
I assume you know that Park
and I are in a relationship.

598
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,017
- Actually, no. I didn't...
- Don't lie.

599
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:42,686
I know how fast the gossip
gets out around here.

600
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:45,856
How's Park as a professor?

601
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,691
He's awesome.

602
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:49,727
Intuitive and supportive
without being patronizing.

603
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,961
Stop.

604
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:53,097
The whole gentle-giant thing
is lost on me.

605
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,467
What I respect is totally
brutal, blunt honesty.

606
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,536
Think of me like Bill Belichick

607
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:59,103
but meaner and with better hair.

608
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,175
You're right. I lied.

609
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,779
I was actually told by a
bunch of people on my first day

610
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:10,714
about the relationship
that you and Park had.

611
00:26:10,848 --> 00:26:13,150
I was also told how you broke up

612
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:14,553
then moved back in
with one another

613
00:26:14,685 --> 00:26:16,287
before breaking up again,

614
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,721
then got back together recently

615
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,290
because Park wanted to help you

616
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:22,159
take care of the baby
that you wanted to adopt

617
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:23,494
but were too overwhelmed
to do it yourself

618
00:26:23,627 --> 00:26:25,496
while also running
the clinical trials.

619
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:29,467
But I wasn't lying about Park
being an awesome professor.

620
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,302
He's been pretty patient
and supportive,

621
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:33,871
despite the fact that
I don't want to be a surgeon,

622
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:35,206
and I faint or hurl

623
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,141
at the sight
of any amount of blood.

624
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,677
But he's a great guy.

625
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,514
And I'm sure he'll be
a great dad or stepdad

626
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:44,516
or whatever the label is

627
00:26:44,648 --> 00:26:46,050
that you need him to be for you.

628
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,653
Is that blunt enough?

629
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,858
Yes. Thank you.

630
00:26:57,094 --> 00:26:58,329
But careful.

631
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:00,498
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

632
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:07,138
Freeing up the last
attachments to the liver.

633
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:08,873
Using ultrasonic coagulator

634
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:10,808
for hemostasis
on the cystic plate.

635
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:15,514
What about an atypical
presentation of lupus?

636
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,448
ANA and ESR are all normal.

637
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:19,650
That's why I said atypical.

638
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,152
I mean,
what else could cause symptoms

639
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,020
in the esophagus,
brain, and gallbladder?

640
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,793
Dr. Kalu,
please irrigate

641
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:31,630
and lead the wound closure.

642
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:35,534
- 0 Vicryl sutures on a long needle driver.
- -Can I feel it?

643
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,768
Sorry. I know
I'm not supposed to be talking,

644
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:41,472
but I've never felt
a live organ before.

645
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,974
It needs to go to pathology.

646
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,410
And please
don't distract Dr. Kalu.

647
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,046
Oh, she's not distracting me.

648
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,282
It's just gonna sit in the pathology
fridge for a few hours anyway.

649
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,319
Do it quietly.

650
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:57,656
Thank you,
Dr. Murphy!

651
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:01,725
Sponge here so I can see better.

652
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:04,663
Need another 0 Vicryl suture.

653
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:09,300
And I'll take
the Metzenbaum scissors.

654
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,202
That's enough.
Put it back now.

655
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:13,572
Wait. Just give me a... Ow!

656
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:17,841
I think a needle
got left in the organ.

657
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:19,678
That's not possible.

658
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,547
We never suture
inside the gallbladder.

659
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,215
I know I felt... felt it.

660
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:26,717
Ow! Okay. There is
something sharp in here.

661
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,954
Uh, maybe it's an edge
of a gallstone?

662
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:34,693
I'm coming.

663
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:38,095
Okay.

664
00:28:40,998 --> 00:28:43,234
There is something protruding.

665
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:44,703
Small forceps.

666
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:57,815
Is it a hair?

667
00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:58,949
No.

668
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:01,485
It's a metal wire.

669
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:08,759
Inside the gallbladder?
How is that even possible?

670
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:11,563
It was definitely
not part of a surgical tool.

671
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:13,430
Well, I read a case
a few years ago.

672
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,100
A patient got a metal wire
from a barbecue grill brush

673
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,768
lodged in his intestines.

674
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:18,936
When we were doing
surgical prep,

675
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:20,639
Phipps said the last thing
he'd eaten

676
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:22,773
was a cheeseburger
at his frat's barbecue.

677
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:24,775
The disappearing mass
in his esophagus

678
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:26,645
could've been caused
by that wire lodged there

679
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:28,279
before it traversed
the stomach wall

680
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:30,114
and ended up in the gallbladder.

681
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,850
That would be amazing.

682
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:35,520
It wouldn't explain
his neurological issues.

683
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:38,389
Well, that could still
be from the slaps.

684
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:43,127
But either way,
we never would've noticed it

685
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,962
without Charlie's
curiosity, so...

686
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:47,097
Yeah. Nice catch.

687
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,769
It was more of an accident
than a catch, but thank you.

688
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:07,493
We need the strongest
magnet we have. Stat!

689
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,959
What are you doing?

690
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:16,293
I'm teaching Steve
how to run the table

691
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:17,961
while, simultaneously,
Barry and I

692
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:19,296
are trying to figure out
how to lower

693
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,398
the overhead cost of the clinic.

694
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:22,691
Try those.

695
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:28,773
"The poop fridge
equals presidential priority"?

696
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:30,508
You see, Steve? I told you,

697
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:32,343
alliteration comes off
as pompous.

698
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:34,746
He prefers "poop"
to "fecal samples."

699
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:36,980
I'm so glad
you're enjoying yourself.

700
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:39,883
Meanwhile, Gail is coming down
on me for things I didn't do.

701
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,318
Hey, it's my signature
on the thing.

702
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:42,886
If Gail doesn't like it,
she can come to me.

703
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,589
She knows you don't
listen to her.

704
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:48,593
So, now, every time she has
a problem, she comes to me.

705
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,328
Well, I can think of
one way to solve that problem.

706
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:52,896
Aaron, I don't have time
for these games.

707
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,699
You don't have time
because you're constantly

708
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,634
trying to placate
the damn board.

709
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,904
All they want is to feel
recognized and respected.

710
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:02,039
All they want,
they don't know it,

711
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:03,340
but what they really want
is a well-run,

712
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:04,676
top-flight hospital.

713
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,443
Well, all Gail really wants now

714
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:09,346
is a full audit of all expenses
for the past year.

715
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,815
Well, that's a colossal
waste of time.

716
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:12,550
Well, I agree.

717
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,386
And after
a 30-minute discussion,

718
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,421
I got Gail to agree as well.

719
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:20,023
This division of labor
isn't working,

720
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:22,652
so from now on,
you can deal with Gail.

721
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:24,179
Fine. Send her on over.

722
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:26,389
Just tell her to bring cash.
We don't take markers here.

723
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:29,066
He's an ass.

724
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,808
Not an ass.

725
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:38,612
What are you gonna do with that?

726
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,205
It may be slightly painful,

727
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:42,516
but it's much safer
than another surgery.

728
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:45,351
Open wide and say, "Ahh."

729
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,020
Ahh.

730
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:07,173
That was in my tonsil?

731
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:10,811
Yes, it caused an infection
and fluid build-up in your ear

732
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:12,345
and irritated
your carotid artery,

733
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:15,848
which caused
the neurological symptoms.

734
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:19,985
You shouldn't ever clean a
cooking surface with a wire brush,

735
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,188
or let someone slap you,

736
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:25,358
or shoot you
with a foam shotgun slug.

737
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:27,159
That is so cool.

738
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:29,663
Yes. It is.

739
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,736
I can't wait
to get back to work.

740
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:37,336
I wouldn't rush it.

741
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:39,606
It's gonna take time
and plenty of physical therapy

742
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,107
to get your function back.

743
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,577
I don't mean so I can work.

744
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,345
I mean so I can
fire that damn butcher.

745
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:53,453
The new CTs are all clear.

746
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:56,423
No more wires floating around.

747
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:57,824
And you might
want to take it easy

748
00:32:57,957 --> 00:32:59,158
with the frat parties
for a while.

749
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:03,028
I'm actually
not that big a partier.

750
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,030
I grew up an only child,
so I always wanted brothers,

751
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:06,433
and now I have like 50 of them.

752
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:11,638
They've helped me through
all sorts of stuff.

753
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,743
A lot of the crazier stuff
they do isn't my thing.

754
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:18,377
Um...

755
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:20,913
But I feel like I owe it
to them to participate.

756
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:24,885
To be there for them
like they were for me.

757
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:27,454
That's very generous of you.

758
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:37,898
You're doing great.

759
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:40,634
No, I'm not.

760
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,234
Can't even watch a surgery

761
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,604
from another room
without dry-heaving.

762
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:45,938
That patient would've
bled out in the ER

763
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:47,674
if you hadn't helped
break open the grinder.

764
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:49,810
Yeah. I make a great crowbar.

765
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,947
Surgery is always a team effort.

766
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:58,919
I'm happy to have you
on my team.

767
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:05,926
Dr. Park...

768
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:28,949
Dr. Murphy, can I talk to you?

769
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:31,918
I am trying to get home
to put Steve down.

770
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:33,319
This won't take long.

771
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,522
I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I was with you,

772
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,924
how you were able to move
that wire fragment

773
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:39,225
from the tonsil without surgery.

774
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:40,527
It was very ingenious.

775
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,795
And I also wanted to thank you

776
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:43,530
for letting me
observe you in surgery.

777
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:44,631
I learned a whole lot.

778
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,534
Oh. That's good.

779
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,001
And you're welcome.

780
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:54,306
When I found the first wire
in the gallbladder,

781
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:56,543
it saved both the patient
and us a lot of time.

782
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,449
That is true.

783
00:35:02,582 --> 00:35:04,885
That's a big contribution from a medical student,
don't you think?

784
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,756
I believe your intense curiosity

785
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,525
and attention to organization

786
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:14,193
will one day make you
an excellent pathologist.

787
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:17,430
I don't want to be
a pathologist.

788
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,699
I understand,

789
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,868
but given your aversion
to textbooks,

790
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,369
your extreme impatience...

791
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:24,538
I'm not impatient.

792
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:26,740
I'm an assertive,
dedicated, hard worker.

793
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:29,709
And your refusal to acknowledge
and learn from your mistakes...

794
00:35:29,843 --> 00:35:31,645
I just want to be a surgeon.

795
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:33,713
Like you.

796
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,218
Oh. You're nothing like me.

797
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:43,690
And I don't think
you should ever be a surgeon.

798
00:35:57,303 --> 00:35:59,539
Hey, about to head out
to Elizabeth's party.

799
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:00,674
I just wanted to say goodbye.

800
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:03,543
Should be home by 11:00.

801
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,048
Wait!

802
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,053
I'm coming with you.

803
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:30,704
Sure this elevator's
big enough for the both of us?

804
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:33,238
- I'm not sure the hospital is.
- Well, that's fine.

805
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:35,709
I'll resign my share
of the co-presidency.

806
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:38,078
Not if I beat you to it.

807
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:43,683
Hey, Charlie.

808
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:49,656
Are you getting out
or just taking a ride?

809
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:53,158
Charlie, are you okay?

810
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,695
No.

811
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:05,005
Charlie should not be upset.

812
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:08,008
I told her she would make
an excellent pathologist.

813
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,111
Well, you've only worked
with her for two weeks.

814
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:13,480
And isn't she hoping
to be a surgeon?

815
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:16,116
You said that
I should be proactive.

816
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,118
Proactive?

817
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:20,820
That's not proactive.
That's hurtful.

818
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,388
Maybe it's not
what you meant, but...

819
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:24,124
I was telling the truth.

820
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:25,825
I tried to be patient,
like you said,

821
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,127
but that also did not work.

822
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:31,765
We gave you
some conflicting advice,

823
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:33,633
which clearly
didn't help matters.

824
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:37,537
So maybe now, together,
we can find a better strategy.

825
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,640
Charlie has a unique
learning style...

826
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:41,975
Why do I need a strategy?

827
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:46,211
I am a good surgeon
and a good teacher.

828
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,481
Good teachers adjust
to their students, Shaun.

829
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:50,182
Maybe there's something
you could do.

830
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:51,918
Maybe there's something
you <i>should</i> do.

831
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:54,554
I have already made adjustments.

832
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:55,722
Okay. Make some more.

833
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:57,256
- Why?
- Why?

834
00:37:57,389 --> 00:37:58,858
- Because it's the...
- 'Cause she needs...

835
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:01,326
Because she needs them,
like you did.

836
00:38:01,461 --> 00:38:03,563
No one ever made things
easier for me.

837
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:06,533
Or went out of their way
to make accommodations for me.

838
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,902
Shaun.

839
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:11,805
I'm sure you believe that,
but that is simply not true.

840
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,943
Dr. Melendez
put me on scut work

841
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:19,112
and threatened to fire me.

842
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:21,915
Dr. Han transferred me
to pathology,

843
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:23,282
but I never gave up,

844
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,718
and I learned
how to accept criticism

845
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:26,186
and improve
my communication skills

846
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,954
in order
to become a good surgeon.

847
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,890
Han and Melendez,

848
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:34,694
and I'm sure many other people,
were wrong about you.

849
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:36,996
But that doesn't mean
you should treat Charlie...

850
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,100
I am not wrong about Charlie.

851
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:41,901
She should <i>not</i> be a surgeon.

852
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:42,869
You know what, Shaun?

853
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:44,838
You sound like Han now.

854
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:46,206
You're being unfair.

855
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,781
No.

856
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,218
I am an attending.

857
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:01,454
It is my decision

858
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:03,690
how to manage the medical
students on my cases.

859
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:07,794
I am going home now.

860
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:17,537
That went well.

861
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:21,241
Yeah.

862
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:24,244
Straight pool or 8 ball?

863
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:27,447
You can break.

864
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:30,850
Okay.

865
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:37,557
This is gonna be hilarious.

866
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,793
And from my favorite uncle,
Jerome,

867
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:42,095
and his adorable boyfriend,
Asher...

868
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:43,563
Is this what I think it is?

869
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:46,733
It is!

870
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,333
I love it!

871
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:50,103
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!
- I'm so glad you like it.

872
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:52,539
You bastard.

873
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:53,940
She's not wearing that
in this house.

874
00:39:54,073 --> 00:39:55,875
Yes, I am.

875
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,545
Go, Kings, baby!

876
00:39:58,678 --> 00:39:59,879
Yes! Whoo!

877
00:40:00,013 --> 00:40:01,380
You like them. We got it.

878
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:04,851
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

879
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:07,020
That was good! Yeah!

880
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,501
I told the attorney
that if I die,

881
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:23,303
I want you
to be Eden's guardian.

882
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:25,505
I know.
You already told me that.

883
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:27,502
I was lying.

884
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,687
But this time, I'm not.
