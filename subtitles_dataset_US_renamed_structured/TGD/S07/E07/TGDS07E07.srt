1
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,850
It might sound extreme, but
I'm pretty sure I'm in love.

2
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,654
I thought you had three
more nannies to interview.

3
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:28,680
I do, but Joelle walked
through the door,

4
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,421
and Steve immediately
stopped fussing.

5
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,467
She held him the whole time.

6
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,296
- Plus, she speaks Spanish.
- Bilingual bonus.

7
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:38,255
Right? And it will be so much
easier to go back to work

8
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,084
if I know Steve is
happy without me.

9
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,347
But Shaun has reservations.

10
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,132
There's a whole
process involving

11
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,090
spreadsheets, ranked voting.

12
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,527
Screw that. Good nannies
are hard to find.

13
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,747
You gotta pounce now.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,184
I can't just make that
decision without Shaun.

15
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,623
Your body is no longer
tolerating the dialysis,

16
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,037
and it is putting you at high
risk for stroke or cardiac damage.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,846
We need to start you on continuous
renal replacement therapy.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,979
"Continuous" meaning...?

19
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,720
Your mom has to stay here

20
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:11,593
until she receives
a kidney transplant.

21
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:14,551
I want you home, not living
in a hospital for years.

22
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,293
It won't be years.

23
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:18,991
CRRT is usually only
effective for about one week.

24
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,124
And then?

25
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,866
Complications will set in,

26
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:25,476
and without a
transplant, she will...

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,652
W-We're going to find a kidney.

28
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:31,003
The last two donors
weren't compatible.

29
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,919
Suki. Let's try
to stay positive.

30
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,965
How? The video I
posted last night

31
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,881
asking for donors only
has a few hundred views.

32
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,101
I don't have enough followers.

33
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,798
Come here, baby.

34
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,459
You have such a good heart.

35
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:58,814
We will place a catheter
in your right jugular vein

36
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,598
and start CRRT.

37
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,953
Looking forward to my
internal medicine rotation

38
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:09,520
with you, Dr. Reznick.
I really...

39
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:11,348
Each of the urine
samples needs a dip test.

40
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,263
Each of the stool samples
in the poop fridge

41
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,743
needs a fecal occult blood test.

42
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,179
Okay. I don't know how to...

43
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:19,704
Dip the pee. Dab the
poo. Send to the lab.

44
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,489
It's not rocket
science, MacGyver.

45
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:25,014
But first, that little blond girl,
Zelda, needs her TDAP vaccine.

46
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,147
And be careful. She's a biter.

47
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,848
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

48
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,285
I saw a video post
about a patient here.

49
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,200
Where do I go to
donate my kidney?

50
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:58,178
I was supposed to raise my
legs and slide on my butt.

51
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,875
Did you hear any
cracking sounds?

52
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,375
No. I didn't realize my leg was
hurt until we were driving home

53
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,271
and the adrenaline wore off.

54
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,316
Did that say 1.6 million views?

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,294
Turns out that when your
tech-savvy daughter helps you

56
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,147
with your bucket list,
you end up an influencer.

57
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,715
You've got a Grade 4
malignant spinal cord tumor.

58
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,282
How long did they give you?

59
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,589
About a year. 10 months ago.

60
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,678
Which is why I took
a break from college.

61
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,003
Spend as much time
with him as possible.

62
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,333
Make videos.

63
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,161
And memories.

64
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,685
Let's get x-rays and
a CT of the femur.

65
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,210
Get you back on your feet
as quick as possible.

66
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:33,343
Okay, if you'll lie down, we'll
get you down to radiology.

67
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,147
Jerome, do you mind just
unlocking that side?

68
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:37,781
Sorry. I need to leave.

69
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,791
Yes, hi. It's Aaron Glassman
checking in on those images.

70
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,098
Well, when...

71
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,839
They were supposed
to be ready today.

72
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:57,889
Fine. Can you have them call me
as soon as they come in, please?

73
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,021
Thank you.

74
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,114
Hi.

75
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,159
I'm Dr. Glassman.

76
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,731
I can just tell you
what's in there.

77
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,688
World-stopping headaches.

78
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,472
Over and over for
the past three years.

79
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,579
The only thing that helps is...

80
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,040
Oxycodone 20s.

81
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,434
Yeah.

82
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:22,262
And then, like a total
klutz, this morning,

83
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:27,005
I knocked my pill
bottle off the sink,

84
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,069
and they all fell
into the toilet.

85
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,138
Uh-huh.

86
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,186
Your prescribing
doctor is unreachable,

87
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,971
and it says here
you're drug-seeking.

88
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,236
After three years of oxy and
a revolving door of doctors,

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,586
that doesn't surprise
me. Forget it.

90
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,719
I'll find another doctor.

91
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,940
Like I said, total klutz.

92
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,028
Hang on, hang on.

93
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,423
- Sit.
- I don't have to listen to you.

94
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:58,167
I know. You don't. Please. Sit.

95
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:08,395
Follow my finger.
Look to your left.

96
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,440
All the way to the right.

97
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,486
You have a twitch in your
eye. Did you know that?

98
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:14,618
Is that a thing?

99
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,490
It might be a thing.
Tap your finger

100
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,795
and your thumb together.

101
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,231
There you go.

102
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:21,408
All the way to your
pinky and back.

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,411
How about a partial refill?

104
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,282
Tide me over? Just
until my doc gets back.

105
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,111
No pills, but I am
going to order you

106
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:31,722
a brain and spinal MRI.

107
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,294
Any family history
of kidney disease?

108
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,775
Not that I know
of. Mom's a saint,

109
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,690
and I'm adopted on
my father's side.

110
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,214
Under name, you
only put "Emmanuel."

111
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,433
Yeah, that's what
people call me.

112
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:48,609
Like Beyonce.

113
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,872
Hmm. Okay.

114
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,788
If the blood and tissue
type match with our patient,

115
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,505
we'll do a cross match
test and we'll see...

116
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,921
Yeah, we'll match.

117
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,005
Whenever I donate, they
tell me I have golden blood.

118
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,143
Rhnull?

119
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,840
That's the rarest
blood type on Earth.

120
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,668
Only 100 cases.

121
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,366
That makes you a
universal blood donor.

122
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,411
Birthplace just says Nazareth.

123
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,065
Is that in Pennsylvania?

124
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,283
No, the other one.

125
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:16,854
If the blood type tests
out, that's great news.

126
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,682
Almost done here.

127
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,902
Uh, you left occupation blank.

128
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:23,078
I'm a carpenter by trade,

129
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,515
but I really consider
myself a teacher.

130
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,474
- Dear Lord.
- Yeah, I go by many names.

131
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,432
Uh-huh. This man
thinks he's Jesus.

132
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,827
I've been sent here to help.

133
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,096
EGFR and uACR are normal.

134
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,272
Both kidneys are
fully functional.

135
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:44,707
He is an ideal donor.

136
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:47,189
Except he's obviously
crazy. He thinks he's Jesus.

137
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,930
Technically, we
can't prove he isn't.

138
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,759
I mean, the Bible says Jesus
will return to Earth someday.

139
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:54,283
There's several examples
of ordinary people

140
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,807
becoming holy figures
later on in life.

141
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,375
Muhammed didn't receive his
first revelation from God

142
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,681
till he was 40.

143
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:03,727
I minored in theology.

144
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,773
He's certainly your
patient's savior.

145
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,905
Without him, she's
dead in a week.

146
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:11,213
It is possible we could find
another donor, but unlikely.

147
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,042
But that doesn't mean we
should allow a delusional man

148
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,826
to make life-altering decisions.

149
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,915
And the surgery poses
a bigger risk for him.

150
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,962
We can only give him blood
from another Rhnull donor,

151
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,485
which is nearly
impossible to find.

152
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,329
Regardless, we should
reach out to his family.

153
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,532
Parents are dead.

154
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:28,143
His emergency contact
is his landlord.

155
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,972
If he wants to save someone's
life, I say we let him.

156
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:34,845
UNOS policy says organ
donation is contraindicated

157
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,978
if there is inability
to give informed consent

158
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,850
due to impaired cognitive
or intellectual capacity.

159
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:43,550
That's not our call. We
need a psych consult.

160
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,073
Your patient is suffering

161
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:48,250
from delusional
disorder of grandiosity.

162
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,252
However, he can
reliably articulate

163
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:51,993
that he understands
the procedure.

164
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,473
His driver's license indicates

165
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,692
that he has been an organ
donor for at least a decade.

166
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,740
That suggests this decision
is consistent with his values.

167
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,872
He is completely
competent to donate.

168
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,047
Hallelujah.

169
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,160
I don't know how you
live over half a century

170
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,490
without trying an oyster.

171
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,623
Well, I always wanted to.
I just... I don't know,

172
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,278
I chickened out because
they always look so goopy.

173
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,714
Well, no more fear.

174
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:18,758
Slurp away.

175
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,982
Mmm. Wow. Mmm.

176
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,899
Your femur's not fractured.

177
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,075
Oh. Good.

178
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,599
But the pain you're
feeling is called

179
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,471
referred neuropathic pain,
from a fracture in your spine.

180
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,168
It's compressing
your spinal cord.

181
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:38,953
Not good.

182
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,931
The tumor has infiltrated and
weakened your spinal column.

183
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,653
It likely fractured when you
hit the ground after skydiving.

184
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,787
So how do we fix it?

185
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,572
Open spinal stabilization
and fusion surgery.

186
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,922
We replace your fractured
vertebrae with a cage

187
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,708
and add bone grafts, screws,
and rods for support.

188
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,667
You should be back on your
feet in about six weeks.

189
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,800
That could be more than
half the time we have left.

190
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,631
There is another option
with simpler surgery.

191
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,721
No cage and no bone grafts,
much shorter recovery time,

192
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,332
but even a small bump
could break it again.

193
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:14,292
So I'll avoid small
bumps. Let's do it.

194
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,425
Dad, are you sure?

195
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:17,818
We have a mountain to climb.

196
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:22,562
We'll go get prepped.

197
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,319
Come on, get your
camera rolling.

198
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,132
I got 11 more to go.

199
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,439
Dad, you're so old.

200
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,528
Cameras don't roll anymore.

201
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,317
We still need to run an
MRI on the potential donor

202
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,842
to evaluate the
kidney's structure.

203
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,018
But the labs show he could
be an excellent match.

204
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,153
Your video worked.

205
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,199
Turns out you don't need
a million followers.

206
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,768
Just one... who
thinks he's Jesus.

207
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,335
Hashtag blessed.

208
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,217
I would like to hire
Joelle as Steve's nanny.

209
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,610
I worked it out.

210
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,326
If we cut it down to
two streaming services

211
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,439
and I stop buying Steve
so many cute outfits

212
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,069
and we don't go on
that trip this summer,

213
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,573
we can afford her.

214
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,924
- Whew. This is a very thorough spreadsheet.
- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:24,493
You clearly have strong
feelings about this.

216
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,714
We can hire Joelle.

217
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,107
- Shaun! Yeah!
- Okay.

218
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,326
Okay, we should call her.

219
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,849
Yes.

220
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,027
Hello?

221
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,682
Joelle, it's Lea and Shaun,
and we are so, so excited

222
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,945
because we would
love to hire you.

223
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,165
Oh.

224
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,430
- You stole my nanny?
- She wasn't your nanny.

225
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:51,259
Yet. And you knew I
wanted to hire her.

226
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,218
I encouraged you to
hire her on the spot.

227
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,935
But you hemmed you hawed
and you dilly-dallied

228
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,179
and you spreadsheeted,
so I took action.

229
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,268
And outbid me. It's so gross.

230
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,985
I told you that good
nannies are hard to find.

231
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,837
My current one is
late half the time,

232
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,403
and she costs more than Joelle.

233
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,755
I wanted to close the deal,
so I made an aggressive offer.

234
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,158
I feel like I don't
even know you.

235
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,935
I'm finished with
the perianal abscess.

236
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,501
Great. Dressing change

237
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,634
for a diabetic foot
ulcer in 5 awaits.

238
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,681
Nobody said wound
care was glamorous.

239
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,773
Joelle has experience
with special-needs kids.

240
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,252
And she's bilingual.

241
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,515
I always wanted Eden
to be bilingual, so

242
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,693
seriously, thanks.

243
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:37,479
You're trying to replace my
dream nanny with regifted wine?

244
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,220
- I'm not evil.
- Debatable.

245
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,270
You barely even looked at it.

246
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,944
Enough to see there's
no tonsillar herniation,

247
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,665
which is the main
criteria for Chiari.

248
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,016
That's why I said Chiari Zero.

249
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,409
That's not a real diagnosis.

250
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:57,151
It is real. It is
controversial, but it's real.

251
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,109
Moderate cervical syrinx,

252
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:02,722
plus occipital headaches,
plus dizziness,

253
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,028
plus clumsiness with
the finger tapping.

254
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,378
All symptoms of
Chiari malformation.

255
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,989
And also symptoms of withdrawal.

256
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:11,687
Not the fluid in
her spinal cord.

257
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,994
Too many doctors have just
fed her pain medication

258
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,126
or shooed her away altogether.

259
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,345
Because she's an addict.

260
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:23,525
And one who's around your
daughter's age when she died.

261
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,312
Wow. Okay.

262
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,926
Hannah's pain is real.
She's in actual pain.

263
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,406
Or she's doctor-shopping
for a sucker.

264
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,191
Okay. So both can be true.

265
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,323
She's not gonna be able
to get over her addiction

266
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,978
unless somebody
addresses her pain.

267
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,637
All right, fine.

268
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,945
I don't know how this
is not worthwhile.

269
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,337
Leave the images.

270
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,399
Jerome bailed less than
an hour into his shift.

271
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,793
I'm worried about him.

272
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,664
He's going through it.

273
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,361
I was thinking you might
go talk to him after work?

274
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,846
I can't right now.

275
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:25,805
Yeah, no, of course.

276
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,897
Anything I can do for you?

277
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,901
Thanks. I've got an MRI.

278
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,080
People are free to choose.

279
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,865
God is simply aware of
what those choices will be

280
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:46,216
because He lives outside
of time and space.

281
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,696
Isaiah 57.

282
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,654
Sorry to interrupt your sermon.

283
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:50,830
Lie back.

284
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,573
I know we just met,
but I sense a...

285
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,358
Like, a weight on you.

286
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,840
A sadness. I'm fine.

287
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,016
I'm guessing you were close
to the young man who died.

288
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,107
How do you know about him?

289
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,500
Dr. Allen, he's tachycardic

290
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,424
and his blood pressure's
elevated, 178 over 112.

291
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,156
Go get 20 milligrams labetalol.

292
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,029
People like to tell me things.

293
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,204
I like to listen.

294
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,379
So you're nosy.

295
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,208
Mmm. I'm friendly.

296
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,340
Um, his vitals are normal again.

297
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,823
Probably spiked due to anxiety,
maybe from the machine.

298
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,260
I'm not anxious. I'm
enjoying our conversation.

299
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,392
Oh.

300
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,002
Apparently, I'm the only one.

301
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,396
Try to keep still and no
talking during the MRI.

302
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,232
Hi.

303
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,364
Just checking in.

304
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:50,585
I was thinking I could talk
to Villanueva if you want,

305
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,239
about getting you
some more time off.

306
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:55,111
Thanks, but I don't
think a few more days or

307
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,635
weeks will make much
of a difference.

308
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,988
I'm not sure I can
ever come back.

309
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:04,946
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,000
Rod is placed. Lock
it in with set screws.

311
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,740
Thank you.

312
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,612
Jerome's still not back today?

313
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:20,658
No. He's not sure he
can come back at all.

314
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,443
Too many memories.

315
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:26,838
He's still in shock. Now
tighten the instrumentation.

316
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,686
At least Paul gets to know
the end is coming and prepare,

317
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,104
say his goodbyes.

318
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:34,368
I don't think you can
ever really be prepared.

319
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:36,892
And I wouldn't want my loved
ones to watch me suffer.

320
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,459
Spine is stabilized.

321
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:41,114
Continue with the
endoscopic decompression.

322
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:44,944
So you'd rather not
know it's coming?

323
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,511
I'll go to sleep one night,
never wake up, cut to black.

324
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:51,646
Hold up.

325
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:56,042
There's a clean margin
in the spinal column

326
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,454
surrounding the entire
length of the tumor.

327
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,262
That wasn't visible in
his previous imaging.

328
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,111
The impact of his
landing must have

329
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,055
cut off blood flow to the
tumor at its perimeter,

330
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,313
caused it to shrink.

331
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,228
I think this gives us
room to do a cordectomy.

332
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,838
We could remove
his entire tumor.

333
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,187
And take out the majority

334
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,363
of his thoracic
spinal cord with it.

335
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,017
Would paralyze him
from the T3 down,

336
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,063
and his cancer will
probably come back.

337
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,413
But it'd give him
a lot more time.

338
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:22,024
Let's close him up, see
what he wants to do.

339
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,026
How much of his blood
have we banked so far?

340
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,289
Only two units, and
if we draw more,

341
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,943
he'll be too anemic for surgery.

342
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,379
We found another in Australia,

343
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,878
but it wouldn't get here
until the end of the week.

344
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,904
We can't wait that long.

345
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,733
Naomi may be too unstable
to survive the transplant.

346
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,345
We'll have to make it work
with the patient's own blood.

347
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,087
We'll need to ligate every
vessel twice before cutting.

348
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,002
Be precise and meticulous.

349
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,221
I really don't want
Jesus' blood on my hands.

350
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,093
Luckily, we will
be double-gloved.

351
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,531
Give 7,000 units of Epogen

352
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,664
and 150 milligrams of
iron to increase RBCs.

353
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,579
Hi.

354
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,712
Are you entering
your baking era?

355
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,019
Nope. They're for Joelle.

356
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,108
But I have three reject
batches I could bring you.

357
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,502
- I'm good.
- Okay.

358
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:08,766
Why are you making muffins
for Park and Morgan's nanny?

359
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,247
Because soon she'll be ours.

360
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,250
I've come up with some
additional cost-saving measures

361
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,619
so we can pay her
a little bit more.

362
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:20,126
Mmm. There were
other candidates,

363
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,259
many of them very well
qualified and less expensive.

364
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,740
Morgan stole our son's
nanny. That cannot stand.

365
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:26,828
Out of principle.

366
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,004
What principle?

367
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,661
If we get all of the tumor,
which I think we can,

368
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:36,577
we could extend your
life by five to 10 years.

369
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,839
Maybe more.

370
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:40,972
But I'll be a quadriplegic.

371
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,863
It's likely you'll maintain
some use of your hands,

372
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,541
unless the edema
spreads upwards.

373
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,024
No, no, no, we're sticking
with our original plan.

374
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,721
Just get me back on
my feet again, okay?

375
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:52,680
Dad, they said years.

376
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,899
You'd still have all
your mental faculties.

377
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,205
And you'd have me to help.

378
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,167
Can you get me some ice
chips? My mouth is really dry.

379
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,868
Just think about it, please.

380
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,014
Eve drew this in kindergarten.

381
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,408
I'm the tall one. She's
the one with the hair.

382
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:30,674
She told me that her dream
was touching the sky with me.

383
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:33,460
And I promised her that
we would do that one day.

384
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:36,854
And then her mom and
me, we got a divorce,

385
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,770
and I lost a lot of
years with my daughter.

386
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,208
Well, this surgery would
give you a lot of years back.

387
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,926
After all these years
of being absent,

388
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,519
I can't ask her to spend
her 20s taking care of me.

389
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,394
She should finish college,
start her own life.

390
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:05,753
Hi. This is Dr. Aaron
Glassman again.

391
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,711
No, okay. I don't
understand the delay.

392
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:14,675
Fine. Um, can you please have
them call me back either way?

393
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,633
Thank you.

394
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,117
How you feeling?

395
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,772
Mm. You gave me the
good stuff, so...

396
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,295
Yeah, well, guess what?

397
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,534
After the surgery, you're not
gonna need the good stuff,

398
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,647
nor are you going to need
to be telling stories

399
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,649
about spilling
pills into toilets.

400
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,652
- It wasn't...
- Don't bother.

401
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:38,655
You left the emergency contact
blank on your pre-op form.

402
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,353
You planning to off
me on the table?

403
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,703
Well, I'm not planning on it.

404
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,028
But if something
were to go wrong,

405
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,054
I'm gonna need to contact
your mom or your dad.

406
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,926
Good luck. They kicked
me out years ago, so

407
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,149
if you want someone who
cares if I die, guess again.

408
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,675
I'm gonna take the wild
guess that they still care.

409
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,376
You'd be wrong.

410
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:12,515
Father, thank you for
loving us so much,

411
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,691
and we ask that you
heal Ruth's back pain

412
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,564
so she can get back to
the pickleball court.

413
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,740
- Amen.
- Amen.

414
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,830
The pain is gone! Thank you.

415
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,224
I think that's your pain
meds kicking in, Mrs. Wyatt.

416
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,226
Let's go.

417
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,926
I don't have time to be
looking all over for you.

418
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,929
I'm sorry. Helping people
in pain is kind of my thing.

419
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,800
No, it's my thing.
I'm the doctor,

420
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:39,412
and my patients don't
need your snake oil.

421
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:43,154
- I'm giving them comfort.
- You're giving them false hope.

422
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:46,506
It's okay if you're
angry. He gets that a lot.

423
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,377
I'm not angry. I just
need you to stay put.

424
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,510
I didn't mean right now.

425
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:51,989
I just feel a little...

426
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,732
I need help!

427
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,048
We cannot do the
kidney transplant

428
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,093
until we know why he collapsed.

429
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:10,723
He's hypertensive and
tachycardic one moment

430
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,575
and then stable the next.

431
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,925
Could be carcinoid syndrome
or renovascular hypertension.

432
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:16,405
There are no suspicious masses.

433
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,451
His renal arteries look normal.

434
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:21,236
His labs rule out
hyperthyroidism.

435
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,325
Everything about
this guy is crazy.

436
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,808
Crazy is not a DSM-recognized
diagnosis, but you are correct.

437
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,897
His underlying condition
must have psychiatric

438
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,681
as well as physical symptoms.

439
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,003
He has a pheochromocytoma.

440
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,962
We need to surgically remove it.

441
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,747
It could not be seen on the MRI,

442
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,966
but it has been flooding
his system with hormones.

443
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,664
Once the pheo's out, we may find

444
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,144
Jesus has left the building,
taking both kidneys with him.

445
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:03,060
If that happens, Naomi
almost certainly dies.

446
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,846
We could remove the pheo and
the kidney at the same time.

447
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,239
Given his blood type,
every surgery is dangerous

448
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,372
because of our limited
supply of Rhnull blood.

449
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,156
Ethically, there's
no debate here,

450
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,810
regardless of medical issues.

451
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,030
We remove the pheo,
then ask Jesus

452
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,008
if he still wants to move
forward with the donation.

453
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,729
Prep him for surgery.

454
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,316
You're trying to
steal our nanny?

455
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,560
Oh, Lea is trying
to steal your nanny

456
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,736
because Morgan stole her first.

457
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,521
She didn't mention that part.

458
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,499
Although, Joelle was not
technically our nanny yet,

459
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,046
but Lea is very
passionate about this,

460
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,830
and I'm choosing to support her.

461
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,571
Yeah. Me, too.

462
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:36,964
Oh, you're supporting Lea?

463
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,445
No. Morgan.

464
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,248
We need to do something
before this escalates

465
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,033
and we're ordered not to
talk to each other anymore.

466
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,973
We gotta sit down, the four
of us, and work this out.

467
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,279
Atrium Cafe. Tuesday, noon.

468
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,211
Me again.

469
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,655
You don't have to
keep checking in.

470
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,172
I, um...

471
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,087
I need a favor.

472
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,784
It's kind of a big one.

473
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,137
Due respect, Doctor, the
source of my divinity

474
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:23,793
isn't just a
pheo-whatever-you-call-it.

475
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,404
Your BP and heart
rate are stable.

476
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:29,233
Our connection to God is
not that easily severed.

477
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,409
I think you know that.

478
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,821
Why do you keep
thinking you know me?

479
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,934
You don't. You didn't
know my dead friend.

480
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:37,154
You don't even know who you are.

481
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:38,765
I need to place
an arterial line.

482
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,331
I know you're grieving.

483
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,135
- I don't want to talk about it.
- And you can't understand

484
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,181
how your friend's death
could be part of God's plan.

485
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,425
There is no plan.

486
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,949
It's a lie, and it's cruel.

487
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,473
And I used to believe
in it so much.

488
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:54,781
Every time I lost a
patient, I would tell myself

489
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,478
it's all a part of
a bigger picture.

490
00:23:56,522 --> 00:24:00,264
I took comfort in believing
you were watching out for us.

491
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,503
Even in the midst of suffering,

492
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,026
you were working things
out for our good,

493
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,878
but it is all a lie.

494
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:08,098
My friend was murdered
defending one of your children.

495
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:10,318
You let him bleed out on
the sidewalk all alone,

496
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,929
and there was no one there to
tell him how much he was loved.

497
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,762
He knew.

498
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:20,806
I promise.

499
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,638
He knew.

500
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,253
Hey. God will love you,

501
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:33,733
no matter what you say to Him

502
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:36,300
or about Him.

503
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,911
You just need to keep talking.

504
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,310
Okay, everyone, time to
vote. We need your help.

505
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:49,879
Which peak should we climb,
Mission Peak or Mount Umunhum?

506
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,881
Uh, Mission Peak
is an easier hike,

507
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:54,667
but Mount Umunhum has a
better view of the sunset.

508
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,930
I vote neither.

509
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,468
I hope that wasn't
a live stream.

510
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,109
You're the disappearing nurse.

511
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,416
Jerome Martel.

512
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,767
I'm sorry about that. I, uh...

513
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:13,642
I lost the love of my life
recently, very suddenly.

514
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:17,733
And seeing the two
of you, you know...

515
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,822
It must have struck a
little close to home.

516
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:25,872
I wish I had known my last
day with him was my last day.

517
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:27,743
Or my last month.

518
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,398
So we could have made
the most of that time.

519
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:33,183
Are you here to talk
me into the cordectomy?

520
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:37,057
Asher and I made a plan

521
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,584
to watch every Best
Picture winner since 1928.

522
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:46,196
We made it to The
Godfather Part II.

523
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,548
Asher fell asleep halfway
through, as usual.

524
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,376
He was snoring so loudly, I could
hardly hear what Pacino was saying,

525
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:58,252
I don't know what the right
choice is for you and your family.

526
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,996
But I know there is
nothing I wouldn't give

527
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,954
to sit by Asher's side

528
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,566
and listen to him snore
through The English Patient.

529
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:15,095
Dad. We could watch every one

530
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:18,359
of those 30 for 30
documentaries you like.

531
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,361
Even the ones about hockey.

532
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:23,799
Or we could start our own
two-person true-crime book club.

533
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:25,888
It wouldn't just be
fun and games, Eve.

534
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,020
You'd also be stuck.

535
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,935
Not stuck.

536
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,066
Honored.

537
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,375
Sure, I'd need help,

538
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,944
but I can't lose you after
just getting you back.

539
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:41,600
I want you to be there when
I graduate from college.

540
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,384
Maybe walk me down
the aisle someday.

541
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,656
Okay if I wheel you down?

542
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,225
I'd love that.

543
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:12,848
We removed the pheochromocytoma.

544
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,635
Do you still believe
you are Jesus?

545
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,643
My name is, um... Is Carl.

546
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,038
I remember everything, but...

547
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,737
I know I'm not Jesus.

548
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,609
Are you still willing
to move forward

549
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,219
with donating your kidney?

550
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,310
I...

551
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:41,877
I have no idea what to do.

552
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:47,666
We now only have one
remaining bag of Rhnull blood.

553
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,389
That makes another
surgery quite high-risk.

554
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:52,018
Donating your kidney to Naomi

555
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,585
would be a very
kind thing to do.

556
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,679
But as your surgeon, it is
not medically advisable.

557
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,773
I can't do it.

558
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,424
We've discussed and
would be willing...

559
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,886
Reluctantly willing.

560
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,759
To hire Joelle as a part-time
nanny so we can all share her.

561
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,282
Returning half of
what you stole?

562
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,806
What a cop-out.

563
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,286
- Told you. She's totally unreasonable.
- Excuse me?

564
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,636
If you want to see unreasonable,
let me hold up a mirror.

565
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,223
Unless you already
swiped that from my bag.

566
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,138
I've seen you knock-off bag.
There's nothing worth taking.

567
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,294
Okay. Would you be
willing to employ her

568
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,035
on Tuesdays and Thursdays?

569
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,143
And give you a 60/40 advantage?

570
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,318
We're the ones who found her.

571
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:56,406
We're the ones who hired her.

572
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,823
Youtake Tuesdays and Thursdays.

573
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,476
I'll throw in my wine. Deal?

574
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,652
No deal, but I will give
you the stack of resumes

575
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,089
from the people we didn't hire.

576
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,762
So we're supposed to just
pick through your leftovers?

577
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,832
You already did, except
we were still eating her.

578
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,703
I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

579
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,575
How about a 50/50 split,
alternating weeks?

580
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:13,882
I have a better idea.

581
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,062
You're a genius.

582
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,194
Savant.

583
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:28,418
So, St. Bon's is now in
the daycare business?

584
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,832
- You agreed.
- No, I just didn't contradict you

585
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,858
when you almost
immediately said yes.

586
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,468
I'll take more 4-0 for tackups.

587
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:36,339
You're opposed to
being family-friendly?

588
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,230
I just didn't realize your mini
strokes had turned you into

589
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,386
such a softy.

590
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:43,390
Between the daycare... and her.

591
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,107
What about her?
She's a patient,

592
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,523
who I happen to be right about.

593
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,134
Let's find out.

594
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,093
Opening the arachnoid.

595
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,886
Significant adhesions,

596
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,367
fourth ventricular veil
restricting CSF flow.

597
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:06,108
You were right. Chiari Zero.

598
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,199
This will only solve
one of Hannah's issues,

599
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,853
and arguably the easier one.

600
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,855
Her addiction will
still be a problem.

601
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,858
Doesn't have to be yours.

602
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,513
Watch your dissection.

603
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:39,011
I've got your discharge
papers and your ride.

604
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:45,365
My, uh, emergency
contact is my landlord.

605
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:50,631
You want me to call him?

606
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,896
I think my, um,

607
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,637
brain tricked me
into thinking I was

608
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,205
the most significant
person around because...

609
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,861
I don't really matter to anyone.

610
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,607
Your friend, what
kind of man was he?

611
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:13,480
Clever.

612
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:16,396
Honest.

613
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,702
Would make you laugh
as much as he would

614
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,139
call you out on your nonsense.

615
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:25,884
And really brave.

616
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,194
Maybe it wasn't a trick.

617
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,850
Maybe your brain just showed you
the type of person you could be.

618
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,160
Maybe you came
here for a reason.

619
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:45,077
Yeah.

620
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,730
I'd like to think so.

621
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,526
Um, I'd like to
donate my kidney.

622
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,843
Sectioning the artery
with a vascular stapler.

623
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,846
Vitals holding steady.
Kidney looks great.

624
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,327
Ligating the renal vein.

625
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,722
Removing the left kidney.

626
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:23,898
Let's get this over to Naomi.

627
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,032
The vein tore.
He's hemorrhaging.

628
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,163
Applying manual pressure.

629
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,078
We need suction
and Cooley clamp.

630
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:32,211
His renal vein must have
avulsed off the vena cava.

631
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:34,169
We need to get vascular control.

632
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,302
200 cc. That's the last
of his banked blood.

633
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:37,564
Very aware.

634
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,324
Please, please, do
not let this man die.

635
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:48,943
Sutures aren't holding.

636
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,620
Less than 100 cc
of blood left.

637
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:52,294
- Can we ligate the vena cava?
- Tissue is too friable.

638
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,015
That could cause
complete renal failure.

639
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,408
We should put in a graft.

640
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,689
The walls are tearing.

641
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,513
We need something to get
vascular control now.

642
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,200
A double-balloon occlusion.

643
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,087
We can block it from above
and below at the same time.

644
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,634
And we could use the existing

645
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,767
jugular central
line to get access.

646
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,247
Fluoroscopy.

647
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,860
I'll take the graft.

648
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,514
Lap sponges.

649
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:17,343
Advancing the
catheter to the SVC.

650
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,214
Call out when he
reaches the IVC.

651
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,653
A little further.

652
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,354
You're there.

653
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,620
Inflating the balloons.

654
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,111
BP and heart rate
are stabilizing.

655
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:53,031
Thank you.

656
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,039
I'm not here to ask
you to come back.

657
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:02,562
Promise.

658
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,173
I wrote a list.

659
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,306
Yeah, come in.

660
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,786
Anything anyone at St.
Bon's could remember Asher

661
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,005
ever saying he wanted to do.

662
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:18,404
Save a cat in a tree.

663
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,190
Learn Dothraki.

664
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,672
Eat pasta in Italy.

665
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,634
If you want, I
thought maybe we could

666
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:32,679
do some of it together.

667
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:36,900
Thanks.

668
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,902
But, uh

669
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,079
well, these weren't at
the top of Asher's list.

670
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,085
He was really serious about
making me get a matching tattoo.

671
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:50,610
A big spoon for me,
little spoon for him.

672
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:52,525
Tried to talk me into
it at least once a week.

673
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,444
I said it was too silly
for something so real.

674
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:05,886
Thanks for this.

675
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:23,512
Hey!

676
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:24,948
Dr. Reznick around?

677
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:27,429
No! And don't sneak up
on people like that.

678
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:29,823
I'm sorry.

679
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,466
That lady is putting
me through my paces.

680
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:33,827
I almost miss surgery.

681
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:40,790
When I lost my mom,

682
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:44,098
my whole world
stopped making sense.

683
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,100
I looked to religion
for answers.

684
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,276
I'm still searching
for what feels right,

685
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,106
but I do know my
mom's not just gone.

686
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,890
And I try to find little ways

687
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,774
to make her a part of my
life as much as I can.

688
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,722
There you are. The poop
fridge shorted out.

689
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,682
You've got 22 fecal
samples to relocate ASAP.

690
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,163
How big is your fridge at home?

691
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,302
Hey.

692
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,223
Okay.

693
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,095
Follow this light.

694
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,839
No more twitch in the eye.

695
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,928
Let me see your hands.

696
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,234
That's good, right?

697
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,932
Yeah, just finger tapping.

698
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,978
Both.

699
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,240
Good.

700
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,721
Grab my hands and make
a nice, tight grip.

701
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:43,723
Really tight, as
hard as you can. Ow!

702
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:44,854
Okay.

703
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:46,465
Next you'll be
pitching for the A's.

704
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,293
God, no.

705
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:49,381
Cubs or bust.

706
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,255
Thank you for believing me.

707
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,218
But, um...

708
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,307
I'm... I'm still a little...

709
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:05,048
Uncomfortable? That's normal,

710
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,012
considering the surgery
you've just been through.

711
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:10,402
Could you give me something?

712
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:14,971
Your morphine's maxed out.

713
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,802
But you know what I can do?

714
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,171
I can hang out for
a little while,

715
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,544
keep your mind off things.

716
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:27,114
I can get a deck of cards.
Gin Rummy or Blackjack?

717
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,204
I don't wanna take your money.

718
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,120
Ha.

719
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,948
We could turn on the TV.

720
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:36,471
Okay.

721
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,560
But I'm choosing what we watch.

722
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,258
Oh, I'm sorry.

723
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,217
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

724
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,397
Yes, it's Dr. Glassman.

725
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:52,226
Yeah.

726
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,447
And... And they're conclusive?

727
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:03,716
Okay. Um, can you do me a
favor and send them over?

728
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,326
I'd like to take a look.

729
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,852
Yeah. Um, thank you.

He thought he was Jesus,

752
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:52,607
real, actual Jesus.

753
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,044
You would have loved
it, or mocked it.

754
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,786
Probably both.

755
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,049
You know, when he said he was
a carpenter from Nazareth,

756
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,311
that's the thing...

Hi, Joelle.

759
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,454
- Hi!
- Oh, my gosh.

760
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:15,891
I've missed you so much!

761
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,372
You have done a very nice job

762
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,156
making this not feel
like a conference room.

763
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,767
Thank you.

764
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,465
Steve was such a
happy, easy baby.

765
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:28,164
Oh, was he really?
Oh, I'm so glad.

766
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,079
No, he did great.

767
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,473
He was the only one who
didn't even cry at drop-off.

768
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:35,041
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

769
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,738
Can't wait to see you tomorrow.

770
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,305
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

771
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:43,658
Oh, you did so good, peanut.

772
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:50,143
What's wrong?

773
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:53,538
She said Steve did not react
when his parent left the room.

774
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,584
Which means loves it here.

775
00:40:56,628 --> 00:41:00,632
Or it could be an early
indication of autism.
