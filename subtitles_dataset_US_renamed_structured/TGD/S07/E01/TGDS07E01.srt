00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:02,324
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:02,348 --> 00:00:04,393
- Hey! Stop!
- Danny!

3
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:09,407
Just promise me.

4
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:11,365
- What?
- No opioids.

5
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,253
He asked you not to do that.

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,367
He's tachycardic and
hypertensive because of the pain.

7
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:15,500
He's going into shock.

8
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:17,328
- He's not. He's praying.
- He's dying.

9
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,852
Forgive me.

10
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:22,028
I need to go back to
Texas with my family.

11
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:24,465
<i>You made an error in
yesterday's craniotomy.</i>

12
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,467
You closed with
only eight sutures.

13
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,078
The size of the
wound required ten.

14
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:29,340
We need to figure out why.

15
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,428
I've had a stroke.

16
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:31,864
Yes. A small one.

17
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:34,475
Dr. Glassman, please tell
us what the next step is.

18
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:36,825
Somebody please call security.
Shaun, you are out of line.

19
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:38,503
- Answer.
- It's, um...

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,223
You humiliated me in
public in my operating room

21
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,703
in front of my colleagues.

22
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:46,618
Do you have any idea
how much that hurt?

23
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,054
I don't know what to do.

24
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:50,013
You can just leave me alone.

25
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,971
I don't think you should resign.

26
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,407
Because you don't have
to do it all alone.

27
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,192
You're the reason I
wake up in the morning,

28
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:56,715
so whatever there
is to figure out,

29
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,110
all I want in the world is
for us to do it as a family.

30
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:02,329
I wanted to give you a
heads-up as a friend.

31
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,441
I've decided to resign.

32
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,691
Congratulations, Mom and Dad.

33
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,774
Look at what we made.

34
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:14,975
Do you think
Dr. Glassman is coming?

35
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:17,692
This is from Dr. Glassman.

36
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:20,130
How did he know his
name would be Steve?

37
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:21,546
Because he knows you.

38
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,134
Gloves.

39
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:45,729
Start the timer, please.

40
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,658
Good luck, babe. It's a doozy.

41
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,196
Thirty-seven seconds.

42
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,590
Good work.

43
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,748
I think that was
your fastest yet.

44
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:34,675
Second-fastest.

45
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:40,912
Fifteen minutes of independent
play is starting now.

46
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,915
I will log it into my app.

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,614
You sure you don't want to get in a
few extra snuggles before you leave?

48
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,392
Oh, I had ten minutes of
snuggles this morning.

49
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,460
Very nice.

50
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:53,049
I've also set up the
app on your phone.

51
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,354
It will alert you when it's time

52
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,052
for Steve's nap,
feeding, playtime...

53
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,229
Just in case I miss the
schedules posted on the fridge,

54
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,448
the bathroom, and
in our bedroom.

55
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,930
Yes. And I will be able to
track it while I'm at work.

56
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:07,367
Steve and I will be fine.

57
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,784
Just enjoy your first day back.

58
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,548
We can finish
reading the latest.

59
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:16,376
<i>Journal of Trauma and
Acute Care Surgery</i>

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,401
when I get home.

61
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,641
After this, Steve
should have at least

62
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:22,078
five minutes of tummy time.

63
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,688
Yesterday, he only
logged 12 minutes,

64
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:25,757
- which is three less than...
- I love you.

65
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,128
Say hi to everyone for me.

66
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,111
Okay. I love you, too.

67
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,814
I will miss you both.

68
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:24,705
I don't know why you need three
protein powders for your smoothies.

69
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,166
They do different things.

70
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:29,188
She's barely taken an ounce.

71
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:31,147
That's what the protein-powder
companies want you to believe.

72
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,433
Are you holding her right?

73
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,628
Yes.

74
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:38,763
She needs to be upright with
her head properly supported.

75
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:39,831
Good.

76
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:42,332
And you mixed it enough?

77
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:43,507
The same as always.

78
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:46,186
She's not interested again.

79
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:48,884
And she seems lethargic.

80
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:52,670
I'll take her to
get checked out.

81
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,982
Well, I'd like to come, too.

82
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,203
Sure. You can carry this.

83
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,363
Good morning. How's Perez today?

84
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,518
Don't know.

85
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,193
It's almost 8:00 a.m.

86
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,325
It's been "today" for
a whole eight hours.

87
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,979
You two haven't
texted each other yet?

88
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,286
We both decided we need space.

89
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,852
He's focused on his recovery.

90
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:26,637
I've got my life here.

91
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:29,553
I fully support that.

92
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:31,598
And your next chapter
begins tonight.

93
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:35,385
You and me. Drinks, music,
questionable decisions.

94
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,344
You and Jerome finally
got the surgery!

95
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,911
You're no longer
joined at the hip?

96
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,304
Jerome is obsessed
with some docuseries

97
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:43,958
about one of the many sports
that I don't care about.

98
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,786
Come on. It's been too long.

99
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,223
I've been busy.

100
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,833
You've been

101
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,226
mopey.

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,184
Fine. I agree to
drinks and music,

103
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,056
but I'm definitely a "maybe"
on questionable decisions.

104
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,971
- All right. We'll work up to it.
- Okay.

105
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,495
We're going out
tonight for drinks,

106
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,932
starting a new
chapter. That's right.

107
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:03,630
We're calling it "Bad
decisions with good friends."

108
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,067
We're definitely not
calling it that. Wanna join?

109
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:07,745
No, thank you.

110
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:11,856
Papa Murphy, welcome back.

111
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,074
Pictures of Steve.

112
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,685
I was just about to ask.

113
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,146
This way, I avoid the disruption
of pulling out my phone.

114
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,149
Look at that smile!

115
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:22,519
Just like his mom!

116
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:25,348
He was pooping in that one.
Here he is... about to poop.

117
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:26,895
Hmm. A theme develops.

118
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:31,658
Aw. He's got your eyes, Shaun.

119
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,225
I need to find Dr. Lim.

120
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,295
You may keep those. I
made enough for everyone.

121
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:39,144
Marcus sends
greetings from Spain.

122
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,451
Oh, I thought he was at a
meditation retreat in Vietnam.

123
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,236
He was, and now he's walking
the Camino de Santiago.

124
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,716
How nice for him.

125
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,065
I'm two surgeons down

126
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,154
with no one to approve
hiring a new one.

127
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,852
I need the board to appoint
an interim president, stat.

128
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:53,811
Just as long as
it's not O'Brien.

129
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:55,203
They wouldn't.

130
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,249
I heard from a staffer
who covers board meetings

131
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:58,729
that his name's
on the shortlist.

132
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,775
Ugh. Of the worst possible
candidates for the position.

133
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,560
Good morning! Pictures of Steve.

134
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,388
Aww.

135
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:06,998
You no longer have your cane.

136
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,478
Yeah. PT said I was ready.

137
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:09,783
I'm glad to have you back.

138
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,505
I would like to join your case.

139
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:17,138
He's adorable,
Dr. Murphy. Welcome back.

140
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,879
Shaun, I'm thrilled to see you,

141
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,533
but I'm not sure this is
the case where you want

142
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,796
to start as a new dad.

143
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,649
It is an exciting and
challenging surgery.

144
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,110
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

145
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,242
Hello. I am Dr. Shaun Murphy,

146
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:37,376
attending surgeon and
father of a baby boy.

147
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,248
He is two weeks old, and
today is my first day back,

148
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:41,946
but that will not
affect my performance

149
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,209
as your son's doctor.

150
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,732
Is it true there might
be a heart for Jack?

151
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,822
Yes, but the heart
isn't available yet,

152
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,544
and we may not
get it once it is.

153
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:52,872
We've been through this before.

154
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,655
Why isn't the heart
available yet?

155
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,964
Well, the donor family is
still saying their goodbyes

156
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,599
before they turn
off life support.

157
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:08,755
Jack is an excellent
match for the donor heart,

158
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,584
and his latest echo indicates
that his cardiomyopathy

159
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,281
and overall cardiac
function has worsened,

160
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:15,414
so he should be at
the top of the list.

161
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:16,937
I just want to run
some additional tests

162
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,286
to make sure he's
otherwise healthy.

163
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,506
There is a problem.

164
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,336
There is a small scratch,
likely from his fingernails,

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,294
which has developed
cellulitis and an abscess.

166
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:27,861
If the infection spreads
and he spikes a fever,

167
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:30,386
Jack will be ineligible
for the transplant.

168
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,716
We have to lance and
debride it right away.

169
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,641
Morning.

170
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:47,862
Hi.

171
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:53,670
This is Steve, our son,
who is now two weeks old.

172
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:56,150
Steve, this is the grumpy
man who lives down the hall

173
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,741
and gave you your
favorite blanket.

174
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,765
Shaun was very impressed
you guessed his first name.

175
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:03,747
Wanna take a stab at the middle?

176
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,532
Aaron.

177
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,337
I was lobbying pretty
hard for Bowie,

178
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,209
because why not name your kid

179
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,689
after the coolest
person who ever lived?

180
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:14,366
But Shaun insisted.

181
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:17,520
You should come over sometime.

182
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:19,424
You two both grunt a lot
and make strange faces.

183
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:23,724
I've got a lot going on, so...

184
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,807
We live next door. You
have nothing going on.

185
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:31,577
You're mad. And I get it.

186
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:35,363
But are you really gonna ignore
Shaun and Steve and me forever?

187
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:36,737
Is that the plan?

188
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:40,891
I'm not ignoring you.

189
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,307
And he's beautiful.

190
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,486
Congratulations.

191
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,579
I tried.

192
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,474
Any cyanosis while eating?

193
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,433
Maybe a hint of bluishness
on her lips last night.

194
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,261
I haven't noticed anything.

195
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,263
But given her prior surgery
and the Turner syndrome,

196
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:06,897
I thought we should...

197
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,161
The blood flow is reduced.

198
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,402
It looks like Eden's
aortic stenosis

199
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,603
has progressed more rapidly
than we were expecting.

200
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,801
Can we put her on beta blockers?

201
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,762
We can try, but given how
dysplastic the valve is,

202
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,851
I don't think it
will do much good.

203
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,723
You'll want to get more imaging,

204
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:34,098
but I think Eden's gonna need
another surgery very soon.

205
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:47,562
Cardiac MRI confirmed severe
narrowing of the valve,

206
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:49,652
obstruction, and left
ventricular dysfunction.

207
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,743
Eden needs a new aortic valve,

208
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,963
or her heart failure
will get worse.

209
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,140
Are you thinking mechanical or
cryopreserved homograft for the replacement?

210
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:59,621
Mechanical valve for a
neonate needs to be built,

211
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,666
and it will require
future surgeries

212
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,146
plus lifetime blood thinners.

213
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,149
Cryopreserved valves risk
degeneration down the line,

214
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,238
but it is a solid idea,

215
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:10,545
especially as part of
the Ross Procedure.

216
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,112
Possible complications?

217
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:15,269
Aortic insufficiency,
pulmonary stenosis.

218
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:20,468
We can take some time, discuss
the different options...

219
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:22,059
Do the Ross Procedure.

220
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,936
I'll have Asher get her prepped.

221
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,185
It's time to get
off the sidelines.

222
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:43,708
I'm not sure what
you're referring to.

223
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:44,840
Are you gonna throw me a ball?

224
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,407
You've run the hospital before.

225
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,756
You can handle a
few more months.

226
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,237
I can, but why would I want to?

227
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,065
- That's a no?
- Yes.

228
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,024
Get ready for Interim
President O'Brien.

229
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,504
They would never.

230
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:59,333
That's like Mao
meets Basil Fawlty.

231
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:01,944
Wow. That's two obscure
<i>and</i> dated references.

232
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,728
They're never gonna
move on O'Brien.

233
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,470
Well, apparently, he's
on the board's shortlist.

234
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:09,560
Throw your hat in the ring,
he won't stand a chance.

235
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:12,631
My hat's gonna stay on my
head, but I'll handle it.

236
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:15,479
Okay, Jack.

237
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,917
You know that little
bump behind your ear?

238
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,962
We have to poke it
with something sharp,

239
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,616
which will hurt,

240
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,295
but we have to do it so hopefully
you can get a new heart.

241
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,909
But Mr. Snugglepuff is
here to keep you company.

242
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,935
Asher said the taco truck
added chorizo to the menu,

243
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,632
and it's bus sin'.

244
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,180
The next late night, we
should share an order.

245
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,072
Not really my thing. Thanks.

246
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,552
The sheet papoose is secure.

247
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:47,250
Good. Dr. Kalu, cradle the baby.

248
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,712
Dr. Allen, sterilize
the area behind the ear.

249
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:03,484
Okay, baby, don't look.

250
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:07,033
His eyes are not yet able to focus
beyond eight to twelve inches.

251
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,913
The abscess is pretty deep.

252
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,196
It may take a while to heal.

253
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,068
What about a wound vac?

254
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,050
We don't have one small enough.

255
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,227
It's okay.

256
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:31,860
Maggots.

257
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:35,124
How are those better than
just using antibiotics?

258
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,387
Maggots work faster to
clear necrotic debris

259
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,824
on account of the antimicrobial
nature of their saliva

260
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:42,044
and other digestive secretions.

261
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:44,612
It's safe to put
those bugs on my baby?

262
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,135
Larvae.

263
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,745
These are medical maggots.

264
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,443
They've been specially
disinfected. It's completely safe.

265
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:52,644
I would use maggots on my
son, Steve, in this situation.

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,884
That is unlikely to happen,

267
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:57,953
but I hope the parallel
puts you at ease.

268
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:01,716
Go ahead.

269
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,002
Hmm!

270
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,508
You want some coffee?

271
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,902
Or I have a stash of
protein bars in my office.

272
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,599
I'm fine, thanks.

273
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,669
But if you want
something, go ahead.

274
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:29,072
What's your family here for?

275
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,468
A heart transplant,
hopefully, for our son, Jack.

276
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,185
How old is he?

277
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,839
Twelve weeks.

278
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:40,929
Oh. My daughter,
Eden, is 11 weeks.

279
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,694
She's having heart
surgery right now.

280
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,436
Y'all will be in my prayers.

281
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,093
Is this Jack's first surgery?

282
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:52,984
He's had other procedures,

283
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,272
but this would be his
first open heart surgery.

284
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:57,316
If it happens.

285
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:04,387
<i>When</i> it happens, I recommend
Biafine cream for post-op.

286
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,781
It contains a natural
compound called trolamine.

287
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,349
It really helped
with Eden's recovery.

288
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,612
How many surgeries
has your daughter had?

289
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:13,309
Uh, one. At seven weeks.

290
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,615
Hmm.

291
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,661
Eden and I are old hands.

292
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,687
You're two very
resilient ladies.

293
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,952
I'm Kate Pierce. This
is my husband, Owen.

294
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:26,999
Morgan Reznick.

295
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:31,786
Alex Park.

296
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,660
Would you like to...

297
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,650
Yeah! You can do it! Come on.

298
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,913
Oh! There you go!

299
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:54,350
You got it! You got it!

300
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,222
You got it!

301
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,311
Hi, Daddy. How is it
being back at work?

302
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,877
I just applied maggots to a baby

303
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,314
a few months older than Steve.

304
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,838
Is that Steve?

305
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,319
He is supposed to be asleep.

306
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:07,972
<i>Mm. He's doing well
with tummy time.</i>

307
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:10,627
And you mentioned
yesterday he was behind,

308
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:13,195
so I thought I'd add
a few extra minutes.

309
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,675
No, no.

310
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,547
Tummy time should not be
extended into his sleep window.

311
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,636
Did you not get the app alert?

312
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,682
<i>You are seven minutes
into nap time.</i>

313
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:24,815
Nope. I guess I missed it.

314
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,382
<i>Delaying his nap could
make him overtired</i>

315
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:28,515
or delay his next feeding.

316
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,343
The schedule is very important.

317
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,823
I know, Shaun, I know. It's
just a few extra minutes.

318
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,173
<i>Eight minutes.</i>

319
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,894
<i>That is not a few.
It is several.</i>

320
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,680
Uh, I should go put Steve down.

321
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:42,553
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
- Okay.

322
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,557
Oh.

323
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:52,626
We had to abort the procedure.

324
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,541
Eden has a bicuspid
pulmonary valve.

325
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:57,805
There wasn't enough tissue
to attach it to the aorta.

326
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,961
And we observed
leaking at the valve.

327
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,769
Her heart is failing even
faster than we thought.

328
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm so sorry.

329
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,320
What's our next move?

330
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:16,171
Oh. The maggots worked!

331
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,346
Baby Jack's infection
has cleared,

332
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,242
and the heart is
on its way here.

333
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,524
Eden has two bad valves

334
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,420
and rapidly progressing
heart failure.

335
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,989
We have one donor heart
and two babies who need it.

336
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,449
It's up to us to decide
which baby gets this heart.

337
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:36,905
Jack has been waiting
for three months.

338
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:38,467
A transplant is his only option.

339
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,514
He could go on a VAD until
another heart is available.

340
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,028
That could take months. And a VAD isn't
a good option for Jack because of the...

341
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,968
Morgan. Morgan.

342
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,677
You can't be here.
Neither of you.

343
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:49,899
I can't be anywhere else,

344
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,707
so either someone
should sedate me or...

345
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:54,210
Well, that can be arranged.

346
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:58,429
It's only a problem
that Park and I are here

347
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,195
if we influence your
decision, so don't let us.

348
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,166
I won't say a word.

349
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,399
Dr. Kalu?

350
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,132
Yeah, um

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,891
as far as the VAD for
Jack, he's underweight,

352
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,841
so a high risk of complications,

353
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,625
infections, bleeding, stroke.

354
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,521
It's not a great option
for Eden, either.

355
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:27,545
Eden can go on ECMO
while we're waiting

356
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:29,286
for mechanical
replacement valves.

357
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,854
ECMO has risks, especially for
a baby with Turner syndrome.

358
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,116
And the longer she's on it,

359
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,814
the greater the risk of
serious complications.

360
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,797
The valves may not
get here in time.

361
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,976
Care to weigh in, Dr. Murphy?

362
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:50,133
Jack and Eden are
equally good matches

363
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:53,464
to the donor heart based
on size and blood type.

364
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,599
Anything else?

365
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,277
It's okay, Shaun.

366
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,354
Without this heart...

367
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:16,400
Jack will die.

368
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:21,643
Eden may also die without it.

369
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,277
But she has other options.

370
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:26,889
They are risky, but
they are options.

371
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:31,720
Jack should get the heart.

372
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,643
We'll put Eden on ECMO tonight.

373
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:47,431
And I'll contact Abbott about getting
the 15-millimeter valves ASAP.

374
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:01,813
Hey. I'm sorry. Can
we rain-check tonight?

375
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:04,424
I'm exhausted, and
Jerome promised

376
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,168
that we could watch a
nice crime procedural.

377
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,647
Sometimes you need
a case of the week.

378
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:11,542
Yeah.

379
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,544
Mm-hmm.

380
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:18,700
Mmm! My favorite!

381
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:21,137
One cheddar brisket
with mild sauce

382
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:24,270
so little Steve's next meal
doesn't burn his mouth.

383
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:26,775
You are a treasure.
I am starving.

384
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:29,647
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

385
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,019
Poor Eden, having to go on ECMO.

386
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:35,717
And poor Morgan and Park.

387
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:38,284
It's... been a day.

388
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:41,602
And how are you holding
up? Without Perez?

389
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:49,339
Everything that happens,
at home or at work,

390
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:51,515
he's the first person
I want to tell.

391
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,583
Mm-hmm.

392
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,171
And I can't.

393
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,587
Or I shouldn't.

394
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,851
I really miss him.

395
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,699
You can tell <i>me</i> everything.

396
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:03,788
If it's too surgical, I
may not understand it,

397
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:07,357
but I am excellent at nodding
and acting interested.

398
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,686
Mm!

399
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:11,864
I'm here for you. So is Asher.

400
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,888
What's going on?

401
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:18,784
Tell me. Babies are
terrible at gossip.

402
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:23,460
Asher and I were supposed
to hang out tonight,

403
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:24,766
just the two of us.

404
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,159
Do you need to check on him?

405
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,987
No. If he smells me, I'll
never get out of there.

406
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,510
He'll settle back down.

407
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:32,599
So you and Asher had plans...

408
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,732
He blew me off for Jerome

409
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:37,779
because he had a hard day
on Eden's case, which I get,

410
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:39,084
but I had a hard day, too.

411
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:41,328
Mm-hmm.

412
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:44,481
Steve's not settling.

413
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:46,570
Well, he can wait a minute.
You had a hard day, too?

414
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:49,510
It... It just seems like
everybody has someone except...

415
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:55,057
- Go.
- I am so sorry.

416
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,170
I-I will be right back. I swear.

417
00:21:58,432 --> 00:21:59,737
Mm.

418
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:13,849
You didn't have
to do this, Shaun.

419
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,582
I am more thorough than
anyone else in this hospital.

420
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,890
Starting ECMO.

421
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,107
I just got an e-mail
from Gail on the board.

422
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,327
I'm suddenly a top candidate
for interim president?

423
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:49,439
You're welcome.

424
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:52,201
I don't want that job.

425
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:55,421
It's better... better
you than O'Brien.

426
00:22:55,445 --> 00:22:57,075
You're a good manager, you're

427
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,860
you're well-respected,

428
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:00,862
and, you know, as
a diverse woman...

429
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:02,167
People aren't diverse.

430
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:03,952
I'm part of an
underrepresented group.

431
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:05,170
Right. That.

432
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:06,519
Makes you an ideal candidate.

433
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:08,913
Look. Gail loved the idea.

434
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,504
- I hate you.
- You're welcome.

435
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,857
Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

436
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,403
I am glad to see you, Steve,

437
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:22,405
but you are not
supposed to be awake.

438
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:24,624
Yeah, I-I fell asleep
during his afternoon nap.

439
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,017
We didn't wake up until 4:30.

440
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,150
You need to set an alarm.

441
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,413
The schedule is very important.

442
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:32,265
I know. I know.

443
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,595
Tomorrow I am doing
a heart transplant

444
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,553
on a 12-week-old baby.

445
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:42,642
Okay. You need sleep.

446
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,992
Yes, I do.

447
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:47,909
Go to bed. I'll
handle Steve tonight.

448
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:49,954
I-I don't think I can.

449
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,869
Shh, it's okay. What about your
noise-canceling headphones?

450
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:54,828
I fall asleep on my side.
I cannot do that in those.

451
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,222
Maybe you could go spend
the night at Glassman's?

452
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:59,398
No.

453
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:01,555
What about your office?
Can you sleep there?

454
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:51,233
We can save them
both with one heart.

455
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,516
It's called a domino transplant.

456
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,362
Jack's heart is failing,
but his valves are healthy,

457
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:02,887
so when Jack receives
the donor heart,

458
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,305
we will use his valves to
replace Eden's damaged ones.

459
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,133
A fresh homograft donor
means Eden won't need

460
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,410
multiple surgeries
or blood thinners.

461
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:11,224
One heart could
save both babies.

462
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,792
What are the chances
of valve failure?

463
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,968
Minimal. Jack's valves
are very functional

464
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,796
despite his cardiomyopathy.

465
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,537
The odds of success are high.

466
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,693
It's the best option we have,

467
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:23,608
for Eden.

468
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,587
And for Jack?

469
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:29,851
We would have to be very
careful while removing his heart

470
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,418
so as not to damage his valves.

471
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:34,160
That would mean
more time on bypass,

472
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,224
which means a greater risk
of bleeding or infection.

473
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,078
It's a lot to ask.

474
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,104
They can always say no.

475
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,411
What would <i>you</i> say?

476
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,098
You haven't eaten
anything in 24 hours.

477
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,297
I'm fine.

478
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:04,669
No matter what they decide,
we'll get through this.

479
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:05,844
Don't.

480
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,411
What, try to help?

481
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,438
Yes, exactly. It's
pointless and annoying.

482
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:15,245
You know, I get that you don't
think of Eden as mine yet,

483
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,116
and that's why you
haven't included me

484
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,771
in any of her medical decisions.

485
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,294
Not that I need that,

486
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,296
or disagree with any
of your choices...

487
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,950
Is pissing me off another
attempt to distract me?

488
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,473
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

489
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,997
I just want you to know
that I love that girl

490
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,588
like she's my own, and...

491
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,698
I'm as scared as you are.

492
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:36,246
And I wish you'd let
me help you because

493
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,139
we're in this together.

494
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,251
That's it.

495
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,144
And I really don't
want you to pass out,

496
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:46,735
so please eat or
drink something.

497
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:59,748
If our baby can save your
baby's life, we'd be honored.

498
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,563
"I'll love you forever,

499
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:14,608
I'll like you for always.

500
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:18,636
"As long as I'm living,
my baby you'll be."

501
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:27,123
Oh, my God. What a tear-jerker.

502
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,277
We need to find one of
Daddy's medical journals.

503
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,670
<i>Reminder.</i>

504
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,652
<i>Nap time in five minutes.</i>

505
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:43,855
How do I un-sync the baby
app from our speaker?

506
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,771
Oh, no. You should not do that.

507
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:49,426
I set it up so you can
remember the schedule.

508
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,298
When it's just me and
Steve home during the day,

509
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:55,432
I like to be a little
bit more... flexible,

510
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:56,607
go with the flow.

511
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,478
I'll just... I'll
just unplug it.

512
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:01,873
It has a battery in
case of power outages.

513
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:05,529
Lea, when I'm at work,

514
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:07,879
I like knowing what you
and Steve are doing.

515
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:11,298
It makes me feel like I am
still a part of his day.

516
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:14,842
And when Steve gets
off his sleep schedule,

517
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:16,366
I have to go sleep
at the hospital,

518
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,716
and I miss you both even more.

519
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,893
Aw, we missed you,
too. How did you sleep?

520
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:25,723
Not well. But I came up with a
very good idea to save both babies.

521
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,855
I have to go prep for my
surgery now. I love you.

522
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,771
Dr. Lim, we have a
meeting to review...

523
00:28:30,795 --> 00:28:32,556
One minute, Shaun.

524
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,907
Gail, of course, diversity and
representation should be considered,

525
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,648
but given this is
an interim position,

526
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:39,911
I think the top priority
is finding someone

527
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:42,217
who can hit the ground
running from day one.

528
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,958
And that means someone
who's done it before.

529
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:46,047
He's too modest to
sing his own praises,

530
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,919
but I think he's
the obvious choice.

531
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,748
Hmm. Compelling
argument. Thank you.

532
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,011
Oh.

533
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:57,450
And seniors are also an
underrepresented group.

534
00:28:57,474 --> 00:29:00,453
<i>Dr. Murphy and I will
start with Jack in OR 1.</i>

535
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:03,021
Asher, you'll be with Eden
next door getting her ready.

536
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,893
Allen and Kalu, you two
will receive the donor heart

537
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,286
and prep it for transplant.

538
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,681
Then Dr. Lim and I
will put Jack on bypass

539
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,509
and start cooling
him to 25 degrees.

540
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,641
Given his age and underlying
medical condition,

541
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:18,297
he should not be on bypass
for longer than two hours.

542
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:21,213
Putting in Jack's new heart
will take about 90 minutes.

543
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:24,259
That leaves us half an
hour to remove the old one.

544
00:29:24,283 --> 00:29:26,566
While Shaun is
transplanting the new heart,

545
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,786
I will be excising
Jack's valves.

546
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,942
We have zero room for error.

547
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,945
Prep your patients.

548
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,603
Exciting case.

549
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,389
Yep.

550
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:45,150
We're saving two babies at once,

551
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,089
and your commentary is "yep"?

552
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:49,807
I was agreeing with you.

553
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,548
With as few words as possible,

554
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:53,965
which you've been doing
for the last two weeks.

555
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:58,317
If you have a problem
with me, just tell me.

556
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:01,712
Okay.

557
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,038
Okay. I have a problem with you

558
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:05,692
and how you handled
Perez's case.

559
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,955
- That's completely stupid.
- You just said I should tell you.

560
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,566
I didn't say I would
agree with you.

561
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,089
You overrode our
patient's wishes,

562
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,220
and Perez is gone because of it.

563
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,005
Perez is <i>alive</i> because of it.

564
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,589
You don't know what would have
happened if you'd listened to him.

565
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,401
You made the decision
you thought was best.

566
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:20,577
Didn't matter what
anyone else wanted.

567
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:22,143
I'm sorry, but you
don't get to do that

568
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,797
and not deal with
the consequences.

569
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,973
The consequences?

570
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:28,193
I lost someone I
care about a lot,

571
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:31,326
and I miss him every day.

572
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,765
I'm really trying hard to focus
on the good things in my life,

573
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,593
the job I love,

574
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:40,423
the friends I <i>thought</i> I had...

575
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:45,147
But it feels like everyone is
moving on, and I'm just alone.

576
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:51,153
Spare yourself the
burden of punishing me.

577
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,877
Get her prepped, draped,
and under anesthesia.

578
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,729
I'll see you in 30
minutes, hopefully.

579
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,832
I had an extra set.

580
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,567
You don't have to be Catholic.

581
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,942
They can just be a reminder
that you're not alone.

582
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:27,593
Thank you.

583
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:50,893
There is a lot of scar
tissue to dissect through.

584
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,295
The cardiomyopathy has caused
Jack's heart to enlarge

585
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,277
and adhere to his chest wall.

586
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:58,358
This will take
longer than planned

587
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,579
in order to preserve the valves.

588
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:01,972
We inspected the mitral valve.

589
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:04,149
The atrial septum is intact.
The heart looks good.

590
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,022
Dr. Allen, connect
the pulmonary veins

591
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,242
to prep the left atrial cuff.

592
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,508
Dr. Kalu, you're with us.

593
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,972
Okay. Increase flows
and cool to 25 degrees.

594
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:15,831
Start the clock.

595
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,454
Come on, Peanut.

596
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:25,196
We went with the flow,
but now it's nap time.

597
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:28,051
Come on. Settle.

598
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:29,485
Oh.

599
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,860
Ohh! We were so close, Peanut.

600
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:38,677
I need to transect the aorta,

601
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:41,115
but there are thick adhesions
where it meets the valve.

602
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,630
You now only have an hour and 14
minutes to put the new heart in.

603
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:46,765
The annulus is at the
tip of my dissection.

604
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:49,873
If I nick that, the
aortic valve is useless.

605
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:52,084
Anterior retraction.
We're running out of time.

606
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:53,779
Jack's transplant
is at serious risk.

607
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,172
Metz.

608
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:57,662
Dr. Murphy, you need to
abort this procedure.

609
00:32:57,687 --> 00:33:00,537
Shaun, ECMO is still
an option for Eden.

610
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,259
- You need to abort...
- Got it!

611
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:09,145
The valves are good.

612
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,595
Ready for the donor heart.

613
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:21,780
How is she? Ready to go.

614
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:22,880
Vitals are great.

615
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:24,777
Open her chest and
start her on bypass

616
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,301
while I recover the valves.

617
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:28,999
Scalpel. How do the valves look?

618
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,001
A little bigger than
we measured on imaging.

619
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:33,525
Makes the anastomosis
challenging.

620
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,986
But it can still work?

621
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,969
It has to.

622
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:43,854
Hmm.

623
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,020
<i>Feeding time starting
in five minutes.</i>

624
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:51,567
Shh.

625
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:57,553
It's not seating perfectly.

626
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,216
Let's try a purse string suture.

627
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,852
7-0 Prolene.

628
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:10,746
Got it. Saline.

629
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:17,317
There's a paravalvular
leak at the aortic.

630
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,730
How about pledgeted sutures?

631
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:23,560
In an infant this small,
that could cause stenosis.

632
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:25,483
We try again.

633
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,568
7-0 Prolene.

634
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:31,217
It's been almost two
and a half hours.

635
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:32,436
We need to get him off bypass.

636
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,483
The aortic anastomosis
is complete.

637
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:36,728
Unclamp the aorta
and start rewarming.

638
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:39,641
Now what?

639
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:45,483
We wait... and hope his
heart starts beating.

640
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:02,523
It's been almost three hours.
Do you think something's wrong?

641
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,770
The sutures are holding.

642
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:19,315
Now the little thing
just has to beat.

643
00:35:20,747 --> 00:35:22,966
Start warming her up.
Decrease the flows.

644
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
We need to shock him.

645
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:42,383
Clear!

646
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,153
Again.

647
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,745
The surgeries were successful.

648
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,290
Both your babies are doing very
well, and you can see them soon.

649
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,324
Thank you.

650
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:15,235
Thank you.

651
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,298
You saved our daughter.

652
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:22,641
You are welcome.

653
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:26,967
I miss <i>my</i> baby.
I'm going home now.

654
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,820
All right. Let me just
jump in the shower.

655
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,430
And then I'm good to go.

656
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:39,890
Go home to your man.

657
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,023
It's okay.

658
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,001
Bless you.

659
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,069
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

660
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,133
You're right.

661
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:08,049
This chorizo is...

662
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:09,963
What'd you call it?

663
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,159
Bussin'.

664
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:13,271
Right.

665
00:37:14,403 --> 00:37:15,622
Definitely bus sin'.

666
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,324
I thought we could
share an order.

667
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,208
Tell me you didn't
forget the hot sauce.

668
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:50,328
- Hello.
- Hmm...

669
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,223
Why is Steve awake?

670
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:54,878
You look terrible.

671
00:37:55,836 --> 00:37:58,012
Thank you.

672
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,644
Steve has been fed,
burped, changed,

673
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:03,950
and woken from his haphazard nap

674
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:05,759
by a speaker reminder.

675
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:09,739
How's Eden?

676
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:12,785
Very good. And Jack's
transplant was successful.

677
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:14,831
Mm.

678
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:17,355
Parenting can be very hard.

679
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,400
Mm-hmm.

680
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,664
Yeah. I've noticed.

681
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:25,711
There are many hard choices

682
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:29,149
about what works best.

683
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,827
People want different things.

684
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,266
I will try to

685
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,228
make room for your way.

686
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:44,208
The schedule is important,

687
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:46,539
but I will un-sync the
app from the speaker.

688
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:50,064
I put it out on the fire escape.

689
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:53,764
Thank you.

690
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:55,816
I really appreciate it.

691
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,846
But the only room I need
right now is the bedroom.

692
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:05,576
- Okay.
- Good night.

693
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm borrowing your
noise-canceling headphones.

694
00:39:07,864 --> 00:39:09,257
I love you both.

695
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,514
Are you kidding me?
You recommended <i>me?</i>

696
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:31,516
I was just following
your example.

697
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,909
See? You're a natural leader.

698
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,607
I'm old. I'm worn
out and I'm old.

699
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:37,653
- You're <i>wise.</i>
- I remember rotary phones.

700
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:39,742
You're vital.
You're experienced.

701
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,092
You're the most respected
doctor in this hospital.

702
00:39:42,116 --> 00:39:43,920
Aaron, you have
institutional knowledge

703
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:46,966
and a... and a natural,
unexplainable gravitas.

704
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,665
Will you please stop being an
idiot and just take the job?

705
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:50,927
Stop being selfish and stubborn.

706
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,711
How am I being selfish? I'm...

707
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:54,781
Oh, you're together.
That saves me a stop.

708
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:58,927
Your recommendations
presented the board

709
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:00,389
with a very difficult choice.

710
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:02,629
So we didn't

711
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:04,593
choose.

712
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:07,378
You two are the new
interim co-presidents

713
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:08,925
of St. Bonaventure Hospital.

714
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:13,364
Congratulations!

715
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,089
This is not the schedule, Steve.

716
00:40:23,113 --> 00:40:25,962
Mommy needs to sleep.
Daddy needs to sleep.

717
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:27,509
You need to sleep.

718
00:40:29,032 --> 00:40:31,054
Please?

719
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,733
Please. We are both very tired.

720
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:38,627
Please. We are both very tired.

721
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,000
Hey.

722
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:50,726
I don't know what to do.

723
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,599
I can't go inside because
Lea needs to sleep.

724
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:57,539
I've always been able
to get him down before.

725
00:40:59,062 --> 00:41:01,369
Sometimes babies
just need to cry.

726
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,028
Hey. Um

727
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,356
why don't I take him?

728
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,816
Get some sleep.

729
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,909
It's okay. Just get some rest.

730
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:24,479
I will just take a short nap.

731
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,310
Take as long as you need.

732
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,705
Hey.

733
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,126
Hey. I got you. Hey.

734
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:39,755
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

735
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,128
I got you.

736
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:47,241
Huh. I got you.

737
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:54,892
I'm Grandpa

738
00:41:56,442 --> 00:41:57,791
in case you were wondering.
