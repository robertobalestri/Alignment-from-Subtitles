1
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:14,684
Did he finish his...

2
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:17,118
What are you doing?

3
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:22,112
Steve has little vocalization,
is fixated on ceiling fans,

4
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,027
and makes eye contact
less than 10%.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,294
He's a baby.

6
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:26,661
And as his daycare noted,

7
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,764
he is not upset
when his parents leave.

8
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,157
He's a happy baby.
That's not a symptom.

9
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:32,459
Autistic children
often demonstrate

10
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:34,619
less attachment
to significant...

11
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:36,713
Shaun, you know a six-month-old

12
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:38,607
cannot be diagnosed
with autism.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,610
Not definitively, but it is
important to look for signs.

14
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:44,213
Which may not appear
for another 18 months.

15
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,685
I would still like to consult
a pediatric neurologist.

16
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,422
No. No matter what they say,

17
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:53,855
you'll still be
looking for signs,

18
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,962
you'll still be trying to
find out what's wrong with him.

19
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,019
Not wrong. Just different.

20
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:04,319
You're right. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:05,547
It's just...

22
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:10,772
I don't want to be
evaluating him

23
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:13,376
every time he smiles
or he looks at a ceiling fan.

24
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,244
I just want to enjoy the magic

25
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,346
of watching our baby
experience the world.

26
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:23,486
Ignoring the possibility
may help you feel better,

27
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,021
but it will not help Steve.

28
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:27,856
I have to go to work. Goodbye.

29
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,633
Can you grab more diapers
on the way home tonight?

30
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:40,336
And salsa for Taco Tuesday.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,405
-Chunky, not the smooth kind.
-Yep.

32
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:44,940
And can you skip your workout
tomorrow morning?

33
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:46,209
It's leg day.

34
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:48,559
We need to be
at the courthouse at 8:00 a.m.

35
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:49,955
Courthouse?

36
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,115
To get married.

37
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,483
Our attorney says
a marriage license

38
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:55,219
will expedite
the adoption process.

39
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,319
We can carpool.

40
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,620
I don't want to get married
as an item on your to-do list.

41
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:01,524
Actually,
it's on our need-to-do list.

42
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,792
Okay, this is more than
an administrative appointment.

43
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:08,375
It needs music, flowers,
romance, something... special.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,596
I'll get you a boutonniere
and a harmonica.

45
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:12,401
The other stuff
we don't have time for.

46
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:13,668
Then we should make time.

47
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,471
Just like I'm making time
for leg day.

48
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,131
Did he swallow anything?

49
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:22,311
No.

50
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:25,281
He... He has asthma,
but his inhaler's not helping.

51
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,681
Get a suprasternal view.

52
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,142
Holy cow, he has a third arm.

53
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:34,579
That's his <i>aburo.</i>

54
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,992
His "little brother."

55
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:39,162
-You speak Yoruba?
-My father's Nigerian.

56
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:43,065
I only speak six words.
Seven counting <i>aburo.</i>

57
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,002
They say his little arm is
all that's left of his <i>ibeji.</i>

58
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:48,139
His twin.

59
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:49,739
Eight.

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,575
He's too constricted
to intubate.

61
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,810
Okay, bag mask ventilate.
He needs a tracheostomy, stat!

62
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,654
Mason Landover, 41.

63
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,821
Severe neck, back,
and extremity pain.

64
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:09,691
I'm gonna feel for
tenderness along your spine.

65
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,427
Anything that could be
causing this pain?

66
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,662
Well, I just spent eight months

67
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,197
on the
International Space Station.

68
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,332
Whoa. Like, <i>space</i> space?

69
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,167
Yeah, I'm a botanist.

70
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,702
Studying the effects
of zero gravity on soybeans.

71
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,804
Selected from
hundreds of others for the job.

72
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:24,839
That could
explain the pain.

73
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,043
Returning to Earth's gravity
puts enormous stress
on the joints.

74
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:28,511
It was worth it.

75
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:30,912
He can barely walk.

76
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:34,083
And he's had a bunch
of other health problems
since coming back.

77
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,152
Palpate arms and legs for pain.

78
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,088
Low gravity
decreases bone mass.

79
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:41,190
We should do a DEXA scan
to assess how much he's lost.

80
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:42,891
Oh!

81
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,694
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

82
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:48,397
Skip the bone scan.
Let's head right to the OR.

83
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:04,913
Tracheostomy tube.

84
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,156
And the bronchoscope
is in.

85
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,359
Let's find out what's causing
his breathing problems.

86
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:19,462
Have either of you
seen a third arm before
in person?

87
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,364
I have seen
a third thumb,

88
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,099
a third kidney,
and a third nipple.

89
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:26,168
Must be tough
for the kid, living with that.

90
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:28,738
Not if he learns
to embrace his differences.

91
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,940
Do you think we should
get Steve tested for ASD?

92
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:33,942
Attempting
a diagnosis at Steve's age

93
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,910
will likely lead
to a misdiagnosis,

94
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,779
and then you'll likely
be disappointed

95
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,715
if you discover that your child
is just typical.

96
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,183
Approaching
bifurcation.

97
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,951
There it is.

98
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,621
Constriction coming from
outside the trachea.

99
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:49,659
Something very strange

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,494
is going on
inside Tayo's chest.

101
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:58,100
Hey.

102
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:00,336
So, your recovery is going
very nicely.

103
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,771
We can discharge you now.

104
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,773
Oh. Cool.

105
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:07,243
What's next for you?

106
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:08,977
Like?

107
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:11,913
Like? Like, where are
you gonna be living?

108
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,316
What are you gonna do
for money?

109
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,151
Do you have any friends
out there that can help you?

110
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:16,851
I'll be okay.

111
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,624
Uh, I just need something
for the pain.

112
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,793
I can give you Tylenol.

113
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:26,162
No, that's not gonna be enough.

114
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,138
Hannah, you just had
a very successful surgery.

115
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,873
Your neuro exam
is completely normal now.

116
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,376
You don't need
anything stronger.

117
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,611
Yes, I do. I do.

118
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,181
You just want the oxy?

119
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:46,881
Yeah, because I'm in pain.

120
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:47,849
Because you're an addict.

121
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,120
Thank you for everything.

122
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,824
Hold on. Hold on, Hannah.
Hold on a second.

123
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,494
I'm just trying to help here.

124
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:02,864
Are you hungry?

125
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:06,836
I could eat.

126
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:09,739
Great.

127
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,843
I-I can't believe
I broke his arm.

128
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,444
Not your fault.

129
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,646
He must have lost
a lot of bone mass in space.

130
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,850
Do you and Morgan
still need me to watch Eden
tomorrow morning

131
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,551
while you get married?

132
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:25,154
No.
 Because we're not getting married tomorrow morning.

133
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,856
You can place the last screw.

134
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,657
I don't know much
about weddings,

135
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,926
but it seems like agreeing on
a date is a prerequisite.

136
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,131
He's in V-tach
and hypotensive.

137
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,898
Push lidocaine.

138
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,267
He's coding.
Defibrillator pads.

139
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,105
150. Clear.

140
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,843
Charge to 200.

141
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:48,878
Clear.

142
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:54,983
Normal sinus rhythm.

143
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:56,852
Did I almost kill him?

144
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,421
No.

145
00:06:58,554 --> 00:06:59,889
But we need to figure out
what almost did.

146
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:07,763
Tayo doesn't have asthma.

147
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,098
Because of his third arm,

148
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,633
he has an unusually large
blood vessel

149
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,902
compressing his trachea
and constricting his air flow.

150
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:14,670
We placed a tracheal stent
to relieve the pressure,

151
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:16,705
but that is a temporary fix.

152
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,474
We can't remove the vessel

153
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,810
because that supplies blood
to both left-side arms.

154
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,011
But we can't leave it as it is

155
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,646
because he can't
breathe properly.

156
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,649
We need to remove
one of his arms.

157
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,083
A blood-flow test will--

158
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:30,619
We talked about this.
His big arm should go.

159
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,088
We talked. We never agreed.

160
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,956
I want to remove
the little arm.

161
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,260
The big arm can't hold a pencil
or squeeze a hand or--

162
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:40,129
The little arm
is not much better.

163
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:41,723
He doesn't want to lose
his little brother.

164
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,851
Without his big arm,

165
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,066
do you know how odd
he will look?

166
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,857
Okay. Stop talking.

167
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,938
We need to do
a Doppler ultrasound

168
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:50,031
to test the blood flow.

169
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,104
That is how we will choose.

170
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,154
The echo showed he has
a dilated heart chamber.

171
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:04,923
It's causing arrhythmias.

172
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,125
We'll have to implant
a defibrillator.

173
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:09,260
Is this
from being in space, too?

174
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:10,295
Most likely.

175
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,822
In zero gravity, the heart
can weaken significantly.

176
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:16,734
Ana, I'm gonna be fine.

177
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:18,744
They warned me
my body would change.

178
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:20,563
Not just your body.

179
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:23,353
Let's talk about this later.

180
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,110
Mason's been
a totally different person

181
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,078
since his return.

182
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:30,400
I think something's off
with him mentally.

183
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:33,184
What's off about wanting
more time with you?

184
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:37,589
More time with me means I give up
a dream fellowship in Buenos Aires,

185
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:41,527
so we can both stay here and take care
of the children you now suddenly want?

186
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:44,186
 Being up there made me realize
what's important.

187
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:46,675
Putting down roots,
starting a family.

188
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,058
So, give me a brain scan.

189
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,784
Show her this isn't
just some tumor talking.

190
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,419
We need a medical reason.

191
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:59,637
Marital disputes don't count.

192
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,114
Right now we need to implant
the defibrillator.

193
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:12,200
So, what's your sport?

194
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,374
Your jacket. It's yours, right?

195
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:19,864
Oh! Um, yeah. Uh, track.

196
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:21,199
Ah.

197
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,193
Four-by. I ran anchor.

198
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,003
What's your PR in the hundred?

199
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,026
12.2.

200
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,117
12.2? That's like
scholarship speed.

201
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:33,986
UC Davis
offered me a full ride.

202
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,968
Huh.

203
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,928
It meant having to live
in Davis.

204
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,152
Are you a big fan of track
or something?

205
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,800
I used to be.

206
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,654
What about your folks?
They live around here?

207
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:49,827
You ask
a lot of questions.

208
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:52,530
Okay, well, let me see if I can
answer some of them.

209
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:54,574
You're living on the street.

210
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,835
You're panhandling
or, worse, stealing,

211
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:00,505
and you have absolutely no one
who can help you.

212
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,540
Well, I live
in an '04 Dodge Neon

213
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,217
with a really sweet
rear spoiler.

214
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:10,048
I have a job at Goodwill,
part-time.

215
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:12,884
And I probably have
more friends than you do.

216
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,373
You're probably
right about that.

217
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,536
What about recovery?

218
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,154
I have it under control.

219
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:26,264
Well, you have to go to rehab.
You know that, right?

220
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:28,199
I tried quitting.
It didn't work for me.

221
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,434
Because you need rehab.

222
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,502
You can't do this alone.
No one can do this...

223
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:35,058
No... No one should have to
do this on their own.

224
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,108
Thanks for the pancakes.

225
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,827
Whatever you thought was gonna happen,
it's not happening.

226
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:41,554
 Sorry, what...

227
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,175
What the hell does that mean?

228
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,122
Wow, okay.

229
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,168
My daughter died
of an overdose, okay?

230
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,235
She thought
she had it under control.

231
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,457
So, you know...

232
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,479
Her PR was 12.8, by the way.

233
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:18,238
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

234
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:20,860
My number's on that card.

235
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:22,309
If you need a meal...

236
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,126
reach out.

237
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,425
What the hell
are you doing?

238
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,775
I'm proposing,
you idiot.

239
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,645
Alex Park, will you marry me?

240
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:21,613
You wanted music.

241
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:22,970
I wanted sincerity,

242
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:25,736
not the song that ruined
<i>Moulin Rouge!</i>  for me.

243
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,334
Just say yes already.

244
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:33,191
You sure know how to make
a girl feel special.

245
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,144
 This will show which arm
has better blood flow.

246
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,841
That will help decide
which one to amputate.

247
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,972
Are you feeling sad, Tayo?

248
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,085
Because you are losing an arm?

249
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,465
Dr. Murphy and I
have a condition

250
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:07,723
that sometimes makes it hard
for us to understand

251
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,883
what other people are feeling.

252
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,007
Can you tell us
why you're feeling sad?

253
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,476
My parents.

254
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,874
They fight a lot about my arm.

255
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:25,059
What school I should go to.
Who I should play with.

256
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,479
I make them unhappy.

257
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:34,208
When parents fight
about their child,

258
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,554
it's their fault,

259
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:38,016
not the child's.

260
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,337
Does it say which one
to cut off?

261
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:45,329
Not yet.

262
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,577
Which one would you choose?

263
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,161
It doesn't matter.

264
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,841
No matter what I say,
my parents will be upset.

265
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,678
<i>I know. I know.</i>

266
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,647
Okay, but a doctor is
just gonna want to run tests,

267
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,701
then they refer you to
another doctor for more tests,

268
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:04,879
and we can't afford that.

269
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:07,026
He needs help, Ethan,
and we have no idea--

270
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:08,519
No, what he needs
is discipline.

271
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:10,645
I don't need tests
to tell me that.

272
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,211
Entering the right
cardiac ventricle.

273
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:34,713
Leads placed.

274
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,014
Remove the sheaths and
connect the defibrillator leads.

275
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:39,852
Doesn't seem like a crazy ask,

276
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,680
wanting your wife
to bend a bit.

277
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:45,059
But if they love each other,
they'll compromise.

278
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
Fluoro looks good.

279
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,186
Tough to compromise
when one party is reasonable

280
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,880
and the other just isn't.

281
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,572
Like when one party

282
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:55,350
does an amazing,
romantic public proposal,

283
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,777
and the other one
just leaves them hanging?

284
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:57,933
It wasn't romantic.

285
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,446
It was transactional
and manipulative,

286
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:00,945
and I'm proud I didn't give in.

287
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,300
You're
a modern-day Gandhi.

288
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,452
This is
decerebrate posturing.

289
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,112
Something's jacking up
his intracranial pressure.

290
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:09,180
Push 75 grams mannitol.

291
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,772
Pupils non-reactive.

292
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,630
Pushing.

293
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:18,779
He's stabilizing.

294
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,961
This has nothing
to do with his heart.

295
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,162
Looks like he's getting
his brain scan after all.

296
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:52,732
<i>Okay, we're done.</i>

297
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,483
<i>Doctor can I just lie here</i>
<i>for a second?</i>

298
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,301
<i>-You all right?</i>
-Yeah, yeah.

299
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,537
It's just... it's ironic.

300
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,939
 I was remembering...

301
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:10,104
 looking at the most precious
thing in the universe

302
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:14,513
and realizing exactly what
I had to do with my life...

303
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,797
Get back to Ana.

304
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,231
Turns out the thing I thought
would bring us closer together

305
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:22,342
is actually the thing
that may break us up.

306
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,315
<i>Uh, did you figure out</i>
<i>what's wrong with my head?</i>

307
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,105
You have hydrocephalus...

308
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,667
excess fluid
compressing your brain.

309
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,461
A delayed reaction
to being in space.

310
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,169
We have to install
a shunt to drain it

311
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,697
before it damages your brain.

312
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:47,117
The blood flow
is 8% better in the little arm.

313
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,028
So we should amputate
the big arm.

314
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,387
Should have done this
years ago.

315
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:53,380
For only 8%?

316
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,389
If you are going to
keep arguing,

317
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,822
we should move to
where Tayo can't see you.

318
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:00,310
He thinks he makes you unhappy.

319
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,412
And that makes him sad.

320
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,380
He said this to you?

321
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:07,039
Yes.

322
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,411
Can we remove the big arm?

323
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,217
Yes.

324
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:23,509
I will schedule
the surgery for tomorrow.

325
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,472
Could the hydrocephalus
explain his personality change?

326
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:38,199
No. Based on
his post-landing test,

327
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,607
hydrocephalus
is a recent issue.

328
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,349
You know the Overview Effect...

329
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:48,839
what many astronauts experience
when they see Earth from space?

330
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,804
Is that a medical condition?

331
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,437
No, but it is a real phenomenon

332
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:55,421
that can change
their priorities,

333
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,095
the way they want to live
their lives.

334
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,000
And it can be wonderful.

335
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,056
Assuming they want
their life to change.

336
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,634
I don't.

337
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,862
We had a great thing.

338
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:09,366
Mason pursued his research,
I pursued mine,

339
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,501
and we'd present at conferences
all over the world.

340
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,674
We flew coach, we stayed
at cheap little hotels,

341
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,795
  eating nothing but street food.

342
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,033
But we loved that life.

343
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,183
Seems like he's ready for more.

344
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:27,585
I've waited years
for this fellowship.

345
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:32,197
He knows
how important it is to me.

346
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:35,571
And what was important to me
used to be important to him.

347
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,895
You'll find a middle ground.

348
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,898
I'm not so sure.

349
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:03,319
<i>He's just not making</i>
<i>eye contact.</i>

350
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:04,754
He's tired.

351
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,054
I read this thing
in a magazine...

352
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,339
It's a way to get kids
to make eye contact.

353
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:09,514
What is it?

354
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:11,125
Shaun, look at me.

355
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,538
Hey.

356
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:14,797
Hello? Look at me.

357
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,042
-Aah!
-What are you doing?

358
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,903
-Relax, It's just water.
-He hates it.

359
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:22,780
Well, that's the point,
isn't it?

360
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,874
It's okay Shaun
he didn't mean it.

361
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,144
It's okay, Shaun.

362
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:29,257
It's okay.

363
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:35,438
We need to get a diagnosis from an
expert in autism as soon as possible.

364
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,408
  Any assessment before Steve
is two is a waste of time.

365
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:44,435
I discovered a new study
that uses fMRI imaging

366
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,759
to identify earlier predictors
of autism.

367
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,419
We can't subject Steve to that.

368
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,808
An fMRI is non-invasive
and harmless.

369
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,944
Not for a baby.
Steve would have to be sedated.

370
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:55,086
That is non-invasive
and harmless.

371
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:57,482
No, Shaun, I'm not signing
Steve up for any study.

372
00:19:57,585 --> 00:19:59,101
Okay. I can do it.

373
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,485
No.

374
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,985
This is not
the kind of decision

375
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,253
you can make on your own.

376
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:04,547
Neither can you.

377
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,056
That's why
we have to compromise.

378
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,950
I want to get Steve tested.

379
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,585
You do not.
How can we compromise?

380
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,920
I don't know.
I just... I just...

381
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:12,926
This... <i>This</i> doesn't
feel right to me.

382
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,252
-Why?
-I don't know.

383
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,446
That is not a reason.

384
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:19,795
I will make an appointment
for the study,

385
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,851
and if you think
of a reason before that--

386
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:22,965
No, Shaun!

387
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,742
We are not doing this!

388
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,883
You are being loud.

389
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,770
I am being loud
because you're not listening!

390
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,356
-We're not going to drug our baby...
-Okay, s-stop it.

391
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:32,173
-Stop... Stop talking!
-...and put him into a machine...

392
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,544
...just because you think that
that is what we need to be...

393
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:35,737
Stop... Stop talking!

394
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:46,867
I'm sorry. I...

396
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,803
After ligating nerves, arteries
and veins of the big arm,

397
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:03,347
we will amputate
at the mid humerus.

398
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,675
Maybe use some of the big arm's
skin for the closure?

399
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:07,971
Oh. That is a good idea.

400
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,779
Like <i>Bust 'Em Custom?</i>

401
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:15,150
It was a show where they took
two identical old cars

402
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,919
and stripped one
to restore the other.

403
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,354
Ah, you're into
car restoration?

404
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,121
No. But my dad was.

405
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,357
Whenever I'd feel anxious,

406
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,135
he'd put it on
and we'd watch it together.

407
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:26,696
My father was not supportive.

408
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,465
Mine was my biggest advocate.

409
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,076
Wouldn't it be awesome if we
could strip Tayo's big arm

410
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:36,302
to restore his little arm
to full capacity?

411
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,074
That would be awesome,

412
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,325
but the big arm
has neurological deficits

413
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,033
and atrophied muscles, so...

414
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:59,078
I think we need to strip
the other car!

415
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:02,909
I used a metaphor.

416
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:10,238
-Hey.
-Hey.

417
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:11,964
How did things end up
with Hannah?

418
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,890
Oh, she was
discharged yesterday.

419
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:17,513
I saw. Did she agree to any
follow-up addiction treatment?

420
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,716
I even bought her pancakes,
and I couldn't get through.

421
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,485
You...
You bought her breakfast?

422
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:23,653
More like brunch.

423
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,663
 You should stick
with the medicine

424
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,564
and let social services
do the rest.

425
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,190
- I mean, there are
rules for a reason.

426
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,392
Where would Shaun be
if I followed the rules?

427
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:33,374
-Shaun wasn't your patient.
-Excuse me.

428
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:35,364
Yes, hello?

429
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,401
Okay. Where... Where are you?
Are you okay?

430
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:42,316
Okay. I'll be right there.

431
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:49,214
This new surgery
is much more complicated.

432
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,850
There is a small chance that Tayo
will be left with only one working arm.

433
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,053
Then that is not an option.

434
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:56,817
He said the risk is small.

435
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,223
But Tayo
could end up worse off.

436
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:01,212
Or he could finally have
a proper-sized arm that works.

437
00:23:01,237 --> 00:23:03,192
That is what is important
to you? How it looks.

438
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:06,259
-That is not what--
-Stop arguing.

439
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,013
You should ask Tayo.

440
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:16,907
It is his life
you are fighting about.

441
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:29,488
Hey.

442
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,592
You okay?

443
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:36,970
It was the crappiest car ever.

444
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:38,531
Why...
would anyone...

445
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,737
Maybe it was
that sweet rear spoiler.

446
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,287
Hey, I know a-a shelter
on Lexington.

447
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:04,131
It's clean, it's secure.

448
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,901
No, I have a friend
I can stay with.

449
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,148
I just need a ride.

450
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,678
You were right.

451
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:23,285
And as humiliating as that was,
I deserved it.

452
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:26,546
But I am taking this seriously.

453
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:30,957
In World War I,

454
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:34,152
my great-grandfather survived
a winter in the trenches.

455
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,372
He met this lovely
French farm woman.

456
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:38,265
They fell in love.

457
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,306
When they were married, 
my great-grandmother gave him this ring.

458
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:44,029
And now I want to
give it to you.

459
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:48,891
Will you marry me?

460
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,711
For real.

461
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:53,998
I'm not gonna do
the whole knee thing again.

462
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:01,141
Yes. I will.

463
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:07,904
There's an inscription here.

464
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:12,084
Something like "MF... DR"?

465
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:13,959
I didn't notice.

466
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:17,162
Marie Francois and Daniel Reznick.
That's incredible.

467
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:20,563
It would be, except that it
actually says "Bunny Hearts Irv."

468
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,121
And let me rephrase...

469
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:23,759
No, I won't.

470
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,406
I spent my lunch hour
at a pawnshop

471
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,051
so you could feel romantic
about your second marriage.

472
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:32,612
Well, maybe if
my first marriage

473
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:35,101
had been a bit more romantic,
I wouldn't need a second one.

474
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,359
Oh!

475
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,837
I'm sleeping
in the guest room tonight.

476
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,330
I sleep better
without you anyway!

477
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,525
I could lose my big arm too?

478
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:49,205
Unlikely, but possible.

479
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,170
Your mother and I
fight far too much.

480
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:02,120
But it is because we both
care so much about you.

481
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,510
More than anything else
in the world.

482
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,382
But I know it makes you sad,

483
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:14,940
and that breaks my heart.

484
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,335
I am sorry, Tayo.

485
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,817
What do <i>you</i> want to do?

486
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:23,818
Hmm?

487
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:26,553
You're a big boy.

488
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:29,053
We want to hear what you think.

489
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:37,475
I don't want to say goodbye
to my little brother.

490
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:42,047
But I know he'll understand.

491
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:56,261
The shunt procedure
went very well.

492
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:57,128
How are you feeling?

493
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,463
Okay.

494
00:26:58,597 --> 00:26:59,699
Uh, where... where's Ana?

495
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,991
D-Did she "shay"...
s-she "shay"...

496
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,672
Mason?

497
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:09,941
Pupils are blown.

498
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,078
Pressure's back up, pumping.
OR now.

499
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:26,399
No, no, no, no.

500
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:28,893
You know what? There are
housing-first shelters

501
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,962
you don't even have to
be clean before you--

502
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:32,897
I know a guy who got stabbed
in one of them.

503
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,442
Right, like no one's ever
gonna get stabbed here.

504
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,398
My friend is waiting for me.
I wasn't lying about that.

505
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:44,042
I really appreciate
all you did.

506
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:47,125
You're a good person.

507
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,593
- Daddy, please!
- What are you doing?

508
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,485
- I can't believe
you're doing this.

509
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,765
I hate you!

510
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:12,804
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hannah?

511
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,976
Hey. Look...

512
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:20,362
I have a-a very comfortable
couch in my living room.

513
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:21,658
Nobody's using it.

514
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,983
What do you think?

515
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,049
Good morning.

516
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:47,440
Morning.

517
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,678
I wasn't lying
about the couch, was I?

518
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:51,812
You were not.

519
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,485
Payback.

520
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,037
Fantastic.

521
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:06,330
Unnecessary, but...

522
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,196
The key is adding
the chips by hand

523
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,731
after the batter's already
on the grill.

524
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:14,136
That way, there's no weird
clumps of chocolate.

525
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:16,404
I like to pay my own way.

526
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,274
Uh, there's a guy at work

527
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:22,276
who said he'll rent me
a room in his house.

528
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,311
I'm checking it out today.

529
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:26,480
You know what?

530
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:30,919
I can get you a bed
in the St. Bons rehab unit.

531
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:33,487
When I tried to quit,
it was the worst week
of my life.

532
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,123
Hmm.

533
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:36,557
Well, you can always stay here

534
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,825
until you get back
on your feet.

535
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,494
I don't feel good
putting you out.

536
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,363
It wouldn't put me out.
You just...

537
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:43,664
Couch is right there.

538
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,833
You can earn your keep
in pancakes.

539
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:50,571
I guess I could stay
one more night.

540
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:53,841
I'll even restock
the chocolate chips.

541
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,087
Is he okay?

542
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:06,387
When he was in space,

543
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,589
his brain shifted
due to the microgravity,

544
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,891
and now it's shifting back and
blocking the flow of the shunt.

545
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:14,096
And we need to remove
a piece of the skull
to relieve the pressure.

546
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:16,198
Could he die?

547
00:30:17,698 --> 00:30:19,935
This is a risky surgery.

548
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,203
But it's our best shot.

549
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:25,207
We need your consent.

550
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,614
Thank you.

551
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:44,792
Oh, God, and then I lost it,
and then Shaun lost it.

552
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,427
Now he's totally dug in,

553
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,429
but there's no way I'm gonna
let Steve do this study,

554
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:50,165
but he's being so unreasonable.

555
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:51,866
Why are you so worried
about this study?

556
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,236
It's way too early
for Steve to be tested.

557
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:56,037
And no matter what happens,
it'll label him.

558
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:58,073
And that's what you're
worried about, being labeled?

559
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,341
Once that happens,
he'll be seen as different.

560
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:02,610
-By whom?
-By everyone.

561
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:05,346
Since when are you
so concerned about everyone?

562
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:08,083
Since I became a mom?
I don't know. I...

563
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:09,918
How can I not?

564
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,255
You're a new parent.
That's scary.

565
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:16,024
But how often do we make
the right decision
when we're scared?

566
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,811
Isolating the median,
ulnar, and radial nerves

567
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:37,913
of the small arm.

568
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,749
Beginning side nerve transfer.

569
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,170
Goodbye, little brother.

570
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,476
Hey.

571
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,846
I might have been
a little tough on you
yesterday.

572
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,014
Tough I don't mind.

573
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,849
It's the ethics lecture
I can do without.

574
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,152
I just... I-I know
you want to do right by her.

575
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,797
It's fine.
You were trying to help.

576
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:19,809
I get it.

577
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:23,974
Do you think you'll ever
hear from her again?

578
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:26,551
Who knows?

579
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:41,343
Hey.

580
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,216
Hello.

581
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:00,561
Can... Can I have a kiss?

582
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:14,022
That was quite a thing
we had the other day.

583
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,321
When you raise your voice,
it makes me very upset.

584
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:20,248
I know.

585
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:23,151
We both got pretty emotional.

586
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,254
But I've been thinking.

587
00:33:27,486 --> 00:33:31,490
And I don't think it was
about you or the study

588
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:34,139
or even about us disagreeing,
not really.

589
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,399
It was about me.

590
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,435
A child on the spectrum
has so...

591
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:46,371
so many different needs than
a neurotypical child that I...

592
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:48,876
that I got scared.

593
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:53,415
I'm scared I might not
be up to it as a mom.

594
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:59,500
That doesn't make sense.

595
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,391
You are a very good mother,

596
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,485
and you are
very supportive of me.

597
00:34:08,562 --> 00:34:09,965
That's the thing
about being scared.

598
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,390
It doesn't always make sense.

599
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,443
Anyway, if you'd like,
we can try the study.

600
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,449
I would like
to make an appointment.

601
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:35,256
Thank you.

602
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:11,493
Hannah!

603
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,229
Hannah?

604
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,662
What?

605
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:18,413
What, what? What? No! No! No!

606
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,036
Hannah.

607
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:23,271
Hannah, Hannah.

608
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:45,166
Welcome back, Mason.

609
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:54,105
Pupils reactive.

610
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,506
Am I gonna be okay?

611
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,341
I wouldn't go into orbit again,

612
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,082
but if you stick to Earth,
you should be fine.

613
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:08,776
Hey.

614
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:09,900
Hey.

615
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:15,791
You remember that horrible
hotel in Dar es Salaam?

616
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:18,883
Every time they flushed
upstairs, our ceiling leaked.

617
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:24,734
You took the shower curtain
and tented it over our bed.

618
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:27,001
Said we were having a campout.

619
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:34,277
When I thought you were dying,

620
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:36,421
I had my own Overview Effect.

621
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:41,419
A world without you
would be so cold.

622
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:44,344
So empty.

623
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,429
I don't need to take that
fellowship in Buenos Aires.

624
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,488
But I'm not sure
about the kids.

625
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,336
Maybe we can start
with a puppy.

626
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:01,079
No, no.
W-We're going to Bueno Aires.

627
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:03,110
I-I'll take a sabbatical.

628
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:05,588
And the puppy.

629
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,527
Thank you, Dr. Murphy,
for your advice.

630
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,325
When you snapped at us
to stop fighting.

631
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:29,967
Simple, direct, and very wise.

632
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,016
It is very good advice.

633
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:52,778
Tayo.

634
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:20,585
You OD'd.

635
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:22,587
In my house.

636
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,757
Must have been fentanyl
in those pills.

637
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:33,262
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:37,767
You have any idea
how lucky you are?

639
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,671
That I happened to come home
when I did,

640
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:44,501
that I happened to have
naloxone in the house,

641
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:47,753
that there wasn't more fentanyl
in those damn pills?

642
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,731
This can't happen again.

643
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:02,155
I'll go.

644
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:04,503
No, no, no.

645
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,396
That's not what I meant.

646
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:13,371
I'm gonna write you
a prescription of oxycodone.

647
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:16,395
Really?

648
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:20,111
I can deal with you
being an addict.

649
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,080
I can't deal with you
being dead.

650
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,252
You can stay here until we figure
out a way to get you better.

651
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:32,757
I'm gonna give you
each pill on a schedule.

652
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,387
No more scores on the street.

653
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:38,763
Can't you get in trouble?

654
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:42,545
You let me worry about that.

655
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,157
How is he ever gonna be a man

656
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:06,650
if he can't even
look me in the eye?

657
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:08,586
He's just a little boy.

658
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,388
Yeah, and he's gonna stay that way
if you keep coddling him.

659
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,756
It's mint chip.

660
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:14,058
At least
I'm doing something!

661
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,620
Would you like
to get some ice cream?

662
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:41,542
After?

663
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:44,889
No.

664
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:47,313
Now.
