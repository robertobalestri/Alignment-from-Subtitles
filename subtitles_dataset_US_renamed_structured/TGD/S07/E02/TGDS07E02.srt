1
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:04,996
Grasp is good,

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:09,179
but Steve's not gaining weight
quite as quickly as I'd like.

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,834
I'm feeding him every two
to three hours during the day,

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,618
every three to four at night.

5
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:16,621
And pumping in between
to increase milk production.

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,536
Well, I'm going to recommend
you start supplementing with formula.

7
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,452
But everyone says
"breast is best"?

8
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,019
Breast milk is the ideal.

9
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,151
Right now, Steve just
needs a little extra.

10
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,066
Some samples to get you started.

11
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,068
This is an excellent product,

12
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:30,809
and it will make it
easier for me

13
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,376
to do more nighttime feedings.

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,336
Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,645
I thought being co-presidents

16
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,560
meant we would
do things <i>together.</i>

17
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,869
I was aiming for...

18
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,699
you do some things
and I do some things.

19
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,963
Funny how your "some things"
leads to more work for <i>me.</i>

20
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:55,878
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:58,924
The affiliation deal
with San Jose Med School?

22
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:02,188
We had to cover the overages
because the nurses unionized.

23
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,103
In exchange, we teach
a few med students.

24
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:06,279
You won't be teaching anyone.

25
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,672
<i>I</i> will have
the useless baby docs

26
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:09,500
wandering around the department

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,459
like lost children
with scalpels.

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,461
We made a good deal. That's it.

29
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:16,028
It's a good deal.

30
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:33,350
We should go
introduce ourselves.

31
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,874
No, they are baby ducklings,
and I will not be their mommy.

32
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,400
Let them imprint
on Shaun and Park.

33
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,403
Hi!

34
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,447
Bye.

35
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:52,935
Hi, I'm Dr. Park.
This is Doctor...

36
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,415
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

37
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,721
I... I can't believe
it's really you.

38
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:57,896
I'm just so excited,
I'm about to pee myself.

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,898
Please do not.

40
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:02,248
Of course not.
You're... You're not a shaker.

41
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,076
There was a March 2012 abstract

42
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:06,078
that demonstrated
a reluctance to shake hands

43
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:07,863
could be used as a diagnostic
marker for ASD.

44
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,168
But I love a good, firm grip.

45
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:10,082
That's why they call it
a spectrum.

46
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:11,475
We could shake.

47
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,086
That's not very firm.

48
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:15,218
Okay. That's better.

49
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,262
I'm Charlotte Lukaitis.

50
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,786
Nice to meet you, Charlotte.

51
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:19,657
I go by "Charlie" for now,
"Dr. Lukaitis" soon.

52
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:20,745
Only two years away
from my goal,

53
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:22,355
which I've had since I was 17,

54
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,922
ever since I saw that
viral video of you saving

55
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:25,315
that boy at the San Jose Airport

56
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:26,621
using a homemade one-way valve.

57
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:28,753
It was the coolest,
most heroic thing

58
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:30,320
I've ever seen
from a person with ASD.

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,148
It was very heroic.

60
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:33,366
I picked San Jose
for medical school

61
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,803
hoping to engineer
a run-in with you,

62
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,282
but then your hospital
partnered with my school,

63
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,893
and it's like what Taylor Swift
says in "Mastermind"...

64
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:39,721
Charlie.

65
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:42,550
Dom helps me when I,
you know, talk too much.

66
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,334
Hi, I'm Dominick Hubank.

67
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:47,424
And we're happy to have such
eager future doctors joining the team.

68
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,947
Future surgeon.

69
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,383
I don't want to be a surgeon,

70
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,472
but I'm excited
for the rotation.

71
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,126
Okay.

72
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,954
Charlie, you are on my team.

73
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:56,912
Yes!

74
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,884
Would you like to present?

75
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:13,624
I'd love to.

76
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:19,325
- Richard Shelford, 53...
- Call me Rich.

77
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,631
Not that I'm wealthy.

78
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:23,286
Right, Rich Shelford,
53 years old...

79
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,766
Don't feel a day over 52.

80
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:26,507
That's funny.

81
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,813
Okay. This is taking too long.

82
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:31,033
Please tell us what happened.

83
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,601
He was coughing so hard
he couldn't catch his breath,

84
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,211
and then he fainted
and hit his head.

85
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:36,865
Cough syncope.

86
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,694
He's thinner and way more tired

87
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,304
than the last time
he visited me.

88
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,740
Yeah, but I'm fine.

89
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,176
It's just a little cold.

90
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,744
You could barely breathe, Dad.

91
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,833
Um, chest X-ray shows
multiple lung nodules

92
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,965
and enlarged lymph nodes

93
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,749
in the hilar
and mediastinal areas.

94
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,708
Get an ABG, CBC,
perform a bronchoscopy,

95
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,274
and send biopsies to path.

96
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:57,320
Can you apply a wound dressing
using the Turban Technique?

97
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,408
I sure can.

98
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:03,587
Hey, uh...

99
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,415
how long until
we could get out of here?

100
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,809
My daughter, she took some time
off work to show me around.

101
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,593
She's got her own business.

102
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,813
Works as a tech consultant for a
few companies around the Valley.

103
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:13,858
- Dad.
- Let the man brag.

104
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,556
- It's every proud father's right.
- Yeah.

105
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,211
- Hold this, please.
- Oh.

106
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,954
<i>Basic Turban Technique
for head bandaging.</i>

107
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:26,654
<i>Step one, tie the ends of two
bandages together in a knot.</i>

108
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,612
<i>Step two,
starting from one ear...</i>

109
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:30,440
The patient
was a good sport about it,

110
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,659
but his daughter was not happy.

111
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,009
A wound dressing
is very low stakes.

112
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,838
Did Charlie do a bad job
following the tutorial?

113
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:39,536
Uh, no. Actually, the dressing
was pretty decent.

114
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,625
But the point is, the patient's
family were uncomfortable.

115
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:46,543
I think someone should tell her

116
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:48,284
no more how-to videos
in front of patients.

117
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,592
Oh. You can if you want.

118
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,641
We were able to repair
your skull fracture

119
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,600
and evacuate
a large subdural hematoma.

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,645
Lucky day.
Is there a Wi-Fi password?

121
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:02,603
I need to get
League Pass in here.

122
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,780
Uh, the accident report says

123
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,912
that you stepped right
in front of an oncoming car.

124
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:09,697
I just didn't see it.

125
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,350
Big day today.

126
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,483
I got the Clips and the points,
the money line, and the over.

127
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:15,398
And it's the last leg
of a six-team parlay

128
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,791
that I <i>need</i> to come through.

129
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,270
That's a lot of action.

130
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,708
Well, having some skin in
the game makes life more fun.

131
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:26,191
Hey, you're The Dominator.

132
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,630
Uh, just "Dom" now.

133
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,457
My football days are behind me.

134
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,503
That pancake block you had
against Stanford?

135
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,244
Cleared the way
for that 75-yard run?

136
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,507
Made me 10 grand, that one play!

137
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:38,639
Why aren't you in the league?

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,292
Decided I wanted to help people

139
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,642
instead of hurt them.

140
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,340
Okay, let's draw blood
for post-op hematocrit.

141
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,863
Once the brain swelling
comes down, you can go.

142
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,128
Have you done a blood draw yet?

143
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:53,262
It's my first day
out of the classroom.

144
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,306
Five bucks he gets an A.

145
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:55,699
No.

146
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:03,185
All right. You're going
to palpate for a vein.

147
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:06,057
Oh, and remember,
when introducing the needle,

148
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:10,148
always bevel up and insert
the tube into the vacutainer.

149
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:12,934
And you just passed
phlebotomy 101.

150
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,763
Oh, God.

151
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:21,029
You could be up five right now.

152
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,293
He went down.

153
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,121
I mean, hard.

154
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,862
Frontal and parietal lobes
look clear.

155
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,822
I'm sorry.

156
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,564
I did deadlifts
and squats this morning.

157
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,000
Didn't have time
to eat breakfast.

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,523
Feeling okay now?

159
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,395
My ego took a hit,
but I'll be okay.

160
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:42,093
Whoa!

161
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:44,226
Is that our patient's brain?

162
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:47,185
Mm. You just passed
anatomy 101.

163
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,709
Which part's the front?

164
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,884
Oh, spoke too soon.

165
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:51,407
This is the axial plane,

166
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:52,800
which means we're
looking down from the top.

167
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:58,196
These are the temporal and
occipital lobes here. Also clear.

168
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,545
How can you tell?

169
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,025
We injected gadolinium,
which leaks out

170
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,331
around the areas of injury

171
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,507
and makes them show up
brighter on the scan.

172
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:05,987
Like that?

173
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,731
Yeah. Like that.

174
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:13,995
That's a tumor,

175
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,692
completely interwoven
with his brain stem

176
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,911
and cranial nerves

177
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,130
and extending
to his upper spinal cord.

178
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,611
I guess we know
why he didn't see that car.

179
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,791
You are descending
through the larynx

180
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,663
to the trachea
and onto the carina.

181
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,840
- Nicely identified.
- Thank you.

182
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,407
Positive affirmations are
empowering for people with ASD.

183
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:36,582
"My autism is awesome."

184
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,367
Onto the bronchi
and bronchioles.

185
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,197
I use Taylor Swift mnemonics.
Do you guys do that, too?

186
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,329
- No.
- I do.

187
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,592
I wonder if ours are the same.

188
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:50,422
Basic airway anatomy,
L, T, C, B, B.

189
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:53,730
"Lover," "Treacherous,"
"Cardigan," "Babe," and "Bejeweled."

190
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,038
I used "Bad Blood" for both
bronchi and bronchioles. Two for one.

191
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:58,213
Mm.

192
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,344
He knows one song.

193
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,788
Look at the patches
on the bronchial mucosa.

194
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,180
There's a luminal narrowing

195
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,442
from the enlarged lymph nodes.

196
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:14,185
This definitely isn't pneumonia.

197
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:15,273
Cool.

198
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:16,709
My first medical mystery.

199
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:18,799
Can I page Dr. Murphy?

200
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,455
Did you ever
cut quartz countertops?

201
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,885
Yeah.

202
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:34,680
I started off
in a fabrication shop.

203
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:36,506
How'd you know that?

204
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,751
Cutting quartz produces
toxic fine-dust particles

205
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:41,049
that have embedded
in your airway and lungs.

206
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,598
You have silicosis.

207
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:44,816
It's like watching
a magic trick.

208
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,169
Uh, my doc said it was
just a recurring pneumonia.

209
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:53,390
Silicosis can often be
misdiagnosed until it's too late.

210
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,862
You will need
a bilateral lung transplant.

211
00:08:58,547 --> 00:08:59,940
He needs new lungs?

212
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,052
Yes. With your declining
respiratory function

213
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,749
and extensive damage,

214
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,369
you should be prioritized
for transplant.

215
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:09,392
But you will need full-time
home care for the rest of your life.

216
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,237
But I live alone
back in Florida.

217
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,282
Dad, one step at a time.

218
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:20,069
I think you should
get the surgery here,

219
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:20,896
then move in with me.

220
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,114
I can't do that.

221
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:23,681
Of course you can.

222
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,857
Your career has just taken off.
I'm not gonna burden you.

223
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,165
It's not a burden.
You're my dad.

224
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,950
You peeled my oranges
and coached my soccer team.

225
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,475
Then you put me through college
and business school.

226
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,478
Let me take care of you.

227
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,139
Someone raised his girl right.

228
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:51,970
Okay.

229
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,582
We will call
a transplant coordinator.

230
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,543
Where's Steve?

231
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,066
Down the hall,
flirting with the nurses.

232
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,155
I need you to write me
a prescription for domperidone.

233
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,201
It increases
breast milk production.

234
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,724
All the mom message boards
say so.

235
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,335
It is not approved
as a lactation aid anywhere.

236
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,555
Doctors in Canada and Mexico
are using it off-label.

237
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:14,384
Does Steve not like the formula
Dr. Hyland recommended?

238
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:15,820
<i>I</i> don't like it, Shaun.

239
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,562
I feel like... I feel
like a failure as a mom.

240
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,783
But you are not a failure.

241
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,350
You are following
all the recommended guidelines.

242
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,396
In fact, the only guideline
you're not following

243
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,093
is supplementing
with formula as advised.

244
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:31,183
Shaun...

245
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:35,797
I've been wanting
to be a mom for so long,

246
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:39,583
and part of that is my body
is supposed to give Steve

247
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,585
everything he needs,
and mine won't.

248
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:44,022
And I hate it.

249
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:51,203
Come in.

250
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:53,249
Good. You're both here.

251
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,207
An invite to Baby Eden's
Sip and See.

252
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,731
So everyone
can officially meet her

253
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:57,775
in a cute dress
instead of a hospital gown.

254
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:00,778
Is Dr. Glassman going?

255
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:03,433
- I think so.
- Then I do not want to go.

256
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,609
I thought you and Glassy
had worked things out.

257
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,132
He took Steve the other night.

258
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,351
Hmm.

259
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,744
Who cares if he's there?

260
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,441
As long as you
and that gorgeous baby make it.

261
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,051
Wouldn't miss it.

262
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,575
Isn't being a mom great?

263
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,793
The greatest.

264
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:19,492
You just said
you feel like a failure.

265
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,582
I think that is because
of a postpartum decrease

266
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:22,757
in estrogen and progesterone.

267
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:25,890
Did you just call me hormonal?

268
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,850
- No, actually reduced hormonal.
- Okay, Shaun.

269
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,895
- Time to go.
- This is my office.

270
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:32,244
Let's not have it
be your gravesite.

271
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:41,036
Huh. There's gotta be
something you can do.

272
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,865
We can't safely remove the tumor

273
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:45,736
without permanent injury
to your brain stem.

274
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,303
If you survive
the surgery at all.

275
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:52,700
I'm sorry.
I know it's a lot to take in.

276
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,702
But there's... there's new
technology all the time.

277
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:56,225
Nadal's back
with the stem cells,

278
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:57,966
and Bartolo Colon...

279
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,708
Experimental treatments on
athletes' orthopedic injuries

280
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,666
are completely different
than brain surgery.

281
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,712
C-Could you remove
some of the tumor?

282
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,671
Buy me more time?
How about chemo?

283
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,934
This type of cancer
doesn't respond to chemo.

284
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,284
We did read a paper in class
about a TCR approach.

285
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:13,459
Could that be something?

286
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,157
That was only done a few times,

287
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:16,158
and never
with brain stem involvement.

288
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,638
TCR.

289
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,683
It's my new favorite letters.

290
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,424
Whatever they stand for,
let's do that.

291
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:30,476
TCR means we would
saw up through your mandible

292
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,827
and dislocate your lower jaw.

293
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,655
Then we cut open
from the roof of your mouth

294
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:35,873
to the back of your throat.

295
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:37,832
That's just to access the tumor.

296
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,312
That tumor is woven
into your brain stem.

297
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:43,141
Removing it would very likely
leave you quadriplegic,

298
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:46,101
unable to speak or move,
<i>if</i> you survive the surgery.

299
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,495
Okay.

300
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,583
Maybe it's not my favorite.

301
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,369
But let's try.

302
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,374
Sal, you should enjoy
your remaining time.

303
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,377
Travel.

304
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,857
Connect with family.

305
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:10,734
Who am I gonna connect with?

306
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,435
Wife kicked me out
when I gambled away

307
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:18,481
the kids' college fund.

308
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,572
None of them
have talked to me for years.

309
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,101
I got a break coming my way.

310
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,061
I can feel it.

311
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,769
We've got
our annual presentation

312
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,249
to the managed care companies.

313
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,512
They want detailed reports
on patient outcomes

314
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:50,818
for diabetes, geriatrics...

315
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:52,515
That's great.
Schedule that for never.

316
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,778
- No, I've set it for tomorrow at 9:00.
- That's the wrong answer.

317
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:56,867
Unfortunately, I have
back-to-back surgeries.

318
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,609
Thank goodness I have a partner
to do the things I can't.

319
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,011
Oh.

320
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:14,189
You know, med students are
allowed to eat with the residents.

321
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:15,756
I find the sound of people
chewing to be unsettling.

322
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,200
Well, if you want some guidance

323
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,811
and you don't mind the sound
of sipping noises,

324
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,292
Jordan and I
can take you for coffee.

325
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:38,300
Ha...

326
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,303
Uh, baby, let me call you
right back.

327
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,916
Where did you get your bra?

328
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,832
I've always been intrigued
by lace. Is it okay?

329
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:51,487
Kind of busy right now.
Can we talk upstairs later?

330
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,531
What are you doing?

331
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:54,098
Just talking to a friend.

332
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:55,839
You called him "Daddy,"
but your dad's upstairs.

333
00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:00,670
He's a client, a regular.

334
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,020
He paid me five grand
for a last-minute session.

335
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,979
Lucky for me,
he's into exhibitionism.

336
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:06,719
Five grand?
That's more than I made

337
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:09,200
a whole month waitressing,
including tips.

338
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,072
Do people tip sex workers?

339
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:13,770
Charlie, this isn't
any of our business, so...

340
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,598
Plenty of people know what I do.

341
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,208
Just not my actual father.

342
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,690
Please, you cannot
say anything to him.

343
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,300
Of course not.

344
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:26,217
Ah. Good news.

345
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,089
Donor lungs
just became available.

346
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,438
"Happy birthday, Daddy," indeed.

347
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,516
The donor's upstairs
on life support.

348
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,108
His family is ready
to withdraw care.

349
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,649
We'll take you
for some additional testing,

350
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,825
but the transplant could happen
as soon as tomorrow.

351
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,566
Wow.
- You'll need a bedroom on the ground floor

352
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,568
and an easily
accessible bathroom.

353
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,440
I can convert my office.

354
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,268
As long as you have privacy
elsewhere for your <i>work.</i>

355
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,836
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why'd you say "work" like that?

356
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:58,970
I mean, how much privacy do you
need for tech consultations?

357
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,191
Charlie's speech pattern
can be a bit unusual.

358
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,323
Her autism is awesome.

359
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:05,411
Thank you.

360
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:07,979
Don't mention it. Really.
Do not.

361
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:09,676
Love you, Daddy.

362
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,765
So many daddies, so little time.

363
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:13,201
Whoa, whoa.

364
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:15,552
What does that mean?

365
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,381
Uh, Dad, nothing.

366
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:19,991
I'm not asking you.
I'm asking her.

367
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,562
Saying "observe" isn't enough.

368
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:27,694
You need to tell them,
"Don't speak."

369
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,827
I realize that now.
So does The Dominator.

370
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,874
What are your thoughts
about the TCR?

371
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,398
You're considering the surgery?

372
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:37,748
It's either that or do nothing
and Sal is dead in a year.

373
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:41,229
A year is a year.
You're not his executioner.

374
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,448
So you wouldn't do it?

375
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,450
No, I'm not making
this decision for you.

376
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,234
You're an attending now.

377
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:47,627
Your surgery, your call.

378
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,246
What are you doing?

379
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,161
Work order says
deliver them here.

380
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,598
Signed by the president.

381
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,604
Co... president.

382
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,478
Once Rich's questions
picked up speed,

383
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,959
it wasn't long before
Charlie mentioned "sex worker."

384
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,440
Shortly thereafter, he banned Grace
from the room and called off the surgery.

385
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:20,268
Okay.

386
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,923
His oxygen saturation
is decreasing.

387
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:25,404
He is profoundly hypoxic.
Rich needs new lungs now.

388
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:26,492
I told him that.

389
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:27,885
He booked a flight
back to Florida.

390
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:29,626
Said he'll get
on the transplant list there.

391
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:31,932
No, no, no. His lungs
cannot handle transport.

392
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,630
Charlie's mistake is
endangering our patient's health.

393
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,154
Our patient is doing that
all on his own.

394
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:38,417
But Rich would not be upset
if Charlie had not revealed...

395
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,332
She didn't violate
any HIPAA laws.

396
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,638
The only thing she did wrong

397
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,857
was not keep Grace's
secret life a secret.

398
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,643
Which kind of sounds like
something you might have done

399
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:48,862
back in your first year.

400
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:49,689
Hmm.

401
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,435
Our patient needs a bilateral
whole-lung lavage

402
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,132
in order to get home safely.

403
00:17:58,132 --> 00:17:59,264
Please get his consent.

404
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,919
Charlie can do scut work.

405
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,924
Dissecting the tumor
from the ventral surface

406
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,142
of the pons and cranial nerves.

407
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:12,886
Applied too much pressure.
Bleeder.

408
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:15,541
- Oh, God.
- What? Dom,

409
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,760
it's not even real.

410
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,501
Oh, God.

411
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:19,719
Again?

412
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,373
Again.

413
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,159
Have you eaten?

414
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,509
Two double cheeseburgers,

415
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:28,249
fries, coleslaw, cottage cheese,

416
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:29,512
a pudding, and fruit salad.

417
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:33,951
You know, hemophobia can make

418
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:36,475
for a pretty rough
surgical rotation.

419
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,520
You got any idea
how to get over it?

420
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,131
I gotta.

421
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:42,742
My brother and I,
we have this deal

422
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,570
to become family docs,
then move back home.

423
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,486
When our mother got sick,

424
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:48,531
we saw how lousy
medical care can get.

425
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,970
You could try exposure therapy,

426
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,406
watch a few hours
of blood draws.

427
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:57,148
Ooh, there's a twist.

428
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:58,410
You good?

429
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,890
Okay. Just breathe.

430
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,533
Shaun <i>doesn't</i> like her?
But she worships him.

431
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,795
Charlie blabbed to the patient,

432
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,884
blew up his double
lung transplant.

433
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,670
Double lumen
endotracheal tubes and clamps.

434
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,715
My guy did the same thing,
but in reverse.

435
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,369
Mentioned a virtually
impossible surgery.

436
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,153
Now the patient wants it.

437
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:49,026
I think I actually saw smoke
come out of Park's ears.

438
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,028
Well, 20% of med school
students don't make it,

439
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:52,899
and most of that happens
during surgical rotation.

440
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,206
I wonder which one
of our ducklings goes first?

441
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:56,294
Ten bags of saline.

442
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:00,690
Oh, you're gonna need a cart.

443
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,694
The big guy's on a mission.
I'll take the girl.

444
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:07,044
I've never said
those words before.

445
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,088
Done with my scut work.

446
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,830
You guys need a cart.

447
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,180
I'll be right back.

448
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:21,624
Hey.

449
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,978
Are you not going to go to Morgan's
baby thing because I might be there?

450
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:29,893
Yes.

451
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:32,852
Well, that's pretty dumb.

452
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:37,074
Don't you think it's time
we moved past this stuff?

453
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:37,988
No.

454
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:40,338
Well, I'm trying to.

455
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,428
I'm the one
who should be mad at you.

456
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,476
You should have met Steve
on the day he was born.

457
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:51,001
Yes. I should have.
I should have done that.

458
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,658
I was pretty upset back then.

459
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,357
You humiliated me,

460
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:02,229
and I'm not a surgeon now
partly because of you.

461
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,842
Did you forget that?

462
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:13,371
That is not an apology.

463
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:27,934
Drained ninth liter of effluent.

464
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,869
Left lung output
is looking clearer.

465
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,424
<i>Did everyone
look at Grace's cam-girl site?</i>

466
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,592
What is she doing here?

467
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,352
She was done with scut work.

468
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,463
Infusing another liter
of saline.

469
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:45,056
<i>Grace put herself online
because she wants customers.</i>

470
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:47,190
<i>I'm giving her what she wants.</i>

471
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,666
You actually subscribed?

472
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:50,841
<i>I am a feminist,
and she's very beautiful.</i>

473
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,385
<i>Her site offers
tasteful nude portraits,</i>

474
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,440
<i>sensual shower videos,
and gritty bondage.</i>

475
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,265
No amount of money
is worth selling your body.

476
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,093
<i>Uh, $3.6 million a year
might be.</i>

477
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,002
What about you, Dr. Murphy?

478
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:04,088
How would you feel if your son
ended up doing sex work?

479
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:09,668
<i>What if he ends up sick</i>

480
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,409
<i>from cutting quartz countertops
for a living?</i>

481
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,707
We can clear Rich to fly home.

482
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:21,714
But I need to talk to him first.

483
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:37,831
How long ago did she wake up?

484
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,552
About an hour or so.
I just fed her.

485
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,069
The patient wants to go for it,

486
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:01,768
and there's a non-zero
chance it works.

487
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,337
So do it.

488
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:07,469
Only the best of the best
could pull this off.

489
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:10,168
And what if that's you?

490
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:15,608
I've been in the OR with you.

491
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,001
I know your steadiness,

492
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,047
your precision,
your persistence.

493
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:26,793
I believe you can do this.

494
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,019
Maybe Eden should decide.

495
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,891
She agrees with her mama.

496
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,646
You are able to fly home now.

497
00:23:56,257 --> 00:23:58,303
But you should listen
to your daughter.

498
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:07,834
Dad.

499
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:08,965
Please.

500
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,447
Dr. Murphy says
it's very unlikely

501
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,319
they'll find another donor
match before you die.

502
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:16,451
Take the lungs.

503
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:22,544
You don't have to live with me.
I'll find a place for you.

504
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:26,505
You have to stop
what you're doing.

505
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:31,292
No.

506
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,687
I like what I do.

507
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:37,646
I'm successful,
and I'm not hurting anyone.

508
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:39,605
You're hurting me.

509
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,584
My son, Steve,
is three weeks old.

510
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:07,894
I have been thinking about what
he might do when he gets older

511
00:25:07,894 --> 00:25:09,983
that I would not approve of.

512
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:16,381
But I can't imagine
not wanting him in my life

513
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,298
unless he was cruel
or unkind to others.

514
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:25,041
She is kind and generous.

515
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,087
She loves you
and wants to care for you.

516
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,915
She seems like
a very good person.

517
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:35,269
You did raise Grace right.

518
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,678
You're a gambling addict
who showed up here

519
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,158
having already
thrown everything away.

520
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,335
The only way I do this surgery

521
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:00,033
is if I know you'll make
better use of the extra time.

522
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:03,645
- This doesn't seem ethical.
- It's not.

523
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,174
Convince me you'll
lead a life worth saving.

524
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:21,315
My name is Sal Zacharia,

525
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,577
and I have a gambling addiction.

526
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,625
I promise I will get treatment.

527
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,237
And you'll reach out
to your ex-wife,

528
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:31,499
try to reconnect
with your family.

529
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,805
How is this any business
of yours?

530
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,030
Tell me
why I should believe you.

531
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,780
Because I die if you don't.

532
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,049
I don't wanna die.

533
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:09,276
Let's get prepped for surgery.

534
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:23,010
Scrub your arms to three
inches above the elbow.

535
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,142
How did you get Rich
to change his mind?

536
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,274
Did you trick him?

537
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:28,189
I related to him as a father.

538
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:31,317
I have become very good
at displaying empathy.

539
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:32,517
Neurotypicals are weird.

540
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,629
Yes, they are.

541
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:36,327
Rinse your hands and arms
from fingertips to elbows,

542
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,852
one direction only.

543
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:43,247
I am displaying empathy now,
by allowing you into the OR.

544
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,021
You should be grateful
I was able to fix the case.

545
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:47,855
Hands up,
and don't touch anything.

546
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:55,063
My first time
being gowned and gloved.

547
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,468
Do we get to shave his chest?

548
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:57,946
It was done in pre-op.

549
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:01,309
Oh, I shave my own body hair,
so I'm great at it.

550
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,150
Not my chest, though.

551
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:05,177
I mean, my underarms,
my legs, my... Charlie.

552
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:07,161
Okay.
Please stop talking.

553
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,216
I... I, uh,
was just trying to...

554
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:15,840
You cannot touch your skin.

555
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,365
I didn't, I touched my earring.

556
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,149
You can't touch
any non-sterile item.

557
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:26,764
You've just contaminated
the surgical field.

558
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:28,418
You have to re-scrub in,

559
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:30,332
and we have to re-drape
everything.

560
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,909
- You're speaking very loudly.
- Go read the literature

561
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:35,531
on operating-room
sterile technique.

562
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,688
That won't help.
I'm an auditory learner.

563
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:40,126
You need to leave.

564
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,041
Okay? Leave now.

565
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:56,040
That looks fun.

566
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,080
Why did you e-mail
"Will not attend"?

567
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:03,105
You're clearly
skipping my baby's party

568
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:04,846
because you feel
like a failure as a mom.

569
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:06,108
But you're not.
And that's stupid.

570
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:07,457
And how can I help
if you won't just tell me

571
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:09,067
that you're having
breastfeeding problems?

572
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,548
Mm. I'm sorry.

573
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:14,116
I feel like a jerk complaining
to you about all of this.

574
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:16,031
I know I'm lucky
to breastfeed at all,

575
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,251
and I am not being rational.

576
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:21,950
You're not the only one failing.

577
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:29,349
When Eden cries
during the night,

578
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,089
Alex is the one who wakes up.

579
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,309
Every time.

580
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,137
During one
of his overnight shifts,

581
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:39,185
I slept through my own baby
crying for almost 20 minutes.

582
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:42,623
I mean, that's actual neglect.

583
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,931
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Child
Protective Services is downstairs.

584
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,672
Shut up, raisin boobs.

585
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,544
Mm.

586
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,244
You are the greatest mom.

587
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:58,421
Adopting a baby
with Turner syndrome,

588
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,510
caring for her
after two heart surgeries,

589
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,991
and somehow throwing a party
while being so put together.

590
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:05,994
And I use formula exclusively.

591
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,225
Finally got the last box
removed from my office.

592
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:23,272
- Space is a little tight.
- And yet, I found some.

593
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:26,928
Well, that's excellent use
of your co-presidential powers.

594
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,626
- I owe you.
- Oh, my God, can we please stop?

595
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,629
Can we...
Can we just have a truce?

596
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,457
- I'll think about it.
- Please?

597
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,372
I promise, from here on in,

598
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:38,505
I will check in
with all the big stuff.

599
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,854
Okay?

600
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,943
No more gotchas.

601
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,510
Happy birthday!

602
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,253
I sent the memo out
this morning.

603
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:50,299
Eighty?

604
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,608
You look really good
for your age.

605
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:11,538
I got booted out
of my first surgery

606
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,322
for contaminating
the sterile field.

607
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:15,106
I'm probably about to join you.

608
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,673
I fainted twice
at the sight of blood.

609
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:18,893
I'm already sweating
and seeing little black dots.

610
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,026
- What?
- Feel better?

611
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:24,507
That activated your sympathetic
nervous system.

612
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,292
More blood flow
means you won't faint.

613
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:29,556
Too bad I can't
do that to myself.

614
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,297
Try snapping your glove
against your wrist.

615
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,144
All right.
Let's cut.

616
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,608
Stair-step mandibulotomy
complete.

617
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,958
Dr. Wolke, dissect to the floor
of the mouth posteriorly,

618
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,134
then swing the tongue medially
and the mandible laterally.

619
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:32,270
Transecting eustachian tube
and elevating the pharynx

620
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,228
off the longus colli muscles.

621
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:38,538
We now have access to the
upper cervical spine and clivus.

622
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:42,368
Now comes the hard part.

623
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:51,028
Bring the Fabricius robot in.
Get the arms in position.

624
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,379
Have the Rhoton dissector
and ultrasonic aspirator ready.

625
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,710
25-degree angled
Rhoton dissector.

626
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,504
Dissecting a safe plane
between the tumor

627
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:31,593
and the ventral surface
of the pons and cranial nerve.

628
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:41,864
Final step.

629
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:43,692
Too deep here and the guy's
permanently paralyzed.

630
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:16,977
All tumor's out.

631
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:23,951
And heart is still beating.

632
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:50,854
I'm not okay.

633
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:01,342
Dad.
- Hmm?

634
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:03,317
Hey.

635
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:05,506
Hey! You're here.

636
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:07,741
Of course.

637
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:11,954
How do you feel?

638
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,686
Like I can breathe again.

639
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:19,256
Good.

640
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:23,272
I found a place that can help
with your meals and medicine.

641
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:32,191
You know, I...

642
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,944
I'd really like
to stay with you.

643
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,791
If the offer still stands.

644
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,552
Of course it does.

645
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:46,501
Yeah?

646
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:47,658
Yeah.

647
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,739
You're a good person.

648
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,105
Hello.

649
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:17,889
I would like a report
on what you've learned

650
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,804
from the sterile techniques
manual.

651
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:20,892
I'll e-mail it.

652
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:23,025
I'm reorganizing
for peak efficiency.

653
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:25,684
Making a great day greater.

654
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:30,636
No. Excuse me.
Today was not a great day.

655
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,469
Nor was yesterday.

656
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:36,734
You made several big mistakes
and dozens of small ones.

657
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:39,406
My anatomy professor told us
it's okay to make mistakes.

658
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,171
That's how we learn.

659
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:42,528
Your professor is wrong.

660
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:45,885
And so is this re-organization.

661
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,348
I had everything
in the proper place.

662
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,053
Restore it, then go home.

663
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:10,283
Looks like we both
caught a break.

664
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:11,135
Mm.

665
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:13,510
Hmm.

666
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,340
Is Janet your ex-wife?

667
00:37:19,995 --> 00:37:21,387
Nice.

668
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:22,780
Looks like she's pretty excited

669
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,912
about you getting
into treatment.

670
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:24,782
Mm.

671
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:33,530
And you got a confirmation
for the bets you just placed.

672
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:01,863
Good luck, Sal.

673
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:29,499
You okay?

674
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:33,721
Dr. Murphy doesn't appreciate
efficient organization skills

675
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:34,765
when he sees it.

676
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:39,814
Hmm.

677
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,750
I do.

678
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,723
That doesn't matter very much.

679
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:45,036
You're not my hero.

680
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,305
Sure about that?

681
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:27,470
That's that smile
I like to see. Whoo!

682
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:33,693
You're so sweet.

683
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,742
Formula?
- You were right.

684
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:39,787
No guilt, okay?

685
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,702
I'm proud of you.

686
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,661
Also, supplementing
has advantages for Mama.

687
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:48,230
Bless your dear, dear soul.

688
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:57,369
Because we've had
a long couple of days

689
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,806
with our new babies.

690
00:40:02,897 --> 00:40:05,856
My first med school rotation
was oncology.

691
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:08,032
I was doing patient intake,
and I asked a woman

692
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,512
if she'd been keeping up
with her mammograms.

693
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:12,689
It was a follow-up
to a double mastectomy.

694
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:18,347
Mine was obstetrics.

695
00:40:18,347 --> 00:40:20,131
It was my first delivery,

696
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,872
and the doctor handed me
the newborn,

697
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:24,570
and I said, "Ew,"
like, out loud.

698
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,445
When I was in my first
ever surgery, open heart,

699
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:32,100
the attending asked me
what the ACT was.

700
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,841
I proudly said,
"Activated clotting time."

701
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,669
She said,
"I know what it stands for.

702
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:37,496
"I need you
to tell me the number."

703
00:40:37,496 --> 00:40:39,498
Wow.

704
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:42,545
Mm-hmm. That attending could
have thrown me out of the OR.

705
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:43,851
But she mentored me instead.

706
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,114
Yeah.

707
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:49,944
To taking care of our ducklings.

708
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,032
Yeah.

709
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:06,961
I have heard valid arguments
both for and against sex work.

710
00:41:08,397 --> 00:41:09,877
Are you considering
a career change?

711
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:11,226
But it doesn't matter.

712
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:16,231
It is okay for family
to disagree.

713
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,191
Being a family who argues

714
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:23,542
is more important
than not being a family at all.

715
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:29,026
I'm sorry it took me
so long to meet you.

716
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:32,943
I look forward to spending
some more time together.

717
00:41:34,162 --> 00:41:34,902
Okay?

718
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:39,341
He was saying that for me.

719
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,823
Hi.

720
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:50,787
I got ya.
