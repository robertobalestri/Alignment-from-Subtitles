1
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:06,625
An isobar is a line
of equal barometric pressures.

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,389
Not to be confused
with an isotach,

3
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:10,943
which is a line
of equal wind speeds,

4
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,818
or an isodrosotherm,

5
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:16,709
which is a line of
equal dew point temperatures.

6
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:21,750
And now that you have swallowed
excess air, you need...

7
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:24,244
Very good.

8
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:30,182
His poop was orange brown,
which is expected,

9
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:32,184
given his iron supplement.

10
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:38,256
He is changed, fed, and burped.

11
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:42,251
Mmm. Best dad ever.

12
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:53,338
I think it worked.

13
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:55,140
Jazz is soothing,

14
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:57,576
and kind of sexy
at the same time.

15
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:05,179
You know, since we got back
together, we haven't...

16
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:06,705
Had sex?

17
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:08,774
It's been almost two months.

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,739
We have a good excuse.

19
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,487
People with kids
have sex, right?

20
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,901
You want to?

21
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:39,507
Oh.

22
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:47,553
Maybe we should
go somewhere else.

23
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,194
Yeah.

24
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:51,363
Ah, but later.

25
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:53,571
We have to get ready for work.

26
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:58,920
You want the head trauma or
the rebar through the shoulder?

27
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:00,913
Rebar. It will be
much more exciting.

28
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,174
In that case, Dom,
you're with me on...

29
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,642
No, Dom is with me.

30
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,647
Welcome to Team Park.

31
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,322
Mom?

32
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:20,858
Hey, Audie.

33
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,960
Well, what are you doing here?
Are you okay?

34
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:25,763
Oh, I'm great.
I'm just here for a drug trial,

35
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,999
for my hyperthyroid.
I... For two weeks,

36
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,536
I am making $5,500.

37
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,146
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

38
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:37,484
I just... I figured I would
call you once I settled in.

39
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:38,951
I found a cute hotel

40
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,811
with a microwave
and a mini fridge and...

41
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:42,863
Mom, you are not
staying at a hotel.

42
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:45,398
Mmm, you and Clay
need your privacy.

43
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,881
Clay is in Chicago
doing a fellowship,

44
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,264
and he'll be gone
for another month,

45
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:51,828
which you would have known
if you had called me.

46
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,326
Cancel the hotel.

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,663
I have a microwave
and a maxi fridge.

48
00:02:58,796 --> 00:02:59,997
Yeah, I know.
I'm on my way.

49
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,670
Cameron Howard, 38,

50
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,388
drove his car through
the back of his garage.

51
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:08,181
BP is stable.

52
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:10,075
Stat trauma panel labs
and an E-FAST.

53
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,586
- Whose garage?
- Our garage, Cam.

54
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,279
He just, you know, forgot
which was the gas

55
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,013
and which was the brake.

56
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:18,316
And also that he's not
supposed to drive.

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,618
Who said I'm
not supposed to drive?

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,453
Your doctor.

59
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,722
He's been diagnosed with
Early Onset Alzheimer's.

60
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:27,726
At 38?
That is so young.

61
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,134
He's tachycardic
and hypotensive.

62
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:38,470
- He is in hemorrhagic shock.
- What?

63
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,572
Pushing a 500cc bolus.

64
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:42,973
Call the OR.
We're on our way.

65
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:48,647
John Doe, scalp abrasions,

66
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,082
possible head trauma
and drug overdose.

67
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:53,017
His name is Nathan Speed.
I know him from my church.

68
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,159
No deep lacerations or skull
or c-spine step offs.

69
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:02,494
Body is limp, shallow breathing,

70
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,663
old track marks,

71
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,464
constricted pupils.
What'd you take?

72
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,667
S-S-S...

73
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,268
Slurred speech.
Could be an opioid overdose.

74
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:12,936
I need 8 milligrams naloxone
and a urine tox screen.

75
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,674
He's tachycardic and warm.
Doesn't correlate with an OD.

76
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,145
This looks more like a stroke.

77
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,347
His respiratory rate is fast.

78
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,947
And he has a port.

79
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,254
Si-Sick.

80
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:31,389
Sick. Sick.

81
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:33,692
Those aren't track marks.
They're blown veins

82
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,160
from IV placements.
It's not an OD.

83
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,795
Nathan has sickle cell disease,
and he's in a crisis.

84
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,698
Push IV fluids
and morphine for pain.

85
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,366
Check a CBC and hemoglobin S.

86
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,742
You have an amazing voice.

87
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,244
- So do you, Dr. Allen.
- Thank you.

88
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:28,946
Seems like you're feeling
a little better today.

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,883
And you remembered
how much I love that song.

90
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,420
We've missed you in choir
for the past couple months.

91
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:37,422
Mmm.
I had another crisis,

92
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,057
ended up
in a different hospital,

93
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,860
and it took me days to convince
the docs I wasn't an addict.

94
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,804
But you know,
it seems like God decided

95
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,264
I was due for an upgrade
this time around.

96
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,186
That's an excellent compliment.

97
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,936
I think you're flirting,
which is fine,

98
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,705
because I think she likes you.

99
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,840
You know, I think so, too.
But how come she turned me down

100
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:57,484
when I asked her out
a few months back?

101
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:59,352
Bad timing.

102
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,188
Is it still bad timing? You
haven't mentioned a boyfriend.

103
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,214
Oh, that's good to know.

104
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,717
Charlie,
Mr. Speed is our patient.

105
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,252
Let's keep it professional.

106
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,890
At least until he's discharged
later today.

107
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,542
Balloon catheter in position.

108
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,777
How is fatherhood treating you?

109
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:35,814
Steve is very good.

110
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:39,617
Lea and I are exchanging
42 words per day on average.

111
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:44,656
Jerome's been in Sydney
for the last 10 days

112
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,291
for a nursing course.

113
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,259
I've called him
like three times.

114
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:49,928
All I've gotten back
are like two one-word texts

115
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:50,929
and a thumbs up.

116
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:56,835
And Carter Nix,
that cute pedes nurse, is there.

117
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:03,141
Okay, let's remove the rebar.

118
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,510
Set up a FaceTime date with him.

119
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:06,945
Last year I played for Cal,

120
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,580
my girlfriend got a job
in Zurich.

121
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:11,449
Had to schedule our phone calls
like doctor's appointments,

122
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,285
but it was the only thing
that kept us going.

123
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,921
Mmm! How long
have you been together?

124
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:19,324
We aren't anymore.
She cheated on me.

125
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:26,965
Oh.

126
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,000
He tried to get out of bed
and fell.

127
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:33,003
Nathan, are you in any pain?

128
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,038
The transfusions didn't work.
He's in crisis.

129
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,574
Get him subcutaneous tinzaparin.

130
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,543
I-I can't hear
out of this ear.

131
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,944
That's not from his sickle cell.

132
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:41,513
He needs a brain MRI
and audiogram.

133
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:50,170
<i>You okay, Nathan?</i>

134
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:53,826
Yeah, um, I'm just going to close my eyes
and think of where I'mma take you to dinner

135
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,160
when all this is over.

136
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,997
Aw, he's so romantic.

137
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:58,424
Are you going to
go out with him?

138
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,497
You have to go out with him.

139
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,292
So when you said you
"knew him from church"?

140
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,191
Moving on to the next
imaging sequence.

141
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,105
- Okay.
- Okay.

142
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,607
He asked her out.
She said no.

143
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,808
I think it's because
of another guy,

144
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:10,476
but he's still interested,
and so is she.

145
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,211
Makes sense.

146
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,980
He does seem to tick your boxes.

147
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:16,149
T2 axial images are ready
to be viewed.

148
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:17,683
By that, you're saying
he's smart,

149
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,385
educated, talented, funny...

150
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,154
He needs you.

151
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,288
What's that supposed to mean?

152
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:24,824
Is that normal?

153
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,205
I got your text.

154
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:41,107
Not sure I have time for lunch.

155
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,344
How about a snack?

156
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:48,848
I love snacks.

157
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:52,218
Yeah?

158
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,023
- This is going to be so hot.
- So hot.

159
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:02,328
Morgan?

160
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:03,563
Uh, just a second!

161
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:11,837
Hi.

162
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,172
Why didn't you tell me my mother

163
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,774
was in one
of your clinical trials?

164
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,709
Eileen Lim?

165
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:19,212
I didn't know she was your mother.
She never mentioned it.

166
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:21,047
- She was accepted into the trial?
- Mmm-hmm.

167
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,883
Which means no significant
underlying health issues?

168
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,918
I can't tell you that,
but solid deduction.

169
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:29,755
I need you
for a surgical consult.

170
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,290
And you missed a button.

171
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,898
What about the third floor
supply closet? That's new.

172
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,701
Sexy. I'll text you
a time for tomorrow.

173
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:49,676
And there was surprisingly
little muscle damage.

174
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,010
With physiotherapy,

175
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:53,212
he should make
a complete recovery.

176
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:55,548
Physically.

177
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,783
Your husband is on
all of the recommended meds

178
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,852
for Alzheimer's.

179
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,420
I'm afraid to say there's
nothing more we can do.

180
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:08,261
God. Three months ago,
he was nothing like this,

181
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:11,764
just a bit forgetful.

182
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:16,335
Now, I mean,
there are moments still.

183
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:19,438
But then he slips back
into the fog.

184
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,775
I miss him.

185
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:29,982
And it just breaks my heart
to know how much <i>he</i> will miss.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,821
I'm pregnant.

187
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,243
Cam's Alzheimer's is so atypical,
given his age

188
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,770
and the rate he's declining,
I just think it's worth

189
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:47,166
reconsidering
all treatment options.

190
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,769
There are no viable
treatment options,

191
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:50,336
so it is not worth
reconsidering.

192
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,805
How about vagus
nerve stimulation?

193
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,190
- Nice.
- It hasn't been tested for early onset cases.

194
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,917
- Not viable.
- Focused ultrasound.

195
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,611
That may stabilize
the plaque burden,

196
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,479
but would not improve
clinical symptoms.

197
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,481
- Not viable.
- Deep brain stimulation.

198
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:03,883
I did some homework.

199
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,772
Highly invasive
with limited efficacy.

200
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:08,202
- Not viable.
- What about non-invasive

201
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:11,390
deep brain stimulation,
using temporal interference?

202
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:14,795
Stimulating the hippocampus
could improve episodic memory.

203
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,195
So... viable?

204
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:18,799
Yes.

205
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,036
Alright. Nice.

206
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,672
You have benign tumors
near your brain stem

207
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,873
called vestibular schwannomas.

208
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,876
The one on your right
is very large,

209
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,813
causing the imbalance
and hearing loss.

210
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,648
Benign is good, though, right?

211
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,720
They're growing.

212
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,088
If left untreated, eventually,
they will kill you.

213
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,827
We recommend surgical
removal of both.

214
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:49,830
Surgery will be complicated

215
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,832
because of your recent
sickle cell crisis.

216
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:58,839
And removing the tumors risks
complete hearing loss.

217
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:37,576
If I can't hear, I can't sing.

218
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,645
That's not living.

219
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,884
I'll take my chances.

220
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:06,206
Okay.

221
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,533
Good morning.

222
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,585
Denver omelet.

223
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,912
Home fries, extra crispy.
Your favorite.

224
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:56,226
When I was 13 and burning
2,400 calories a day.

225
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,429
What are you doing here,
Mom? Really?

226
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:05,116
I told you.

227
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,780
There is a website that
lists all the drug trials

228
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:11,757
currently running, including
one for hyperthyroidism

229
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,484
that is 10 miles from your house

230
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:16,695
and pays $500 more than we do.

231
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,029
But that one
doesn't come with a visit

232
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:19,932
to my high-powered
doctor daughter.

233
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:22,801
If there's something
going on with you,

234
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,502
I just wish you'd tell me.

235
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,140
I'm here because
I am worried about you.

236
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:32,109
- I'm fine.
- You always say you're fine,

237
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,813
whether you're in a wheelchair
or you're in the middle of a pandemic

238
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:37,014
or recovering from PTSD...

239
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:39,016
Mom, I told you I didn't
want to see anyone...

240
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,519
I know,
and I respected your wishes.

241
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:43,354
But then I call you,
and you rush me off the phone,

242
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:44,823
or you say you're
going to call me back,

243
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:46,324
and you don't.

244
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:48,526
- You always deflect.
- I'm not deflecting,

245
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,495
- I'm working.
- Of course, especially

246
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,463
now that you're
hospital co-president

247
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,700
as well as chief of surgery.

248
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,669
I mean, it's a lot,
but I'm handling it.

249
00:14:57,803 --> 00:14:59,671
I'm your mother.

250
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:01,372
I was there when you melted down

251
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:04,008
because you had a book report
and a science project

252
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:05,677
- due the same day...
- I can't have this conversation again.

253
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,979
That was 30 years ago.

254
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,780
And by the way,
I aced them both.

255
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,916
Well, of course you did.
You've always taken after your father.

256
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,818
- Why is that a bad thing?
- It isn't.

257
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,653
He was driven,
and he was brilliant.

258
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,120
And he was too proud...

259
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:17,723
And you just wish
that he had worked less.

260
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,323
- I wish...
- Right? And that he was

261
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,225
more present
as a husband and father.

262
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,997
I wish that he had been able
to ask for help.

263
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,365
Well, maybe he didn't
<i>want</i> your help.

264
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,606
I have to grab a shower.
We leave in 30.

265
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,615
Mmm, we could try
a middle fossa approach

266
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,349
on Nathan's left side tumor.

267
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:48,252
Mmm, 30% rate of hearing loss

268
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:51,023
and won't be able to
fully resect the tumor.

269
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,992
What'd you mean?

270
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,029
That Nathan ticks boxes
because he needs me?

271
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,096
Just that taking care of people

272
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,598
seems to be your comfort zone.

273
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,200
What about radiosurgery?

274
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,603
Delayed efficacy
and potential damage

275
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,137
to cranial nerves.

276
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,774
Taking care of people is my job.

277
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:10,008
And mine, too,
but I don't seek that out

278
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:11,208
in my personal relationships.

279
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,813
Perez was an addict.
Nathan has a chronic illness.

280
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,381
Just, you know, seems like
you have a bit of a type.

281
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:20,384
And what's your type?
The model who cheats with married men?

282
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:22,253
- Okay.
- Oh, wait, that was your fake girlfriend

283
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,255
who was really with your boss.

284
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:26,758
That sounds complicated.
I don't really have a type.

285
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:30,963
Short, tall, blonde, brunette,
neurodiverse, neurotypical,

286
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,898
I've dated them all.
As long as there's chemistry.

287
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,399
Uh, what about
a suboccipital approach?

288
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,637
Too high a risk of
cerebellar injury or stroke.

289
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,172
You don't know me, okay?
So you should stop acting like you do.

290
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:42,841
- I think I do.
- Oh.

291
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,942
I think I see something in you

292
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,142
that you don't even
see in yourself.

293
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,579
- You guys like each other.
- Don't be ridiculous.

294
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:49,915
No way.

295
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:56,153
What I'd <i>like</i> is for us to
focus on finding a surgery

296
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,288
to safely save Nathan's hearing.

297
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,392
Okay?

298
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,593
- Okay.
- Thank you.

299
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:04,763
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

300
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,701
I miss you, too.

301
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,603
Oh.

302
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:14,271
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

303
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,680
- Mmm!
- Okay.

304
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,883
This may not be appropriate
workplace behavior.

305
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,351
I know.
And I missed it so much.

306
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:30,154
I've been so tired and there
hasn't been any time for us.

307
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,625
We need to make an appointment.

308
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,193
Yeah. We do.

309
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:39,031
- We need a date night.
- Okay.

310
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:42,834
Our favorite karaoke bar has
a two-for-one special tonight.

311
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:44,468
We should go there
and drink tequila

312
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,337
and sing "Islands in the Stream"
just like old times.

313
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,710
I don't know if I'm ready to
leave Steve you know, just yet.

314
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,014
Okay.

315
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,452
You know what?
Karaoke sounds great.

316
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:03,955
- I'll call Jordan.
- Okay.

317
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,891
Oh.

318
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:07,693
My patient is waking up.

319
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:09,193
Oh.

320
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,697
I'm very glad we are having
date night tonight.

321
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:21,707
What were the four words
I asked you to remember?

322
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,541
Apple, elephant,

323
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,342
planet, table.

324
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:28,212
Very good.
And the color?

325
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,749
Oh, that would be the color
of my Gilly's eyes. Brown.

326
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:35,087
- Very viable.
- Okay.

327
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,556
- Hello.
- Hey.

328
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,524
Uh...

329
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,393
Uh, you...

330
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:43,561
You have brown eyes, too.

331
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:45,063
Yeah.

332
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:48,399
Are you the hospital
social worker, or...

333
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:02,714
I was going to give you a ride.

334
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:05,717
Mm, seemed like
you needed some space.

335
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,854
And so did I.

336
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,990
Co-signed, as we decided,

337
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:13,491
- together.
- Thank you.

338
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,994
Uh, this is my mother, Eileen.

339
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:17,561
Aaron Glassman, my co-president.

340
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:18,797
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

341
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,564
Nice to meet you.

342
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,134
She taking good care of you?

343
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:26,138
She is. Now if she'd just
do that for herself.

344
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,973
Uh, in the "recommendations"
sections, you wrote,

345
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:31,408
- "same as last quarter."
- And?

346
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,145
And Gail specifically asked
for detailed feedback,

347
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:34,880
so I told her we would.

348
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,882
Knock yourself out.
Very nice to meet you.

349
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,387
That's another
two hours of work.

350
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:46,258
If he doesn't think
it's necessary, why do you?

351
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:49,527
Because I'm the responsible one.

352
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:52,063
And please don't tell me
I sound like my father.

353
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,802
Could the procedure
have made him worse?

354
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,336
No, it just doesn't make sense.

355
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:04,776
It won't be long
before he requires

356
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,279
24/7 nursing care
for the rest of his life,

357
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,981
which could be 15 to 20 years.

358
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,453
You may want to consider
a long-term care facility.

359
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:18,857
No.

360
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:24,202
Even if we could afford that,
I-I would never do that to him.

361
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:28,421
It will be quite challenging
looking after both of them.

362
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:35,674
How far along are you?

363
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:37,508
I'm, um...

364
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,400
Wait, do you mean...

365
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,554
I could still terminate
my pregnancy?

366
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,916
That is your choice.

367
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,604
Hi, Gilly.

368
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:16,421
Hi. Hi.

369
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,503
I'm so sorry about this.

370
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:21,171
- No.
- I know that I'm slipping.

371
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,476
You have to put me
in a nursing home.

372
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:28,826
And I-I do not want you
to use our savings.

373
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:31,156
It's got to be a place
that our insurance will cover.

374
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,327
- No, I can't.
- You have to, Gilly.

375
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:36,264
It'll be too much to take
care of both of us, okay? -No.

376
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,790
You have to, Gilly.

377
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,523
For our baby.

378
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:44,411
Okay? Okay.

379
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:50,033
Where...

380
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,401
Why am I in a hospital?

381
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,940
Wha-What, um...

382
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,509
-What's wrong with me?
What... What... -Okay, okay.

383
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:01,744
- What is happening?
- It's okay.

384
00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:04,314
I don't, um...

385
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,884
Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?

386
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:11,121
- What's happening to me? Oh, my God!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

387
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:12,556
Why is this happening to me?

388
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:15,559
It's okay. Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

389
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:31,274
This is really not sexy.

390
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:32,741
Well, we can change that.

391
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:43,954
Mmm, ow, my hair.

392
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:44,888
Oh, it's my watch.

393
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:47,991
What was that?

394
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,658
Something lemon-scented.

395
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:50,961
Here.
Take that off.

396
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:55,832
- Leave it!
- What?

397
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:58,168
It takes my mind off the smell!
Keep going!

398
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,350
Are you okay?

399
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:14,918
Yeah, the window cleaner
broke my fall.

400
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:16,086
I'm fine.

401
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:19,990
- Are your eyes burning?
- Nothing we can't handle.

402
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,158
No.

403
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:26,830
Do you smell ammonia?

404
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,737
Dr. Park?

405
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,139
I'm gonna walk this off.

406
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,244
You smell very lemony.

407
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,013
What are you still doing here?
Didn't the residents tell you to go home?

408
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:45,282
I ignored them.
This is my one job and my one mission.

409
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:46,715
Okay, there was a case
in Mauritius

410
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,785
where they removed
bilateral schwannomas

411
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,987
in a patient with
recent sickle cell crisis

412
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,390
using a bilateral endoscopic-
assisted keyhole approach

413
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:55,025
with preserved hearing.

414
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:56,159
How'd you find this?

415
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:57,827
I used AI software to search

416
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:00,130
all potentially relevant
non-English-language articles.

417
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:01,730
This is great, Charlie.

418
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:06,570
Tell Jordan and Kalu
to take it to the patient.

419
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:08,939
Now my tablet smells lemony.

420
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,541
- But it's streak-free.
- Oh.

421
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:16,379
Hey.

422
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:20,016
You heard they're calling
a board meeting tomorrow?

423
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,785
Mmm-hmm.

424
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,186
Can you cover for me?

425
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,455
I got Warrior tickets.

426
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,590
Show them to me.

427
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:30,060
You think I'm making up
Warrior tickets?

428
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:34,097
Take out your phone
and show me the tickets.

429
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,703
Does it count if I buy them
right now?

430
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:43,473
Honestly, I wish
I <i>could</i> cover it.

431
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,709
It would be preferable
to taking my mom shopping.

432
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:49,446
She wants a TV tray,

433
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,047
and tomorrow's
my one free night.

434
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:52,916
You're kidding, right?
You'd rather cover a board meeting

435
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:54,718
than hang out with your mom?

436
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,287
Yeah.

437
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,756
Does she have leprosy?

438
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:03,093
I mean, look, she's a lovely
person with everyone else,

439
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,462
but when it's just us,
conversation starts

440
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,998
as a critique of my life
and devolves into an argument.

441
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,165
That's a sad story.

442
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:16,139
I'll take her shopping,
for two board meetings.

443
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:20,543
Deal.

444
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:21,745
Okay.

445
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,488
The endoscopic keyhole approach

446
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,156
poses a much smaller risk.

447
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:40,430
If there's any chance
of me losing my hearing,

448
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:42,699
I can't do it.

449
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,770
I mean, my music,
it's all I have.

450
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,272
Not too long ago,
I thought I had it all.

451
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:51,675
I traveled the world.

452
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:54,577
Cushy job, great benefits.

453
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:56,046
It ticked every box on the list

454
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,716
of what I thought
was right for me.

455
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,718
Then luck of the draw
brought me back here,

456
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,487
and I realized how much
better things might be.

457
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:08,793
I just had to embrace
the unknown.

458
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:12,696
Best decision I ever made.

459
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,635
What do you think?

460
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:27,577
That God wants you
to really live.

461
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,414
And he brought you here
so we can save you.

462
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:40,890
Let's embrace the unknown.

463
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,841
His numbers all look good.
We can discharge him tomorrow.

464
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,680
We always wanted kids.

465
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:07,813
He couldn't wait to be a dad.

466
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:09,943
Then I got diagnosed
with breast cancer.

467
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,289
Stage three. Really aggressive.
I was so sick.

468
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:16,226
And Cam?

469
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,797
He took a leave of absence
so that he could be with me

470
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:25,101
every miserable hour
of every miserable day.

471
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:29,706
And that wonderful man
is still in there somewhere.

472
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,105
If I try to look
after both of them,

473
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,965
I won't be enough
for either of them.

474
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:46,262
I'm going to terminate
my pregnancy.

475
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:05,477
First, I check his diaper,
if it's pinching anywhere,

476
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:07,370
then his bottom
to see if there's a rash.

477
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,938
If he's still crying,
try a cuddle,

478
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:11,065
but he prefers a swaying motion,
not an up and down.

479
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:12,829
- And if that doesn't work, he...
- I have compiled

480
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:14,722
a comprehensive
"Guide to Steve Care,"

481
00:28:14,747 --> 00:28:16,891
which includes links
for diagnosing conjunctivitis,

482
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,118
UTIs, febrile seizures, menin...

483
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,245
Okay, first of all,
I'm a doctor.

484
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,839
Second of all, I grew up
watching brothers, cousins,

485
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:25,065
neighbors' kids,
and some of their cousins.

486
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:27,812
I will call you
at the slightest issue.

487
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:29,038
Now, please go.

488
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:07,080
This does kinda
seem like old times.

489
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:10,715
The karaoke selection no longer
offers "Islands in the Stream,"

490
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,246
but they do have
a lot of A-B-B-A.

491
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:17,650
Still, look at us,
out on a date night,

492
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:22,021
just the two of us.
This is nice, right?

493
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:24,090
And they replaced the ballast

494
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,293
on the neon sign
that was buzzing.

495
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:27,860
Oh.

496
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:32,798
Mmm, this is not

497
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:35,302
the same brand of tequila
they used to serve.

498
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:39,705
It's Jordan!

499
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,107
It's Jordan.

500
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,008
What?

501
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:45,477
No, it's in the fridge.

502
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,046
Is he crying?

503
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,048
Oh, okay.

504
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:50,583
Everything else good?

505
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:53,018
Great. Yeah, okay.

506
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:54,353
Okay, bye.

507
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,723
She couldn't find his pacifier.

508
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:58,691
Steve's fine.

509
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,860
Oh.

510
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:02,195
Yeah.

511
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:11,871
I'm sorry, but this is <i>not</i>
like old times.

512
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:14,506
It's not just the tequila

513
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,142
and the music that's changed.

514
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:18,878
Everything has changed,

515
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:22,249
how I see the world,
how I see you,

516
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:25,918
how I see me.

517
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:30,223
One teeny-tiny, little baby,
and the whole world looks different.

518
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,943
I should go to the hospital.

519
00:30:51,077 --> 00:30:54,780
You go to the hospital.
I'll go home to Steve.

520
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:56,048
Okay.

521
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,426
Hi.

522
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,262
Felt like an apology
offering was in order.

523
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,066
Dinner? Shaun mentioned
you were babysitting.

524
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:19,705
I am starving,
and it smells delicious.

525
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:21,941
It tastes even better.

526
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:24,177
It is, uh, fenkata,

527
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:27,780
a Maltese stew with vegetable,
wine, and rabbit.

528
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:29,882
Hmm.

529
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:33,452
What if your favorite dish
is something you've never tried?

530
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:37,424
Y-You think me facing the
unknown is eating bunny soup?

531
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:38,524
- Hard pass.
- Look, if you don't like it,

532
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,260
we can order
something else, okay?

533
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,830
Um...

534
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,266
Do not be a coward.

535
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:51,503
Mmm.

536
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:54,540
- It's...
- Bussin'.

537
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:57,444
Definitely bussin'.

538
00:31:58,378 --> 00:31:59,845
I'll make you a plate.

539
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,582
I got your ultrasound set up
on his left side.

540
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:04,950
Okay.
I am testing a theory.

541
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:06,453
Wake up, please!

542
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,656
What are the words
we asked you to remember?

543
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,524
What are you doing in my house?

544
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:13,726
I'm... I'm calling
the police.

545
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:15,261
I'm...

546
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:19,865
What are the words
we asked you to remember?

547
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,337
A-Apple, elephant,
planet, and table.

548
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:25,472
Oh.

549
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:27,039
What just happened?

550
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:30,276
His Alzheimer's is atypical
because it is not Alzheimer's.

551
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,610
His left jugular is compressed

552
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,612
and restricting blood flow
from his brain,

553
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:34,780
which is only restored
when his head is turned

554
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,849
to the right
at least 60 degrees.

555
00:32:36,982 --> 00:32:39,752
There definitely is
a viable treatment option,

556
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:41,720
a surgery.

557
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:45,058
I will tell your wife.

558
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,529
That guy's good.

559
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,738
Let's optimize hemoglobin.
Stand by with two more units of RBCs.

560
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,138
It's ethnically matched,
and our supply is low,

561
00:32:58,272 --> 00:32:59,306
so I'm working on a plan

562
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,643
to recruit
African American blood donors

563
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:03,812
to help sickle cell patients.

564
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,245
Thank you, Charlie.

565
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:08,081
Opening arachnoid
and draining CSF from cistern.

566
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,183
Retracting the cerebellum.

567
00:33:12,386 --> 00:33:15,122
And there's our big schwannoma.

568
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:17,090
Dr. Allen, would you like
to debulk the tumor?

569
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,794
Rhoton dissector
and microsuction.

570
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,802
You did some great work
on this case.

571
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:29,169
Can you tell Dr. Murphy?

572
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:36,310
Charlie, I know Shaun
is your hero,

573
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:38,011
but I can see that you have
a future as a surgeon.

574
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:40,347
You just need
to believe it, too.

575
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,115
Of course I believe it.
The only one

576
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:44,318
who lacks confidence
in me is Dr. Murphy.

577
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:46,955
I just thought it might help
if you told him he's wrong.

578
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:00,969
What's your favorite song?

579
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,642
Say you won't let go.

580
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,183
"Say You Won't Let Go"
by James Arthur.

581
00:34:16,316 --> 00:34:18,018
Your hearing is intact.

582
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:23,056
And we have a spot
in our sickle cell disease

583
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,993
gene therapy trial,
if you'd like.

584
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:33,200
Thank you.
Thank you for taking care of me.

585
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,005
It's what I do.

586
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:40,008
You never answered my question.

587
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,911
About dinner.

588
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:51,259
I think I'm going
to take a rain check.

589
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:56,925
Nathan, you are amazing,

590
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:59,761
and you're
everything I pray for.

591
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:03,031
But I know myself, and...

592
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:05,733
I might need to face
some unknowns, too.

593
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,036
Mmm.

594
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:15,375
For now,

595
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,745
I'd love to hear that song.

596
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,050
Mmm-hmm.

597
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,080
Gilly.

598
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:57,685
Talk to him from here.

599
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,095
Hey.

600
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,165
Why are you standing?

601
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:16,436
You should be sitting.

602
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,876
You're pregnant, Gilly.

603
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:29,017
Yeah. I am.

604
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:48,670
What if we never get it back?

605
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:50,203
Get what back?

606
00:36:50,337 --> 00:36:52,140
How hot we used to be
for each other.

607
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:53,741
We used to be unstoppable,

608
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,209
and that was
before I even liked you.

609
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:58,245
We're in a better place now.

610
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:01,281
We're a team, raising Eden.

611
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:02,984
I love the new us,

612
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:05,153
but I don't want
to lose the old version.

613
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:06,654
Me, either.

614
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:11,659
It took Mia and I awhile
to get our groove back.

615
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:12,994
This is normal.

616
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:14,095
Thanks for comparing me
to your ex-wife.

617
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:15,530
Relax.
I'm trying to make a point.

618
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:17,932
Did you just tell me to relax?
That is so dismissive.

619
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,332
I'm offering perspective,
but if you're gonna go

620
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:21,368
from zero to bitch
in 10 seconds...

621
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:23,336
Oh, you think I'm a bitch now,
you have no idea.

622
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:32,880
<i>This is my wedding dress.</i>

623
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:35,183
Oh, that's gorgeous.

624
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,051
<i>- She's turning red.
- I will have a heart attack.</i>

625
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:39,554
Ooh!

626
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:41,089
<i>Take it off.</i>

627
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:42,924
<i>Go change. Go change.</i>

628
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:45,727
<i>- Hang in there. Hang in there.
- You look beautiful.</i>

629
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,394
<i>It's a beautiful dress,
but I just don't see it</i>

630
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:49,296
<i>for your wedding day.</i>

631
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:54,135
- We had a date.
<i>- Yeah, I know we had a...</i>

632
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,603
I wore my nice cashmere sweater,

633
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:57,572
the one that you bought me
for our anniversary.

634
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:59,006
<i>- I know, I...</i>
- But you were too busy, right?

635
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,475
You were probably hooking up
with Carter Nix.

636
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:02,143
<i>- What?</i>
- And, sure, we never talked about

637
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,212
ground rules,
but I just thought...

638
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:07,380
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.</i>

639
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:10,283
<i>I am so sorry
that I missed our date,</i>

640
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,352
<i>but jet lag is kicking my ass,</i>

641
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:14,421
<i>so I fell asleep,
unfed, uncharged,</i>

642
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:16,591
<i>which is why my phone's
been dead all day today.</i>

643
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:19,392
<i>But I have zero interest</i>

644
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:21,462
<i>in anyone in the entire world
besides you.</i>

645
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:27,568
<i>And Carter Nix will not stop
doing the Aussie accent.</i>

646
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:29,637
<i>And it's... It's terrible.</i>

647
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,109
<i>You look adorable, by the way.</i>

648
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:43,084
Alright, I'll get the wine.

649
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:46,754
Well, mission accomplished.

650
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,055
Thank you for your help.

651
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:49,657
Oh, no.
Happy to help.

652
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:52,260
You have no idea.

653
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:55,328
So, how do you like
to consume your TV?

654
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,598
Are you a binger or a savorer?

655
00:38:57,732 --> 00:38:59,432
Oh.

656
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:02,970
Yeah, no, I don't really
watch much anymore at all.

657
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:06,207
Then what's with the TV tray?

658
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,409
Just an excuse
to spend time with Audrey.

659
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:11,179
Thought we'd do better
with an activity.

660
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:13,281
See, and here you are,
stuck with me.

661
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:15,183
Oh. No.

662
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:17,819
You have been very sweet.

663
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:21,656
I just wish Audrey
liked me more.

664
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:24,559
Yeah, parenting,
not for the meek, huh?

665
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,828
Speaking from experience?

666
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:28,963
Yeah.

667
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:31,032
How many kids?

668
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:33,968
My daughter.
She passed when she was 19.

669
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:37,939
Oh, I am so sorry.

670
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:39,439
I-I didn't mean...

671
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:42,109
No, no, no, no, no.
It's fine.

672
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:44,612
After you.

673
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:54,021
May I ask,

674
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:57,424
what was your daughter's name?

675
00:39:57,558 --> 00:39:59,827
Maddie.

676
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:01,095
What is that smell?

677
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,365
Oh, my God. Best crepes in town.
May I buy you one?

678
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,703
I would kill
for a Galette Bretonne.

679
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:10,338
I don't know what that is,
but it sounds delicious.

680
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:17,211
Here we go.

681
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:19,914
- Thank you.
- Hello.

682
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:23,416
Mmm, olives are gross.

683
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:26,854
You thought rabbit was gross
until you tried it.

684
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:30,558
Uh-uh-uh.
I've had olives. I hate olives.

685
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:33,294
Don't "uh-uh."
You haven't tried Castelvetrano olives.

686
00:40:33,426 --> 00:40:36,764
- Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh.
- Okay? They're mild, buttery,

687
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:38,398
meaty, with a crisp bite.

688
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:41,903
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

689
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:43,104
Yeah.

690
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:44,705
Fine.

691
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,275
But only because I do need
to refuel after this.

692
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:52,880
- How are olives meaty?
- How are they not?

693
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:54,882
Okay, first it was rabbit,
and now it's olives.

694
00:40:55,016 --> 00:40:55,917
Like, what is the meal...

695
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:07,261
Last night, I missed Steve, too.

696
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:11,599
And it's very difficult,

697
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:13,734
because whenever I'm away
from you, I miss you.

698
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:17,204
And when I'm away
from Steve, I miss him.

699
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:25,479
I know, Shaun.

700
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:29,317
But having more people to miss

701
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,285
means having
more people to love.

702
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,091
You were right.

703
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:41,929
Our lives will never
be the same again.

704
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,436
They'll be better.
