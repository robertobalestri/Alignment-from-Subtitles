1
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:04,673
How long have you known?

2
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:09,586
About a week or two.

3
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:12,214
My doctor found it
on the yearly scan.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,921
Did they give you
a sense of how long?

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,056
-Three to six.
-Years?

6
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:24,776
Months.

7
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:31,707
What's your plan?

8
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,603
Is there a surgery or chemo?

9
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,864
No. This is my plan right here.

10
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,106
You. You're it.

11
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,442
You're the plan.

12
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:42,572
And you.

13
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:44,705
And that one.

14
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:48,283
And maybe some bowling.

15
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,289
I have to go to work.

16
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,728
Last time, you also said
it was inoperable. Goodbye.

17
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,132
He just took your medical file.

18
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,767
Yeah.

19
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,589
I'm so sorry, Glassy.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,581
Me too.

21
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:38,098
Despite having you on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone,

22
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,067
your post-op infection
is still progressing.

23
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,802
We're waiting for
the cultures to grow out,

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,505
but we suspect MRSA.

25
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:45,806
I'm thinking we debride
the infected tissue,

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,709
then flush antibiotics
directly into the wound

27
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,976
and put in drains.

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,110
Good call.

29
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:51,145
I'll put it on the schedule,

30
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,147
and leave you two alone.

31
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,852
I guess we weren't
exactly subtle.

32
00:01:58,986 --> 00:01:59,788
No.

33
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,959
You said you wanted more
than a one-night stand.

34
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:08,797
I did.

35
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,500
But, uh,

36
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:14,469
how would we do that?

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,005
I don't know.

38
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,375
But...

39
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,110
I would like to make it work.

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,012
Me too.

41
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,322
Oh, it's Shaun. He wants me in
the Residents' Lounge, stat.

42
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,010
The patient
is a 68-year-old man

43
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:39,302
diagnosed with grade IV
butterfly glioblastoma,

44
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,463
from the left
frontotemporal lobe.

45
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,699
Do we have
a full medical record?

46
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,767
Patient history?

47
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,268
Or a name?

48
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:49,738
Successful surgical resection
for glioma five years ago,

49
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,971
followed by
chemo and radiation.

50
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,507
And within the past year,

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,708
several minor strokes.

52
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,478
Glioma and strokes.

53
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,045
Are those Glassman's?

54
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,349
His cancer's back?

55
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:04,952
The patient's identity
isn't medically relevant.

56
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,455
How is he? How are you, Shaun?

57
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,024
The patient's identity
isn't medically relevant.

58
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,363
Shaun, did Dr. Glassman
ask you to develop a treatment?

59
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:17,766
No, he didn't.
Otherwise, he'd be here.

60
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,735
The patient is reluctant
to pursue treatment,

61
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:23,036
but the patient is also
not aware of new developments.

62
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,873
You and Jordan go do
Claire's debridement.

63
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:30,705
I'm sorry, Shaun. I can't.

64
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:42,516
Looking at the axial images
with contrast...

65
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,733
How's Claire?

66
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,067
Looks like MRSA. We've got her
on vanc and ceftriaxone.

67
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,138
Rack 'em up.

68
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,876
Said the woman who
hates the fact that there's

69
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,912
a pool table in
the president's lounge

70
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:05,946
to a dying man?

71
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,218
Shaun?

72
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,621
He's got a group brainstorming
a treatment plan for you.

73
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,777
-I'll rejoin them
if you want me to.
-No.

74
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,830
Thank you.

75
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,336
Hey, look at the bright side.

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,104
When I'm gone,
no more co-presidency.

77
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,441
You can run this joint
however you want.

78
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:35,643
I never wanted it
in the first place.

79
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,745
Stop. You're a natural.

80
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,950
Even if you are overly invested
and too accessible...

81
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,121
In every other way,
you're amazing.

82
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:55,530
This sucks.

83
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:02,971
Shut up and rack 'em.

84
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,213
No sign of any more
devascularized tissue.

85
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,215
Proceeding with
antibiotic irrigation.

86
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:18,987
Looked like you two were
reconnecting last night.

87
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,989
Yeah.

88
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,392
Did that...
Does that bother you?

89
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,996
It caught me
off guard a little.

90
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:32,000
You could have told me you two
had unfinished business.

91
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,167
You're with Perez.

92
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,206
Danny and I are texting a lot,

93
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,543
and, yes, I do hope and pray
my future is with him.

94
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,378
That's why I backed off
and stopped flirting with you.

95
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:45,213
You and me, we're friends.

96
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,016
Placing the drain.

97
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:53,186
Thing about friends is,
no holding out.

98
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,023
I told you about me and Danny,
you tell me

99
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,725
when your ex you're not over
is back in town.

100
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,027
I can close.

101
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,061
Deal.

102
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,865
To both.

103
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,167
I'll go check on the cultures,

104
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:08,636
see which antibiotics
are working.

105
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:30,190
Shaun, have you tried calling
the Tisch Brain Tumor Center

106
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,493
or Cleveland Clinic about
their in-progress GBM trials?

107
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:37,065
That is an excellent idea.

108
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,067
I'll keep things rolling here.

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,105
Come on, guys,
I need some energy,
some enthusiasm.

110
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,241
Stop pitching the same idea.
Start pitching any idea.

111
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,777
I ran out an hour ago.

112
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:51,704
How long are we supposed
to keep doing this?

113
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,581
Until Shaun accepts
what we already know.

114
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,517
That there is no treatment.

115
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,138
-What do you got?
-Nothing's working.

116
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,101
Not a single antibiotic made
a dent in Claire's infection.

117
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:18,940
It's not MRSA.

118
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:27,973
We cleared out
all the infected tissue,

119
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,789
but initial cultures confirm
you don't have MRSA.

120
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,090
You have acinetobacter.

121
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:37,261
It's resistant to everything.

122
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:39,096
One of the antibiotic combos
slowed growth a little.

123
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,998
We'll try that.

124
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:43,233
But mostly, we need
your immune system
to beat this thing.

125
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:47,037
Are you scared?

126
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,941
I heard about Glassman.
How's he holding up?

127
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,646
Better than the rest of us,
I think.

128
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,614
At least, he's acting like it.

129
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:00,350
Congratulations.

130
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,221
I assume they'll
offer you the presidency.

131
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:06,557
Look,

132
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,258
it is a terrible way
to get the offer,

133
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:10,794
but it is still
a huge accomplishment.

134
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:16,133
There's another offer.

135
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:18,802
Chief of surgery
at the hospital

136
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,872
where Clay's doing
his fellowship in Chicago.

137
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:25,275
I'd get to focus
on surgery again,

138
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,177
be with Clay again.

139
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:30,147
But?

140
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,586
How did you know it was
the right choice

141
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:38,055
to move to Guatemala?

142
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,161
It made me want to throw up.

143
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,599
It was <i>so</i> terrifying.

144
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,103
But in an exhilarating
kind of way.

145
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:59,109
What?

146
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:00,612
You're sweating.

147
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,325
I'm looking for
stuff to scavenge.

148
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,994
Oh, well, help yourself.

149
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:21,633
Just stay away from the scotch.
I'm gonna need that.

150
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,172
Tell me about your bucket list.

151
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:29,641
Bucket list? Hmm.

152
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,012
Criss-cross the Serengeti with
a backpack and a pitch tent.

153
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,147
Wrestle an alligator and win.

154
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:39,216
Or go bowling.

155
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:40,652
I didn't take you
for a Pin Prince.

156
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,187
A bowler?

157
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,489
I'm kind of
a Strike Siren myself.

158
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,158
Park and I are in a league.

159
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:50,961
I wasn't expecting that.

160
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,039
I know what I want.

161
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,682
When you were treating
my rheumatoid arthritis,

162
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:11,683
there was this

163
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,551
one day when you were
going over my

164
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,888
X-rays and blood work

165
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:20,857
and medical history,

166
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:23,527
all this stupid paperwork
about me and my stupid hands,

167
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:26,597
and it all felt
so overwhelming.

168
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,202
And then you gathered it up
into this nice, neat pile,

169
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:33,705
and you
paper-clipped it together.

170
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,711
And all of a sudden,
it felt manageable, like,

171
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,946
maybe I would be okay.

172
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,754
Also, I can use it
to jimmy open

173
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,222
the filing cabinet
in my office.

174
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:53,223
I can't find the key.

175
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,531
Thank you.

176
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:17,848
I sense you've cracked it.

177
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,652
No, we've made
no progress at all.

178
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,290
Shaun, we've been
at this all day.

179
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:28,258
It's only 3:15.

180
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,060
We've been at this
for over seven hours,

181
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,629
with six people
looking non-stop.

182
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:34,766
If there was
a miracle cure to find,

183
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,134
-I think we would've--
-I found something!

184
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,776
A maximal resection
would debulk the tumor

185
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,510
down to
a one-centimeter margin.

186
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:48,378
Minimally invasive techniques
could be used.

187
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:50,547
You would only be
in the hospital for
one to two nights,

188
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,983
and overall recovery
would be faster

189
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,118
because they wouldn't be
operating in the brain stem.

190
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:56,420
The surgery
would be followed

191
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,121
by an experimental
ultrasound therapy.

192
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:01,091
Thank you. An experimental
ultrasound therapy,

193
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,592
breaking down
the blood-brain barrier

194
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,762
to increase chemo penetration,
allowing for a lower dose.

195
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,632
There would still be
some side effects,

196
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:09,801
but we could take
more edibles together

197
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,202
and eat Mallomars. Mm.

198
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,847
It could give you
as much as a year.

199
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,650
Maybe more,
if you respond well.

200
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:32,289
Claire is in septic shock.
I have to go.

201
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:36,828
I will be back later
to answer any questions.

202
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,733
Temp's 103.

203
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,368
BP's low, cardiac output
is declining.

204
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:45,936
We could do another
wound debridement.

205
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,138
It's in her blood. The wound is
not the biggest issue anymore.

206
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,040
But clearing it out
allows her immune system

207
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:51,375
to focus its resources
elsewhere.

208
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:54,111
Not enough. We could try
a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

209
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:55,412
Guys.

210
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:57,080
We all know the answer.

211
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,386
You have to put me in a coma.

212
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,321
-No.
-We're not there yet.

213
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:08,125
We are.

214
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,732
Shutting down your
other metabolic demands

215
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,768
will allow your body to

216
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,870
focus on fighting
the infection.

217
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:23,907
I know, once you put me under,

218
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:25,877
that may be...

219
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:34,685
But this is my best chance
to beat this thing.

220
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,934
Hey.

221
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,907
Have you looked over
the materials?

222
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,208
I highlighted
relevant sections.

223
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:00,444
I have, and I appreciate

224
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:01,612
what you're trying
to do, Shaun.

225
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,413
Yes. It is a very good plan.

226
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:04,816
I'm not going to do it.

227
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:09,654
I don't want to spend
my remaining days
sick and in pain.

228
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:12,022
I might not be able
to talk normally.

229
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,057
I might not be able
to walk normally.

230
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,626
I'll have memory loss.

231
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,929
Oh, there is
a less than 20% chance.

232
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,129
I don't want to take
that chance.

233
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:22,934
But it could give you
more time.

234
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,071
A year, maybe,

235
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:30,273
and in and out of hospitals
half the time.

236
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:31,943
Or, Shaun,

237
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,312
or I could do nothing

238
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:36,580
and have six good months.

239
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,851
I could spend those good months

240
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,518
with you and Lea

241
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:43,754
and Steve.

242
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,113
Please don't touch anything.

243
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,485
Glassman rejected the plan.

244
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:49,122
His three concerns were
impairment of motor and speech,

245
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:51,456
loss of memory,
side effects of the chemo.

246
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,760
I just need to find ways
to mitigate those risks.

247
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,137
You are just standing there.

248
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,043
You are here to tell me
to stop working

249
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:12,145
on Dr. Glassman's case.

250
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,447
No, Shaun.

251
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:17,817
It's your choice.

252
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,909
The rocuronium will
temporarily paralyze you

253
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:45,178
to make intubation easier.

254
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,646
Once the tube is in, we'll do
a continuous propofol drip.

255
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:51,184
You ready?

256
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,203
I forgot a med.

257
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,211
I can't say goodbye.

258
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:21,214
Just got you back.

259
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:24,416
I love you.

260
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:27,754
I...

261
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,222
I'm so sorry

262
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,058
we lost so much time.

263
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:34,794
Hey.

264
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,232
We needed that time
to get back here.

265
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,400
We weren't ready before.

266
00:17:44,302 --> 00:17:45,637
We were too dumb.

267
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:47,974
We were so dumb.

268
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,249
But I did tell you
that I think, one day,

269
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,683
we'd both be very happy.

270
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:03,923
I just didn't realize
it would be together.

271
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:10,263
I love you, too, Claire Browne.

272
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,635
And I really wish
I could kiss you right now.

273
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,284
Where is Shaun?

274
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,293
Claire's asking for you.

275
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,495
I am working on her case.

276
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,832
Currently, I'm working
on Dr. Glassman's,

277
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:49,001
but I will switch back
in 3 minutes and 27 seconds.

278
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:50,803
She might not wake up, Shaun.

279
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,206
She wants to say goodbye.

280
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:56,309
I will find a way
to save them both.

281
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,477
Oncolytic viruses
have been used to infect

282
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:02,949
and destroy cancer cells,
but the viruses won't work

283
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,952
because Dr. Glassman's tumor
was previously EGFR negative...

284
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:07,720
-Shaun.
-...so there is no target
for the virus to attach to,

285
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,355
-but if I could find
a different receptor --
-Shaun.

286
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:13,860
Your very good friend,
who might die,

287
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:16,494
is asking for
a few minutes of your time,

288
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:18,865
but you're too busy ignoring
the expressed wishes

289
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,199
of your other friend
who's dying.

290
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:25,805
I know you're scared.

291
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,442
But you're being a bad friend

292
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:33,212
when the people you love
could really use a good one.

293
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,086
I know how to save Claire.

294
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,360
Hello. We can use viruses

295
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,695
to cure Claire's
bacterial infection.

296
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,597
Bacteriophages, to be precise.

297
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:27,599
They are viruses
that attack and infiltrate

298
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,502
only bacteria, and then
destroy them from the inside.

299
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,604
Every bacteriophage
only infects certain kinds
of bacteria.

300
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:33,940
All we need to do is find one

301
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:35,942
that will attack
Claire's infection.

302
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:37,376
There are billions of phages.

303
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:38,978
Are any of them known
to work on acinetobacter?

304
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,048
- No.
- So, we're searching

305
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:44,917
through a billion haystacks
for one needle?

306
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,451
Not exactly.

307
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,854
Each phage can attack
more than one kind of bacteria,

308
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,958
so it is more like searching
a billion haystacks

309
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:53,326
for a million needles.

310
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,760
And where are
we supposed to find these

311
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:56,494
haystacks, or needles?

312
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,731
Bacteriophages. The metaphor
is not helping.

313
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,532
We need to collect the phages,

314
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:02,435
as many as we can,
as fast as we can.

315
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,170
Phage therapy
is experimental.

316
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:07,572
We would need a compassionate
use authorization from the FDA,

317
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:09,442
-but they've--
-But that's tomorrow's problem.

318
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:10,743
Today, we've got to find
the right phage.

319
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,280
According to
the microbiology department

320
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:15,715
of the CDC,
the most common sources

321
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,383
of bacteriophages are swamps,

322
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:19,218
farms, storm drains,
and sewage plants.

323
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,324
I noticed her left forearm
felt cold with a weak pulse.

324
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,259
-Septic emboli?
-Poor blood flow.

325
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:28,461
Already showing signs
of ischemia.

326
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:31,496
We can do a thrombectomy,

327
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:33,498
try to remove the clot
and slow progress of infection.

328
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:36,235
Her body's putting a ton of
resources into saving this arm,

329
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,903
which is taking energy away
from saving her vital organs.

330
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,273
She can live without an arm.

331
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:44,844
Let's try
the thrombectomy first.

332
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:46,912
We need transport.

333
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:53,219
I have taken your concerns
into account

334
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:54,720
and formed
a new treatment plan.

335
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:59,125
I don't want
a new treatment plan, Shaun.

336
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,326
You don't know.
You haven't looked.

337
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:03,595
We will do
a fluorescence-guided

338
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,664
awake brain surgery
with cortical stimulation.

339
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,002
Shaun, I appreciate that
you're doing this out of,

340
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,569
you know, love.

341
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:13,205
But sometimes
when you love someone,

342
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:15,141
you don't have to
fight every fight.

343
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:18,511
You don't have to persevere
to the ends of the earth.

344
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:19,845
Sometimes, when you
love someone,

345
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,515
you just, you know,
take 'em bowling.

346
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:25,518
Six years ago,
you didn't give up,

347
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,520
and you got to see me
get married.

348
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:28,921
You got to meet your grandson.

349
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:30,022
You got to save more lives.

350
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:31,824
You were wrong then,

351
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:34,360
-and you are wrong now.
-Shaun, look at me, please.

352
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:36,228
Listen to me.
Look at me, please!

353
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,534
Is my tumor recurrent,
yes or no?

354
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:44,837
Yes.

355
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,540
Is it aggressive?
Is it even more aggressive?

356
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:55,047
There are
better treatments now.

357
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,549
We just need to
buy you some time.

358
00:22:58,751 --> 00:22:59,852
I shouldn't have told you.

359
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:09,395
You are being selfish.

360
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:14,934
And you are a coward.

361
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:20,106
You could keep fighting
and have more time with me

362
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,341
and with Lea and with Steve,
but you are giving up.

363
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,910
You are giving up on all of us.

364
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,588
If you are giving up on me...

365
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:41,392
then I have to give up on you.

366
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,867
The thrombectomy didn't
fully clear the blood clot.

367
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,321
It's obstructing blood flow,

368
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:08,289
and the arm is showing
signs of necrosis.

369
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,359
I think we need to amputate.

370
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,195
Or we could try
an open thrombectomy.

371
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,931
It'll give us better access
to the clot.

372
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:18,833
It'll also risk seeding
the infection to other places.

373
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:20,167
We could start a heparin drip,

374
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:21,536
see if it'll give us
better blood flow.

375
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,238
The arm is taking resources

376
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:24,839
the rest of her body
desperately needs.

377
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:26,474
Her creatinine and LFTs
are trending up.

378
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,710
Her liver and her kidney
are starting to fail.

379
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,011
Putting off amputation
any longer,

380
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,146
it risks her life.

381
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,151
She wouldn't be
a surgeon anymore.

382
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:42,157
She loves her job
and is very good at it.

383
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:45,794
I know.

384
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,433
But what she loves

385
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,870
is the young girl in Guatemala
who walked half a day

386
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:57,205
to the hospital
with a broken ankle.

387
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:02,010
And the old man who
just lost his wife of 52 years

388
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,380
and needed someone
to hold his hand.

389
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,852
And the first-year
surgical resident

390
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,155
who was different,

391
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:15,890
but she saw something
special in him.

392
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:22,397
Claire loves people,

393
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,132
and she will find a way
to take care of people,

394
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:25,300
no matter what.

395
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,203
And I think,
if she was here right now,

396
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:28,970
listening to all of this,
she would tell us

397
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,772
to take her damn arm

398
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,507
and trust that she will find
a way forward,

399
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,075
because she...

400
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,211
she always has.

401
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,121
Prep the OR.

402
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,241
I thought you could use
some baby snuggles.

403
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:09,677
You have no idea.

404
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:10,945
Mm.

405
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,249
Come here.

406
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,252
Come here. I gotcha.

407
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:17,986
I gotcha.

408
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,821
Hi.

409
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,258
Hi. I gotcha. I gotcha.

410
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:25,693
I said no to

411
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:28,663
Shaun's plan twice.

412
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,271
I thought he'd be ready to

413
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:39,507
accept this eventually.

414
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:43,044
Well, "eventually" probably
means more than 48 hours.

415
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:51,753
I spent a couple of decades
trying to prepare him

416
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:54,290
for when I

417
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:57,293
wasn't going
to be around anymore.

418
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,298
Apparently, that wasn't enough.

419
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:08,703
Glassy...

420
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:12,308
I love you.

421
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:15,677
You are the first-wisest

422
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,880
and second-smartest person
I know,

423
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,349
but if you think you
haven't done enough for Shaun,

424
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:23,384
then I am sorry,
but you are a ginormous idiot.

425
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,554
Look at who you're holding.

426
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:30,525
That baby is here
because of what you did.

427
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:32,328
<i>I'm</i> here
because of what you did.

428
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:35,897
You saw who he was,
who he could be.

429
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,632
You saved his life,
and he knows it.

430
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,003
He will come around...

431
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:45,341
eventually.

432
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:48,509
Hi.

433
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,980
He doesn't have
a whole lot of time.

434
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,368
10-blade.

435
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,728
We've concluded our tour
of the most disgusting barns

436
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:41,996
in Northern California.

437
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,967
I have received hundreds
of phages from the CDC.

438
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,304
Charlie and Dom
are on their way with 87.

439
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,637
Have any showed promise so far?

440
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,274
None whatsoever.

441
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,077
Shaun, uh, can I talk to you?

442
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:58,980
I have samples to test.

443
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:02,116
Uh, it's important.

444
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:04,786
We'll keep gathering.

445
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,455
I know of
a slaughterhouse nearby.

446
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:09,425
- You know of a slaughterhouse?
-  -Mm-hmm.

447
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,700
You can't shut Glassman out.

448
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,936
I presented him with two plans.

449
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,305
He doesn't want them.
That's his choice.

450
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:25,173
His choice is wrong.

451
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,443
No, it isn't, Shaun.

452
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:41,390
I know how hard it is
for you to accept.

453
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,359
I know you don't want
to face any of this,

454
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:46,661
but Glassman is dying, Shaun.

455
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,468
And all this work you've
been doing to try to save him

456
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,470
is really for you.

457
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,673
You need a new plan.

458
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:02,176
A plan to say goodbye.

459
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:07,483
Right now, you can't
make yourself feel okay

460
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,684
about Glassman's decision,
and that is okay.

461
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:11,487
You don't have to.

462
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:13,489
But...

463
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,659
he <i>is</i> going to die,

464
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:21,497
and if you are not with him
for his final days,

465
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:25,099
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

466
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,171
So...

467
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:33,641
you need to plan

468
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:35,511
for your final days
with your father.

469
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,242
You are a very good friend.

470
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:20,456
I should have come earlier.

471
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,560
I am sorry.

472
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,577
Goodbye, Claire.

473
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:05,645
We've got it!

474
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:09,673
We've got it!

475
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:14,175
-The bacteriophage?
-Yes!

476
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,724
The right bacteriophage?

477
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:18,307
I said, "We've got it."
What else would I have meant?

478
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:20,777
Oh-ye!

479
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,324
I told you. I was not wrong.

480
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,660
I was not wrong
to not say goodbye.

481
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:30,993
I will see you very soon.

482
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,998
You have the data.
It's in the green folders.

483
00:32:36,132 --> 00:32:37,233
Stress the time frame,

484
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:39,302
the bacterial lysis times
were very striking,

485
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,337
and there were low levels
of endotoxins.

486
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:44,474
Oh, also, uh, her amputated arm
isn't strictly relevant,

487
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,476
but because we're applying
for a compassionate use,

488
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,578
anything that'll
make her appear

489
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:49,178
more sympathetic
will be helpful.

490
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:01,959
We can appeal.

491
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:05,995
But the whole point
of a compassionate use

492
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:08,030
is to allow people
with no other option.

493
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:09,365
They can take risks.

494
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,335
I am <i>so</i> angry.

495
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:13,402
Are you not angry?

496
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:21,512
Go back to the hospital

497
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:24,380
and prep Claire for
the bacteriophage treatment.

498
00:33:26,683 --> 00:33:27,885
Are you going to...

499
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:31,053
I don't know. I need to think.

500
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:57,014
Are you okay, Shaun?

501
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:59,415
Is Claire going to be okay?
Why did you text us?

502
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:01,317
I texted you

503
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,656
because when I have
important news,

504
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:08,057
you two are the people
I need to share it with.

505
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,734
On the day the copper pipes

506
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:19,736
in the old building
smelled like burnt food...

507
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,241
my brother taught me

508
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,878
that just because you
love somebody doesn't mean

509
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,513
you get to love them forever.

510
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:35,552
But I was okay

511
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,623
because I had you,
Dr. Glassman.

512
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:44,728
And on the day that...

513
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:52,736
On the day
that you go to heaven...

514
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:55,505
I will have Lea.

515
00:34:56,405 --> 00:34:57,641
I will have little Steve.

516
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,212
And on the day
the carousel smelled like oil,

517
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:05,247
the carousel you used
to go to with Maddie,

518
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:07,116
I told you I would go there

519
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:09,285
and think of you
after you're gone, and I will.

520
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,991
But I want to go
before then too.

521
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,794
I will go there with you.

522
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:24,668
And I will go bowling.
I will go bowling with you.

523
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:29,106
I will make a plan.
But I can't today because...

524
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:37,346
Because on the day you stood up
for me, I met Claire.

525
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,119
And she believed me.

526
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:47,124
And I spoke to people
in this room,

527
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:52,194
and I told them
I want to save people

528
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,463
so they can become adults

529
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,833
and have children
and love those children.

530
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:57,801
But I don't...

531
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:01,138
I don't need to save everyone.

532
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,708
I just need to save Claire.

533
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:17,587
The FDA did not approve
her treatment.

534
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,527
But I am going to give it
to her anyway.

535
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,832
And then I won't be
a doctor anymore.

536
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:33,335
And that's okay.

537
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,345
No. No.

538
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:49,086
No, Shaun, that's not okay.

539
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:08,088
Thank you.

540
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,430
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

541
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:44,243
I am Chief of Surgery

542
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:46,679
at San Jose
Saint Bonaventure Hospital.

543
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,125
I have
autism spectrum disorder,

544
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:01,227
which is part of the reason
that I remember the names

545
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,864
of all 1,524 people
whose lives I've helped save.

546
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,169
There were a lot of people

547
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:12,605
who did not want me
to be a surgeon

548
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:15,039
at Saint Bonaventure Hospital,
or anywhere,

549
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:17,877
because I was different.

550
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:23,215
I couldn't make eye contact.

551
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,318
I didn't know how to lie.
I made people uncomfortable.

552
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:30,088
But someone believed in me.

553
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,895
Dr. Aaron Glassman...

554
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,898
was my friend.

555
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:49,974
I love you, Dr. Glassman.

556
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,282
I love you more, Dr. Murphy.

557
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,144
<i>But you don't</i>
<i>even speak Ukrainian.</i>

558
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:27,513
They have translators, Mom.

559
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,785
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

560
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:35,955
Thanks.

561
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,026
We have to go.

562
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:07,479
Dr. Claire Browne

563
00:41:09,315 --> 00:41:11,050
is my friend.

564
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:16,055
Hello.

565
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:20,960
Dr. Glassman and I
saved her life.

566
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,263
Dr. Glassman saved
over 4,000 lives.

567
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,898
He would say less,
but I give him credit

568
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:27,333
for all the lives
that I have saved,

569
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,068
because he taught me

570
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:31,904
a mnemonic for remembering

571
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:32,972
the effects
of organophosphate poisoning,

572
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:34,273
and he taught me that

573
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:36,475
if you just palm grip
the needle driver,

574
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,911
you will get
way more maneuverability,
and force control.

575
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,113
And he taught me...

576
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:45,117
that when you touch one life,

577
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:47,553
you don't just touch one life.

578
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:51,957
You touch every life
that that life touches.

579
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:03,469
Dr. Glassman said
many wise things. Yes.

580
00:42:03,602 --> 00:42:05,304
And over the years, I have
tried to write them down.

581
00:42:13,545 --> 00:42:15,814
"Think about
what people can do,

582
00:42:15,948 --> 00:42:17,282
not about
what people can't do."

583
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:21,787
"Hear what I have to say,

584
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:25,190
and then decide
if it's bad advice."

585
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:28,694
"Questions are good."

586
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:31,230
"Leads to awareness
and understanding."

587
00:42:31,363 --> 00:42:34,134
"And, who knows,
maybe even acceptance."

588
00:42:40,606 --> 00:42:43,809
And when he wanted the board
to hire me, he said,

589
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:49,115
"We will be a better hospital
for hiring him."

590
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:51,984
"We will be better people
for hiring him."

591
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:55,988
And then he slammed
the desk with his hand,

592
00:42:56,122 --> 00:42:57,589
because that is
how you communicate

593
00:42:57,723 --> 00:42:59,425
that you really mean
what you are saying.

594
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:04,430
He always knew people
were looking to him,

595
00:43:04,563 --> 00:43:06,265
that they might
take lessons from him.

596
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:08,834
And if they did,

597
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:11,870
he always wanted
that lesson to be...

598
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,079
"Don't be an ass."

599
00:43:24,683 --> 00:43:26,018
"Don't be an ass."

600
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,788
It's not always easy.

601
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:37,197
Together, we planned,

602
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:42,034
and six months after he died,

603
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:44,204
I started...

604
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:47,606
the Dr. Aaron Glassman
Foundation

605
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,409
for Neurodiversity in Medicine,

606
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:53,213
which is today run by myself
and Dr. Claire Browne,

607
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:56,749
and has affiliations
with 17 hospitals

608
00:43:56,882 --> 00:43:58,684
and 32 medical schools.

609
00:44:11,363 --> 00:44:12,264
<i>I wanted to help people</i>

610
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:15,067
<i>and save lives.</i>

611
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:19,404
<i>And I wanted to make</i>
<i>a lot of money</i>

612
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:20,639
<i>so that I could buy</i>
<i>a television.</i>

613
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:25,310
<i>But because of Dr. Glassman,</i>

614
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:28,248
<i>I have much more than that.</i>

615
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:31,316
<i>I have many friends.</i>

616
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:37,689
<i>And I have a family.</i>

617
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,461
<i>And I have two televisions.</i>
