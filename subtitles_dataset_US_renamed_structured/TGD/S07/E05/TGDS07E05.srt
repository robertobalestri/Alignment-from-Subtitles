1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:01,741
Previously on The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:03,091
I'm Charlotte Lukaitis.

3
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:05,789
- Charlie. You are on my team.
- Yes!

4
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:08,400
Positive affirmations are
empowering for people with ASD.

5
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,575
My autism is awesome.

6
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,403
We should prep
a bolus dose of TPA.

7
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,275
No, we should not do that.

8
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:16,321
You ordered a nurse to prep an
unindicated and very risky medication.

9
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,454
I didn't order her I was just
making a suggestion. Get out!

10
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:21,892
I believe your intense curiosity

11
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:23,241
and attention to organization

12
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:25,722
will one day make you
an excellent pathologist.

13
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,332
I don't want to be
a pathologist.

14
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,508
I just want to be
a surgeon like you.

15
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:30,944
You're nothing like me.

16
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:33,686
So much of my life
in Orthodox world.

17
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,385
I still don't feel like
I know what I'm doing.

18
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,995
I have so little figured out,

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,562
except that I'm really into you.

20
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:43,870
- Mom?
- Hey, Audie.

21
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:46,264
But what are you doing here?
Are you okay?

22
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,659
Oh, I'm just here for a drug trial.
For my hyperthyroid.

23
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:51,878
You heard they're calling
a board meeting tomorrow?

24
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:53,967
- Can you cover for me?
- I wish I could cover it.

25
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:56,057
It would be preferable
to taking my mom shopping.

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,232
I'll take her shopping.

27
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:58,494
Thank you for your help.

28
00:00:58,537 --> 00:00:59,756
Oh, no. Happy to help.

29
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,584
See, and here you are,
stuck with me.

30
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,542
Oh! No.

31
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,718
You have been very sweet.

32
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,695
- Should we just...
- No.

33
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:28,089
Can't we just check on him?
It's been ten minutes.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,354
- Nine.
- I'm rounding up.

35
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:35,661
You shouldn't. This process
is tiring and difficult.

36
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,837
But once we finish,
we will all be happier

37
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,664
and more well-rested.

38
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:44,148
How does the crying
not bother you?

39
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:50,198
In prehistoric times,

40
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:52,113
when infants awoke in the night

41
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,549
and didn't see their parents,

42
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:56,551
it could mean they had
been killed by wild animals

43
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:57,814
or competing tribes.

44
00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:59,642
Steve's cries
are designed by nature

45
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:01,557
to alert other adults
to take care of him.

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,645
Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:04,429
How much longer?

48
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,431
Ten seconds.

49
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:09,913
Nine, eight...

50
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:12,742
seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

51
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:16,049
Don't worry, Steve.
Mommy's coming.

52
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,107
Mm.

53
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:32,370
Morning.

54
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,243
Morning.

55
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:36,722
That was fun.

56
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,812
Yeah.

57
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:40,944
Mm.

58
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:45,166
I have to go, unfortunately.

59
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,518
When's your first meeting?

60
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,307
After this.

61
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:01,051
I have a consult.

62
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,748
No, Shaun, please stay.

63
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,404
Sorry. I was, um...

64
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:09,712
Sorry.

65
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,409
I was just about to tell Shaun

66
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:13,411
that he'll be working
with Charlie Lukaitis today.

67
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,544
No, I'm going to work with Dom.

68
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,502
Charlie is disruptive
and distracting.

69
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,896
She should be failed
out of this rotation.

70
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,637
That's a harsh assessment,

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,248
and one you can't make until
she's completed her rotation.

72
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,468
Then...

73
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:28,687
I want to opt out of being
a teaching attending.

74
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:31,168
You can't do that, Shaun.
This is a teaching hospital.

75
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,865
You can't opt out.

76
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,651
Well, actually, you can,
but you lose access to the residents

77
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:36,869
Jordan, Kalu, Asher.

78
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:38,349
I prefer to work alone.

79
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,308
And you'd stick
to simple surgeries.

80
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:43,224
Lap choles, appendectomies,
hernia repairs.

81
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:45,574
Not to mention, you'd lose
a third of your salary.

82
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,577
I cannot teach her.

83
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,536
She interrupts me, and when
I point out her mistakes,

84
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,364
she just argues with me.

85
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:55,584
Well, why don't you stop
pointing out her mistakes?

86
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,454
Why don't you start

87
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:58,978
pointing out things
she does well?

88
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:00,980
Why would I do that?

89
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:03,287
Because when you criticize
people, they feel bad,

90
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,984
and that leads to arguments.

91
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,596
And that leads to Charlie
standing alone mute in an elevator.

92
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,467
And that leads
to more meetings with us.

93
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:12,731
I can't just
let her mistakes go.

94
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,865
So, how about you try
a compliment sandwich?

95
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,171
When you need to give
negative feedback,

96
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,869
stick it between
layers of praise.

97
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,960
Charlie...

98
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,658
doesn't have two pieces
of bread to work with.

99
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:32,229
Then make it a compliment
open-faced sandwich.

100
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,667
Find the bread, Shaun.

101
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,031
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, you okay?

102
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,859
Your door was closed
when I left.

103
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:56,906
I wasn't there. I, um...

104
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,213
stayed over at Aaron's.

105
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:03,565
You... s-slept over there?

106
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:04,783
Yes.

107
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:05,871
- Like...
- Yes.

108
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,310
I hope you don't have
a problem with that.

109
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,225
You're a grown woman.

110
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,880
That decided to have sex
with my co-president.

111
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:16,707
Sure. That's... fine.

112
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,971
Great.

113
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:22,105
It was amazing, Audrey.

114
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:23,846
I mean, for a man his age,

115
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,677
you cannot believe the stamina
and the decisiveness.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,852
That's great, Mom.

117
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,201
It's just sex.

118
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:33,116
I'll be going home
after the study is over.

119
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,207
But as sex goes,
this is pretty high quality.

120
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,214
Where did you fall?

121
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,130
In the shower.

122
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,914
I hate how old that
makes me sound.

123
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,221
Don't worry, you also lookold.

124
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,570
Oh, thank you for that.

125
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,922
BP's 100 over 70,
heart rate 75 BPMs.

126
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,360
Hip bone's swollen and deformed.

127
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:00,709
Does this hurt?

128
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,493
Ow! Ow!

129
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,409
You have a fractured
and dislocated hip.

130
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,150
Oh, no.

131
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:08,673
Don't worry. We'll get him
to the OR right away.

132
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,066
Your dad will be fine.

133
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:13,243
He's my fiance.

134
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,292
Then your fiance will be fine.

135
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:25,951
Thank you.

136
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,953
Hi! I know the last time
we worked together

137
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:29,825
could have gone better.

138
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,392
I always quote
the great Taylor Swift

139
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,089
at important moments,

140
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,960
- so let me just say...
- Don't do that.

141
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,962
I promise I won't
interrupt you today.

142
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,747
I'll work extra hard
to be helpful.

143
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,534
What were you doing when
you first started throwing up?

144
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,971
Walking with Mom.

145
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,364
We weren't
overdoing it or anything.

146
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,627
We walk together
every morning before school.

147
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,542
It's our special time.

148
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,370
That's awesome.
Do you know Mirna Valerio?

149
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,373
She's a large-bodied woman
who runs ultramarathons.

150
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,461
You could work
your way up to that.

151
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,549
Or just marathons.

152
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,116
That wasn't an interruption.

153
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,554
It was...

154
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:05,687
good that you did not
interrupt me,

155
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,993
but you did not need
to tell that story.

156
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:12,650
Although, it was not
completely irrelevant.

157
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:15,653
With the fever and white count,
I thought she had a UTI.

158
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,178
Lucy, please lie down.

159
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:26,403
Take a deep breath.

160
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,972
Positive Murphy sign.

161
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,930
And it was spotted
by Dr. Murphy. So cool.

162
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,584
It wasn't named after
Dr. Murphy, though.

163
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:35,804
It is, in fact,
named after Dr. Murphy.

164
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:37,545
- He just wasn't me.
- It's still cool.

165
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:39,634
There's nothing cool about it,

166
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,331
since it means Lucy's
gallbladder is inflamed

167
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:42,854
and will need to be removed.

168
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,857
Why would she be having
trouble with her gallbladder?

169
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,598
Probably because
she's morbidly obese.

170
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:51,646
But don't worry,

171
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:52,995
we do the surgery every day.

172
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,823
Not on teenagers, though.

173
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,047
I shouldn't have assumed.

174
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,441
Placing second guidewire.

175
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,791
But are we all just going to
ignore how gross this is?

176
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:09,098
I mean, he's old enough
to be her grandfather.

177
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,187
Lots of people think it's gross
that you and I are together.

178
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,623
Yes, but we're actually in love.

179
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,277
Okay? She's gold-digging.

180
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,672
- Another assumption.
- A deduction, actually.

181
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:20,588
If he's not loaded,
why would she be with him?

182
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,067
Also, I found her Instagram.

183
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,808
You should see the hotel
they stayed at in Baja.

184
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,985
And they've been engaged for a year,
but no wedding website.

185
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,596
He's clearly stalling,

186
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,424
trying to have as much sex
as he can before tossing her.

187
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,251
- He's 74.
- Yeah.

188
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,124
And a man.

189
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,692
Implanting primary FNS screw.

190
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,823
If she's after his money
and he's after her youth,

191
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:41,477
then they're both
getting something out of it.

192
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:44,786
Tightening locking screw.

193
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:50,879
Dissecting
the gallbladder off the liver.

194
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:53,621
Processed foods, sugary drinks,
schools dropping PE...

195
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:56,275
No wonder there's an epidemic
of childhood obesity.

196
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,496
Weight is a bad proxy
for health, actually. BMI, too.

197
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,716
It doesn't take into account
muscle mass or metabolic...

198
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,282
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

199
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,894
Oh, I, um...
I-I asked Charlie

200
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,286
to learn the tools
by laying them out.

201
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,812
Laparoscopic
instruments go on the left,

202
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,422
then clamps, scissors,
retractors, and sutures.

203
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,032
You have done the opposite.

204
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,560
You... did lay them out,
though.

205
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,606
Thank you.

206
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,566
One thing, though.
Shaming people who are overweight,

207
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:27,611
which, sorry, Shaun,
you kind of did

208
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:28,873
with that
"morbidly obese" comment,

209
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,396
can actually lead to overeating.

210
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,356
I was stating a medical fact.

211
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,706
Ultrasonic coagulator.
Starting the...

212
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,360
But if your fact
made her feel ashamed,

213
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:38,622
- then you...
- You inter...

214
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,887
Charlie, you did a good job

215
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,150
when you were not
interrupting me earlier.

216
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:46,674
Thank you.

217
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:47,892
But you did not do a good job

218
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:49,590
when you were interrupting me
just now.

219
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,896
Oh, I just thought we were
talking at the same time.

220
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,203
But you are doing
a good job right now

221
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:56,074
because you are
not interrupting...

222
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:57,902
It's mostly I'm completing your
train of thought, which helps.

223
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,121
Okay, I am running out of bread.

224
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:05,388
Shaun.

225
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,043
Her liver has yellow
diffuse deposits and fibrosis.

226
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:10,785
She has advanced fatty liver.

227
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,701
If this progresses,

228
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:15,616
she will need a liver transplant or she will die.

229
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:24,276
It may take a few months
to regain full mobility,

230
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,409
but that shouldn't stop you
from walking down the aisle.

231
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:28,672
Thank you so much, Doctor.

232
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,068
So, how'd you two meet?

233
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:36,506
Well, we needed some
legal work done at the school

234
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,682
where I teach
seventh grade English,

235
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,859
and somehow,
a big fancy litigator

236
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,078
took us on pro bono.

237
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:44,862
- Not that fancy.
- No. Fancy.

238
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,343
And very modest.

239
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:50,215
I had, uh, lost my wife,
Julie, to COVID

240
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,391
a couple of years before and...

241
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,871
Well, I was a mess.

242
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:56,091
I certainly never thought
I could fall in love again.

243
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,659
Neither of us
expected this to happen.

244
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,573
But we're real glad it did.

245
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:01,705
It's a beautiful story.

246
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:05,883
When's the big day?

247
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,105
Hey, are you okay?

248
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,323
Yeah, it's just
my stomach thing.

249
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,023
Uh, we're just waiting for Scott

250
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,286
to finish converting to Judaism.

251
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,636
I'm sure you know how long that
process can be, Dr. Wolke.

252
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,681
You're Jewish, right?

253
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:22,247
No.

254
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,642
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I...

255
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,209
I assumed...

256
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:31,996
I feel sick.

257
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,128
Ronit?

258
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:36,435
Ronit.

259
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,701
- Look at me.
- Ronit!

260
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,703
Crash cart!

261
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,713
Stomach and duodenum are normal.

262
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,628
Are you ready to admit
you're wrong about them?

263
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:51,457
Fine. They're in love.

264
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,240
But why not just
peacefully live out

265
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,113
his golden years together?

266
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,636
Why is she making him jump
through all these hoops to get married?

267
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,551
Does he really want to spend
the rest of his years

268
00:11:58,595 --> 00:11:59,987
studying the Book of Ruth?

269
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,728
She's not forcing him
to do anything.

270
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:02,860
He wants to make her happy.

271
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,296
Yeah, by pretending
to care about

272
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,993
something he doesn't
actually care about.

273
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,256
If he wants to stay married,
I also recommend pretending

274
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,476
to care about every
other thing she cares about.

275
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,086
Transverse colon is normal.

276
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,740
Also, it doesn't hurt
for a man of his age

277
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,742
to have a younger medical proxy
who cares about him.

278
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,831
So just give her
power of attorney.

279
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,660
Yeah, maybe in a ceremony.
She could wear white.

280
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:22,357
They could exchange rings.
What's that called?

281
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:24,229
Why are you so invested in this?

282
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,535
Why are you so cynical?

283
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,840
Guys.

284
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,626
Left ovary and pelvic organs.

285
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,331
Dr. Glassman and Dr. Lim

286
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,115
suggested
the compliment sandwich,

287
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,508
but it is very distracting

288
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,249
having to find two things
Charlie is doing right

289
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,816
just so I can correct
her mistakes.

290
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,645
There are a lot of them.

291
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,473
What do we do in sleep training
when Steve cries?

292
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:53,911
We ignore him.

293
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,042
Ignore her.

294
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,696
Charlie isn't a baby.

295
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,699
When she makes mistakes,
it affects patients.

296
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,658
How often do med students
get to do something

297
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:02,746
that could actually
hurt a patient?

298
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:05,966
Not very often.

299
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,969
So, when she does something
annoying, just let it go.

300
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:10,275
If you ignore the mistakes,

301
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,973
you don't need to look
for the compliments.

302
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,323
Well, yeah.
That is worth a try.

303
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:19,371
Lucy's coming out of anesthesia.

304
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,633
I have to go.

305
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,332
Have you forgotten something?

306
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:26,726
Something to steel you against
any level of annoyingness?

307
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:31,383
It smells of adorableness
and diaper cream?

308
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,746
Now go get your ignore on.

309
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:55,276
You have stage three
ovarian cancer.

310
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,452
It's spread beyond
the ovaries and pelvis.

311
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:03,154
I told my GP months ago

312
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:04,764
that I was having back pain
and nausea.

313
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,244
He said that it was
probably just stress.

314
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,507
Unfortunately,
that's not uncommon.

315
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,683
70% of cases are missed
at the early stages.

316
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:17,124
We will do everything we can,

317
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,345
starting with removing as many
of the tumors as possible.

318
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:24,305
And hopefully
chemo can get the rest.

319
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,408
Thanks. Perfect.

320
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:44,151
- Audrey!
- Oh!

321
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,328
- Hi.
- Hello.

322
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:49,766
So, we were just talking about
where to go for dinner.

323
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,245
Yeah, what was that place?

324
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:54,031
- The Chinese fusion on Elm?
- East-West.

325
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,555
Try the wonton tacos.

326
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,647
Excuse me. Um...

327
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:05,433
Hey, uh, I'm guessing
you're not okay with this.

328
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:07,087
You sleeping with my mom?

329
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,089
My dad did it for years.
We got along fine.

330
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,961
Since you're
not okay with it, uh,

331
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:13,441
is there anything that I can do

332
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:15,095
to make this
a little bit less awkward?

333
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,315
There's not going out with her.

334
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:18,403
Short of that?

335
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,623
You asked.

336
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:38,336
Are they?

337
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,033
Please don't make me think about
this any more than I already have.

338
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,732
Ah! Wow.

339
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,342
You've really
gotta hand it to Glassman.

340
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,473
I really don't.

341
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:46,736
Sleeping with
your competitor's mom

342
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,825
has got to be
the 49th Law of Power.

343
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,609
He's not my competitor.
He's my colleague.

344
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,745
Imagine if they got married.

345
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:04,362
That's why we are recommending
gastric sleeve surgery.

346
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:05,972
She's 14.

347
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:08,148
Lucy fits the guidelines.

348
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,410
She has a BMI of 40,

349
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,804
she's 136 pounds overweight,

350
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,807
and she's having severe
medical problems as a result.

351
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,679
Do other kids
get surgery like that?

352
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,681
There were
1,400 bariatric surgeries

353
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:20,595
performed on adolescents
in 2022,

354
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,119
and it's becoming
more common every year.

355
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:25,035
Dr. Murphy will remove a large
portion of your stomach.

356
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,732
That will help you to eat less.

357
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,516
And in ways
we don't fully understand yet,

358
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,605
it reduces the hunger signals
in your brain.

359
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,044
That is not wrong.

360
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,005
I want to do this.

361
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:44,141
Mom, I think about food
all the time.

362
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:46,796
I don't want to keep
fighting my body.

363
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,884
I'm just so tired.

364
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:50,974
Baby, I didn't...

365
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:53,454
I didn't realize you were
still hurting this much.

366
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,632
I didn't want you to know.

367
00:16:57,676 --> 00:17:00,287
I was trying to fight it
on my own, but...

368
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,723
I don't think I can anymore.

369
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,253
Uh, okay. Let's do it.

370
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:11,429
Let's do it.

371
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:17,217
Charlie will return with
the preoperative consent form.

372
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,045
Responsibility.

373
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,394
Awesome.

374
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:27,706
Gunderson's doing a robotic-assisted
thoracoscopic lobectomy.

375
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,534
Gunderson.
Isn't he a little green?

376
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:32,232
Yeah. He'll probably push the wrong button
and start a robot rebellion.

377
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:33,538
Can you assist?

378
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,235
I could shuffle
some stuff around.

379
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,281
Great. Problem solved.

380
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,500
I do need you to write
that memo to the board, though.

381
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:41,589
What memo?

382
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,766
"Latest Practices in Lean
Hospital Process Management."

383
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,419
Oh, that memo.

384
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,117
The one you were
supposed to write.

385
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,206
- Now that I'm bailing Gunderson out...
- You don't have the time.

386
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,078
Let me guess, it's due...

387
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,906
- Tomorrow.
- What a coincidence.

388
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,039
Now I can't take your mom
out to dinner.

389
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,485
OR awaits.

390
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,544
Before I have you sign this,
I need to tell you

391
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:06,527
about the risks
of gastric sleeve surgery.

392
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,312
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

393
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,966
One, acid reflux.

394
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,272
Two, vitamin or iron deficiency.

395
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:13,752
Three, hernias.

396
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,754
Four, internal bleeding
during surgery or afterwards.

397
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:17,408
- That doesn't sound good.
- It's not.

398
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,584
Five, surgical wound infection.

399
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:20,933
Six, fatal blood clots.

400
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:23,109
- Fatal?
- Yeah, like a pulmonary embolism.

401
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:24,719
Oxygen is blocked
from your lungs,

402
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,243
and you start to suffocate.

403
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,722
Seven, sepsis leading
to organ failure.

404
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:29,376
- Wait. Hold on.
- I've changed my mind.

405
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,552
So have I.
We're not doing this.

406
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:36,819
Guess you don't need
to hear about number eight.

407
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:42,557
You have put that girl's life
at risk by telling her that.

408
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,950
I did what I was supposed to.

409
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:45,821
I listed all the possible
complications.

410
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,258
- Did you say how unlikely each one was?
- No, but...

411
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:49,999
Or explain that many were
a complication of any surgery?

412
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:52,698
- I didn't think!
- Or that this was a relatively safe surgery?

413
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,091
- This is unfair.
- Stop interrupting me.

414
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,615
You're interrupting me.

415
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:58,791
I am the attending.

416
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,054
I have tried complimenting you,

417
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:02,621
but that didn't work.

418
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:04,492
I have also tried ignoring you,
but that also didn't work.

419
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:07,103
But I am required
to keep teaching you, though,

420
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,975
so you will have to
go back to learning

421
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:10,629
by observing only.

422
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,631
You will not bother me.

423
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:14,241
You will not say a word,

424
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:16,591
either in surgery
or in front of the patient.

425
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:26,601
You're quiet.

426
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,387
I can't stop
thinking about Ronit.

427
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:35,044
If her doctor had
only taken her seriously.

428
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,046
Imagine trying to plan a wedding

429
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,527
while she's in chemo and he's
recovering from a broken hip.

430
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:41,703
Who cares about their wedding planning?
She could die.

431
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,749
- They care.
- Well, they shouldn't.

432
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,490
Marriage is an outdated
institution

433
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:48,493
that was invented
as a property transaction,

434
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,233
not as an expression of love.

435
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,583
How people feel
about it now is...

436
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,063
That's all that matters.

437
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:56,065
Well, sometimes
our feelings trap us

438
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:58,807
in conventional ways
of thinking.

439
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:01,810
Like, Rashi says
that most of the Israelites

440
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:04,030
stayed enslaved in Egypt
because it's all they knew.

441
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:06,423
Are you seriously comparing
a loving marriage to slavery?

442
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,296
Both were invented as a means
of exchanging human chattel.

443
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,690
That is offensive
on so many levels.

444
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,953
And I doubt it's what Rashi,
whoever that is,

445
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,824
meant when he wrote
that parable.

446
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,391
It's a Midrash, not a parable.

447
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:18,871
Well, you sure know a lot
about Judaism

448
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,350
for someone who isn't Jewish.

449
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:21,874
Okay, I'm not a practicing Jew,

450
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,484
but I don't have to share
my life story with a patient.

451
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:26,269
Why didn't you just say
"I was raised Jewish, but I don't"

452
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:28,794
Hold on.
I'll get you a bandage.

453
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:33,886
Here.

454
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,761
I don't feel like
cooking anymore.

455
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:41,850
I'm going home.

456
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,209
What are you still doing here?

457
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,647
Aaron and I are going
out to dinner.

458
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,996
And salsa dancing.

459
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,301
You dance salsa?

460
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:00,913
Youdance salsa?

461
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,698
My Spanish teacher
got me into it.

462
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:05,004
You have a Spanish teacher?

463
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,614
She could actually be
a Spanish teacher.

464
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:08,573
Habla muy bueno.

465
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,531
- Ah, bien, actually.
- Bien, actually.

466
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:14,274
So, I was doing research
for this very urgent memo,

467
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:18,191
and I came upon this great
article on Lean Practices

468
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,280
in the Argentinian Journal
for Hospital Administration,

469
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:21,673
and it was in Spanish.

470
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,500
So I translated it for him.

471
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:25,241
So she translated it for me

472
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,636
and had some great ideas
for the memo itself

473
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,421
and saved me hours of work.

474
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,033
Oh, don't wait up tonight, hon.

475
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:39,734
With an open surgery,

476
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:41,388
Park and I can get
more of the tumors.

477
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:44,696
Laparoscopic surgery lowers
the risk of complications,

478
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:46,349
which would allow her
to start chemo sooner.

479
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:48,700
Ronit's pre-op labs.

480
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:52,704
- Hey, Jordan.
- Hey, Jerome.

481
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,270
How's Grandma E?

482
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,620
Doctor said she'll recover fine.

483
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:57,230
Whether they'll recover
from me second-guessing

484
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:58,971
everything they're doing
is another question.

485
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:01,321
I'm glad to hear it.
On both counts.

486
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,717
What was that?

487
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:08,807
We had a fight last night.

488
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,681
All right, this weekend,

489
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,510
I found a box
in Jerome's drawer.

490
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:18,643
I'm pretty sure
it was a ring box.

491
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,906
Tomorrow night's the second
anniversary of our first date.

492
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:23,038
I think he's going to propose.

493
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:26,563
Or I should say, was.
I don't know about now.

494
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,566
- But isn't that what you wanted?
- No, it is.

495
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,830
There's just something
about the ceremony of it all,

496
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:34,528
the ancient rituals,
it just feels... icky.

497
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,573
Ancient rituals?

498
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,533
We're talking about you getting married,
not sacrificing a goat.

499
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:43,058
I worry we'd only be doing it
because we're supposed to.

500
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:46,409
In Brooklyn, my path
was laid out for me.

501
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,153
Study the Talmud,
get married, have kids.

502
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:53,460
I didn't really have a choice.

503
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,114
What if this is the same thing?

504
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,769
Do you love Jerome?

505
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:00,293
- Absolutely.
- Then you do have a choice.

506
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,512
You can make a life
with the man you love

507
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,906
or find another path
without him.

508
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,600
Bariatric surgery is conducted
hundreds of thousands

509
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,308
of times a year
in United States hospitals.

510
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:18,039
But what Ms. Lukaitis
talked about,

511
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,867
the bleeding, the clots...

512
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,173
Serious complications
are very rare.

513
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,348
How rare?

514
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,437
Based on my surgical record,

515
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,526
site infection rate
is less than 1.5%,

516
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,486
and I would identify it early
and treat it well.

517
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,270
Excess bleeding is less than 1%,

518
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:34,316
and death is 1/20th of that.

519
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:37,253
What do you think, Mom?

520
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,712
I don't know.

521
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,669
I don't want her to be ashamed.

522
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,800
Last year...

523
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,011
she was suicidal because of
the teasing and the bullying.

524
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,972
And I was too,
when I was her age.

525
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,036
We got counseling

526
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,910
and were really in a place
where she loved herself,

527
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,296
and I don't want you
to lose that.

528
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,395
I was diagnosed with ASD
when I was five years old.

529
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,397
That's not relevant.
And I told you not...

530
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:15,009
Shaun, I think they want to hear
what Charlie has to say.

531
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:22,918
Thank you.

532
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:25,541
My brain...

533
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:28,196
it doesn't process
emotional signals

534
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,937
like other people's brains.

535
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,200
Same with Lucy's brain
with hunger.

536
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:35,487
My parents wanted
what was best for me,

537
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:37,775
but my mom, she didn't want me
to feel different.

538
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:40,618
So she was against me
having an in-school aid.

539
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:43,733
Thought it would stigmatize me,
but my dad convinced her.

540
00:24:43,777 --> 00:24:45,430
They found a great aid

541
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:49,173
that helped me learn
to navigate the world.

542
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:52,307
This surgery won't stigmatize
your daughter.

543
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,701
It will give her
what she needs to thrive.

544
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,535
Everyone needs help sometimes.

545
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:00,831
Let Dr. Murphy help you.

546
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:08,076
Mom, please.

547
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:12,564
Yeah.

548
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,096
Okay.

549
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:18,835
Good job.

550
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:24,643
After radical debulking,

551
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:26,769
I don't see
any obvious gross tumor.

552
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:31,175
Assessing
abdominal organs and spleen.

553
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:36,003
There are sub-centimeter
lesions on her liver.

554
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,613
Infiltrative hepatic metastasis.

555
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,400
Check her diaphragm.

556
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:49,886
It's everywhere.

557
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,671
She probably only
has a couple months, if that.

558
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:56,414
Let's close.

559
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,986
What exactly
is your motivation here?

560
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,683
Are you trying to piss me off?

561
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:06,468
Mark your territory?

562
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:07,512
What are you talking about?

563
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:09,906
You, dating my mom.

564
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,082
You think this is about you?

565
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:13,736
It's crossed my mind.

566
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,346
Are you out of your mind?

567
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,913
Oh, come on. What do you
have in common with her?

568
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,480
My mom's...

569
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:20,612
She's, uh...

570
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,179
Yes?

571
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:23,746
Dull.

572
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,444
- My mom's dull.
- No, she's not.

573
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,667
She's a great person,
a loving mother.

574
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:34,713
But she was a homemaker.

575
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:36,977
Not exactly the world's
most interesting woman.

576
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:40,545
Let me tell you something
about your mom.

577
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:43,505
She learned Spanish
so she could read Don Quixote

578
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,507
in the original. Who does that?

579
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,292
She's seen every movie
in the Criterion Collection.

580
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:49,685
That's five stars right there.

581
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,557
She buys The New York Times
in paper form

582
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,037
so she can do the crossword,

583
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:56,039
which she does through Saturday.

584
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,780
I don't even get past Wednesday.

585
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:02,698
- She does?
- Yes, she does.

586
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:04,569
Maybe you should get to know
your mom a little bit better.

587
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:06,006
I certainly will.

588
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,356
Thrilled for you two.

589
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,053
Plus, the sex is amazing.

590
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:20,716
I want to marry you.

591
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:27,070
It won't be
a Jewish wedding, but...

592
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,857
der mentsh trakht un got lakht.

593
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,427
"Man plans, God laughs."

594
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:44,566
But if a Beit Din,

595
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:47,264
a council of three rabbis,
approves your conversion,

596
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,138
then there are only
a couple steps left.

597
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,444
The big one being a ritual bath.

598
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,972
You can have
a Jewish wedding here.

599
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:03,193
I'll set it all up for you.

600
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:07,241
I was raised Hasidic.

601
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:14,552
You've done this with strength.

602
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:15,597
You will be blessed.

603
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,010
I'm sorry.
I just can't take this anymore.

604
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:38,881
- No. No.
- I have to rock him to sleep.

605
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,449
No, that is the worst thing
we could do.

606
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:43,451
It will teach Steve that
if he cries for ten minutes,

607
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:45,932
he will get rewarded
with a hug from Mom.

608
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,759
Steve isn't a test subject.

609
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:51,938
He's our baby, and we need
to be flexible with him.

610
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,288
He will be fine.

611
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,724
I'm not sure I will be fine.

612
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,118
This is so hard.

613
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:59,423
And you have surgery tomorrow.

614
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,164
Don't you need your sleep?

615
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:06,082
We should focus
on how much better it will be

616
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:08,171
for all three of us
in a few weeks.

617
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:10,869
Okay.

618
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:20,685
Thank you for doing this,
Rabbi Benjamin.

619
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:23,427
I've adored Scott and Ronit
since I met them last year.

620
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:25,418
I'd do anything for them.

621
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:28,857
Now, time for some Jewish math.

622
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:32,697
300 gallons is about 150 se'ah.

623
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,744
We need 40 se'ah
of natural water

624
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:39,225
and a wall between the natural
water and tap water.

625
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:41,967
And we aren't getting
rainwater in here,

626
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:44,840
but Rav Kook
and the Ben Ish Chai

627
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,103
wrote that we can use ice,

628
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:48,278
so we're going to need a lot.

629
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:51,063
We have a giant ice maker
on every floor.

630
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:55,720
Where do you go to shul, Asher?

631
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,897
Uh, I don't.

632
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:04,424
Or, you know,
not since I came out.

633
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:06,122
You can't be gay and Jewish?

634
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:10,430
Well, aside from the explicit
prohibitions in Vayikra 18 and 20,

635
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:11,780
there's the Noahide laws

636
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:14,347
and the sin of Sodom,
as explained in Sanhedrin.

637
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:15,958
You should brush up
on Sanhedrin.

638
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,699
According to the Midrash,

639
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,744
the sin of Sodom was cruelty
toward strangers, not homosexuality.

640
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:23,618
Is an Orthodox rabbi telling me

641
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,881
that the real sodomites
are the homophobes?

642
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,318
If the Midrash fits...

643
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,581
You are a Jew, Asher.
Whether you want to be or not.

644
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,670
Anti-Semites
don't give you a pass

645
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,846
because you have no mezuzah
on your door,

646
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,718
so might as well get
something positive out of it.

647
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:39,459
Respectfully, Rabbi,
I have everything I need in my life.

648
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:41,505
5,000 years of tradition,

649
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,594
and you can't find
anything of value?

650
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,596
The Torah isn't all or nothing.

651
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,294
Try lighting some candles
on a Friday night.

652
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:49,861
Take a little break
on a Saturday.

653
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,602
Put some spare change in
the Tzedakah box for the poor.

654
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:52,777
Read Rambam...

655
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:54,562
or Philip Roth.

656
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,002
I do love bagels.

657
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:01,394
They're super carby,

658
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:03,483
but I can always scoop out
the middle, right?

659
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,921
Heresy. And yet, a start.

660
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,229
Ahh.

661
00:31:10,273 --> 00:31:11,491
Now let's make a mikveh.

662
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,825
Placing the final staples.

663
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:11,176
Okay. Removing
the amputated stomach.

664
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,701
You okay?

665
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,920
I got less than the optimal
amount of sleep last night,

666
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,488
but I am fine to operate.

667
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:23,667
Partial stomach is removed.

668
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:28,411
Heart rate's 115.
BP is 146 over 93.

669
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:29,934
Splenic infarct?

670
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:32,241
No, it is baseline color
and well perfused.

671
00:33:32,284 --> 00:33:33,982
- It could be an intestinal...
- No, it couldn't.

672
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,984
Why not?

673
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,073
Charlie, we don't have time to answer
your questions right now, okay?

674
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,117
That makes sense.

675
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,646
Submerge the remaining
stomach in saline.

676
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,561
Shoot air in from the endoscope.

677
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:50,433
That will tell us
what the problem is.

678
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:55,394
It's a leak.

679
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:57,570
We need to reinforce our
staple line with sutures and...

680
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,530
Heart rate 128. BP 170.

681
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:03,314
4-0 Vicryls, fibrin glue.

682
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,056
Get the 4-0's
from the suture cart.

683
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,710
Why aren't they
on the back table?

684
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,451
I read in The Journal
for Bariatric Surgery

685
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,756
that they were
rarely used, so...

686
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,106
You should have
asked an attending.

687
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,238
I know she can be
quite unrelenting,

688
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,544
but you should not make changes

689
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:16,154
based on the instructions
of a medical student.

690
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:18,461
- Starting sutures.
- -It's not her fault or mine.

691
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:19,854
You have the stitches now, so...

692
00:34:19,897 --> 00:34:22,030
I am trying to concentrate.

693
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:23,596
- Suturing.
- -I need to explain myself!

694
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,337
Stop talking.
You're distracting me.

695
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,078
I wanted to impress you.
It's a top journal...

696
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:28,513
Get out of the OR!

697
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:33,562
Get out right now.

698
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,876
Goggles.

699
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,320
No more anastomotic leak.

700
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,570
Let's close.

701
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,289
Lucy, we'll keep you here
for a couple of days,

702
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,900
and then you'll be good
to go home.

703
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,815
When will I start
to lose weight?

704
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:09,470
You can expect to lose
five to fifteen pounds per week

705
00:35:09,514 --> 00:35:11,124
over the next few months.

706
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:25,051
You look nice.

707
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:26,705
Going out?

708
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,228
Maybe.

709
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:33,233
I could tell that you were
uncomfortable

710
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,366
when I saw you with Aaron.

711
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:39,370
And I think I knew you were
uncomfortable even before then.

712
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:42,982
But I just was having
so much fun, I...

713
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,071
It was unfair of me.

714
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:47,073
- And I think that maybe I should just...
- Mom.

715
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,294
It was unfair of me.

716
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:52,470
Go have fun.

717
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,515
Are you sure?

718
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:56,866
Yeah.

719
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:01,174
Thank you, honey.

720
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:10,401
Why didn't you ever tell me
about learning Spanish

721
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,709
or salsa dancing or anything?

722
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:17,277
You never asked.

723
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,281
I guess I never thought
there was much to hear.

724
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:29,855
You and Dad...

725
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:33,380
He always seemed so in charge,

726
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,686
and you just...

727
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,515
went along.

728
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:44,130
I'm sure it did seem that way,

729
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:45,610
because I knew
it was important to him.

730
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:47,786
He was old school.

731
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,005
But at its heart...

732
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:51,877
it was a partnership.

733
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:55,054
I didn't know.

734
00:36:57,013 --> 00:37:02,235
You have always been
so ambitious, driven.

735
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,499
Is that because you didn't
want to be someone who just...

736
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,024
went along?

737
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:11,505
Maybe.

738
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,076
Is that why
you and Clay broke up?

739
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,862
He hasn't called
since I've been here.

740
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,126
None of his clothes
are in the closet.

741
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:30,350
He wanted to get married.

742
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,267
And I wasn't sure.

743
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:37,749
So I did my usual.

744
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,970
I just avoided him
and I focused on work.

745
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:44,843
And he took the job in Chicago.

746
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm so sorry.

747
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:56,115
I love my job.

748
00:37:57,987 --> 00:37:59,858
I like who I am.

749
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:01,599
I don't need
to get married again.

750
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:07,431
But I don't
always like being alone.

751
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:15,961
I am always here for you.

752
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,938
Charlie Lukaitis
won't listen to me.

753
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:41,291
She is putting patients at risk.

754
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:44,381
She should finish her rotation
at another hospital.

755
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:46,339
I cannot work with her anymore.

756
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:52,302
Well, apparently she can't
work with you, either.

757
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,877
She filed a complaint
against you.

758
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:12,844
Thanks for the ride.

759
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,759
I really enjoyed
our conversation today.

760
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:15,934
Yeah.

761
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:18,415
Yeah. Me too.

762
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,938
Asher, when was the last time
you wrapped tefillin?

763
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:26,118
Maybe another time.

764
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:29,295
Sorry, I just have an important
dinner to get to with my boyfriend.

765
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,297
I think he's going
to pop the question.

766
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:33,995
And if he doesn't, I will.

767
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,085
Mazel tov.

768
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,129
Thank you.

769
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,611
- Until next time.
- Yeah.

770
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,326
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Get out of here, man!

771
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,637
You're desecrating
a house of worship.

772
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,378
What's going on?

773
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:09,640
I've asked them to leave.

774
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:16,603
Go.

775
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,910
Go, and there
won't be a problem.

776
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,085
What do you care?

777
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:21,434
He's a Jew too.

778
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,005
Yeah, I am a Jew.

779
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:28,398
A gay one, in fact.

780
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:29,747
And I'm calling the cops.

781
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:33,751
Go!

782
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:42,412
Are you okay?

783
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:44,153
Yeah. I'll call our security.

784
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:46,677
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

785
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:50,681
Now go get engaged.
