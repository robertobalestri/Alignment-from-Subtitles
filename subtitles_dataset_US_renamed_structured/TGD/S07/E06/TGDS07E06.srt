1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:01,863
Previously on The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,583
You've always taken after your father.

3
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,132
- Why is that a bad thing?
- It isn't.

4
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,164
He was driven, and he was brilliant.

5
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,106
I wish that he had been able
to ask for help.

6
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:14,234
And insert the tube into the vacutainer.

7
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:17,218
And you've just passed phlebotomy 101.

8
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,588
Oh, God.

9
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:22,677
Stop talking. You're distracting me.

10
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,375
I wanted to impress you.
It's a top journal...

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,487
Get out of OR!

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,727
Charlie Lukaitis
won't listen to me.

13
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:30,511
I cannot work with her anymore.

14
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,818
Apparently, she can't
work with you, either.

15
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:35,037
She filed a complaint against you.

16
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,257
- What's going on?
- I've asked them to leave.

17
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:38,519
He's a Jew, too.

18
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:41,653
A gay one, in fact.
And I'm calling the cops.

19
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,855
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Now go get engaged.

20
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:09,879
Are you okay?

21
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,273
Yes.

22
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:14,990
I am meeting with HR

23
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:17,220
to discuss Charlie's
complaint this afternoon.

24
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:21,586
Okay.

25
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:23,869
It's just been three days

26
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,503
and you've barely mentioned Asher.

27
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:30,900
I've read that grief reactions
are delayed in people with autism.

28
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:34,612
When a loss finally hits,
it can be really intense,

29
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:37,167
sometimes even overwhelming.

30
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,559
If that happens, find me anytime.

31
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:46,132
Okay.

32
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:11,864
Asher and I came from different worlds.

33
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,774
I am a devout Christian from Oakland,

34
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:20,761
and he was an Orthodox Jew
turned atheist from Brooklyn.

35
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:24,392
But when we met at St. Bons,

36
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:29,083
he became my closest friend.

37
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,068
Asher had a way of making you feel like

38
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:35,673
he saw the best version of you,

39
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:38,074
but he still loved you at your worst.

40
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,681
He was also one of the most
courageous people I knew.

41
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:47,451
Brave enough to leave behind
the people he loved

42
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,839
to be the person he knew he was inside.

43
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:55,700
He was stubborn and opinionated,

44
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:59,791
had a strange
affinity for grandpa sweaters,

45
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:02,924
made a crazy-good margarita,

46
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:07,388
and he was just so, so much fun.

47
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,478
I've made breakfast.

48
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:15,918
I'm not hungry.

49
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,723
You're barely eating.

50
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:21,465
I know. I'm exhausted.
I couldn't sleep last night.

51
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:22,857
I know.

52
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:25,014
I've heard you up every night since...

53
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:29,261
Isn't your friend's funeral today?

54
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,811
Yeah. I-I think I'm coming
down with something.

55
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,326
I'm gonna do a swab at work.

56
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:37,247
I don't think you're sick.

57
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,352
You should talk to a therapist.

58
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,638
I just need sleep.

59
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:46,215
I have to tell you something
about your father.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,547
And I should have told you this
years ago,

61
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:49,747
but I promised him that I...

62
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,886
Mom, I cannot do this right now.

63
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,410
You idolized him,

64
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,087
and he never wanted you
to see him vulnerable.

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,647
You won't listen to me,
but you will answer a text?

66
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,195
Well, it could be work.

67
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,550
- Honey, your father...
- Ma, I gotta go.

68
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:11,393
He was one of the most
considerate people I knew

69
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,366
and a damn good doctor.

70
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:16,476
He knew what the patient wanted,

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,999
so he fought for it.

72
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,610
He made it happen.

73
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,696
But that was Asher...

74
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,290
standing up for his beliefs.

75
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,702
Even if it cost him his family,

76
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,923
even if it got him in trouble,

77
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:34,213
Asher always did
what he thought was right.

78
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,349
And now he's gone...

79
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:56,235
...because of a couple of
ignorant, hateful monsters.

80
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,086
They knew one thing about Asher.

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,654
One thing. And they killed him for it.

82
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,961
Left him lying there
bleeding on the pavement.

83
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:09,205
And those animals, they get to live.

84
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:11,139
And now he's dead.

85
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,904
And I hate them.

86
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,901
I hate them for taking my friend.

87
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:27,045
Have to go. We all do.

88
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,922
Excuse me.

89
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,285
A guy drove his car through a
crowd at San Jose SpringFest.

90
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,094
- Accident?
- Doesn't look that way.

91
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,512
How badly are we outnumbered?

92
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:47,626
Still early intel,
but it looks pretty bad.

93
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:49,221
Activate Mass Casualty Event Protocol.

94
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,483
Alerts are out. ORs are up.

95
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:52,398
- Elective patients are canceled.
- Good.

96
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,511
We have eight surgeons away
at the Cleveland Conference.

97
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,620
I need a surgeon.

98
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:58,733
Severe head injury,
hypoxia, and seizures.

99
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,281
Skull fracture,
brain herniation with CSF leak.

100
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:06,525
I'll take him up.

101
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,283
Call Dixon. He's the backup Team Leader.

102
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:10,155
He's in Cleveland, too.

103
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,374
- Put Murphy in charge until I get back.
- You sure?

104
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:14,575
Today's gonna be messy,
especially after losing Asher.

105
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:17,062
You'll help him.

106
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,480
Shaun won't let emotions get in the way.

107

108
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,355
Dispatch said we're getting
over 25 patients,

109
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,183
many critical. First wave just arrived.

110
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:39,401
Lim's gonna be in the OR for a while.

111
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,142
SpringFest was
six blocks from our house.

112
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,230
You were gonna take Eden.

113
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,406
I know it's horrible,
but these things are pretty rare.

114
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,258
Are they? Look at Asher.

115
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:49,324
Are you okay?

116
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:50,761
You seemed pretty angry at the funeral.

117
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,892
Seems pretty reasonable.

118
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,614
Watch your backs.

119
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:56,549
Do you need me to slap you?

120
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:57,811
I hope not.

121
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,639
You gonna have a problem
working with Dr. Murphy?

122
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:00,664
I hope not.

123
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:03,034
Okay.

124
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:04,644
Doctors Park, Kalu, and Allen,

125
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,472
you'll be treating Red Tag patients.

126
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,474
Dr. Reznick, you're with the ER
physicians on Yellow Tag patients.

127
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:09,997
Dom, you're on Green Tags
in the waiting room.

128
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:11,075
Green Tags?

129
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,044
Red Tags are urgent surgical patients.

130
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:14,698
Yellow, urgent non-surgical.

131
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,873
And Green, minor injuries.

132
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,507
Minor injuries. I can do that.

133
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,606
What about me?

134
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:20,980
You're on Black Tags.

135
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,615
But they're already dead.

136
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,599
Yes, every Black Tag patient
needs a pronouncement checklist

137
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,231
completed before they can be
moved to the morgue.

138
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,591
Those bodies are taking up
valuable space.

139
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,409
It feels like you're punishing me

140
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,889
for filing an HR complaint against you.

141
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:36,241
I am not. Not working with you
is an unintended benefit.

142
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:38,591
That's not how you're gonna
get her to drop the complaint.

143
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,680
And you're gonna need
all the help you can get today.

144
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:43,030
Yes, and I need more surgeons. Like you.

145
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,684
I'm not available. Remember?

146
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,773
You have experience,
and I am very short-staffed.

147
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:48,470
You're short-staffed
everywhere you look.

148
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:49,907
Give me Yellow Tags.

149
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:51,149
Bay six.

150
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:53,867
I'm taking her for an Ex-lap.

151
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,434
Jordan needs you.

152
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,828
I've got a red tag. I need a surgeon.

153
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,265
Flora, blunt abdominal trauma,
40 weeks pregnant.

154
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,484
This is Ken, massive flail chest.

155
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:04,051
I need a surgeon now.

156
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,400
There are only two of us.

157
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,054
Move them to adjoining bays.

158
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,143
She is critically hypoxic.

159
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,449
My patient's bleeding out.

160
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,016
My guy's here because of him.

161
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,583
Ken jumped in front of the car,
saved a little girl.

162
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:17,640
- This the driver?
- Yeah. His leg's a mess.

163
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:20,894
Femoral artery's lacerated.
Tourniquet there.

164
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,983
Pressure's critically low.

165
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,245
She must be bleeding into her abdomen.

166
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,160
FAST ultrasound.
What do you see, Dr. Allen?

167
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,684
Massive cardiac contusions,

168
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,164
pulmonary artery trunk tear,
lung lacs...

169
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,339
Okay, those are terminal injuries.

170
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,080
This patient needs a cut down

171
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,734
to clamp his common femoral artery.

172
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,780
I can cross clamp Ken's aorta.

173
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:39,173
That won't fix his heart.
He is a Black Tag.

174
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,914
He risked his life to save a kid.

175
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,611
That is very heroic.
He will be dead soon.

176
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:43,917
You can still save the driver.

177
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,484
We should try to do everything we can.

178
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,253
You have. Move on.

179
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,055
She's in cardiopulmonary failure.

180
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:57,278
She's... dying. I can't save her,

181
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,410
but I can save the baby.

182
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,932
Prep trauma one for a C-section.

183
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,197
Dr. Allen, the leg. Now.

184
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,201
Crash cart!

185
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:17,453
Melissa.

186
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:19,523
They're unhurt, but their dad
was just brought in.

187
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,239
Can you check on the status?

188
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:25,461
I don't know where to start.

189
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:29,093
Start with the patients
on the left side of the room

190
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,509
and work your way over to the right.

191
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:36,510
Hi. I'm Dom. How can I help?

192
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,456
There's a uterine rupture here.

193
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,023
Fetal decels are critical.

194
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:51,942
Baby looks good.

195
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,726
Dr. Murphy, we can take it from here.

196
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,487
Get a Black Tag for the mom.

197
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,171
I need a thoracotomy tray.

198
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,285
I might be able to save the mother, too.

199
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,714
That's two more units of O neg.

200
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:19,720
His pressure's stabilizing.

201
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,588
That's the last bleeder. Bipolar.

202
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,851
There's just so much vascular damage.

203
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,485
I think I have good profusion.

204
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,316
Let's close the dura.

205
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,558
Cerebral pressure is spiking.

206
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:44,690
His brain's herniating.

207
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:45,778
I need to remove half his skull.

208
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,301
Blood pressure dropping.

209
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,699
She's minutes from anoxic brain injury.

210
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,832
There. In the pulmonary trunk...

211
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,051
Dr. Murphy, four more Red Tag
patients just came in.

212
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,260
There it is.

213
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:02,030
Amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream.

214
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,033
The clump of hair got stuck,
blocked her circulation.

215
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:06,906
Mom and baby will be fine. Yes?

216
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,975
While you've been in here,
four Red Tags arrived,

217
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,064
two nurses need central lines,
and Kalu's asking for you.

218
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:22,574
We have incoming
ambulances with multiple casualties.

219
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,727
The damage to your husband's
brain was too severe.

220
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,926
He didn't survive.

221
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,366
I'm so sorry.

222
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:39,976
Shaun needs you to take
another patient to the OR.

223
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,437
It's STAT.

224
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:50,127
I need to relocate your ankle
to restore blood flow.

225
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:51,980
Can you hold this over your wound?

226
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,658
Maybe you should call your supervisor.

227
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:55,424
Maybe.

228
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:58,385
- Ah!
- Got it.

229
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,911
A new patient just walked in.
She can't wait.

230
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,717
Pediatric alert, bay seven.

231
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:07,893
Can you tell me what happened?

232
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:10,483
Car came through my stand.

233
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:13,072
Everything went flying.

234
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,682
Something hit me in the eye.

235
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:17,424
Cast-iron skillet, I think.

236
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:18,797
Let me take a look.

237
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,456
Dr. Reznick!

238
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:29,305
I think I can save his leg
with microvascular anastomosis.

239
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,438
No, you need to amputate below the knee.

240
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:33,570
Limb salvage is tricky,
but I really think I...

241
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:34,833
That is a six-hour surgery

242
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,486
with a less than 5% chance of success.

243
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,556
We could save six patients in that time.

244
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,994
Okay. Clamping bone two.

245
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:49,126
Huh. The last time I was in this room,

246
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,283
Asher and I were doing a colectomy.

247
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,609
You need a minute?

248
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,489
I am faster at limb amputation than you.

249
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,181
See the Red Tag in the corridor.

250
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,648
We're out of treatment rooms.

251
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:09,630
Convert the storage
room into a trauma bay.

252
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,669
Can't. Charlie's still
processing the Black Tags.

253
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,686
I need to head home to Steve.

254
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,621
You want to come with?

255
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:27,711
I could make you a sandwich,

256
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,931
loan you a baby for an hour.

257
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:32,566
Steve's cuddles can be very soothing.

258
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,352
Thank you.

259
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,489
I'm just gonna sit here a little longer.

260
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:43,490
Yeah.

261
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,162
Call me anytime.

262
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:11,364
The nurse says you're my son's doctor?

263
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:13,148
- He's in a lot of pain.
- Who's your son?

264
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:14,695
Riley Larson. He's over there.

265
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,719
The driver. I know who he is.

266
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,242
Can you give him something stronger?

267
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:23,115
He had the standard dose
of morphine 30 minutes ago.

268
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,420
He's still hurting.

269
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:25,900
That's a shame.

270
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:27,411
There's a lot of people
hurting right now.

271
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:36,811
It takes some time
for the meds to kick in,

272
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,197
but he should feel some relief soon.

273
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,373
Move, move, move.

274
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:42,710
Tell the OR to prep for bypass.

275
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,650
It's okay, Amy. I'm here.

276
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,286
Look, I tried to get to her, but...

277
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:49,576
Please just save her.

278
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,993
We're on our honeymoon.

279
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,207
These bodies need to go to the morgue.

280
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,887
His pupils are fixed,
but I don't think they're dilated.

281
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,088
Apparently pupillary dilation
is very subjective.

282
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,445
I'll finish this.

283
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:11,163
"The Principles of Neurology"...

284
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:12,188
Mm.

285
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:21,869
You can't check the pupil box

286
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:23,523
because this patient is still alive!

287
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:26,010
Starting ACLS protocol.

288
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:34,332
Cardiac arrest from a tension pneumo.

289
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:36,899
- Ethan needs this.
- No, that doesn't matter.

290
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,497
- He was a Black Tag?
- Lazarus effect.

291
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,064
When the paramedics did CPR,

292
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,023
air compressed his heart
until it stopped.

293
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:45,049
- I saved his life.
- No, I did.

294
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,748
- Heart's too fast. Amnio.
- On it.

295
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:54,098
Inserting a central line.

296
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:55,472
I was right about the pupil.

297
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,107
You were listening to a book
while he was dying.

298
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,873
I gotta get his pressure up.

299
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,040
I was learning.

300
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:03,593
You can't learn if you don't listen.

301
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:06,829
Asher was excellent at
receiving constructive criticism.

302
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,483
That's not a fair comparison. Asher...

303
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:09,962
You know what?
It doesn't matter who saved him.

304
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,814
Let's just keep him safe. Okay?

305
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:14,270
Central line is in.

306
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:18,275
All right, the pressure's good.
It's good.

307
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,235
Charlie, can you get us
a cardiac monitor, please?

308
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,586
She's not gonna be at her best,
nor anyone else,

309
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,979
if you continue to argue
over every stupid little thing.

310
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,285
She is not helpful.

311
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:29,615
She's helpful to me.

312
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:33,028
Then you take her
for the rest of the day.

313
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,258
She's bleeding everywhere. Hanging FFP.

314
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:47,067
I'll do an ACP to
divert all blood to her brain.

315
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,986
Ophtho is expecting her.

316
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,900
Hey, I'm sorry. I just...

317
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:02,865
I don't think I can
make it through this day.

318
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,494
Then quit.

319
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:07,345
Tomorrow. Right now, I need you
to deal with that guy in the corner.

320
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:10,141
The EMT thought it was cardiac,
but it's just a panic attack.

321
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,981
Take him somewhere quiet
and calm him down.

322
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,395
He knew that you were gonna propose.

323
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,164
He was so happy.

324
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:43,190
Thank you.

325
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:48,833
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,080
They asked me to tell you
that they need the room.

327
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,495
My apartment is so empty.

328
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:59,163
His family took him to New York.

329
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,667
There isn't even a grave I can visit.

330
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,430
My mom used to take me
to the library on Olive.

331
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,156
Sometimes when I miss her,
I go back there

332
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,543
and take out her favorite book
and just get lost in it.

333
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,580
Stabilize the plate.
I'll place the lag screws in.

334
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,056
You were pretty
dismissive of your patient's mother.

335
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:58,704
Forgive me if I'm not all
broken up about that man's pain.

336
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,519
Riley didn't kill Asher.

337
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,353
And it's not your job to punish him.

338
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,726
I'm not.

339
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,707
But shouldn't people feel the
consequences of their actions?

340
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,187
Maybe,

341
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:13,344
but Riley's mother is feeling
the consequences, too.

342
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,107
Her son did this.
She should feel terrible.

343
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,219
Your anger is totally justified.

344
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,073
But is it helping you? Or anything?

345
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:30,119
If those monsters
hurt like we're hurting,

346
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,512
maybe something will change.

347
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,648
I did everything I could for your wife,

348
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:40,501
but her chest injury was just too...

349
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:45,395
No.

350
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:04,250
Excuse me. Doctor.

351
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:09,922
You need to look at this.

352
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,293
I've been waiting two hours.

353
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:16,624
S-Someone will get to you soon.

354
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,085
After my arm gets infected.

355
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:19,890
We're doing the best we can.

356
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,482
Then get more doctors.

357
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:24,553
Hey, look around you. People are dying.

358
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:26,450
Sit down and wait your damn turn.

359
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,173
You have a new patient.
20-year-old, shattered pelvis.

360
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:37,144
Charlie, I need that thing.

361
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,519
Sorry. I was reading Ethan's EKG.

362
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:41,789
Hook up the drain now.

363
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:45,233
Good. Start suction.

364
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:48,504
You're doing great.

365
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,138
Dr. Murphy doesn't think so.

366
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,246
He's still evaluating me.

367
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,118
That's why I filed the HR complaint.

368
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:55,946
We'll deal with that
when the time is right.

369
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,513
A bad evaluation will stop me

370
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,992
from getting into a surgical residency.

371
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,516
No matter what I do,

372
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,227
Dr. Murphy will
find something to criticize.

373
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:05,303
Why is he like that?

374
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,610
Dr. Murphy has been held
to a higher standard.

375
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,438
He's doing the same thing to you.

376
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:10,656
That's not fair.

377
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,050
Nevertheless,
he wants you to be perfect,

378
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:15,008
so you do the best you can.

379
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:18,272
I need you to treat a complex
liver laceration, Dr. Glassman.

380
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:20,362
I'm not operating. I told you that.

381
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,413
It can't wait.

382
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,192
Well, Dr. Lee should be finished by now.

383
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:26,759
I just gave him an open hip fracture.

384
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:29,458
Well, then transfer the patient to SFG.

385
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:30,937
They are on diversion.

386
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,330
For crying out loud, Shaun,

387
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,724
you know the last time
I was in an operating room,

388
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:35,986
and a liver lac?

389
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,336
Yes, it is a complicated,
multi-step surgery.

390
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,207
Exactly. I might kill the patient.

391
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:42,819
He's already dying.

392
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,864
You are my only option.

393
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,389
So it's me or the janitor?

394
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:49,565
The janitor is cleaning trauma two.

395
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,218
He is very bright but is...

396
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:52,902
Okay. Okay. Okay.

397
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:55,484
Just give me Nurse V.
At least she'll keep me honest.

398
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:59,226
Nurse Villanueva
is running the ER with me.

399
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,358
Nurse Paikin, then.

400
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:02,186
Assisting Dr. Lee.

401
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,232
Nurse Lashelle,
she is very experienced and available.

402
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,799
Okay, fine.

403
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:09,652
Keep an eye on Mr. Newton's
hemoglobin and Ethan's EKG.

404
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,075
My son's pain medication
still hasn't kicked in.

405
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,381
I'm on my way to surgery.

406
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,035
It's been two hours. Please!

407
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,496
Then he's likely maxed out
for the next couple hours.

408
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,817
I know what you think of me.

409
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:35,486
I can't even argue with you.

410
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:40,241
He left me a letter.

411
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:46,122
He didn't think he'd still be alive.

412
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:50,345
He wanted to die doing this.

413
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:56,338
For as long as I can remember,
I've been trying to help him.

414
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,397
We tried everything.

415
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,986
Pills, therapy,

416
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,249
inpatient, outpatient.

417
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:08,644
Seemed like he was making progress.

418
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:11,018
Maybe that's just what I hoped.

419
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:17,391
I'm angry, too, at him.

420
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,196
How could he have done this?

421
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,638
And I'm angry at myself for not
knowing what he was capable of.

422
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:25,206
I wish you would help him.

423
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,289
He's down a liter.

424
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:47,204
Give me two units.

425
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:54,962
Okay, here we go
into the triangle of death.

426
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:57,443
So many things can go wrong.

427
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,487
You want to talk it out?

428
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,753
Clamp the porta hepatis.

429
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,129
Ligate the left hepatic
to control the bleeding.

430
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:09,286
Remove the left lobe...

431
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:11,008
- Dr. Glassman?
- Yes.

432
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,825
I need you to look
at Ethan's rhythm strip.

433
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:13,970
Is it urgent?

434
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,276
He's in sinus rhythm,
but I noticed a run of PVCs.

435
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,931
Well, keep him monitored.
I'll check it when I'm done.

436
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:21,194
But a half hour ago, he had another run.

437
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:23,022
Didn't I tell
you to check every 45 minutes?

438
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,546
I'm being thorough.

439
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,635
PVCs are fairly common.

440
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,725
Can I do a 12 lead and electrolytes?

441
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,683
That's a good idea, Charlie.

442
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:33,293
Run it past Dr. Paxton in cardiology.

443
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:34,536
Mm.

444
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,408
Okay.

445
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:40,528
Clamp the porta hepatis.

446
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:44,720
Ligate the left hepatic
to control the bleeding.

447
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,831
I need threaded
pins here to stabilize the pelvis.

448
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,884
What is it?

449
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,910
He looks a lot like Asher.

450
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:03,347
Maybe a little.

451
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,451
Blood pressure's dropping.

452
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:09,260
There's bleeding
in the pelvis. Vascular clips.

453
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:21,515
Okay, your pressure's pretty high.

454
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,387
I still feel my heart racing.

455
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:24,823
That sounds normal.

456
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:27,347
Maybe that doctor lady
should do another EKG.

457
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:30,165
I learned about mindfulness-based
meditation last semester

458
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:32,309
in psych class.
I think that could help you.

459
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,814
I'm here for medical care, not yoga.

460
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:41,922
- Is that bad?
- It's just a little nosebleed.

461
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:45,583
Pinch hard.

462
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,522
I've never had a nosebleed like this.

463
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,382
I need a doctor in here. Hello?

464
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:52,349
Why is it not stopping?

465
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,009
Okay, 500cc bolus.

466
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,251
Get her to OR three with Dr. Lee.

467
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:02,469
I need to hand off to a doctor.

468
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:03,669
One minute.

469
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,866
Morgan can close this when she's free.

470
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,259
Two more Red Tags in the corridor.

471
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:10,913
- Have Jared take them.
- Dr. Kalu's still in the OR.

472
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,436
Then get Asher.

473
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,504
Asher?

474
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:20,686
Oh. He's dead.

475
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:24,491
One of the Red Tags
has a chest impalement.

476
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:25,754
He could go south soon.

477
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:28,017
Doc, my crew has an urgent pick-up.

478
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,716
Dr. Quao needs an anesthesiologist,
but they're all tied up.

479
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,326
I need you to look at Ethan's EKG.

480
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,806
There are some unusual patterns.

481
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,895
Dr. Glassman is supervising you.

482
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,505
He's busy. He sent me to Dr. Paxton.

483
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:39,681
He thinks this is normal,

484
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:41,315
but I think Ethan is gonna die again.

485
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:43,087
Okay.

486
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,946
Dr. Paxton was right and I am very busy.

487
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,843
If you compare them over the two hours,
you'll see the clusters.

488
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,661
- Sorry.
- Quao really needs an answer.

489
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,685
And that Red Tag needs a surgeon.

490
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,190
Okay.

491
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,912
- Look, two hours ago...
- Okay.

492
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:01,378
Dr. Murphy?

493
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:06,403
Dr. Murphy, Quao really needs an answer.

494
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:08,310
Doctor, we have an urgent pick-up.

495
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,321
- Find Dr. Park.
- We need a new Team Leader.

496
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:12,638
Wait.

497
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:16,424
Dr. Murphy, I see
you're covering your ears.

498
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,371
I think you're feeling very overwhelmed.

499
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,025
I would be, too,
with people coming up to me,

500
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:21,592
bombarding me with questions.

501
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:23,420
But maybe it would help
if you broke it down...

502
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:25,988
...step by step,

503
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,883
issue by issue.

504
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,622
We can't wait any longer.
Go find Dr. Park.

505
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,122
Get the plastics resident to
close for Dr. Park in OR one.

506
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:47,801
and send Dr. Park
to the corridor patient.

507
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:49,828
EMT can hand off to Dr. Steffy
in the procedure room.

508
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,115
And the anesthesiologist in trauma five

509
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,925
should be finishing soon.

510
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:54,103
Come with me now.

511
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,639
We are going to save
your patient's life.

512
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,416
He has a ventricular aneurysm.
His heart's going to rupture.

513
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,375
There's no empty OR and this can't wait.

514
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,246
- I will have to operate.
- Here?

515
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,553
- It's not sterile.
- I can treat an infection.

516
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:09,120
I can't do anything for him
if he's dead.

517
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,789
Okay. You have to help me.

518
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:25,463
It seems like it's slowing down.

519
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:30,999
This is a posterior epistaxis.

520
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:32,186
A what?

521
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,188
An artery ruptured
in the back of your nose.

522
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,451
You're bleeding out. I need help!

523
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,801
Look, I gotta go find you a doctor.

524
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,087
Uh, I don't feel so...

525
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:45,199
Help! I need help, somebody!

526
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,776
Somebody help!

527
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:04,821
Inflate the balloon...
Inflate the balloon...

528
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:23,585
I got the DeBakeys.

529
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:25,283
There are no Dacron sutures in the ER,

530
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,285
but I think the Teflon should
be a suitable replacement.

531
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,677
Yes, it is.

532
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,418
- I need a surgeon!
- Is that the aneurysm?

533
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:32,856
Yes, and we're too late.
It's already ruptured.

534
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,366
Give me your finger.
You need to plug this.

535
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,955
Don't move.

536
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,303
Clear.

537
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,521
Push another milligram of epi.

538
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:55,052
Charge to 50 joules.

539
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:57,054
Heart monitor's showing asystole.

540
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,471
It's an unshockable rhythm, Audrey.

541
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,274
Time of death, 4:50 p.m.

542
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:18,367
Somebody heard yell...

543
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,905
What the hell happened?

544
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:29,129
TachoComb sheet is in place.

545
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,328
Give me the...

546
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,395
Final closure.

547
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,635
I need to run mattress sutures
to secure it.

548
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:41,054
Any error, I will destroy
the blood supply

549
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:42,882
to his entire left ventricle.

550
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:45,102
- That sounds really bad.
- It would be catastrophic.

551
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:46,257
Can I help?

552
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:52,129
You must do exactly what I tell you

553
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,243
- exactly when I tell you.
- Okay.

554
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,822
Teflon sutures.

555
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,805
Cut here. Exactly here.

556
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:15,674
Very good.

557
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,761
Hold this forceps at a 30-degree angle.

558
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:21,965
You see that felt strip edge?

559
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,141
Press it down gently.

560
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:12,590
I couldn't watch the news anymore.

561
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:13,920
So I made cookies.

562
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:16,667
It's stupid.

563
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,298
What else can I do?

564
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,467
Nothing, Mom.

565
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:25,429
- You can't bring Asher back.
- I know.

566
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:28,809
I am so sorry.

567
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,092
Yeah.

568
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,746
Oh.

569
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,165
What were you gonna tell me
earlier today about Dad?

570
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,669
He was an amazing man.

571
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,574
Love of my life, really.

572
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:47,480
And he had clinical depression.

573
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:49,719
What?

574
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:51,721
He traveled for work,

575
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:56,794
but some of those trips,
they were hospital stays.

576
00:32:57,751 --> 00:33:00,232
And he never wanted you to know.

577
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:02,906
- Why?
- Because...

578
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,908
he loved being your hero.

579
00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:08,973
He loved being a success,
being immersed in his work.

580
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,268
But when those things
weren't propping him up...

581
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,771
he would get lost.

582
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:21,434
And I know that I am far from exciting.

583
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,897
No, you weren't all wrong about me.

584
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,663
More than anything,

585
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:30,804
I have found fulfillment
from the small connections

586
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:32,936
that I share with people...

587
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,008
like making cookies for my daughter.

588
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:43,543
He would have been so mad
that I told you,

589
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:47,255
but I realized that
I couldn't keep telling you

590
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,170
that I was worried about you

591
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,415
without telling the truth about why.

592
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:56,312
I loved your dad,

593
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,274
almost as much as I love you.

594
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:06,155
I am so proud of who you have become.

595
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:12,286
And I don't want you to end up like him.

596
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,034
Okay.

597
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:45,486
This will help him
sleep through the night.

598
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,255
I promise I'll keep
your son comfortable.

599
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:52,692
Thank you.

600
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,739
Thank you.

601
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:12,805
Simon. Kerry.

602
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:15,307
You ready to see your dad?

603
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,458
Go see your dad.

604
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,876
I saved Ethan's life twice today.

605
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,922
You just saved him once.

606
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,573
The first time I did.

607
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:37,054
I may have been wrong about you.

608
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:41,584
You might make
an adequate surgeon one day.

609
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,632
The corridor is clear,

610
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:58,225
and there are four empty bays
for walk-ins.

611
00:35:58,775 --> 00:35:59,906
Thank you, Shaun.

612
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,239
You did a great job.

613
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,941
It was a lot to ask, especially today.

614
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:09,487
I am a good leader.

615
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:20,080
Let's take a look at that arm.

616
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,695
I'm sorry about earlier.

617
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:24,919
You were right.

618
00:36:24,944 --> 00:36:26,811
Compared to what these people
are dealing with, this is...

619
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,964
You don't need to apologize.

620
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:32,401
It's just that my wife's
been home alone all day.

621
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:34,490
She has MS.

622
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:38,102
I have to lift her.

623
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,781
That sounds tough.

624
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:45,414
Not really.

625
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:47,858
She's an amazing woman.

626
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:50,027
An amazing architect.

627
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:52,756
What's her name?

628
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:07,194
I've sat there
every day since it happened.

629
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,202
I came to empty his locker.

630
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:16,445
I just can't.

631
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,346
Pre-gaming before Beyonce.

632
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,532
I'll help you.

633
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:54,758
Go home.

634
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:57,043
Rhino Rocket.

635
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:02,162
I could've stopped the bleeding
with a Rhino Rocket,

636
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:04,318
but I did everything wrong.

637
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:06,729
You were right.

638
00:38:07,408 --> 00:38:09,256
I can't handle this job.

639
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,475
I should quit.

640
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,318
Don't be an idiot.

641
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,298
You saved a man's life
with a urinary catheter.

642
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,336
That's some kickass MacGyver medicine.

643
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:28,493
You still got game, Dr. Glassman.

644
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,800
Ha. Even MJ knew when to call it quits.

645
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:33,933
This felt like an old-timers game.

646
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,282
Well, nice to go out on a win, though.

647
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,437
Ah, thank you.

648
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:41,244
How's Ethan's heart?

649
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:43,246
It exploded. But we fixed it.

650
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,945
Oh, and I'm withdrawing the
HR complaint against Dr. Murphy.

651
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:47,057
For now.

652
00:39:00,113 --> 00:39:02,657
I figured you guys
would need something to eat.

653
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:03,900
Oh, bless you.

654
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,401
I hear you're leaving town tomorrow.

655
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,557
Yes.

656
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,560
It's been a memorable trip.

657
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,156
Sorry about earlier. We, um...

658
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,375
Please sit. You've been
on your feet all day.

659
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:28,577
Come join us. I have extra sandwiches.

660
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,405
I, uh...

661
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,060
I found some things that I thought...

662
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,758
you might want.

663
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:39,738
Asher was waiting for the right moment

664
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,156
to slip that onto your desk.

665
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:53,839
A rep was handing these out

666
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:56,798
at a medical convention
that Asher and I went to.

667
00:39:56,822 --> 00:39:58,171
I was going to toss it, but...

668
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,348
Asher stuffed it into his backpack.

669
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:18,318
I... already knew about
this articulating dissector.

670
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:21,447
It is very promising.

671
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:31,528
Oh...

672
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,503
I will miss Asher.

673
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,716
He was a good friend.

674
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:41,911
He was.

675
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,303
I'll miss him, too.

676
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:46,413
We all will.

677
00:40:57,796 --> 00:41:00,527
I want to apologize for earlier...

678
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,318
going off-script in my eulogy.

679
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,023
I made it about my anger.

680
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,655
And if you knew Asher,

681
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,874
you'd know he would have plenty to say

682
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:16,312
about not being the center
of attention at his own funeral.

683
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:24,669
- This photo.
- Oh, yeah.
