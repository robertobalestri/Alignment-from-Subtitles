1
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:04,328
Okay. Juice and
coffee all ready.

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,807
Should I take the
banana bread out?

3
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:06,983
Yes, please.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,637
She left her hotel
22 minutes ago.

5
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,335
She should be here any minute.

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,858
Don't give me that look.

7
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,468
You're the one who insisted
on showering together.

8
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:16,557
I thought it would save time.

9
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,472
When are you going
to learn, Shaunie?

10
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:19,952
I'm irresistible.

11
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,499
That is very true.

12
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:23,936
She's here.

13
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:28,743
Hi!

14
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,596
Hello, Claire. It is
very good to see you.

15
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,759
Would you like coffee or
freshly squeezed orange juice?

16
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:45,847
Coffee, please.

17
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,414
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,112
He is the cutest.

19
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,070
- Look at the little cheeks.
- I know.

20
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,725
How are things at
Centro de Salud?

21
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:54,987
Great.

22
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,554
I've managed to make
a ton of improvements

23
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:59,296
- since you were there.
- Did you get a new CT machine?

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,211
Yeah, and an MRI.

25
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,169
Also, we opened a
prenatal clinic,

26
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,302
and I've instituted
a bunch of protocols

27
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:07,826
to decrease Hospital
Acquired Infections.

28
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,002
And on the personal front?

29
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:12,657
Uh... that is a
work in progress.

30
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,962
But good.

31
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,182
I told Lea about the
lump in your breast.

32
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,924
It was before I convinced you
to have your surgery here.

33
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,578
Not a HIPAA violation.

34
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:23,537
I hope you also told her
that the biopsy was negative.

35
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,844
It's not cancer, so there's
nothing to worry about.

36
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,194
He did. I reserve
the right to worry.

37
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,066
But let's save the
medicine for later

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,807
and focus on more important
stuff like Latin lovers.

39
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,809
Oh. Oh, is that banana bread?

40
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,897
That smells amazing.

41
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,247
Resistance is futile.

42
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,968
We have ways of making you talk.

43
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,687
That was a nice
start to the day.

44
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:44,191
A fantastic start.

45
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,171
What are you gonna wear?

46
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,042
I know it's just City Hall,

47
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,784
but it feels like we should at
least wear something special.

48
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,873
We can't get married
at City Hall.

49
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,614
- Alex, we've been over this.
- I know.

50
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,616
And you say you don't
care where we get married.

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,531
I don't. But you want to
wear something special,

52
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:03,273
because you want our wedding
to be special like I do.

53
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,231
I don't want to
delay our adoption.

54
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:06,972
You won't have to.

55
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:09,105
I'm gonna give you the
wedding you deserve.

56
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,716
Something beautiful and
impressive like you.

57
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,153
In four days? As
impressive as me?

58
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:16,373
Impossible.

59
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,789
Challenge accepted.

60
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,252
This is a Thomas Keller recipe.

61
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:28,036
I found it online.

62
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,106
Wow. Smells delicious.

63
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,240
And

64
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:36,219
your morning dose.

65
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,743
Also delicious.

66
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,093
When I was little, I used
to dream about being a chef

67
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:43,313
at a really nice restaurant,

68
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,426
and now I'm gonna
make it a reality.

69
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:49,710
I know I'll have to
start at the bottom,

70
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,930
but I can work my way up.

71
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,237
Hmm. I'm glad you're
feeling better,

72
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,064
but, you know, you
have to focus on today.

73
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,762
I know. I'm gonna get clean.

74
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,615
- You're gonna get professional treatment...
- No.

75
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,203
It's the only way. And
it's the only way forward.

76
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,337
No, it's not. I
don't want methadone.

77
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,426
I hate meetings and
sharing with strangers.

78
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,776
So we'll find you a
program that works for you,

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,821
but getting sober is the point.

80
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,520
It's the only point. You
can't make this a solo act.

81
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,348
I'm not alone. I have you.

82
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,045
I'm not an addiction specialist.

83
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,873
No, but you are a neurosurgeon.

84
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,091
- That's better.
- Hannah...

85
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,702
You are controlling my doses.

86
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,728
We'll taper off a
little each day.

87
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,297
It's not that simple.

88
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,319
Even if you stop using,

89
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:34,929
it's a Band-Aid.

90
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:37,976
Eventually, you're gonna relapse

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,545
unless you get treatment,
and I think you know that.

92
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,287
If I break the rules again,
you can kick my ass out.

93
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,897
I don't want to kick you out.

94
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,204
I-I... Nobody's kicking you out.

95
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,422
I want to help.

96
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,120
Well, then we can
do this together.

97
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,234
Please, just give me a chance.

98
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:00,172
33-year-old male,
struck by lightning.

99
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,392
Second degree burns and a
possible fractured spine.

100
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,742
- A spinal fracture from lightning?
- From falling off a roof.

101
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,048
He was working construction
when he got hit.

102
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,050
- Can't feel my legs.
- Push IV fluids.

103
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,226
Let's get trauma
labs and an EKG.

104
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,792
Can you tell me your name?

105
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,403
- Clint.
- Nice to meet you, Clint.

106
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,709
I'm Dr. Allen. I'm gonna
take good care of you.

107
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,953
Take the trauma shears,
cut his clothes off.

108
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,378
Oh.

109
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:34,337
- Hi.
- Hey.

110
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,340
Oh, it's so great to see you.

111
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,906
You, too. I wish it was
under better circumstances.

112
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,082
Oh, I'll be fine. It's
just a tiny benign lump.

113
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,041
Hi, Dr. Brown. I'm
Charlie Lukaitis.

114
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,651
It's very nice to
meet you, Charlie.

115
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,349
Shaun speaks really
highly of you.

116
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,176
- Really?
- I have been fair,

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,396
but not overly complimentary.

118
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,311
Shaun, I was being nice.

119
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,618
You could try harder
to do the same.

120
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,402
- Thank you, Dr. Brown.
- Oh, call me Claire.

121
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,143
Okay, I'm sure the new MRI

122
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,405
you acquired is excellent,

123
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,059
but we should do a
stereotactic biopsy

124
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,582
and breast MRI.

125
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:03,975
Instead of a mammogram?

126
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,803
New research shows
that breast MRI

127
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,587
are more accurate
for younger women

128
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,067
with denser breast tissue.

129
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:12,026
I was about to say that.

130
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,768
Sorry, I'm working on
controlling my impulsive speech.

131
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,380
It just seems you're eager
to demonstrate your knowledge

132
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,599
as med students
are supposed to do.

133
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,949
Thank you, Dr. Brown.
I mean, Claire.

134
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,193
Now you are being too nice.

135
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:29,305
Those are punctate burns at
the entry and exit points

136
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,568
connected by second
degree linear flash burn.

137
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,310
What are all these red lines?

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,442
- I'm not s...
- Lichtenberg figures.

139
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,097
The electric shock causes
extravasation of red blood cells

140
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,012
from the capillaries.

141
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,057
It'll heal with
minimal scarring.

142
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,798
Hi. I'm Dr. Lim.

143
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,365
I thought Dr. Park was on today.

144
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,652
He's taking a personal
day... wedding planning.

145
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,979
Can you wiggle your toes?

146
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,198
Alright, nice.

147
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,156
The loss of sensation
in your legs

148
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,419
is a temporary keraunoparalysis.

149
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,551
It'll disappear over
the next few hours.

150
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:02,076
Get spinal CTs and trauma
pan scan to confirm,

151
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,363
then we'll debride the burns.

152
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,910
Are you ready to
take Mama to work?

153
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,632
Yeah?

154
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,968
Hello?

155
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,646
Glassy, you home?

156
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,104
Oh, my God.

157
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,150
I am so sorry. That's my fault.

158
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,543
I was seasoning the skillet,

159
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,153
and I left for like a second
to take out the trash.

160
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,242
I'm Lea, Aaron's neighbor.

161
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,635
It's nice to meet
you. I'm Hannah.

162
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,940
I'm Aaron's niece.

163
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,377
I'm just visiting
for a couple weeks.

164
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,596
I'm so sorry if I
woke you guys up.

165
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,077
Oh, it's alright. I w... I
was just heading to work.

166
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,451
I should, um, open a window.

167
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,782
So, you'll have to lie facedown

168
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,069
- with your breast centered in the frame.
- Okay.

169
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,309
Is it harder or easier

170
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,703
this time being a second-year?

171
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,879
Um... bit of both.

172
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,839
Yeah. What about you, Chief?

173
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,057
How are you liking
the big chair?

174
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,885
I like it.

175
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,452
Fewer resources than here,

176
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,020
but also fewer restrictions
and more control.

177
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,674
Mm. Sounds like a good fit.

178
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,850
Hmm. Oh, speaking of.

179
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,156
Shaun showed me your
Lamborghini in the parking lot.

180
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,071
I know. I know. I'm an idiot.

181
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,769
No, I was gonna
say good for you.

182
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,292
I thought you hated sports cars.

183
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:30,817
Oh, I mean, I still do, but
I know that you loved them.

184
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:34,038
And you just didn't want
to seem ostentatious.

185
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,343
Mm.

186
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,694
No, I'm happy you've
stopped worrying so much

187
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:40,044
about what other people think.

188
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,437
Whatever you left
here searching for,

189
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,984
it's clear you found it.

190
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,161
Maybe we both did.

191
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,271
We're looking for
white-speculated

192
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,298
enhancing masses like... there.

193
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,669
1.72 centimeters.

194
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:57,931
A 3-centimeter
incision should...

195
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,759
Did you and Claire used to date?

196
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,675
W-We were just good friends.

197
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,894
With benefits.

198
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,157
I knew it.

199
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:08,836
Does Jordan know
that she's here?

200
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,554
Uh, I don't know.

201
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:14,252
Also, that hardly matters
since I'm not dating Jordan.

202
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,602
Oh? I thought you wanted to.

203
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,431
I did.

204
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,216
But we decided to
just be good friends.

205
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,740
Her and Perez, her ex-boyfriend,

206
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,219
text every day since Asher died.

207
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,960
It was wrong.

208
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,353
No, it's not wrong.
It's just a choice.

209
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:31,312
The biopsy from
Guatemala was negative,

210
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:34,620
but our biopsy from
earlier came back positive.

211
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,428
Claire has breast cancer.

212
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:45,022
- Sorry I didn't come by earlier.
- Hi!

213
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:47,067
Park is out, and I
had to help Glassman

214
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,678
get some stuff off his plate.

215
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,810
- It's still not an excuse.
- It's fine.

216
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,248
I'm here now to assure you
you are going to be fine.

217
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:55,946
Shaun briefed me on your biopsy,

218
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,382
and we went over
your MRI together.

219
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,973
You are in the perfect hands.

220
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:03,127
Ooh. Tell me about being
co-president with Glassman.

221
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,869
Mm. It's been interesting.

222
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,174
Collaborative.

223
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,046
By collaborative, you
mean you get stuff done,

224
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,961
and then he tells you how you
should have gotten it done?

225
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,528
Oh, you have one of
those in Guatemala?

226
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,356
Just one? I wish.

227
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,750
- Oh, I miss the old days.
- Mm.

228
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,839
You mean when you were
a Ducati-riding badass?

229
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:22,015
Hey, I do not need a
Ducati to be a badass.

230
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,234
- Mm.
- I just need...

231
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,323
- More sleep?
- I was thinking more sex,

232
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,107
but sleep is good.

233
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,457
Tell me about it.
Sometimes I wonder if I...

234
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,179
Hold that thought.

235
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,661
- To be continued.
- I'll be here.

236
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,992
Hey, we need to talk.

237
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,951
Hello, I need to get Claire
prepped for her surgery.

238
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,214
There's a girl living
in Glassman's apartment.

239
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,782
She says her name is Hannah
and claims she's his niece.

240
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,784
He does not have a
niece named Hannah.

241
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,612
I know, but she had a key
and her clothes were there.

242
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,832
He had a patient last
week named Hannah.

243
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,181
She was a homeless drug addict

244
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:58,835
who needed
cervicomedullary surgery.

245
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,979
Why would he let a homeless
drug addict live with him?

246
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,796
I...

247
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,885
don't know.

248
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,955
I have to go.

249
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,917
The MRI confirmed the mass
is under 2 centimeters.

250
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,853
That's only Stage 1A.

251
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,072
With your hormone profile,
you should be responsive

252
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,857
to hormone therapy
after the surgery.

253
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,534
You probably won't need chemo.

254
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,951
Do you disagree?

255
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,126
No.

256
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,214
Tell me if you do.

257
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,563
I'd rather get the bad news now.

258
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,609
I agree completely.

259
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,504
I was just thinking
about someone else.

260
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:41,423
But I will be focused in the OR.

261
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,145
Another 10 milligrams morphine.

262
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,276
Sorry.

263
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,408
I just need to remove

264
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:52,105
the necrotic skin and tissue

265
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,454
to avoid infection.

266
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,847
That's okay.

267
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,762
It hurts 'cause I'm alive.

268
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,634
Never taking that
for granted again.

269
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,200
Good for you.

270
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,344
I never should have even
started working construction.

271
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,403
Take a couple deep breaths.

272
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,798
Maybe just not outside
during a thunderstorm.

273
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,908
I used to have a band.

274
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,605
Even put out a couple EPs,

275
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,240
but we just couldn't break out.

276
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,177
I got a day job, turned 30.

277
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,222
Next thing I know,

278
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,573
I'm a foreman for
a roofing company.

279
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:29,186
Sometimes, big decisions are
just a bunch of small ones

280
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,907
you don't even realize you made.

281
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,930
I just feel like
I should recommit.

282
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,105
You know, I could
eke out a living

283
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,760
playing clubs and bars.

284
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:41,067
I'd rather look in
the mirror and know...

285
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,702
I'm the person I want to be.

286
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:48,988
A curvilinear incision

287
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,947
along the natural crease
line of the breast

288
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,514
gives the best cosmetic result.

289
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,691
Who were you thinking about?

290
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,084
You told Claire you were
thinking about someone else.

291
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,739
I shouldn't talk about it.

292
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:05,352
Raising the flap with a
wide margin around the mass.

293
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,963
Did I say something
inappropriate?

294
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:09,966
I wasn't thinking about you.

295
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,402
- Was it...
- Charlie.

296
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,066
He said he doesn't
want to talk about it.

297
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,323
Send this to pathology.

298
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:22,369
The tissue orientation is
marked with ink at 12:00.

299
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:25,938
Dr. Kalu, your suture
spacing is quite excellent.

300
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,157
You can close.

301
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,139
Suture with vicryls
and monocryl, please.

302
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,259
Is the Hannah who's
living with you

303
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,088
the same Hannah you
treated for Chiari Zero?

304
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes.

305
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,789
Seven ball, corner pocket.

306
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,226
Sh-She is a drug addict.

307
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,054
Who I am helping.

308
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,316
Helping her detox?

309
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,057
She's a patient
under my care, Shaun.

310
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,276
That's all you need to know.

311
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,669
If she's a patient,

312
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,411
that means you are
continuing to treat her

313
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,978
while she is living with you.

314
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,371
- How?
- Shaun...

315
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,068
Are you prescribing her opiates?

316
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,288
I'm helping her get sober.

317
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:14,117
I can't have her go out on
the street and buy drugs.

318
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,860
Prescribing her oxycodone in
this situation is unethical.

319
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,687
- I'm aware.
- And possibly illegal.

320
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,820
- I'm aware.
- You could lose your medical license.

321
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,324
You need to make her leave.

322
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,986
I'm not giving up on her. But
thank you for your concern.

323
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,924
How long has he been seizing?

324
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,404
Over four minutes.

325
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,449
- Then give four milligrams lorazepam.
- Already did.

326
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,606
Then give four more and
one gram levetiracetam.

327
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,025
He's got a mass in
his frontal lobe.

328
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,288
- Could it be from the lightning strike?
- No.

329
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:58,422
In fact, the lightning probably saved
his life, putting him in the hospital.

330
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:02,165
He has that seizure anywhere
else, he'd probably be dead.

331
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,080
A supramaximal resection
might get at all.

332
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,604
- If we're lucky.
- And if we're not?

333
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,413
It'll likely progress to a
glioblastoma and kill him.

334
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,177
We had our first
official date here.

335
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,482
She jumped on stage

336
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,136
and tried to join Cory
Henry's backup singers.

337
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,311
She loves music,

338
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,052
and this would be
the perfect place.

339
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,837
Yeah, I'd love to help you,

340
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,534
but I got bands
booked every night.

341
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,666
Couldn't you reschedule one?

342
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,668
I-I'll pay their fee, cover whatever the
difference ends up being in your gate.

343
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,279
I mean, name your price.

344
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,846
Sorry.

345
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,021
But I think you're
gonna have to choose

346
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,961
between immediate
and meaningful.

347
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,856
The glioma is in your
posterior frontal lobe

348
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,987
near the motor strip.

349
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,597
We have to be very aggressive.

350
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,425
If we leave any tumor behind,

351
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,166
it could grow back
as a glioblastoma,

352
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,952
which could be terminal.

353
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,214
Okay.

354
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,042
Because of the
placement of the tumor,

355
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,479
we may need to cut into
your eloquent cortex,

356
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:58,158
the area of your brain which
controls motor function.

357
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,481
Are you saying I won't
be able to play guitar?

358
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,511
It's possible.

359
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,996
Alive is alive.

360
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,085
I'll take it.

361
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,848
I am going to tell Dr. Lim

362
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,937
about Dr. Glassman and Hannah.

363
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,070
I don't think
that's a good idea.

364
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,507
He'd probably consider
it an even worse betrayal

365
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,074
than when you ended
his surgical career.

366
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:27,293
I was right about that,

367
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,426
and I am right about this, too.

368
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,908
He could lose his medical
license. I am saving him.

369
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,978
Shaun, I don't think it's just
about helping a former patient.

370
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,957
What else is it about?

371
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,872
You know why he helped
you back in Wyoming?

372
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,613
Because he knew I needed help.

373
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,832
Of course.

374
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:49,315
Also... his daughter
had just died.

375
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,143
He was grieving.

376
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,604
Maybe he did for you what
he couldn't do for her.

377
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,323
What does that have
to do with Hannah?

378
00:15:57,347 --> 00:16:00,239
Hannah's a drug addict,
just like Maddie was.

379
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,459
I think some of this is
Glassman dealing with his sense

380
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,485
that he failed his daughter.

381
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,594
After everything he's
done to support you,

382
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:10,317
don't you think you should
let him help Hannah?

383
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:18,997
Dr. Glassman... is only
putting himself at risk,

384
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,718
which I guess is okay.

385
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,767
I won't tell Dr. Lim.

386
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:27,508
Okay.

387
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,151
I'm thinking an awake craniotomy

388
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,370
with intraoperative
motor brain mapping.

389
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:47,808
Respiratory failure leads to
brain edema and herniation,

390
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:50,202
air embolism, intraop seizures,

391
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,857
just to name a few of the risks.

392
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,601
He was struck by lightning
and remembered who he was.

393
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,037
A guitarist.

394
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,952
I don't want to take
that away from him.

395
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,954
Big swing.

396
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:04,390
I think I'm gonna do it.

397
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,068
You seem amped up about this.

398
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,766
It suits you.

399
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,356
You need to keep him playing
guitar during the surgery.

400
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,315
If his playing gets worse
during motor mapping,

401
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,056
then you can't cut
into that area.

402
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,960
If he keeps playing well,
then it's safe to cut.

403
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:27,979
<i>Digale a Dr. Maldonado
que cubra esos turnos...</i>

404
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:31,374
<i>Esperemos la semana que viene.</i>

405
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,811
<i>Me ten go que ir.</i>

406
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,576
<i>Gracias, Imelda.</i>

407
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,557
Your pathology just came back.

408
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:41,886
We didn't get clean margins.

409
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,997
Now, you're already on the
board for this afternoon.

410
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,304
We'll perform a re-excision,
removing a wider margin

411
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,696
of the breast tissue,

412
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,307
followed by a sentinel
lymph node biopsy

413
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,984
to see if it's spread.

414
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,031
But

415
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,035
if it has

416
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,517
well, then, who better
to take this on?

417
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,018
You grew up in a trailer park.

418
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,281
You were raised by
a bipolar mother.

419
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,196
Went to a top med
school on scholarship.

420
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,503
Then you were recruited to be
chief of surgery in a country

421
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,983
where you didn't even
know the language.

422
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,160
Now, two years later, you, uh

423
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,751
you speak perfect Spanish and
you've overhauled the hospital.

424
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,148
You are an unstoppable
force, Claire Browne.

425
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,953
And on top of all of that,

426
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:31,651
you are kind, compassionate,

427
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,896
and [chuckles]
heart-stoppingly beautiful.

428
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:43,034
Cancer doesn't stand
a chance against you.

429
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,738
Forgot how great your
bedside manner is.

430
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,700
And my Spanish is
far from perfect.

431
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,990
Play guitar during surgery?

432
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,035
The risk of
complications is higher,

433
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,168
but an awake surgery
is the only way

434
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,737
to ensure full post-op function
of your fine motor skills.

435
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,739
We test each resection area

436
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,743
and get immediate feedback
before removing any tissue.

437
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,397
And won't it hurt?

438
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,249
You won't even feel it.

439
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,211
Any song requests?

440
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,235
Thank you for coming.

441
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,106
So, what does she want?

442
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,326
She doesn't want anything.
She doesn't know I'm here.

443
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,808
I want your help. I'd like to
stage an intervention for Hannah.

444
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:44,855
You think we haven't tried
that... multiple times?

445
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,900
Well, let's try again.

446
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,075
Your daughter needs your help.

447
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,499
What do you know
about my daughter?

448
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,559
She came to me with Chiari Zero.

449
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,605
That is a malformation
of the brain

450
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:59,478
which causes persistent and
sometimes very intense pain.

451
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,264
That's why she started
on the oxycodone.

452
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,787
Can that be treated?

453
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,615
My colleague already
performed surgery.

454
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,206
It was a complete success.

455
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,339
She had brain surgery?

456
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,820
Is she still in the hospital?

457
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,496
She's staying on my couch.

458
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,305
It was there or the streets.

459
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,351
So she's using in your home?

460
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,203
Yes, under my supervision.

461
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,248
I wrote her a prescription
for oxycodone,

462
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,294
which I'm administering
on a schedule.

463
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,078
You're her new drug dealer.

464
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:37,037
Her first night in my
apartment, she OD'd on fentanyl

465
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,648
fentanyl that she
bought on the street.

466
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:41,564
Street drugs right now
are Russian roulette.

467
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,348
What I'm doing is much safer.

468
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,308
I could call the cops on
you. Do you know that?

469
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,658
Tell me something...
is it just the drugs?

470
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,094
Are you also sleeping with her?

471
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,965
If I were doing that,
would I be calling you?

472
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:55,012
Can we please stop
with the nonsense now?

473
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,492
I'm trying to save her life.

474
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:57,884
The only way she
turns this around

475
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,669
is if she hits rock bottom.

476
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,782
- Rock bottom.
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,763
I kicked my daughter
out of my house.

478
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,591
And I told her,
"Do not come back

479
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:11,463
until you're clean and sober."

480
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,969
The next time I saw her
was on the coroner's table.

481
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,626
Well, I'm very sorry.

482
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,695
But Hannah is not your daughter.

483
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:29,568
And the only person that
can save Hannah is Hannah.

484
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:32,397
But she has to want the help.

485
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,225
And that's never gonna happen

486
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,859
as long as you
keep enabling her.

487
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,201
I heard your second
surgery was boring

488
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:55,464
just the way we like them.

489
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,204
I'm still a little sore.

490
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,684
That's why I brought this.

491
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,449
Oh, thank you.

492
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,907
Oh, yeah, that is much better.

493
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,778
Bless you.

494
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,065
Now, show me that baby.

495
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,526
Oh, she is gorgeous.

496
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,398
The spitting image
of Winston Churchill.

497
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,748
She, too, will one
day rule an empire.

498
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,794
Park looks so happy to
be her dad. Doesn't he?

499
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,187
And as soon as we get married,

500
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,971
we can finalize the adoption
and make it official.

501
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,843
Way to bury the lede! Congrats.

502
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,148
When's the big day?

503
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,715
Sometime this week, actually.

504
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:32,327
- Do you want to come?
- Absolutely.

505
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,590
Oh, I'm just glad
that Park is making

506
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:35,852
an honest woman out of you.

507
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,419
Me, too.

508
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,683
I can't believe how close I
came to letting him get away.

509
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,235
Hi.
- Hi.

510
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,737
I'm making Coq au vin.

511
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:54,697
I found a bottle of
Burgundy in the cabinet.

512
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,612
I hope you don't mind.

513
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,048
We're celebrating.

514
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,682
Celebrating?

515
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,597
What are we celebrating?

516
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:03,991
I got a job

517
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,666
at L'Amour, as a hostess,

518
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,147
but it's one of the best
restaurants in the city,

519
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,497
and I can work my way up.

520
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:15,500
Wow. That is amazing.

521
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:18,135
I am very, very proud of you.

522
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,113
Thank you.

523
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:22,028
I'm proud of me, too.

524
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,813
Mmm.

525
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:26,772
Oh. Time for your pill.

526
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,992
Um, after my shower.

527
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,846
This has to simmer for
30 minutes, anyway.

528
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:28,181
- Those aren't mine.
- Please don't lie to me.

529
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,835
I found them in your jeans.

530
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,489
Why were you going
through my stuff?

531
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,907
Well, obviously, I
can't trust you, can I?

532
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,476
I want to get clean.
I do. I just...

533
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,237
You're making me go too fast.

534
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,499
We're gonna get you treatment.

535
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,327
I'm gonna take you, and
we're gonna go, and...

536
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,372
No, I told you, I'm
not going to rehab.

537
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,852
It doesn't work!

538
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:49,420
- It's the only thing that does work!
- I'm outta here.

539
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,422
- I'm gonna flush it right down the toilet.
- Stop. What are you doing?

540
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:52,641
That's mine. Stop it.

541
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,643
- I paid for those. Stop it.
- Too bad.

542
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,079
There you go.

543
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,278
Okay?

544
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,391
This is your fault!

545
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,785
How could you think
giving me more pills

546
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,308
was gonna help me get clean?!

547
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,527
How is it my fault?

548
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,920
I'm giving you too many drugs

549
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,661
or I'm making you
kick too fast...

550
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,097
Which is it? It can't be both.

551
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,533
I hate you!

552
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,187
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do!

553
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,581
I hate you. I got to go.

554
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,192
You can't leave.
Like hell, I can't.

555
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,803
If you leave, you're g...
you're gonna end up dead.

556
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:26,002
Is that what you want?

557
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,483
This isn't working.

558
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,096
- I have to go.
- Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright, alright.

559
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,665
Your pathology report
hasn't come back yet.

560
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:03,779
Oh, that wasn't why
I, um... why I texted.

561
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,827
What's been on your mind?

562
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,354
You're not very good at
keeping secrets, Shaun.

563
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:18,228
I... can't tell you.

564
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,884
Do you want to? Yes, I
think you could help.

565
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,932
I've never betrayed your trust.

566
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,781
Dr. Glassman is
prescribing oxycodone

567
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,001
to a teenage drug addict
who is living with him.

568
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,046
He says he isn't concerned
about losing his medical license

569
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,005
or going to jail,
but he should be.

570
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,572
If I don't understand
his decisions,

571
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,946
how can I stop him
from making bad ones?

572
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,036
Oh.

573
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,366
When I was a kid, I...

574
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,587
I didn't even ask
why my mom used.

575
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,676
I was too busy
trying to survive.

576
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,700
But now, I think what
my mom needed most

577
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,600
was one thing in her life
without an "if" attached.

578
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,124
With addicts, everything
becomes conditional.

579
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:11,127
A home, a job, even love.

580
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:15,305
They only get them
if they get clean.

581
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:19,309
Dr. Glassman told Maddie
she could only come home

582
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,702
if she got sober.

583
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,008
Then she died.

584
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,033
The "if" killed her.

585
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,665
The drugs killed her.

586
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:31,519
And a car accident
killed my mom, but

587
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,849
sometimes I can't help but feel

588
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,702
if I'd told her I loved
her unconditionally

589
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,183
she would still be alive.

590
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:53,013
So, Dr. Glassman needs
to keep giving Hannah

591
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:56,955
unconditional love, even
if it risks his career?

592
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,609
I think so.

593
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,307
And if I want to
help Dr. Glassman,

594
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,420
I need to help Hannah.

595
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,098
How?

596
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:11,167
I-I'm sorry, Shaun.
I don't know.

597
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:17,933
But if someone told me
the day we met outside,

598
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,674
when you were soaking wet,

599
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,024
barely able to communicate,

600
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:24,026
that you would become
a top attending,

601
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,550
a wonderful husband and father,

602
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,271
I wouldn't have believed them.

603
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,361
But you have grown so much.

604
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:36,323
You're really, really good
at helping people, Shaun.

605
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,370
You're gonna figure
out how to help.

606
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,593
I've missed this.

607
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,292
Me, too.

608
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,168
Ojemann stimulator.

609
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,041
Beginning motor mapping.

610
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,590
No motor arrest.

611
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:09,051
Mark area one safe
for resection.

612
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,934
Area two not safe for resection.

613
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,177
Are you okay, Clint?

614
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,352
I think so.

615
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,204
Can you keep playing?

616
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,559
Continuing motor mapping.

617
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:42,104
Totally clean margins,
lymph node negative,

618
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,322
no more surgeries.

619
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,411
You are good to go.

620
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,525
Oh, that is fantastic.

621
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:50,701
Oh, thank you.

622
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:58,013
I'm so glad I got
to see you again.

623
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,426
Me, too.

624
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,801
Seems like you're
back where you belong.

625
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,916
I wasn't gonna come back.

626
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,092
I, um...

627
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:15,354
I-I told Shaun

628
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,487
that I'd just get the
lumpectomy in Guatemala,

629
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:21,080
and then he told me
that you would be here.

630
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,194
You know, since being back,

631
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:33,938
I, um, think about
you all the time.

632
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,984
Not like I didn't before, but...

633
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,648
I don't know why I
couldn't commit to you.

634
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:42,971
I think I was just
young, stubborn.

635
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,581
It's okay.

636
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,392
We got all of it.

637
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,351
You'll need to do
some radiotherapy,

638
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,702
but it shouldn't interfere
with your music career.

639
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:01,313
Well, I'm not sure
any crowd will compare

640
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:03,818
to playing with
my brain exposed.

641
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,603
Thank you so much.

642
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:21,072
You look upset, like
you have been crying.

643
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,576
Are you okay?

644
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,274
No.

645
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,191
Hannah bought pills
on the street.

646
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:33,892
I don't know what to do.

647
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,483
I can't help her. I tried.

648
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,969
I-I don't want to...

649
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:12,756
I don't want to fight anymore.

650
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:27,293
Do you want me to stay with you?

651
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,128
No.

652
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,245
I'm gonna go for a walk.

653
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,184
Thank you. Thank you.

654
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,699
Who are you?

655
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:09,422
I am Dr. Shaun Murphy.

656
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:14,011
Dr. Glassman's... son.

657
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,689
Not biologically.

658
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,497
Dr. Glassman helped me
like he's helping you.

659
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:25,414
So, basically, we're
both broken toys

660
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,417
that are supposed to replace
the daughter he couldn't fix?

661
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:32,271
Dr. Glassman didn't fix me.

662
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,622
He loved me.

663
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:43,195
I'm not like other people.

664
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,678
Other kids called me weird.

665
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,204
My parents didn't want me.

666
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,011
So, that was how I saw myself.

667
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,710
But Dr. Glassman saw
that I could be more.

668
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,495
And now I see myself
as so much more

669
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,087
because Dr. Glassman loved me

670
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,264
unconditionally.

671
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:13,679
I am still different.

672
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:17,988
I will... always have autism,

673
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,014
but now I'm proud of that.

674
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,559
You will always be an addict,

675
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,280
even if you stop using drugs.

676
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:30,851
But Dr. Glassman
sees you can be more.

677
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,029
Why can't you?

678
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,498
Mm. It's after midnight.

679
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:50,847
I know.

680
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,718
Joelle's on her way to babysit.

681
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,198
Why?

682
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:56,244
I borrowed your favorite dress,

683
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:58,898
gave it to the dressmaker,
so she'd have the right size.

684
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,465
I haven't looked.

685
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:03,512
I'm not supposed to
see it until later.

686
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:06,297
We're getting married now?

687
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,257
2:00 a.m. was the only time the
perfect venue was available.

688
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,128
Idle Time Jazz Bar, where we...

689
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,893
Had our first official date.

690
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,330
You're amazing.

691
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,042
I'm glad you're here.

692
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:37,613
I know I'll always be an addict.

693
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:42,575
But I'd like to be more.

694
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,319
I know I need rehab.

695
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,037
I'd really like it

696
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:53,281
if you could still
be here for me

697
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,284
after rehab.

698
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,376
Like you were for Dr. Murphy.

699
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:19,351
As long as I'm here,
I'll be here for you.

700
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:24,158
We have to find you
the right program.

701
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,203
I am a president of a hospital,

702
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,099
so I should be able
to pull some strings.

703
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,775
Mr. Big Shot.

704
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,192
You better believe it.

705
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,132
To always support your
boundless ambitions.

706
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:44,265
To never complain,

707
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,875
no matter how many
times you make me listen

708
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:48,007
to the same show tunes.

709
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:50,208
And most of all, I...

710
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,753
I vow to be the
man and the father

711
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:57,930
and the best friend
you and Eden need.

712
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,608
Always.

713
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,376
Well, I think I
was the last person

714
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,073
that knew we were
getting married tonight,

715
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,380
so I didn't write any vows.

716
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:17,211
But the truth is
that I will never be

717
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,890
as romantic or as
sweet as you are.

718
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,131
But I will never
stop loving you.

719
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,375
Or stop teasing you because
I know it turns you on.

720
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,250
Shaun and Lea, the rings.

721
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:39,822
With this ring.

722
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,217
I thee wed.

723
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:50,529

772
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,898
Thank you.

773
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,293
You're welcome.

774
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,819
You have grown... a lot.

775
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:34,997
As a doctor, as a
father, as a man.

776
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:39,088
Thank you. I have.

777
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,841
My cancer is back.

778
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,151
It's progressed
to a glioblastoma.

779
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,655
There are... new experimental...

780
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,507
No, no, no, no, no, no.

781
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,902
It's terminal.

782
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,169
I'm dying.

783
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:39,560
Amir will be here in a minute

784
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,953
to take you to your hotel.

785
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:44,956
Or we could go
back to your place.

786
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,871
I can't.

787
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,723
Not if it's gonna be
a one-night stand.

788
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,726
It's not gonna be
a one-night stand.

789
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,709
Oh.

790
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,798
You okay?

791
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,061
Oh, yeah. I just feel
a little bit sick.

792
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,193
Yeah, you feel warm.

793
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:05,697
You didn't drink
anything, did you?

794
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,024
No, because of the medication.

795
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:10,702
Claire?

796
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:12,878
Claire? Clai...

797
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:17,709
Hi. Are you Jared?

798
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:25,020
St. Bonaventure, as
fast as you can drive.
