1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:03,267
<i>The human heart
is a giant muscle</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,603
<i>squeezing or contracting
over 60 times each minute.</i>

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,369
<i>That's 3,600...</i>

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,571
At this point, your
blood is a deep purple

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,876
because it's just finished
dropping off oxygen

6
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,246
for all the parts of your body.

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,316
Come on, follow me.

8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,151
Come on.

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:28,755
Ian.

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,264
I have a question, and I
need to go to the bathroom.

11
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,890
Which would you
like to do first?

12
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,025
The question.

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,366
Okay. Where's the bathroom?

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,200
Who knows where the bathroom is?

15
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,297
I do.

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,842
Go with Ian to the bathroom.

17
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,138
I don't have to go.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,645
We're not at school, nobody
goes anywhere by themselves.

19
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,578
Why? In case you get lost.

20
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,344
Or in case somebody kidnaps us.

21
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,079
If somebody kidnaps
Ian, they'll kidnap me, too.

22
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,229
I want to stay with the class.

23
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,551
Michael, go with Ian...

24
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,781
Do you need help?

25
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,223
I need you to find a grown-up.

26
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,292
Is the baby coming?

27
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,453
Who should I take
with me? You're fine.

28
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,328
Go to the front desk
or find a security guard.

29
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,197
I really have to pee.

30
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,500
Oh, God.

31
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,099
Is the baby coming? I
don't know how to do this.

32
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,105
Are you okay, Ian?

33
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,371
Yeah. Sure.

34
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,079
I don't think you are.

35
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,511
You're bleeding.

36
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,684
Help!

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,418
Help!

38
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,941
$20. Call.

39
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,445
You'll call anything.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,648
My stack is bigger
than your stack.

41
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,086
You in or out?

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,374
You know that
relative to their size,

43
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:43,062
gorillas have smaller
testicles than humans.

44
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,158
Well, then you'd probably have an
edge over a gorilla, but not over me.

45
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,068
Reason is, primate testes' size

46
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,198
inversely corresponds to
the fidelity of our females.

47
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,475
You think there might be a better
time to annoy me about my wife?

48
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,035
I'm talking about poker. Right.

49
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,138
Women are evil, you're
right to drive them away.

50
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,410
Call, fold or raise.
Story time can wait.

51
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,918
We're smaller and
better than chimps,

52
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,622
bigger and worse than gorillas.

53
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,180
For all our rationality,

54
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,489
our supposed trust and
fealty to a higher power,

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,361
our ability to create a
system of rules and laws,

56
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,761
our baser drives are more
powerful than any of that.

57
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:24,032
We want to control our
emotions, but we can't.

58
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,233
If we're happy,
things don't annoy us.

59
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,110
If, on the other hand, we're
sitting on crappy hole cards,

60
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:34,171
little tiny things annoy
us a whole lot more.

61
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,978
I raise.

62
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,465
So, are you gonna tell me an
annoying story every time I raise?

63
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,617
God, that would be annoying.

64
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,520
I call.

65
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,295
Dr. Cuddy, I got one of
your patients in the ER.

66
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,092
Ian Alston, six-years-old.

67
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,832
Oh, I know him. What's
the problem? I'm all in.

68
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,960
Bloody diarrhea.
Hemodynamically stable,

69
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,130
but he's been developing
some coordination problems.

70
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,197
It sounds like gastroenteritis
and dehydration.

71
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,333
Order fluids and I'll
take it on my service.

72
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,536
Bet's to you, House.

73
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,545
They scan his head?
No, why would they scan...

74
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,478
Don't play games.
You gonna call?

75
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,607
How's the heart rate? Stable.

76
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:14,246
I'm sorry. House, it's gastroenteritis.
I'm not going anywhere.

77
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,414
Put the order in,

78
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,085
and have someone tell Alan and
Sarah that I'll be up when I'm done.

79
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,284
You in or out?

80
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,527
I'm out.

81
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,396
Stone cold bluff.

82
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,307
You might want to spend a little
more time paying attention to your cards

83
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,210
and a little less time
staring at my breasts.

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,009
They don't match either.

85
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,050
I'm gonna take some air.

86
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,961
Follow my finger with your eyes.

87
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,370
How much longer
will Dr. Cuddy be?

88
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,416
Well, given the number of Mojitos
she's knocking back at the party,

89
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,511
I'd say it's gonna be at least three
hours before she's even conscious.

90
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,351
Weren't you at the same party?

91
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,685
I don't drink.

92
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,924
I want you to reach
out and grab my cane.

93
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,627
What's wrong?

94
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,900
Your son's brain is losing
control of his muscles.

95
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,500
Dr. Cuddy's message said it
was just dehydration from diarrhea.

96
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,976
She's wrong.

97
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,580
Is he gonna be all right?

98
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,118
I don't know.

99
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,306
So, were you in
one of those cages?

100
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:28,149
No. No, no, no, no. No,
those are for tourists.

101
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,680
You were in the water
with the great white?

102
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,751
Sure, it's no big deal. You just
have to keep an eye on them.

103
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,821
If they get too close,
punch them in the nose.

104
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,132
Send them on their way.

105
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,830
I had you going.

106
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,132
You are mean.

107
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,105
Hey. How's that anal fissure?

108
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,107
Did it heal yet? Or
is it still draining?

109
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,474
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,308
I didn't realize you'd
come back for seconds.

111
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,380
I figured that after that girl in the
stairwell you'd be done for the night.

112
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,440
He's joking.

113
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,383
No Adam's apple, small hands.

114
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,284
It's no surprises this time.

115
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,053
I'll see you later.

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,955
Got a case.

117
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,360
Well, you could've
just said that.

118
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,706
You didn't have
to screw with me.

119
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,008
Yeah, if I didn't
screw with you,

120
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,110
you'd spent the whole night
thinking you might get laid,

121
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,660
which means you'd be useless.
Better to extinguish all hope.

122
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,036
Get Foreman and Cameron
and meet me upstairs. Stat.

123
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,476
What's so urgent?

124
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,641
Two cases, same symptoms.

125
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,250
What do six-year-olds and
70-year-olds have in common?

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,948
Their immune systems
don't work as well.

127
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,047
Could be listeria. I
already checked for that.

128
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,922
Leukemia has a higher
prevalence in both young and old.

129
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,326
- So does asthma.
- No, no, no.

130
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,954
They can both get diabetes.

131
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,157
No!

132
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,703
The nearly dead
and the newly bred

133
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,137
have more in common with each
other than with people in the middle.

134
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,438
It's weird. It's kind
of a circle of life thing.

135
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,172
This kid doesn't have
kidney failure. He will.

136
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,010
Based on this file, the
kid just ate some bad food.

137
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,141
Was the old man...

138
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:07,176
They were nowhere near each
other in any of the four dimensions.

139
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,353
This case is 12 years old. Yep.

140
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,414
And this case is Cuddy's.

141
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,720
She assigned it to me.

142
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,593
She agrees with you that this is
something more than gastroenteritis?

143
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,462
She wouldn't have assigned it
to me if she didn't, would she?

144
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,105
What were we talking about?

145
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,406
Two patients with two
symptoms in common.

146
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,970
And five symptoms not in common.

147
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,915
While you were all wearing
your "Frankie Says Relax" t-shirts,

148
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,043
I was treating a
73-year-old woman

149
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,213
who went through this
progression of symptoms.

150
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,279
The last of which was...

151
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,995
And in case any of you
missed that class in med school,

152
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,655
that one's untreatable.

153
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,289
Kid's got the first two.

154
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,132
It took Ester an hour and 20
minutes to go from two to three.

155
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,797
And less than a day to make
it all the way to the rear exit.

156
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,570
This is all because a child
has some blood in his diarrhea?

157
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,903
He's got a tummy ache.

158
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,122
If there was any reason to
think it was anything worse,

159
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,375
Cuddy would be all over it.

160
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,972
Great. Do a colonoscopy.

161
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,129
On a six-year-old kid who probably has
nothing worse than some food poisoning?

162
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,313
And if you happen to
find any purple papules,

163
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,855
do me a favor and grab a slice.

164
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,153
I wanna check for
Erdheim-Chester.

165
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,594
A disease that there have been,
what, maybe 200 reported cases of ever?

166
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:27,157
If Ester's family had let me
do an autopsy, there'd be 201.

167
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,541
See anything?

168
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,640
No, and I don't expect to.

169
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,019
House usually avoids cases.

170
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,353
If he's actually stealing a case
from Cuddy, there's gotta be a reason.

171
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,359
It's not the first time
I've seen this file.

172
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,695
About a month before
Cameron was hired,

173
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,993
some trucker came in
here with these symptoms.

174
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,692
House decided he was dying.

175
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,564
Two days and a spinal tap,

176
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,035
bone marrow extraction,
and three colonoscopies later,

177
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,300
we send the guy home
with a bunch of painkillers

178
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,171
and a diagnosis of a
bad cheese sandwich.

179
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,476
One of the guys who
worked here before me

180
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,209
said House tried to cure
Ester at least three other times.

181
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,650
You know how people see the
Virgin Mary in danishes and stuff?

182
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,614
Someone died 12 years ago
and House doesn't know why.

183
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,092
House sees that case
now in paint peeling,

184
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,487
in clouds, and
now in this poor kid.

185
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,223
Erdheim-Chester is an abnormal growth
of some of the cells that fight infection.

186
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,565
Is that cancer? 'Cause
he seems okay now.

187
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,901
The other doctor kind
of scared us about that.

188
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,806
He shouldn't have. We're just
testing. It'll probably be negative.

189
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,002
I don't understand.

190
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,155
You don't think that's what it is but
you want to do this thing to him anyway?

191
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,478
We need to be sure.
Isn't there any other way?

192
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,449
It shouldn't take long.

193
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,384
All right.

194
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,445
Those ridges look a
lot like purple papules.

195
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,856
They're not purple. They're
red. Probably just blood blisters.

196
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,986
Give me the biopsy needle.

197
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,468
How long is this gonna
take? Forget it, Chase.

198
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,411
Your punching out the shark story's
good, but she's not waiting for you.

199
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,205
So?

200
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,992
We couldn't confirm the
source of the bleeding,

201
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,110
but we did biopsy
some... Blood blisters.

202
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,813
You mean papules.

203
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,787
Come on, Cameron. Who's right?

204
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,454
Chase is. Negative
for Erdheim-Chester.

205
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,892
Let me see.

206
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,399
If it's not Erdheim-Chester...

207
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,202
It's exactly what we said before, a
garden-variety viral gastroenteritis.

208
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,469
Can we go back to the party?

209
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,477
Do a kidney biopsy.

210
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,280
Ester's shut down in exactly...

211
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,610
This kid is not Ester.

212
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,480
You screwed up.
She died. I'm sorry.

213
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,678
But that does not mean
this kid is dying as well.

214
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,814
Jeez, you're testy when you
don't get any fuzz. Come on.

215
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,664
What'd the test say?

216
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,264
Colonoscopy was clean.

217
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,810
And the biopsy was
negative for Erdheim-Chester.

218
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,369
So Ian's going to be all right?
It was just some sort of virus.

219
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,046
What's that?

220
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,743
Urine.

221
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,581
Yeah, but it's brown.

222
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,654
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.

223
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,248
Still think it's not
the same case?

224
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,242
<i>So, what can cause
bloody diarrhea,</i>

225
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,939
ataxia and kidney failure?

226
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,278
I'll go do a biopsy. Forget it!

227
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,748
That battle's over.

228
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,251
His rising creatinine is
his kidneys' way of saying,

229
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,083
"Go on without me."

230
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,883
What explains everything?

231
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,118
E. coli HO-157
causes bloody diarrhea

232
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,164
and leads to
Hemolytic-uremic Syndrome.

233
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,791
Toxins from the bacteria
cause his kidneys to shut down.

234
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,529
We should start him
on plasmapheresis.

235
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,902
Clear, concise, and
completely plausible.

236
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,234
And exactly what I did
last time. Didn't work.

237
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,570
What else?
Goodpasture's Syndrome.

238
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,113
Circulating antibodies cause
kidney failure and bleeding.

239
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,876
But not the purple papules.

240
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,680
If you throw in Ester's next symptom,
brain, makes me think heavy metal toxicity.

241
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,312
His hematocrit would
have to be low. It's at 44,

242
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,550
and Ester's never
dropped below... 42.

243
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,990
You have the file memorized?

244
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,618
It's my lucky number.

245
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:48,992
What about lymphoma?

246
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:53,557
Causes kidney failure, GI bleed,
and can infiltrate the base of the brain.

247
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,199
You check Ester for that?

248
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,602
She never showed any signs of...

249
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,971
If he has lymphoma
this far advanced,

250
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,169
we should be able to see
it in his blood and brain.

251
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,974
Chase, run a blood smear
and immunochemistries.

252
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,810
Foreman, get an MRI.

253
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,682
I'll page Cuddy. No, you won't.

254
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,344
She thinks the kid
has a stomachache.

255
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,531
Then she'll come right up
here and do one of two things.

256
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,932
If she agrees with
me, I don't need her.

257
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,390
If she disagrees,
I don't want her.

258
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,256
You can't handle people
disagreeing with you?

259
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,919
She might have a
different take on this.

260
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,294
Subordinates can disagree
with me all they want. It's healthy.

261
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,096
People who can shut me
down on the other hand...

262
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,693
Forget Cuddy. I'll have
Wilson keep her busy.

263
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,015
Keep your answers short and
discreet. Is Cuddy still playing?

264
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,852
The chicken is still
in Piccadilly Square.

265
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,854
Brilliant. She'll never suspect
that Normandy is our target.

266
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,412
Is that House?

267
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,993
Tell him that the blinds just went to
20-40 and he's running out of chips.

268
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,291
<i>How's she doing?</i>
What's going on?

269
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,228
The way you took off,
something's obviously...

270
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,199
Love to chat but got a game
to play. How's she doing?

271
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,003
The patient is on life support.
We're about to pull the plug.

272
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,094
Are you talking about me?

273
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,537
What've you got?

274
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,636
<i>Those sounds like
high-dose cardio meds.</i>

275
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,541
Two hearts.

276
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,611
You got the flush?

277
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,203
Still waiting on the final labs.

278
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,112
Is she drinking her seltzer?

279
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,179
No, hydration is not a problem.

280
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,619
She's bluffing.
Push your all in.

281
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,417
Call.

282
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,757
Two pair. Show me your hearts.

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,298
Seven of clubs.

284
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,235
Oh, dear. Sounds
like I messed up.

285
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,739
You're gonna be stuck
with her for a while.

286
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,173
Talk to you soon.

287
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,344
Oh, yes!

288
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,054
Why are you taking
a picture of his head?

289
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,858
We're looking for
lymphoma but...

290
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,662
So, it's not Erdheim-something
and it's not his kidneys,

291
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,463
but his kidneys are failing.

292
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,798
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

293
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,270
Dr. House mentioned
another case.

294
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,807
Is there another patient with
the same thing that Ian has?

295
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,275
Not exactly. What
does that mean?

296
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,471
Dr. House had a
patient a while back

297
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,707
who exhibited the same
symptoms as your son.

298
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,876
Then you know what's wrong? No.

299
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,510
So what do you know?

300
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,385
We know the likely
course the disease will take.

301
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,479
Which is?

302
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,301
She had multiple
system failures affecting...

303
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,123
What happened to her?

304
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:41,057
She died 24 hours
after her admission.

305
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,274
Mr. or Mrs. Alston, would
you mind giving me a hand?

306
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,610
He's having
trouble sitting still.

307
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,980
It's impossible to get
the detail we need.

308
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,044
So I figured he might feel more
comfortable hearing your voices.

309
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,192
Ian, honey.

310
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:14,133
Just sit still. They'll be done in
a moment. We're here with you.

311
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,566
I'm scared.

312
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,001
It's okay, honey. It's...

313
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,803
It's only a big camera. It's
gonna take a picture of your head.

314
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,636
You love it when I take your
picture at home, don't you?

315
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,805
Yeah.

316
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,875
And you have to hold
still for that, too, right?

317
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,310
But this isn't like that.

318
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,084
I know it's scary,
Ian, but you can do it.

319
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,727
You're getting to
be so grown-up.

320
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,899
So just hold perfectly
still, just for a little bit.

321
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,106
Mommy, are you crying?

322
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,737
No. No, honey, I'm just tired.

323
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,406
Okay. I'll try.

324
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,911
The base of his brain's been
infiltrated by a small mass. We think...

325
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,643
Pituitary? Looks that way.

326
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,049
Explains the low blood pressure.

327
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,415
And pretty much
confirms the lymphoma.

328
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,423
If we'd started Ester
on prednisone...

329
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,863
Did anyone see the lymphoma?

330
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,697
No, we saw a mass. The
location is consistent with...

331
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,737
Didn't see any in
the blood either.

332
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,898
White blood cells show no
spindling or abnormal nuclei.

333
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,432
Nothing on immunochemistries
either. It's not lymphoma.

334
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,274
House!

335
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,347
It's a train.

336
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,647
We don't know what kind of
train... Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

337
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,743
I'm thirsty. It's closed.

338
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,347
It's not now.

339
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,130
We got one advantage. We
know where the tracks are going.

340
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,002
The fact that the end of the
line is death is an advantage?

341
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,371
The fact that we
know is an advantage.

342
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,706
It means maybe we
can get ahead of it.

343
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,776
Next station is the liver.

344
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,474
We got about 90 minutes
before it gets there.

345
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,814
Maybe we can cut down a tree
across the line just outside of town.

346
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,908
I'll do an ultrasound.

347
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,045
No, treatment will
tell us more, faster.

348
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,866
How can we start treatment if we
have no idea what we're treating for?

349
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,825
Treat him for everything.

350
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,021
Give him acetylcysteine,
and interferon, and silymarin,

351
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,294
and whatever else you can
think of to protect the liver.

352
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,105
What's going on?

353
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,617
Oh, just catching up on
some TV. How're you doing?

354
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,882
Well, thanks to your last consult,
the patient has improved dramatically.

355
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,617
Tell House the patient
is about to kill the doctor.

356
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,318
She says the patient... <i>I heard.</i>

357
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,190
What've you got? Well,
Cuddy just raised and...

358
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,388
You're paired. What?

359
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,623
Nines.

360
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,226
How do you know?

361
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,963
Anything lower, you
wouldn't sound so excited.

362
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,470
Jacks or higher,

363
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,975
your voice sounds like Debbie
from accounting is sitting in your lap.

364
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,169
Ask Cuddy if she can
beat a pair of threes.

365
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,255
Wait. What's going on? If
you're gonna mess with me,

366
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,656
wouldn't it be more
fun to do it in person?

367
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,342
Yes, it would.

368
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,282
Can you beat a pair of threes?

369
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,412
<i>What'd she do?</i>

370
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,615
I left orders for
PO fluids, Doctor.

371
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,124
Enough with the codes.
She obviously knows it's me.

372
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,286
She's drinking her seltzer.

373
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:36,957
Did she stop?

374
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,729
Yes. Go all in.

375
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,563
But... Just do it.

376
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,061
You couldn't care less
about this charity event.

377
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,934
<i>You claim not to
be messing with me.</i>

378
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,998
Obviously, you're either
trying to keep me... Shut up.

379
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,476
Look, last time I wanted
the game to go on. I still do.

380
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,741
It means that this
time you get to win.

381
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,043
Hold on.

382
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,850
I fold.

383
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,831
<i>House, are you sure you're okay?</i>

384
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,662
Meds seem to be working.
Liver's holding its own.

385
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,426
Good.

386
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,870
But the platelets are
dropping. Even better.

387
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,532
Why? It means
he's getting sicker.

388
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,873
It's new. New is good.

389
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,072
Because old ended in death.

390
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,684
I can't breathe.

391
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,113
Chase!

392
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,218
What's happening?

393
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,220
Ian, come on.

394
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,666
Honey, just relax.

395
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,896
Ian, breathe. Come
on, honey. Please.

396
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,038
Please, honey.

397
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,722
<i>We had to put
him on a ventilator.</i>

398
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,819
He's back on Ester's path

399
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,258
and we managed to make
the train skip a few stations.

400
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:30,326
Which means that instead of 12
hours, he's probably got less than two.

401
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,201
Which begs the question,
why? What did we do?

402
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:35,036
Acetylcysteine could
mess with the lungs.

403
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,702
Mess with them, not shut
them down in 20 minutes.

404
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,041
Interferon modulates
the immune system.

405
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,877
It could affect a cancer of the
blood, like one of the leukemias.

406
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,883
It doesn't speed them
up. It slows them down.

407
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,680
It slows down all 500 of them?

408
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:50,382
Anybody know where we can
find an oncologist at this hour?

409
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,293
What effects would
interferon have on leukemia?

410
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,227
Depends on what type. Could
make it better. Could make it worse.

411
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,235
A four-year
fellowship to learn that.

412
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,523
Tell House if he
wants to play cards,

413
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,740
<i>he can get his ass
back down here and play.</i>

414
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,866
You hear that. She
wants me off the phone.

415
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,604
Means she's
vulnerable. Go all in.

416
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,478
But the party's over in
less than three hours.

417
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,074
<i>It's over in less
than two hours,</i>

418
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,278
which means you either have

419
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,378
three of a kind or just threes.

420
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,920
I'm guessing threes.

421
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,260
I bet $500.

422
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,922
Go all in.

423
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,488
You obviously want to bust me.

424
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,589
<i>Why would you...</i>

425
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,725
Either you go all in,

426
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:39,329
or I tell everybody in the building
that you wear toenail polish.

427
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,838
I'm all in.

428
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,238
I'll call.

429
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,407
I'm betting you
have a pair of threes,

430
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,211
but even if you have three,

431
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,946
it's not gonna beat trip nines.

432
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,020
Oh! Oh! Oh, no!

433
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:03,084
Oh, no! Oh! Oh,
that's gotta hurt.

434
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,961
What happened? I just killed
two birds with one straight.

435
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,090
Goodbye.

436
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,161
Fine, keep playing.

437
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,066
<i>But I need you to
recommend a good oncologist</i>

438
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,981
because if I don't get one up
here in the next few minutes,

439
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,837
I got a dead six-year-old.

440
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,841
If you need help, ask.
These games are insane.

441
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,505
The games have a
higher success rate.

442
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,847
Well, I don't see anything
that looks like leukemia.

443
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,387
You do a bone marrow
biopsy? No time.

444
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,616
Even if there is an
occult blood cancer,

445
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,749
you wouldn't expect
interferon to make it worse.

446
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,453
Certainly not this fast.

447
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,085
What would move this fast?

448
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,322
Autoimmune diseases.

449
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,940
If his body's own
defenses are attacking him,

450
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,164
then beefing them up is
just gonna put fuel on the fire.

451
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,328
Sarcoidosis could be
in his brain and lungs.

452
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,065
No. No enlarged hilar lymph
nodes on his chest x-ray.

453
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,165
The systemic nature suggests
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.

454
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,470
Or Kawasaki's Disease.

455
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,840
Can't be Kawasaki's.

456
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,038
That doesn't affect the elderly.

457
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,010
This is a kid's x-ray?

458
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,108
House had another patient.

459
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,751
Who may or may not
have had Kawasaki's.

460
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,187
This kid on the other hand,

461
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,715
<i>he makes antibodies that are
eating the inside of his arteries,</i>

462
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,786
<i>choking off blood to his
major organs, one by one.</i>

463
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,766
<i>First the GI tract, then the kidneys,
then the brain, now the lungs.</i>

464
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:20,468
Can anyone think of a reason why
Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly,

465
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,866
other than that it doesn't?

466
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,905
Nice. FOREMAN: We
can confirm with blood work.

467
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,676
We need an ANA, sed rate...

468
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,444
Labs will take two hours.

469
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,509
What was the old
lady's sed rate?

470
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,110
Elevated, 98.

471
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,851
You can't use another patient's
labs to diagnosis Kawasaki's disease.

472
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,358
Is that like a dare
or something?

473
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,018
You don't have time to be wrong.

474
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,121
Fine. We'll look for
Kawasaki where he lives,

475
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,166
Ian's coronary arteries.

476
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,968
This other patient,

477
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,902
the old lady, Ester?

478
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,244
Have you read <i>Moby Dick?</i>

479
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,546
It was a book?

480
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,285
It was ten years ago. Twelve.

481
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,217
Obsession is dangerous.

482
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,055
Only if you're on a wooden ship,
and your obsession is a whale.

483
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,389
I think I'm in the clear.

484
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,894
You do realize it's a metaphor.

485
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:20,126
You do realize that the point of metaphors
is to scare people from doing things

486
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,532
by telling them that something
much scarier is gonna happen

487
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,832
than what will really happen.

488
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,368
God, I wish I had a
metaphor to explain that better.

489
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,309
Go back to the game. Don't worry,
I'm not gonna get eaten by witches.

490
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,851
Coronary arteries
clear. No aneurysms.

491
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,620
Flip the mode.
Let's see the flow.

492
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,354
How did that other woman die?

493
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,821
She went into
respiratory distress.

494
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,162
Her heart and liver
were already... No.

495
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,160
Did she suffer?

496
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,199
Was she in pain?

497
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,605
I don't know.

498
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,741
Laminar flow. No blood
clots, no ragged edges.

499
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,184
Damn. Shut it down.
We're just wasting time.

500
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,983
Look at the right atrium.

501
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,153
That's not Kawasaki's. No.

502
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,887
It's small, but it's there.

503
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,331
Ester didn't have
a mass in her heart.

504
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,892
Ian's younger. He can
take more of a pounding.

505
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,029
Ester died before the
disease reached her heart.

506
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,131
The disease made a
mass and made it fast.

507
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,869
Could be bacteria. Muscle.

508
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:37,942
Connective tissue.

509
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,808
The kid can't take
any more theories.

510
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,813
Only thing we know is
that whatever that mass is,

511
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,439
that's what he's got.

512
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,781
We need a piece of
it. I'm doing a biopsy.

513
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,799
I'll shut the blinds.

514
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,302
No, let them watch.

515
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,861
I do my best work
on the big stage.

516
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,341
Passing through the
superior vena cava.

517
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,470
You're in the atrium. Pull back.

518
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,915
You've hit the
wall of the heart.

519
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,750
These procedures
would be so much simpler

520
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,414
if you could do them
on healthy people.

521
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,779
And out again.

522
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,261
V-fib. Cardiac arrest.

523
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,796
Call a code.

524
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,258
Come on, paddles!

525
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,699
Come on. Charge.

526
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,929
Clear!

527
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,304
<i>Code blue, ISO room.</i>

528
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,467
<i>Code blue, ISO room.</i>

529
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,475
And again.

530
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,674
Nothing. Again.

531
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,394
You got a clock on this?

532
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,096
How much longer you
gonna keep doing this?

533
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,330
Clear.

534
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,976
Wait. I've got something.

535
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,645
He's back.

536
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,924
What are you doing? I'm
doing what we came here to do.

537
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,392
It almost killed him. I
know. I was right here.

538
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,587
I need a Vacutainer.

539
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,688
His brain's been oxygen
deprived for over eight minutes.

540
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,325
There might be nothing left.
He might... Tell the parents.

541
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,802
Where the hell is
that Vacutainer?

542
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,881
So, what's he got? Brain damage.

543
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,352
Good chance. I was
talking about before that.

544
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,498
You're not worried about...

545
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,956
Things I can't do
anything about?

546
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,719
I try not to. Yeah.

547
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,227
Things just roll off you
like water off a duck.

548
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,387
Histiocytosis.

549
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,624
Very unlikely in a 73-year-old.

550
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,292
Whatever this is,
it's very unlikely.

551
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,332
Come on. More
ideas. Let's go, people.

552
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,871
Genetic disorders could
cause masses everywhere.

553
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,962
Tuberous sclerosis.

554
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,837
If it's genetic, he's
had it all his life.

555
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,399
Why now? I don't know.

556
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,876
It sure fits nice enough.

557
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,810
We haven't ruled
out leukemia yet.

558
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,713
Or sarcoma. He could have
multiple soft tissue tumors.

559
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,011
Or sarcoidosis.

560
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,551
Multiple neurofibromatosis.

561
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,314
Chondrocytomas.

562
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,915
How's it going? You win?

563
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,256
I got called away by the
angry parents of a patient.

564
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,761
There are three of you here.

565
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,374
None of you had the sense to stop
him, to pick up a phone and call me.

566
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,775
I told them you'd signed off.

567
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,200
The parents are mad
because their kid is dying.

568
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,463
It's understandable.

569
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,528
But if he doesn't die, they
won't be mad anymore.

570
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,150
Well, if he's brain damaged,
they might still be a little ticked.

571
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,233
Had to do it to save him.

572
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,778
You had to do it
to diagnose Ester.

573
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,938
You may have
killed a six-year-old

574
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,347
because you're obsessed with a
woman who's been dead for 12 years.

575
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,613
Sometimes you lose,
House! You're not God!

576
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,686
He's not dead yet.

577
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,864
No, but you're done with him.

578
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,323
It's my case now. Go home.
Go ride your motorcycle.

579
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,827
Go brood in a dark room.
Just don't go near Ian again.

580
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,330
So, anything else or
is it just these seven?

581
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,929
Drop it, House. She's right.

582
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,406
No, she's not!

583
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,637
You know she's not. We
should have called her.

584
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,202
I'm surprised you didn't.

585
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,119
You're gonna have to
find a way to let this go.

586
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,581
We can't go near Ian.

587
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,515
We don't need to go near him.

588
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,513
We have his tumor.

589
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,553
Well, Cuddy may be right
that we screwed up the protocol.

590
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,354
She may be right about
my screwed up obsession.

591
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,826
But I'm right
about the medicine.

592
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,430
How many tests
can we do with that?

593
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,057
Look, we cure the kid, we
solve everybody's problems.

594
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,396
How many?

595
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,703
Maybe two good pieces.

596
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,502
How many okay pieces?

597
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,367
Three would be pushing it.

598
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:09,343
Three tests, seven choices.

599
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,512
Okay, what's first?

600
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,246
Sarcoidosis seems most likely.

601
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,722
Yeah. So likely that Cuddy's
gonna think of that all on her own.

602
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,249
She's got the kid's whole body
to play with. Let her do that test.

603
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,659
What's next?

604
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,458
It's moving too
fast to be spreading.

605
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,642
It has to be growing from
something that's already there.

606
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,601
Genetic disorder.
Tuberous sclerosis.

607
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,661
Or it's his immune
system. Histiocytosis.

608
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,602
Well, there are more documented
cases of Histio amongst older people

609
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,372
than tuberous sclerosis.
Let's start with that.

610
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,841
Wing or drumstick?

611
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,812
Gonna need a
little more than that.

612
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,289
A little more is
more than a third.

613
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:56,419
If we have to repeat this test
because you didn't cut us enough...

614
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,759
I'm adding one micro liter
of the immunoperoxidase.

615
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,169
Make it two. I don't want
House biting off our heads

616
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,333
because we weren't
sure if it turned red or not.

617
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,975
That's definitely not red.

618
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,686
The problem could still
be an abnormal cell growth

619
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,658
but a different
cell line. Sarcoma?

620
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,285
Muscle cells are
throughout his body.

621
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,601
It would explain the geography.

622
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:34,064
Genetic disorder is far more likely
in a six-year-old. Tuberous sclerosis.

623
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,862
Pretty unlikely to
cause a GI bleed.

624
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,232
The time course fits.

625
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,931
Mr. Foreman, you agree with
both of them? Thanks for playing.

626
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,497
If we have enough tissue
for two tests, why not do both?

627
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,099
Then we don't have
to think as hard.

628
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,175
Taking the pressure off the choice
makes us less likely to think critically.

629
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,147
Sarcoma is more likely
to hit a six and 70-year-old.

630
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,774
Tuberous sclerosis, it is.

631
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,341
You think sarcoma
is less likely?

632
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,545
It's more likely.

633
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,885
The test for it, on the
other hand, is less reliable.

634
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,400
Test is negative.
Well, that's okay.

635
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,101
If the tumor cells haven't matured, the
Ki-67 protein wouldn't have turned off.

636
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,338
What happens if we
don't solve this? Kid dies.

637
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,609
I mean for the next 12 years.

638
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,948
Ki-67's negative.

639
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,989
And PCH antigen is negative.

640
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,861
Mighty Casey's
down to his last strike.

641
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,907
Mighty Casey struck out.

642
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,607
Thanks a lot. I was gonna
read that this weekend.

643
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,735
Chondrocytoma.

644
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,251
Connective tissue's been in all
the places we've been looking.

645
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,943
The kid is too sick for that. We're
better off testing for sarcoma.

646
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,695
We would've seen signs of that
when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.

647
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,052
The tumor cells looked like
muscle under the microscope.

648
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,784
No, they didn't.
They looked like fat.

649
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,090
I vote for neurofibromatosis.

650
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,063
Why? Because the
other choices suck worse.

651
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,167
Give me a minute.

652
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,639
You want me out of here?

653
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,867
You come up with anything?

654
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,205
No.

655
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,804
Hey. We can talk
about it tomorrow.

656
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,848
I won the poker tournament.

657
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,790
I totally played this guy,
Berman, from business affairs.

658
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,957
I got great cards. But I
don't bet. Just call, no raises.

659
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,363
Berman pairs his
king on the flop.

660
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,767
I keep calling, the river turns,

661
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,602
I check. He can't stand it.

662
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,973
He goes all in.
He's sure he's won.

663
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,205
I call, I flip them.

664
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,116
Pocket aces.

665
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,046
I nailed his ass.

666
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,326
The aces were hiding all along.

667
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,300
Test him for
Erdheim-Chester disease.

668
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,707
Erdheim-Chester?
That's not even on the list.

669
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,541
Because we already
did it. He tested negative.

670
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,775
So did Ester. The disease lied.

671
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:47,080
Yeah, the tumor's got it in
for you. Diseases don't lie.

672
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,313
Fine, it didn't lie.
It slow played us.

673
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,846
We biopsied the colon, it
hadn't reached the GI tract yet.

674
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,059
It's there now. It's
in his liver, his lungs.

675
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,891
You want it to be there.

676
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,227
Because then you didn't
screw up 12 years ago.

677
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:04,167
We can't waste our one test on
the one disease we know it's not.

678
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,562
Run the test.

679
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,810
You sure about this?

680
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,749
Wait. Let me think about
that. Don't pressure me.

681
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,723
Just run the damn test.

682
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,721
Cells look like macrophages.

683
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,560
That's a good start.

684
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,903
Take your time, and say it loud.

685
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,480
CD 68 positive.

686
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,627
Start the treatment.

687
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,486
So, Ester can rest
peaceful now, huh?

688
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,321
Yeah.

689
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,097
$40.

690
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,900
You got lucky.

691
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,445
You gonna call?

692
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,104
What I do

693
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,713
is not just based
on the flip of a card.

694
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:36,511
You guessed. You got lucky.

695
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:37,611
It fit.

696
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,783
It could just as easily have been
sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.

697
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,293
No, not just as easily.

698
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,887
Maybe not. But it
wasn't impossible.

699
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,197
Are you gonna call?

700
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,206
You know, relative to its size,

701
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,904
the barnacle has the
largest penis of any animal.
