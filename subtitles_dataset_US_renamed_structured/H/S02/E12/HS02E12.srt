1
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,976
All right, hold on. I
got the turn up here.

2
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,744
Oh! How cool was that?

3
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,653
That was way cool!

4
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,760
My turn. Sorry,
that's not allowed.

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,696
I just signed 15
pages of forms saying

6
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,860
you gotta ride on the back of that
thing. I don't see any lawyers around.

7
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,927
You know that's
not the point. No.

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,940
You just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

9
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,465
Come on, Dad!

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,046
You go over 15, we're
pulling over, all right? I mean it.

11
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,412
You're the best. All
right, get on there.

12
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,576
Put on your goggles. Okay.

13
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,544
Ready? Got the clutch in?

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,646
All right, that's my boy.

15
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,237
Adam, you're going
too fast, slow it down!

16
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,368
I mean it, you're going
too fast. Slow down!

17
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,708
Adam!

18
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,111
Adam!

19
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,655
Let go of the throttle!

20
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,021
Adam!

21
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,193
Adam! No!

22
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,691
What've you got?
Sixteen-year-old, status post,

23
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,634
ATV crash, 40%
burns on his body.

24
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,137
Nasotracheal intubation.

25
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,983
Start a bag of lactated
Ringer's, wide open...

26
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,203
Will he be okay? We'll
be with you when we can.

27
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,675
Get him out!

28
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,672
Wait, wait, wait!

29
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,007
I'll start fluids. Let's
go get him hooked up.

30
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,376
Watch the line.

31
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,938
Been looking for you.
Been avoiding you.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,301
Burn Unit can handle it.

33
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,937
If they could handle it, they
wouldn't be asking for you.

34
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,045
Is that a journal?
Friend wrote an article.

35
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,277
In Hindi?

36
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,583
They have a cutting-edge
neuroscience program in India.

37
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,885
It says so right on the cover.

38
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,855
Kid's heart rate's messed.

39
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,296
Tachycardia can be
explained by the burn.

40
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,800
I assume the Burn
Unit knew that.

41
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,832
His potassium's low.

42
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,840
Which can also be
explained by the burn.

43
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,433
Except I'm sure the Burn
Unit's pumping him with fluids

44
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,104
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

45
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,738
Could be amphetamines.

46
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,680
Or bacteria
lunching on his heart.

47
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,083
Or cardiomyopathy, or
some other very bad thing.

48
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,780
He needs an EKG.

49
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,890
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

50
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,399
Is he even gonna
survive the burn?

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,695
What, you got a
date or something?

52
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,365
Forty percent of his body.

53
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,907
If the Burns Unit can
prevent an infection,

54
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,034
his body will
regenerate maybe 10%,

55
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,875
surgeons will do 20 or so
grafts, six months in this room,

56
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:09,508
he'll end up with a series of
nasty scars, maybe some pain,

57
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,983
but he'll live.

58
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,985
Unless his heart shuts down

59
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:17,650
'cause we can't figure out what's
causing the low potassium and tachycardia.

60
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,860
We need help from a
Belgian doc named Einthoven.

61
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,260
He's dead.

62
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,199
While he was alive, he invented a
little dittie called the Galvanometer.

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,326
Where do we get one?

64
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,963
Go to any electronics store
that's been open since before 1905.

65
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,100
There's a good chance they've
got one in a corner in the basement.

66
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,845
We need an audio-visual
setup for the lecture hall.

67
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,848
What for? For the lecture.

68
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,407
What lecture?
Dr. Weber's lecture.

69
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,985
Who is Dr. Weber?
A neurologist, I think.

70
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,523
The memo was from you.

71
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,128
Where is my assistant? She left.

72
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,360
When? Wednesday.

73
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,732
Seriously? Well, the temp
agency sent someone,

74
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,066
but she got lost.

75
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,629
Well, when she
gets here, fire her.

76
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,888
Oh, yeah.

77
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,693
Did you issue this
memo? Look at that.

78
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,931
Congratulations.

79
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,346
The patient that has been in a
coma for two years and counting

80
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,702
is still in a coma.

81
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,502
This is not my signature.

82
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,167
I don't know anything
about this guy.

83
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,110
I'm supposed to introduce
him? Have lunch?

84
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,781
The coma patient has a
migraine? Oh, no, no, no.

85
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,183
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

86
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,720
That's a migraine.

87
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,086
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

88
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,819
I did subsequently give him
nitroglycerin, which could possibly...

89
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:03,023
You induced a migraine
headache in a coma patient?

90
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,760
I gave him a little headache, similar
to the one you're giving me now.

91
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,393
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

92
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,439
Well, it would be wrong to try out a
new migraine prevention medication

93
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,736
on someone who
can actually feel pain.

94
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,903
Did you sign this? Yeah.

95
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,714
We can talk later about
the appropriate discipline.

96
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,330
Because of the burn,

97
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,823
we can't perform any of our
normal tests to see what's wrong.

98
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,485
So we're going to
try a Galvanometer.

99
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,323
It picks up a pulse in
the wrists and the ankles.

100
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,861
Hopefully it'll tell us why
his heart rhythm is abnormal.

101
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,199
What have I done to
him? I... It was an accident.

102
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,497
All right? So...

103
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,771
He's got all these burns

104
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,037
and now there's something
wrong with his heart?

105
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,875
We're trying to figure out if the
two are somehow connected.

106
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,939
Had he been sick
lately? No, nothing.

107
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,644
Anything unusual
with his behavior?

108
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,413
Had he been
tired a lot? Nothing.

109
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:03,617
He was great, he was happy, he
was just having a great time, and then...

110
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,320
If he was experimenting with
amphetamines or cocaine...

111
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,453
No.

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,826
We gave him some pot
about a year ago, to try...

113
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,423
It was just once.

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,060
We thought if we took the
mystery out of drugs and alcohol,

115
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,468
the less he'd experiment.

116
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,870
We'll know more after the tests.

117
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,711
It looks like they're
gonna electrocute him.

118
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,312
Plug it in.

119
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,340
You plug it in.

120
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,886
Fine. Give me the cord.

121
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,022
Works.

122
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,897
Prominent U waves.

123
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,867
No inverted T wave. No ischemia.

124
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,696
Q wave normal.

125
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,231
That's not good.

126
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,275
Okay, turn it off. Turn it off!

127
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,280
What's happening? What is that?

128
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,587
The seizure's getting...

129
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,412
Can't you stop that?

130
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,687
Who electrocuted my patient?

131
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,718
He had a seizure. CAMERON:
He wasn't electrocuted.

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,423
What does the
seizure tell us? Move.

133
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,725
What are you looking for?

134
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,564
Same as you are, love, acceptance,
solid return on an investment.

135
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,227
Differential diagnosis. Go.

136
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,204
Could be epilepsy
or seizure disorder.

137
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,639
Not with the tachycardia. It
could be a virus in his brain.

138
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,007
Your specificity's impressive.

139
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,602
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

140
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,977
Could be MS.

141
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,710
The seizures could be caused by
plaques and lesions on the brain.

142
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,412
Well, let's find out
which. Get him an MRI.

143
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,250
No nuclear imaging!

144
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,324
He wouldn't survive the move to
Radiology. MRI and CT scan are both out.

145
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,626
Okay, lumbar puncture will tell
us if his proteins are elevated,

146
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,029
at least we can exclude MS.

147
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,134
We can't do a lumbar
puncture either.

148
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,862
You're cramping my exits.

149
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,769
Don't tell me, no
skin on his spine.

150
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,775
We'd be inserting a needle into
an area that's teeming with bacteria.

151
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,721
If he doesn't have a brain infection
already, we'd give him one for sure.

152
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,476
There's no other
way to look at a brain.

153
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,614
Transcranial Doppler Sonography.

154
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,848
She said "brain," not
"pregnant woman's uterus."

155
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,686
They do sound alike. I used
one to look at a brain this morning.

156
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,420
Why didn't you take the patient
to Radiology, get an MRA?

157
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,587
Obviously I was
doing something illegal.

158
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,927
Using nuclear imaging
would have raised questions.

159
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,797
You're not gonna get a
diagnosis of MS from a sonogram.

160
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,927
Not definitively,
but patients with MS

161
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,098
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

162
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,242
Okay then.

163
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,283
Thank you for all
coming to today's lecture

164
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,410
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

165
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,482
who is our guest
today at our hospital

166
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:53,084
to talk about headaches.

167
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:57,959
Dr. Weber is at the Weber
Center for Pain, that makes sense.

168
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,163
Weber, Weber. So
please welcome Dr. Weber!

169
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,669
Thank you Dr. Cuddy.

170
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,611
I suppose I should tell you
a little bit more about myself.

171
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,683
I went to school in Virginia.

172
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,732
You've never been to one
of these things in your life.

173
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,282
Who is this guy? No idea.

174
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,528
What's with the outfit?

175
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,762
Sudden chills and
light sensitivity.

176
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,634
Inexplicable.

177
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,064
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

178
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,442
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar...

179
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,340
Hmm. He must be good.

180
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,437
You went to Hopkins, and studied
under Brightman and Gilmar.

181
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,914
Shh.

182
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,384
Helped me win the Doyle
Internship at the Mayo Clinic.

183
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,445
You were supposed to
get the Doyle Internship.

184
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:01,487
This guy's Von Lieberman? The guy
who got you thrown out for cheating?

185
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,293
The dean threw me out. Von
Lieberman just ratted on me.

186
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,596
This guy's name is
Weber, not Von Lieberman.

187
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,865
I call Weber Von
Lieberman, way eviler.

188
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,404
Shh.

189
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,535
1D receptors have improved
the acute treatment of migraines,

190
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,970
to this point...

191
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,605
So what's the plan?

192
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,243
You gonna wait until he bends
over and make a fart sound?

193
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,388
I'm not here about the
past. He's a bad scientist.

194
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,426
Well, you cheated off
him, how bad can he be?

195
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,863
He got the answer wrong.

196
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,299
Are they trying to wake him up?

197
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,603
They can't do that, right?
He'll be in too much pain.

198
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,974
Don't worry, he's still under.

199
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,310
But the brain never completely
sleeps, it's always working.

200
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,873
Controlling your heart
rate, breathing, temperature.

201
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,078
The eyes respond
to visual stimuli.

202
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,123
Blood flow increases in
certain areas of the brain

203
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,681
and we can track
that with a sonogram.

204
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:10,219
With MS, blood vessels are
more reactive, so flow is faster.

205
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,490
If Adam has an infection,

206
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,100
there'd be swelling, which
would constrict the arteries.

207
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,399
And the flow would be slower.

208
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,304
Chase. Near the
subarachnoid space.

209
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,641
Data from control subjects were
analyzed of a two-way ANOVA

210
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,812
with status and side
as within-subject factors.

211
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,019
You stalked this guy for 20 years
just for this shot to humiliate him?

212
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,061
I'm trying to learn.

213
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,460
Vessels without
significant rebound...

214
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,192
He doesn't even
know what that means.

215
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,786
You're gonna interrupt
him, aren't you?

216
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,427
If I have a question.

217
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,471
And what's that
gonna accomplish?

218
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,304
Why can't you just enjoy this?
Why can't you just be happy for me?

219
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,710
You have got to find less debilitating
outlets than humiliating people.

220
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,216
I hear bowling is
more fun than stalking.

221
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,307
But I'm better at this.

222
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,854
If "P" is less
than point-zero...

223
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,412
Blow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

224
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,055
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

225
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,864
Bleed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

226
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,230
It could be. 10% with damage
to cerebral cortex have a seizure.

227
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,860
Or bacterial meningitis.

228
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,166
Viral encephalitis? There's
no way to tell without...

229
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,467
Shut up!

230
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,074
Excuse me.

231
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,606
Not you.

232
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:35,342
You know, if my lecture is
interrupting your meeting, I can wait.

233
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,344
As your people say
in India. Appreciate it.

234
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,983
We'll figure out why later.
Fix the bleed or he dies.

235
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,289
Talk to you in a couple hours.

236
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,672
I'm in the subarachnoid space.

237
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,042
Can you get it? Think so.

238
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,460
Put the probe back where
it was so I can see the wire!

239
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,628
We're looking
for the bleed in...

240
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:16,783
Look when I get there, I'm flying
blind without a contrast CT here!

241
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:30,402
And with a p-value
of less than 0.001,

242
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:35,107
we have strong statistical evidence that
this drug prevents migraine headaches

243
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,541
without daily administration.

244
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,736
Excuse me, Doctor.

245
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,474
He knows his field
better than you do.

246
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,507
It's always been my understanding
that, unless you follow a daily regimen,

247
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,611
no drug can prevent a migraine.

248
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,588
That's why they call
it a breakthrough.

249
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,851
That's why you call
it a breakthrough.

250
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,224
No, the pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials

251
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,525
also hails it as a breakthrough.

252
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,226
I'm sure your wife
and lawyer do, too.

253
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,812
Is there anybody who doesn't
stand to make a fortune from it

254
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,304
calling it a breakthrough?

255
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,532
Who are you?

256
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,098
Just a lunatic who
desperately needs a hobby.

257
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,167
How exactly do
these studies work?

258
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,179
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people,

259
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,876
and if they don't get a migraine,
you go, <i>"Voilà,</i> my drug works"?

260
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,542
Excuse me, miss?

261
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,682
Do you have cancer?

262
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,225
Wow! Mango juice
prevents cancer.

263
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,889
Perhaps I should have taken
my medication before this lecture.

264
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:35,398
We had a very specific control
group, chronic migraine sufferers.

265
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,628
I don't have time to go
through all the math right now,

266
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,129
but the incidence was
dramatically... Sure, in India.

267
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,404
Two plus two equals
five there, right?

268
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,674
Do I know you?

269
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,342
I know your math
skills. They blow.

270
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,112
<i>Touché.</i>

271
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,086
You sound very familiar.

272
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,021
Why did you publish it in
an obscure journal in India?

273
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,584
Why not publish it in really, really
cool head cases of South Philly?

274
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,358
<i>Neuroscience New Delhi</i>
is a respected journal.

275
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,094
Yeah. The guy running Slurp N'
Gulp tells me it's one of the best.

276
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,102
Get a hooker, anything.

277
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,765
See, I'm thinking that publishing
studies is probably the easiest way

278
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,469
to get a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

279
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,637
And choosing a journal that no
one can actually read, well, that's...

280
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,907
That's shrewd.

281
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,747
I know I know you.
Sure you do, Dick.

282
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,277
The name's Philip.

283
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,446
My bad. Something
to do with your face.

284
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,753
I always think
your name is Dick.

285
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,816
House? Here.

286
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,596
Medical school was 20 years
ago. Give it a rest. Grow up.

287
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,433
Yeah. You were always the grown-up.
Do the responsible thing, tattletale!

288
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,897
You cheated! I cheated
then, you're cheating now!

289
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,033
Your drug doesn't work.

290
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,601
Oh, yes, you would like to believe that
because it plays right into your fantasy...

291
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,670
I tested it. Oh, really?

292
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,950
What are your parameters?
Where's your study?

293
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,046
Room 2134.

294
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,654
One patient? The coma patient?

295
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,951
You haven't changed a bit.

296
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,597
You took shortcuts in med
school, you're taking shortcuts now.

297
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,064
You cannot test this
on an abnormal brain.

298
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:20,163
That's so close-minded. He's
not abnormal, he's special.

299
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,676
Cerebral cortex
atrophies in coma patients.

300
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,241
You need live, conscious people.

301
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,353
You don't know
everything, House!

302
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,155
Something that
disrupts brain function.

303
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,864
Plaques are perfect. Interrupt
neuronal communication.

304
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,264
MS? No, MS is complicated.

305
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,168
I think this is more basic. It's
just tachycardia and seizures.

306
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,298
How much longer the Burn Unit
guys gonna keep him in that thing?

307
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,275
Lecture's over, let's
go. House wants to...

308
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,841
Adam's waking up.

309
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,046
Get the anesthesiologist
in here now.

310
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,414
He's in pain.

311
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,885
That's not pain.

312
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,557
Need some help in here!

313
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,216
Adam had an orgasm.

314
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,822
What? You mean,
while he was sedated...

315
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,833
What's wrong?

316
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,371
I'm having a migraine.

317
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,239
Are you okay?

318
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:35,867
Yes.

319
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,077
I was right.

320
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,017
I'm gonna knock you
out for a couple of hours.

321
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,889
No, I got work to do.

322
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,094
Just give me
sumatriptan for the pain

323
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,655
and verapamil
so it doesn't recur.

324
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,931
I heard the patient had fun
in the hyperbaric chamber.

325
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,133
Yeah.

326
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,802
Gotta schedule me
some time in there.

327
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,313
Weber's meds aren't
even legal in the U.S.

328
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,313
It's legal in India.

329
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,448
I was disoriented.

330
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,521
Moving around is a bad idea.

331
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,558
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to let me know.

332
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,567
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

333
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,727
Nothing can hurt my heart.

334
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,175
Hey, you're gonna feel some
dizziness. Definitely gonna be constipated.

335
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,584
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

336
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,754
Is he gonna be okay? No.
Something's seriously wrong with him.

337
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:02,386
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

338
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,392
Don't make me say it again.

339
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,627
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

340
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,067
Then guess.

341
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,669
Could pain medication
cause an orgasm? I wish.

342
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,708
Maybe pain caused the orgasm.

343
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,212
You get a tattoo, the brain releases
endorphins which create pleasure.

344
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,838
Most people don't
orgasm from a needle prick.

345
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,780
Well, Chase has a point.

346
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,547
The brain is like a huge
train station, if the switches...

347
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,825
You're the
neurologist, talk for me.

348
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:36,988
If sensory information got misinterpreted
by the medial forebrain bundle,

349
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,998
it's possible for bad to feel
good, and good to feel bad.

350
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,729
He's a lucky kid. Let's not
fix him until the burns heal.

351
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,863
So what attacks the
medial forebrain bundle?

352
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,203
Infective neuropathies,
vasculitic neuropathies...

353
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,402
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic leukodystrophy.

354
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,207
All very bad things.

355
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,908
No way to look for any
of them in his condition.

356
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,347
Could be an infection.

357
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,078
I said infection about
eight seconds ago.

358
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,120
You listed some
brain infections.

359
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:05,682
But what if it's just a regular old
infection festering in the burned skin?

360
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,284
Pus on his arm isn't causing
problems in the forebrain.

361
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,922
He's on 20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,

362
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,659
how often he urinates.

363
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,361
His brain is like a waiter
that's got too many...

364
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,166
Hey, hey. I do the metaphors.

365
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,800
The brain is stressed.

366
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,071
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

367
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,239
So we just wait for his burns
to heal to see if you're right?

368
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,580
If you're wrong, he doesn't
have that kind of time.

369
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,577
Dominic Larrey.

370
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,480
He another dead doctor?

371
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,219
He's Napoleon's
Surgeon in Chief.

372
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,851
Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.

373
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,327
By amputating legs.

374
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,057
And with bugs.

375
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,033
Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

376
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,866
Maggots, they eat dead people,

377
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,401
Maggots eat dead
flesh. Only dead flesh.

378
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,882
So they're perfectly
suited to clean wounds.

379
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,118
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive in injured tissues.

380
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,189
Dr. Jekyll, I presume.

381
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,923
They found a half-eaten sheep in the zoo.
The police wanna ask you a few questions.

382
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,589
I need something
to wash it down.

383
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,725
Coffee? Bad idea.

384
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,895
You're better off with
water! Coffee's closer.

385
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,773
Foolproof plan, by the way.

386
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,638
Either his meds would work,

387
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:08,340
and you'd be in psychic pain
because Von Evil is gonna be rich.

388
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,079
Or they wouldn't, and you
get to be in agony all day.

389
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,189
Perfect lose-lose
situation. Very you.

390
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,090
I had to prove...
You've proved nothing.

391
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,462
Right. This isn't a migraine.

392
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,393
Yeah. "Dear <i>New England
Journal of Medicine,</i>

393
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,164
"I took this guy's drug
and still got a headache.

394
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,900
"Thus, scientifically proving
that my arch enemy is an idiot."

395
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,306
You just wanted the pain.

396
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,868
Meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

397
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,573
You get distracted by pain.

398
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,412
Leaves less room for the things
you don't wanna think about.

399
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,783
Like the Flyers sucking,
or the price of gas,

400
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,318
or the fact that you pushed the
love of your life out of your life.

401
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,189
God, I wish the
pain would go away.

402
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,366
Next time you need to get your
mind off her, stick a needle in your eye.

403
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,230
It's less annoying to the rest
of us when you can still walk.

404
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,137
Did you sleep here?

405
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,040
Lower.

406
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,540
Do you want a pillow?

407
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,212
Not softer, lower.

408
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,421
Frequency of your
voice is grating.

409
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,219
You should've
been better by now.

410
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,815
I'm super.

411
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,524
Patient?

412
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,553
The maggots did
great for the burn.

413
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,991
But the brain waves
are still all over the map.

414
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:38,299
Which means your regular old infection
isn't causing his brain dysfunction.

415
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,236
Which means there's
an underlying condition,

416
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,036
which means we've
gotta get inside his head.

417
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,906
Do a lumbar puncture.

418
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,208
We've already established
that we can't get a lumbar...

419
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,271
C2, C3.

420
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,340
No. No. No way.

421
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,409
I only saw a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

422
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:59,925
Ask the parents if they prefer to
have their son in a wheelchair or dead.

423
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,298
Something's causing
his brain to lose control.

424
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,267
Eventually it'll shut off.

425
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,859
We need to do a lumbar puncture

426
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,804
to get some of the fluid in
his spine so we can test it.

427
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,034
You need us to sign a consent?

428
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,838
I have to warn you.

429
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,903
There's a serious risk
of paralysis or death.

430
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,645
Are you saying we
shouldn't do this?

431
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,545
You have to do this.

432
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,483
Then why are you telling
us what can go wrong?

433
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,647
I just think you should
know... Either you're cruel

434
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,666
or this clipboard is a way
for you to cover your ass,

435
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,501
in case you cripple our
son. This isn't his fault.

436
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,586
No, it's not. It's yours, that's
what you keep telling me.

437
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,290
My son is lying
in there half-dead,

438
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,595
I am just trying to find a
way to get through this.

439
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm sorry. Yeah, I know.

440
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,984
Needle.

441
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,831
It's not going
in. Don't force it.

442
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,504
I'm going one space higher.

443
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,774
It's too close to his
brain stem, it'll herniate.

444
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,142
You're gonna paralyze
him. You're not helping.

445
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,876
His blood pressure's
spiking, stop. I can get it.

446
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,581
He's 180 over 120,
he's gonna stroke.

447
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,749
I'm in the space.
Give me the vial.

448
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,769
He doesn't have
MS or an infection.

449
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,048
His proteins aren't elevated?

450
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,780
Wrong protein. lgM, not lgG.

451
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,955
Elevation was probably
caused by the bleed.

452
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:16,285
What if there was tingling in
his extremities prior to the crash?

453
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,388
How can you still be on
MS? I gotta be on something.

454
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,901
Something's interrupting his
neurons' chitchat, like lesions.

455
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,734
We can't scan for them.

456
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,969
The only test we can do, we
just did and it was negative.

457
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,102
He has no tingling, no numbness.

458
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,646
And you read his history,
parents didn't say anything about...

459
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,306
What about Adam?

460
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:41,586
We can't look into his brain,
but you want us to read his mind?

461
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,921
Good point.

462
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,958
Yeah, you can finish the
sponge bath in a minute.

463
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,402
They're just re-doing his
dressings. He's out, he's fine.

464
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,306
I didn't page you to put him
out. I paged you to wake him up.

465
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,002
Why are these
lights so damn bright?

466
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,844
Thank you.

467
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,905
Come on, I need to talk to him.

468
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,679
House, you can't wake up a burn
victim to play twenty questions.

469
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,720
It's torture. He won't remember.

470
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,449
He's gonna be in
extraordinary... God, you're good!

471
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,320
You're putting me to sleep.

472
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,953
I know he's gonna be in pain, I
know you disapprove. I'm his attending.

473
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,428
Wake him up.

474
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,406
Oh, my God!

475
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,817
I'm Dr. House. It hurts!

476
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,122
It's gonna get a lot
worse, so answer fast.

477
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,888
Before the accident, did you experience
any numbness or tingling in your fingers?

478
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,452
You got burned, it's
healing, I need an answer.

479
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,724
It really hurts!

480
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,698
Any tingling in
your arms or legs?

481
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,462
You gotta do
something, I can't...

482
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,868
Adam, you gotta listen to
me, did you feel anything?

483
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:12,069
I pissed in my pants and
then I don't remember...

484
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,148
Was he okay? Get
everyone in my office.

485
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,881
Where you going?

486
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:01,022
Kid's screaming gave me a
headache. I gotta take an aspirin.

487
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,282
House, you okay? We've
been waiting for you.

488
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,655
I'm hallucinating.

489
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,229
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

490
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:20,268
What did you see? I saw music.

491
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,642
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

492
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,711
You took something.

493
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,983
The kid's fighting for his life.

494
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,511
Hey, you find him?

495
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,677
He was hallucinating
in the locker room.

496
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,151
He okay?

497
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,018
He's feeling no pain, he's high.

498
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,386
Vicodin high?

499
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,051
Past that. He's seeing sounds.

500
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,885
Took something.

501
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,426
Why is it so dark in here?
It's a beautiful day outside.

502
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,129
Open the shades,
let the sun shine in.

503
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,761
It's nighttime.

504
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,576
It's still Tuesday,
right? You look better.

505
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,571
I took something.
Mind if I ask what?

506
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,245
Little of this, little of that.

507
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,307
I know what's wrong
with our patient.

508
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,909
He's depressed.

509
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,706
He told you that when
you woke him up? Nope.

510
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,565
He told me he pissed
his pants and blacked out.

511
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,787
That's not diagnostic of depression.
Lack of appetite, isolating yourself.

512
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,988
Uncontrollable urination and blacking
out are good predictors of what?

513
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,121
Seizure.

514
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,632
Which means the seizure he
had when you tested his heart

515
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,668
was at least his second
seizure. So what?

516
00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:01,139
Depression and seizures aren't
correlated. No, but you know what is?

517
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,801
Depression and
anti-depression medicine.

518
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,434
Tox screen was clean.

519
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,706
Yeah, but you know how
much crap he's got in his system

520
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,940
for dealing with those burns.

521
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,984
The guy could have the Spanish
Armada floating through his bloodstream

522
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,645
and we wouldn't know about
it, till they started firing cannons.

523
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,315
Antidepressants have been known to
cause seizures in kids, but not orgasms.

524
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,555
This is a brain in trouble. This is
a brain with too much serotonin.

525
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:26,428
Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it
doesn't cause the brain to shut down.

526
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,627
Antidepressants fake brains into
thinking they have more serotonin

527
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,033
than they actually do.

528
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,834
Every ten million or so
cases sets off a chain reaction.

529
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,535
Produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

530
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,976
If Adam has Serotonin
Storm, it's deadly.

531
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,276
But treatable. Cyproheptadine.

532
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,906
Unless he doesn't
have Serotonin Storm.

533
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,611
He could just as easily have
too much dopamine as serotonin,

534
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,247
but if it's dopamine, the
cyproheptadine will kill him.

535
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,292
Where are you going? Gonna
talk to the kid again, he seems nice.

536
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,724
You can't.

537
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,617
Why? Did he say
he doesn't like me?

538
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,824
Anesthesiologist told
the parents what you did.

539
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,890
Everyone's a tattletale.

540
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,206
Is your son depressed?

541
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,245
No. Who are you? I'm Dr. House.

542
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,623
Oh, you're the
idiot who thought...

543
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,491
I heard him screaming all
the way down the hallway.

544
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,383
If I didn't wake him up, I wouldn't
have learned what caused the crash.

545
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,080
He had a seizure.

546
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,289
This wasn't my fault?

547
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,490
Well, if he hadn't had the brain
problem, he wouldn't have the burns.

548
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,657
On the other hand, if you
hadn't put him on the ATV,

549
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,009
he also wouldn't have the burns.

550
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,244
You can debate your personal
responsibility after I leave.

551
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,759
I need to wake him up again.

552
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,669
I need to know if he's
taking antidepressants.

553
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,002
He's not.

554
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:46,573
He's the happiest kid I know.
But you don't know, do you?

555
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,147
He's my son.

556
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,377
That's sort of my point.

557
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,852
At 16, they'll tell anyone
anything, except their parents.

558
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,616
Adam talks to us
about everything.

559
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,749
Yeah, I know about
the pot and the cocaine.

560
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,690
There was never...
Cocaine. What...

561
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,855
Are you sure? Are you
having him followed?

562
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,524
He told us when he
got drunk at a party.

563
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,431
He told us when he
started having sex.

564
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,197
At 16? Way to go.

565
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,999
He told us when he
cheated on a math test.

566
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,302
He told us when his
girlfriend cheated on him.

567
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,343
He doesn't hide anything from
us. But if he was depressed?

568
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,901
He'd tell us.

569
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,047
We don't judge, he's not
depressed, we're sure.

570
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,242
"Bet his life on it" sure?

571
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,716
Just hypothetically.

572
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,381
Yeah.

573
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,019
Okay.

574
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,297
Kid's happy.

575
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,258
Happy, happy, happy.

576
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,970
Then we're back to where
we started. Seizure disorders.

577
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,940
Seizure disorders
aren't causing orgasms.

578
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,636
Vascular malformations?

579
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,770
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

580
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,905
Hepatic encephalopathy?

581
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,279
Liver enzyme tests were normal.

582
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,658
Where are you
going? Take a leak.

583
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,860
What are you doing?

584
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,926
You can't come in
here, you're not sterile.

585
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,402
Don't touch our
son, we told you...

586
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,066
Seriously, millions of
bacteria, microbes on you.

587
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,076
He'll die of sepsis.
If you go in there...

588
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,472
I think he's gonna
wake him up again.

589
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,107
I know he is.

590
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,683
House, you can't do this.

591
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,885
Oh, if I had a nickel for every
time I've heard that. Relax.

592
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,588
Are they gonna sue us?
If I'm right, I save his life.

593
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,631
If I'm wrong, he's dead
no matter what I do.

594
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,935
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

595
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,264
Leave him alone!

596
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,737
You're not sterile. Do
you wanna kill the kid?

597
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,774
Give me the syringe.
No pain, no gain.

598
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,832
Hey, you gotta stop this.

599
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,481
They're right.

600
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,080
- He's not depressed.
- Yeah, sure.

601
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,781
I'm not letting you go till
you give me that syringe.

602
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,846
What's that on his wrist?

603
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,153
A burn.

604
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,558
Why on his wrist?
Why not on his wrist?

605
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,531
His back, his torso, everything's
a mess. His forearms are clean.

606
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,794
Except right there. So what?

607
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,601
It's a perfect circle.

608
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,971
So a drop of burning gasoline fell
on his wrist, a screw from the ATV.

609
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,869
Maybe.

610
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,855
Why are you torturing
him? Does your son smoke?

611
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,625
I'd kill him.

612
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:53,997
So, he can talk to you about sex,
crack, anything except cigarettes.

613
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,828
He has a cigarette
burn on his wrist.

614
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,634
Also a fading nicotine
stain between two fingers.

615
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,638
Bad news, your son has
a filthy, unhealthy habit.

616
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,077
Good news, he's trying to quit.

617
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,274
Bad news, the
quitting's killing him.

618
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,147
Good news, I can
cure him. Bad news...

619
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,850
Nope, that's the end of it.

620
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,913
Quitting smoking can kill?

621
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,221
No-smoke meds
are antidepressants.

622
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,352
The crappy ones you
get over the Internet

623
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,227
are loaded with whatever
antidepressants they can get cheap.

624
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,598
And since Mommy and Daddy obviously
didn't take him to a pediatrician...

625
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,941
Sorry, I was wrong about
him being depressed.

626
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,873
Treat him.

627
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,153
Hey!

628
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,425
Did you drop acid?

629
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,001
Why would I do
that? To annoy me.

630
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,503
Or maybe because
you're miserable,

631
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,872
or because you
want to self-destruct.

632
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,507
Pick one.

633
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,937
How about because LSD acts
on serotonin receptors in the brain,

634
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,814
which can stop a
migraine in its tracks.

635
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,820
I'm just saying that's
also a possibility.

636
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,324
How did you know about it?
Cameron is worried about you.

637
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:30,294
I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours,
if you were functional, she must be wrong.

638
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,195
Either that or I also took a
whole bunch of antidepressants,

639
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,358
which short-circuited the LSD.

640
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,265
I'm just saying that
would also explain it.

641
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,634
Thank you for ruining
my clinical trials.

642
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,696
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

643
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,004
You're kidding. Really?
How could that surprise you?

644
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,270
You sent them an email

645
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,903
complaining about my math,
telling them about your stunt.

646
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,175
I didn't know people
actually read emails.

647
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,979
Delete button's so conveniently
located. So what's next?

648
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,609
You gonna follow
me my whole life?

649
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,484
Torture me? Why would I do that?

650
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,650
You waited 20 years to do this.
What's next? Break up my marriage?

651
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,758
No. We're even. Right.

652
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,060
Oh, thanks for setting me up.

653
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,138
Eye for an eye, LSD
and antidepressants.

654
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,773
Everything in balance.

655
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,904
Buddhists call it Karma.
Christians call it the Golden Rule.

656
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,573
Jews call it...

657
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,882
I don't know, Rabbi Hillel
said something poignant.

658
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,689
Universe always
settles the score.

659
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,993
Does it? No.

660
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,420
But it should.

661
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:51,132
Do you think you'll ever be able
to look at him and not blame me?

662
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:55,070
Yeah. Will you?

663
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,196
I'm Paula.

664
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,061
Hey, Paula. How you doing?

665
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,630
You work over at the college,
or are you full-time over at the...

666
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,971
I'm looking for a distraction.

667
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,577
You don't need to
talk to do that, do you?
