1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:04,661
Hi, kids.

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,070
Mommy, look what I made.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,767
Oh, wow.

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:12,913
It's a farmer and a
cow and some horses.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,374
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,711
It's for Ted's office.

7
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,718
Oh, he's gonna love it. And
it'd be nice if you called him Dad.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,413
Give me a big hug.

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,622
Secret is the Haas avocados. I
can e-mail you the recipe if you want.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,424
It's the third time they've
changed plans since Friday.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,232
These idiots think you can just add a
14th floor and the mayor won't notice.

12
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,297
And I thought turning the garage
into a nursery was complicated.

13
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,706
Any luck on your end yet?

14
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,801
Not for lack of trying.

15
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,139
Ted.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,381
Come on. Come on, Margo!

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,045
I have to go tell a
client he's an idiot.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,383
Go kick some ass.

19
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:59,222
I have to take Stella to karate by
3:00 and a birthday party at Julia's after.

20
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,695
You okay?

21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,971
Yeah. I'll be back. Just
make sure she's dressed.

22
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,440
Honey! Honey!

23
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,059
He's actually on time.

24
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,890
He's six minutes early.

25
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,595
Something's happened. I'm on it.

26
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,698
Good morning, Jimmy.

27
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,266
Anybody die while I was gone?

28
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,298
Did you iron your shirt?

29
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,468
I thought about shaving.
Couldn't find a razor.

30
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,343
What the hell
happened in Baltimore?

31
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,747
Sorry, chief.
Never kiss and tell.

32
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,148
I think you just did.

33
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,880
There's no such
thing as "just a kiss."

34
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,817
Did you iron your shirt?
Everybody's flash today.

35
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,384
Has she left Mark?
Is she going to?

36
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,291
I think I can hear
cancer kids calling.

37
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,593
Are you planning on
asking her to leave Mark?

38
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,067
Not sure. Cameron
keeps my calendar.

39
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,798
Hey. This is a big
deal. This is an affair.

40
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,969
Have you even talked to Stacy
about what the hell this means?

41
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,977
Didn't have a lot of time for
talking, if you know what I mean.

42
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,980
Great. Breaking up a marriage.
Fertile ground for high comedy.

43
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,141
We need to talk about this.

44
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,787
Gosh, wish I could. How did
the HIV test go? You study up?

45
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,218
I rescheduled for this
afternoon. We have a new patient.

46
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,623
Thirty-four-year-old
female, movement disorder.

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,025
Movement disorder? Fascinating.

48
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,323
This isn't just gonna go away.

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,369
No. But maybe you will.

50
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,236
Probably suffered head
trauma in the car accident.

51
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,706
Trauma leads to the dyskinesia.

52
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,969
According to her husband,

53
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,477
the flailing started before
she got anywhere near that car.

54
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,855
What does the
flailing look like?

55
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,610
Her arms spasm uncontrollably
and there's a mild facial twitch.

56
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,173
Demonstration?

57
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,851
You wanna know what it
looks like, go see the patient.

58
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,822
Oh, snarky. Was he like this
the whole time I was gone?

59
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,219
The patient's been on a fertility
regimen for the last 13 months.

60
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,262
Excess estrogen in the
system could explain...

61
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,854
Who finished the
animal crackers?

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,365
Sudden movement disorder
could be a symptom of Huntington's.

63
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,962
If you finish something, don't just
put back the empty box, throw it out.

64
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,273
Huntington's takes
a day to confirm.

65
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,470
We should put her on tamoxifen
in case it is the fertility meds,

66
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,739
counteract the estrogen.

67
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,873
That's a great idea if
you wanna kill her baby.

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,382
Movement disorder can
present in the first trimester.

69
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,546
She's not pregnant.

70
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,490
Peeing on a stick is only 99%
accurate. Get a real pregnancy test.

71
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:55,120
You know, the one with the blood
and the hormones and the rabbit.

72
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,155
Oh, I'm sorry,
it's still your limo.

73
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,194
What do you say, Miss Daisy?

74
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,929
Whatever you want.

75
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,300
Lame duck's done quacking.

76
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,929
You quack, people shoot at you.

77
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,997
Cuddy just put me here
to make you miserable.

78
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,043
Another two days, you can go
back to making yourself miserable.

79
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay, get an MRI. See if it's
in her head or in her uterus.

80
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,974
You're gonna want
to paralyze her.

81
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,351
You run tests on a flailer,
somebody's gonna lose an eye.

82
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,061
Sorry. You think I'm pregnant?

83
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,662
We need to find out for sure.

84
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,062
Would all this go away
once she delivered?

85
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,465
It could also be neurological.
We need to get an MRI.

86
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,968
Can she do that
if she's pregnant?

87
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,937
The risk to the fetus
is extremely low.

88
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,597
But there is a risk.

89
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,604
I don't think we should
do it until we're sure.

90
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,005
Ted, I think you should
take Stella home.

91
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,913
I wanna stay here.
We should be with you.

92
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,360
You should take
her out of the room.

93
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,615
We're gonna temporarily
stop Margo's spasms.

94
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,383
You can do that? Vecuronium.

95
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,517
It's a paralytic. Essentially cuts
off the brain from the muscles.

96
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,891
Don't worry. Your
mom will be just fine.

97
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,489
It'll make running
the tests easier,

98
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,000
and it won't be dangerous for
the baby if you are pregnant.

99
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,161
Let's go, Stella.

100
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,499
I want to go with Mommy.

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,540
We'll be just outside, okay? We
gotta let the doctors get her better.

102
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,473
All right? It's okay, sweetie.

103
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,511
Love you. Love you.

104
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,542
Your vitals will be
watched closely.

105
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,226
I'm gonna close your lids
so your eyes don't dry out.

106
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,729
Just try to relax.

107
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,596
What the hell did you do?
Were you just cold and lonely?

108
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,139
Of course he told you.
He's an eight-year-old boy.

109
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,871
Hey, you're the
one who kissed him.

110
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,810
Why are you so
worked up over this?

111
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,903
Because you're married.

112
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,414
Not to you.

113
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,914
This is none of your business.

114
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,215
The last time you left, I was the
one stuck picking up the pieces.

115
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,587
Oh, right. He cried himself to sleep
every night. That so sounds like him.

116
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,286
He's been pining for five years.

117
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,486
You're being dramatic.

118
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,656
No. Actually, I'm underplaying.
This is me being restrained.

119
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,099
It was one kiss. Are you
being intentionally thick?

120
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,272
This was not just
a one-night stand.

121
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,579
You can't toy with him.

122
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,646
I'm not.

123
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:36,419
He's probably toying with
me. I don't know what I'm doing.

124
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,390
Oh, boy.

125
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,170
Welcome back to the world.
You're off the vecuronium.

126
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,040
Could you wiggle
your toes for me?

127
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:01,013
The MRI was clear. Whatever
this is, isn't in your brain.

128
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,313
MRI. So I'm not pregnant?

129
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,817
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
So what do we do next?

131
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:12,826
Well, it could be a variety of things,
some treatable, others more serious.

132
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,155
Open up.

133
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,623
I'm gonna run a genetic
test for Huntington's.

134
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,063
That one of the more
serious ones? Yeah.

135
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,398
It's also possible that this is just a
symptom of the fertility treatments.

136
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,214
And now that we know you're not pregnant,
we're gonna start you on tamoxifen

137
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,638
to counteract the estrogen.

138
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,232
Will that undo all the
fertility treatments?

139
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,177
For the time being,
yeah. But it could cure you.

140
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,477
You can start trying again
once we get you healthy.

141
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,477
Damn it!

142
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,352
The spasms are gonna get worse
now that the vecuronium is wearing off.

143
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,883
What are you so scared of?

144
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,861
I'm still your mother.
I'm just a little sick.

145
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,956
Why did you even bring her here?
I told you to leave her at home.

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,139
Hypervigilance,
sudden irritability.

147
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,971
Symptomatic of lunch with Cuddy?

148
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,807
The patient now
defines Huntington's.

149
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,144
Then what do you need me for?
Start her on Huntington's meds.

150
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,944
Before we get her
test results back?

151
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,451
We start her on valproic
acid, it could destroy her liver.

152
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,782
Could stroke. If we wait,

153
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,015
she could progress
to full-blown psychosis,

154
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,684
and then her kid will never
get the chance to say goodbye.

155
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,954
Wanna tell the
class how that feels?

156
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,756
Huntington's patients don't
progress to psychosis in a day.

157
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,110
She went from zero to
60 in world record time.

158
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,070
Indicating it might be something
other than Huntington's.

159
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,901
We got a problem.

160
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,676
Stay away from me!
Where's my daughter?

161
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,655
What's happening? She's
having a psychotic break.

162
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,444
No! She is not yours!
What do you want with her?

163
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,574
Calm down! TED: Honey.

164
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,794
Margo, you're
gonna hurt someone.

165
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:45,979
No.

166
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,482
Push two milligrams of Ativan.

167
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,081
I want my daughter!

168
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,718
She's not yours! I want my
daughter! No more experiments!

169
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,386
No!

170
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,199
How can her Huntington's
test be negative?

171
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,300
All the signs are there.
Movement disorder, psychosis.

172
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,742
It should be Huntington's.

173
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,804
Yeah. It would certainly
make your job easier.

174
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,309
Well, good news for Margo, it's
not Huntington's. Bad news for us,

175
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,786
her psychotic break
eliminates fertility meds.

176
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,291
Which means we have no
idea what's wrong with her.

177
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,691
We give you so much,
and you give us so little.

178
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,162
You know, the patient is prime age to
develop spontaneous schizophrenia.

179
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,258
Almost impossible. No
family history of mental illness.

180
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,962
How about toxins?

181
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,970
None of her family members are sick.
Nobody at her office, her volunteer group,

182
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,406
kid's classes, and
PTA members, all fine.

183
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:47,846
So she raises a daughter, runs a
business, she does charity work,

184
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,813
she volunteers at
school, attends PTA.

185
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,852
What makes Mommy run?

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,048
You're thinking drugs? Cocaine.

187
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,020
Explains the psychosis
and the flailing.

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,156
And the uncanny ability to bring
home the bacon, fry it up in a pan,

189
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,824
and never ever let Teddy
forget that he's a man.

190
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,162
I'll go look for her stash.

191
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,496
Take Foreman.

192
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,799
There's gotta be a
reason for the stereotype.

193
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,817
I know you're in there.

194
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,785
I can hear you caring.

195
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,629
The door was locked.

196
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,193
It means I didn't
wanna see anyone.

197
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,572
High school reunion?

198
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,403
It's for a patient.
She can't roll.

199
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,610
Hey, I locked that door, too.

200
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,479
Paranoia. Must
be the good stuff.

201
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,121
Times like these, I
wish I had cancer.

202
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,884
So what did she say?

203
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,090
It depends. What did you do,
and who are we talking about?

204
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,561
We both know that as soon
as we talked, you ran to Stacy

205
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,029
so you could gossip and giggle.

206
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,395
I need to know what she said.

207
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,957
I have a crazy idea. Why
don't you go talk to her?

208
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,198
Because my bestest buddy
says that could lead to trouble.

209
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,337
She sounds confused,
but I don't think she is.

210
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,449
I think she's waiting for you to do
something, show her you're serious.

211
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,045
Wow.

212
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,357
It's a big jump from "infidelity
is morally wrong" to "do her."

213
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,893
I didn't say "do her."
I said do something.

214
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,952
What exactly did she say?

215
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,529
She didn't say it was a mistake.

216
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,670
She's not gonna leave Mark
in the middle of his rehab.

217
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,296
Too much guilt.

218
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,873
She left you.

219
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,004
Harsh toke, dude.

220
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,378
House.

221
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,354
Killjoy.

222
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,304
I could've covered this. You
need to get that test today.

223
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,102
I wish you guys would remember
my birthday instead of my HIV test.

224
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,736
Forgive us for being
concerned. I got a bet with House.

225
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,040
He says you're too scared to
get it. I say you're too anal not to.

226
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,910
I'll cut you in.

227
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,920
That was a colossal waste.

228
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,033
Who would've known?

229
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,641
Searching a high-end
family home for illicit

230
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,859
narcotics was such
an obvious choice.

231
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,830
Working moms
practically live in their cars.

232
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,459
Little bump on the run.

233
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,764
You were a car thief, right?

234
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,677
Mama's little helper.

235
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,039
House, Ritalin.

236
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,450
Cocaine with a PG rating.

237
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,147
Prescribed to her daughter.

238
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,919
Mommy does everything for her family
these days, even swallows their pills.

239
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,517
It's possible the kid's
meds are the kid's meds.

240
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,586
Pop enough Ritalin, it
can explain everything.

241
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,189
Well, Ritalin maybe explains
some tics, some involuntary...

242
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,632
No, case reports
have referred to chorea.

243
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,246
She's been cut off from her
stash, so the flailing's tapered off,

244
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,296
the psychosis hasn't
returned. It's perfect.

245
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,171
Tox screen will confirm that.

246
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,733
Half-life's 12 hours. Drugs
will be out of her system.

247
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,006
We're done. Get rid
of her. We're not done.

248
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,073
We have to confirm the diagnosis before
we send her home to die of something else.

249
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,747
Oh, yes. The power tastes
so sweet. You just can't resist.

250
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,756
You're like a diabetic
at the ice cream counter.

251
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,657
You wanna say no, but you
need that chocolaty goodness.

252
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,161
Yeah, well, I'm still
signing the charts.

253
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,597
So until tomorrow, you're
not allowed to kill anyone.

254
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,962
Wuss.

255
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,335
We've asked her three
times if she's on any meds.

256
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,168
So we don't ask her.

257
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,173
Candy striper.

258
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,423
So, you like dogs?

259
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,865
That's not a dog.

260
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,939
Smart kid.

261
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,368
Are you always
such a good little girl,

262
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,471
or does Mommy sometimes say you're
the reason she needs a double martini?

263
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,245
Who are you? Over here,
kiddo. I'm talking to you. Focus.

264
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,578
Must be because
you're off your meds.

265
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,815
Who are you?

266
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,447
Doctor and candy striper.

267
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,718
She's not on any medication.

268
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,157
Well, that's strange.

269
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,890
'Cause this bottle has her name on it.
And I think these are medical pills inside.

270
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,932
What's he talking about?

271
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,567
The doctor prescribed Stella...

272
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:11,996
A few months ago.

273
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,473
I never told you about it,
because I never gave her any.

274
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,304
That's funny, 'cause
the bottle's almost empty.

275
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,041
You missed a couple
of days. Take five.

276
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,777
Stop. Why? Unless
they're not hers.

277
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,395
You need some water, sweetie?

278
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,047
I'm not taking Ritalin.

279
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,988
Come on. All the
cool moms are doing it.

280
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,323
And tox screen
says you're cool, too.

281
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,329
You were on drugs
while taking care of Stella?

282
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,331
I'm sorry, Ted.

283
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,247
It's a cafeteria menu.

284
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,342
It should take a couple
hours to process her.

285
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,252
Then you can take her
home and divorce her.

286
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,161
Working late?

287
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,097
Or are you just avoiding Mark?

288
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,801
It was one kiss, Greg.

289
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,868
So far. I'm planning
on keeping a chart.

290
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,376
I'm moving back to
Short Hills. I think it's time.

291
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,277
You're leaving?

292
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,479
It was never meant to be permanent,
and now that Mark's getting better...

293
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,386
Yeah, much better.

294
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,519
Except for the
whole walking thing.

295
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,787
He needs to get back to work.

296
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,023
Right.

297
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,628
Saving the next generation from
making bad choices about acne cream.

298
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,136
You're running away because
the kiss meant something.

299
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,669
I'm not running
away. I'm going home.

300
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,072
With Mark.

301
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,776
I love Mark.

302
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,341
You love me more.

303
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,046
I don't want you to leave.

304
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,671
Are we okay?

305
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,273
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,900
Let's just get you home.

307
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,775
That's a good idea.

308
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,156
Mommy! Hey!

309
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,987
Call a code! What's
wrong, Mommy?

310
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,651
What's going on?

311
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,333
This better be important.

312
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,199
You've gotta come
back in. No, I don't.

313
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,204
Margo's stable,
but... <i>Oh, my God.</i>

314
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,864
Well, I'll be right there.

315
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,568
She had a stroke.

316
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,939
Perfect.

317
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,984
Gotta go back to work.

318
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,719
Right now?

319
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,084
Well...

320
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,691
Patient's stable. Could
maybe wait a half-hour.

321
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,834
He should have been
here 20 minutes ago.

322
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,773
Doubt if he makes it at all.
I saw him leave with Stacy.

323
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,519
He was probably just
walking her to her car.

324
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,569
Oh, yeah. That
sounds like House.

325
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,410
He's not an idiot. He's not gonna
hook up with a married woman.

326
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,315
I hope he is getting some.
Maybe he'll mellow out.

327
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,690
What took you so
long? It's midnight.

328
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,127
Traffic. <i>Cinco de Mayo.</i>

329
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,188
You owe me $100.

330
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,864
You didn't take the test?

331
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,265
Fear trumps anal every time.

332
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,606
It's not a big deal. I had the
viral load and antibody test.

333
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,370
It's 99.9% that I
don't have HIV.

334
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:13,845
And if you have the test, and it's
negative, you gain a tenth of a point.

335
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,350
But if it's positive you
lose nearly 100, right?

336
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,650
No arrhythmia, so Ritalin
isn't the big problem.

337
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,288
Something else is going on.

338
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,790
Fine, let's play doctors.

339
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,860
I removed the clot
which caused the stroke.

340
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,438
Problem is, we don't
know where it came from.

341
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,057
Did ultrasounds of her
heart, arms and legs. All clear.

342
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,690
Could be a protein C deficiency.

343
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,735
Wouldn't explain the
movement disorder.

344
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,929
Nothing explains everything.

345
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,238
What if it's a crime syndicate?

346
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,971
Let's say Ritalin and the
fertility meds plotted a caper.

347
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,979
Ritalin takes care of
the psychosis, the flailing.

348
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,481
I still don't think Ritalin...

349
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,074
Fertility meds are
competitive by nature.

350
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,019
They had to do something bigger,
something really unexpected.

351
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,921
Fertility treatments have been
known to cause endometrial cancer.

352
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,222
Which could cause clots, which
could have caused her to stroke.

353
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,285
So ultrasound her
uterus this time.

354
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:08,027
See if there's something growing in there
that doesn't look adorable in a onesie.

355
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,934
Cameron. I love you.

356
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,070
You'll get your test
results tomorrow.

357
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,956
The prescription for
my heart condition.

358
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,093
A bit on the cheesy side.

359
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,190
I was trying for romantic.

360
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,700
Still fits.

361
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,504
Did you tell Mark?

362
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,711
I told him I had to work late.

363
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,584
You gonna tell him?

364
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,023
How am I gonna tell him?

365
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,925
Still working on that
phrasing. How about,

366
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,077
"You know all the stuff you were worried
about when we first came here, honey?

367
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,193
"You were right."

368
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,429
Pithy.

369
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,714
Everything's easy when you
don't care if you hurt anyone.

370
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,206
You already did
the hurting part.

371
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,074
He just doesn't know it yet. If
I never tell him, it'll never hurt.

372
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,183
I want not to love
Mark. I wanna hate you.

373
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,313
I want all of this to
be simple, but it's not.

374
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,086
You can either
have a life with me,

375
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,663
or you can have a life with him.

376
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,694
It can't be both.

377
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,206
It's not easy, but it is simple.

378
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,116
No endometrial
thickening. No masses.

379
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,249
No cancer.

380
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,556
She's on fertility treatments.
She had a blood clot. It's there.

381
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,723
Millions of women are on fertility
treatments and they don't get cancer.

382
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,663
Right. They get babies.

383
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,725
She had a blood
clot and a stroke.

384
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,521
She'll get another one and probably
die, if we don't find that tumor.

385
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,937
Do an endometrial biopsy.

386
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,909
Biopsy's painful and unnecessary.
We just did an ultrasound.

387
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,440
What?

388
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:38,482
If you have a personal
issue that's interfering with...

389
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,122
What are we waiting for?

390
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,255
Your four weeks just expired.
Your reign of terror is over.

391
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,023
Mine has just begun.

392
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,760
Now go stick a needle up her
hoo-hoo and find that cancer.

393
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,363
"Hoo-hoo"?

394
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,632
He went to Hopkins.

395
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,338
<i>Pergasaurus has got 1,500 horsepower
blown and injected with alcohol.</i>

396
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,121
<i>Yeah, that baby really moves.</i>

397
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,793
Oh, yeah, and the transmission,

398
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:09,090
<i>two-speed Powerglide.
Suspension...</i>

399
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,015
What are you watching?

400
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,046
TV.

401
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,812
What are you doing here?

402
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,087
Ted's with my mom. He
asked the nurse to watch me.

403
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,285
What nurse?

404
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,556
She's not really watching me.

405
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,696
I got that.

406
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,166
Do you still have the balloons?

407
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,257
No.

408
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,764
Do you wanna play something?

409
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,100
Nope.

410
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,874
When can Mommy come home?

411
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,416
Don't know.

412
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,147
What's wrong with your foot?

413
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,279
War wound.

414
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,379
Does it hurt?

415
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,719
Every day.

416
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,351
Is that why you're so sad?

417
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,626
Oh, aren't you adorable?

418
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,698
I'm not sad, I'm
complicated. Chicks dig that.

419
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,032
One day you'll understand.

420
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:07,562
That's what my parents say when
they don't want me to know something.

421
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,868
They say that a lot?

422
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:12,469
Only when they're talking
about making babies and stuff.

423
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,877
When you catch them fighting?

424
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:15,947
They don't fight.

425
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,074
Not ever?

426
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,180
People who love
each other don't fight.

427
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,688
Right. Forgot that.

428
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,119
What floor was that nurse
on who was watching you?

429
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,285
Two.

430
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,160
Good talk.

431
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:38,270
At your age, the type of uterine cancer
that develops is not likely to metastasize.

432
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,396
It's very treatable.

433
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,440
Okay, hold still, Margo.

434
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,038
I'm feeling a little bit dizzy.

435
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,540
Oh, my God.

436
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,910
BP's dropping.

437
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,344
What's going on?

438
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,011
Get him out of here.

439
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,110
What's going on?

440
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,746
Heart rate's 98 and rising.

441
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,290
We've gotta find that bleed.

442
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,825
What'd you do, hit an artery?

443
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,329
With what? I hadn't even
started the procedure.

444
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,902
I need some advice.

445
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,199
Whatever it is, can it wait?

446
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,500
Yeah.

447
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,042
What was Greg like after I left?

448
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,174
An egomaniacal
narcissistic pain in the ass.

449
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,748
Same as before you left.

450
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,116
Do you think he's capable
of having a real relationship?

451
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,451
What happened in
Baltimore? Nothing.

452
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,148
Right. Maybe something.

453
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,384
Right.

454
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,394
Technically, most of the
something happened after Baltimore.

455
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,453
Oh, God, Stacy.

456
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,398
I don't know what to do.

457
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,900
Are you seriously thinking
about leaving Mark?

458
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,095
No. I don't know.

459
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,763
I can't.

460
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,467
And you want me
to tell you it's okay?

461
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,338
It wasn't all bad with Greg.
I was with him for a reason.

462
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,878
You left him for a reason.

463
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,642
I could swear I
remember him being fun.

464
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,449
Sorry for the scare.

465
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,079
Just tell me she's okay.

466
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:06,717
Ultrasound showed the bleed
was coming from her liver.

467
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,523
It's rare, but the blood
got into her fallopian tubes.

468
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:13,191
In a way, it was lucky. Let us know
we were looking in the wrong place.

469
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,631
The tumor's in her liver.

470
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,430
Is it cancer?

471
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,896
We're running some more tests.

472
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,223
There it is.

473
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,522
It's a liver tumor.

474
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,245
Well, if it's malignant,
at least she's

475
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,797
only gonna leave one
child without a mother.

476
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,101
Do a biopsy.

477
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,295
We can't. It's vascular.

478
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,039
House.

479
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,579
What? I'm here about Stacy.

480
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,176
What about her?

481
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,384
I think I'm losing her.

482
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,182
Your wife, your problem.

483
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,050
She won't talk to me.

484
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,687
So what? You gonna talk to
me instead? Talk to your shrink.

485
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,163
She keeps saying
everything's fine.

486
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,063
Find a bar. Talk to a stranger.

487
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,069
You're the only one
who's been through this.

488
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,568
I'm shutting her out.

489
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,099
I'm saying things and then
hating myself for saying them.

490
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,872
How did you get past that?

491
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,244
Didn't.

492
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,749
Can you please be a human
being for one minute and talk to me?

493
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,922
Sorry. Gotta go. People dying.

494
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,556
You're not gonna outrun me.

495
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,063
House!

496
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,570
You're not ready for this.

497
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,317
I've seen the way you and
Stacy talk to each other.

498
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,622
You're an idiot.

499
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,159
You probably just set your
rehab back three months.

500
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,354
Let go. Get off of me!

501
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,509
Liver tumor doesn't make sense.

502
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,844
You saying the CT was wrong?

503
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:47,579
I'm saying the symptoms don't add
up. A plus B does not equal liver tumor.

504
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,785
We gotta solve for X.

505
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,892
We gotta look
at this differently.

506
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,519
What do we know about her?

507
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,723
The side effects of
the Ritalin caused the...

508
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,529
No. We've examined the file up
and down. Come on, give me that.

509
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:06,001
Why do you people always
overlook the human element?

510
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,166
What do we know
about her? Margo...

511
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,578
Dalton. The woman.

512
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,214
She's a people-pleaser. She
doesn't like to let people down.

513
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,750
Never fights with her husband.

514
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,219
She turned to drugs instead of
asking for help to manage her life.

515
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,381
So if she can't manage now,

516
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,755
why does she want another kid?

517
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,227
Foreman, I need your help here.

518
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,328
You wanna pull a bank
job, would you go it alone?

519
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,101
If you gonna rob a home, sure,
that's a one or two man crew.

520
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,576
But a bank, you need a
lookout, a getaway driver.

521
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,544
I'm not saying anything until
the metaphor plays itself out.

522
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,480
So here's the caper.

523
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,610
Fertility meds
create a distraction.

524
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,049
Mommy had three refills on
Ritalin in the last three weeks.

525
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,024
That team goes
straight for the top floor.

526
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:04,723
No trouble taking out communications, but
they need the specialist, a safecracker.

527
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,563
All he does is stroke,
blood clot, liver tumor.

528
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,335
Foreman was right. This
badass even does flailing.

529
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,833
Come on.

530
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,741
There's only one guy I know
who does that kind of work.

531
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,608
Birth control pills?

532
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,789
While the surgeons are
cutting out a chunk of your liver,

533
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,690
should I have them
do a hysterectomy, too?

534
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,490
A hysterectomy?

535
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,493
I'm trying to get pregnant.

536
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,624
You don't have to lie to
me. We're not married.

537
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,191
You're Supermom.

538
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,429
You can do anything.

539
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,996
You work seven days a week,
you volunteer, you raise a kid.

540
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:51,744
Yet you still somehow find the
time to lie to hubby number two

541
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,043
that you really, really wanna give him a
child with his chin and pretty brown eyes.

542
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,582
What makes you
think that I would...

543
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,742
Because it fits.

544
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:02,481
Birth control pills caused
a hepatocellular adenoma.

545
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,619
Explains all your symptoms that
aren't explained by your other lies.

546
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,327
That's it?

547
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,493
Also...

548
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,193
I'll have the tuna on rye.

549
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,331
Would you like to
leave my room now?

550
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,066
Your tumor is benign.

551
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,840
Stop taking the pill, and
it will go away on its own.

552
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,347
I'm canceling the surgery.

553
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,774
What are you gonna
tell my husband?

554
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,081
That I'm canceling the surgery.

555
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,177
You can do the explaining.

556
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,882
It's tricky, huh?

557
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,753
It's one thing to say
you can't have a baby.

558
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,385
It's another to say
you don't want one.

559
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,090
Personally, I'd make
up some other lie.

560
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,526
Could...

561
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,592
Could I die on the table?

562
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,133
Could you die if
you tell him the truth?

563
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,174
I need this surgery.

564
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,311
I'm not on the pill.

565
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,476
You can't cancel the surgery.

566
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,386
If she goes off the pill, the
tumor goes away on its own.

567
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,583
You have no proof the
birth control pills caused this.

568
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,101
You have no proof
she's even taking them.

569
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,526
If we do the surgery maybe
we'll kill her on the table.

570
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,359
Then I can prove I'm
right at the autopsy.

571
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,026
Or we can forget the surgery,
let the tumor grow, and kill her.

572
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,265
Why don't you take it up with Stacy,
see which option minimizes your risk?

573
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,308
Here's what I think she's
gonna say, "Oh, I love Greg.

574
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,208
"But if you go against the patient's
wishes, you're calling her a liar.

575
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,473
"And if something goes
wrong, I end up in court

576
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,914
"having to defend the big mean
doctor, albeit with dreamy eyes,

577
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,179
"who wouldn't believe
the nice suburban mom.

578
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:44,053
"And even though his cane makes
me melt, do the damn surgery."

579
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,751
Shocking.

580
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,256
It's benign.

581
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,256
People do crazy things for love.

582
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:27,265
No, crazy is hanging out in the
park all day talking to pigeons.

583
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,595
Margo knows what she's doing.

584
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,432
She gave up half her
liver to save her marriage.

585
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:37,135
No, she surgically removed her
fingerprints to cover her pathetic lie.

586
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,708
It's twisted and manipulative.
I get that. But it's also

587
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,347
romantic.

588
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,486
I'm barely willing to put
the seat down after I pee.

589
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,918
Do we need to talk?

590
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,584
Nope. I'm fine.

591
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,598
So the surgeon got the
whole tumor, and it was benign.

592
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,728
That's good, right?

593
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:06,863
Yeah, benign is good.

594
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,375
How could a benign tumor
have caused all the symptoms?

595
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,337
We believe all your wife's
symptoms will go away now.

596
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,747
Oh, thank God.

597
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,176
Look, I'm gonna pick up Stella.

598
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,120
I'll call you after I
get the babysitter.

599
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,387
Dr. Foreman,

600
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,692
you can help me.

601
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,963
You could tell my husband that

602
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,637
because of all this,

603
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,210
I can't take any more
fertility treatments.

604
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,377
Confidentiality rules stop me
from telling your husband the truth.

605
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,113
But my obligation
to lie ends there.

606
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,727
Are there...

607
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,326
Is there a birth control method,
something that won't make me sick?

608
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,366
Margo, you're gonna
have risks with everything,

609
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,202
especially if you're not
telling your fertility doctor.

610
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:19,404
If you keep doing this, it's gonna
kill your marriage and kill you.

611
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,737
You don't know.

612
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,207
In a few years,

613
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,909
we'll give up.

614
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,522
Stop trying to get pregnant.

615
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,753
We'll hug, cry.

616
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,330
Eventually Ted will stop thinking about
it, and he'll appreciate Stella even more.

617
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,994
And we'll live happily
together for the next 50 years.

618
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,750
Something you need to see.

619
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,663
Knowing is always
better than not knowing.

620
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,713
It's a referral request.

621
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:30,976
Right.

622
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,884
The HIV thing came in earlier.

623
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,886
You're fine.

624
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,656
You won't read your
mail, but you'll open mine?

625
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,592
It said "confidential,"
and I wanted to know.

626
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:47,063
The most important letter of
my life, and you're still an ass.

627
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,196
Comforting, isn't it?

628
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,361
Hey.

629
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,731
Hi.

630
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,478
I'm gonna talk to Mark tonight,
and I'm gonna stay here with you.

631
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,290
Don't do it.

632
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,259
This isn't funny, Greg.

633
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,523
I know.

634
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,795
You

635
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,769
spent all these
months chasing me.

636
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,743
Now I'm here and you start
running? What the hell changed?

637
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,674
Nothing.

638
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,573
Nothing changes.

639
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,811
I'm not gonna change.

640
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,512
Who asked you to?

641
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,285
Mark is willing to
do whatever it takes.

642
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,187
I'm not.

643
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,492
Never was.

644
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:28,122
Now you're introspective?
Weren't so analytical the other night.

645
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,234
You were happy with
Mark. You'll be happy again.

646
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,498
Shut up about Mark. What
the hell is wrong with you?

647
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,301
I can't make you happy!

648
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,466
What?

649
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,569
How do you think
this is gonna end?

650
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,774
We'll be happy, for what? A
few weeks? A few months?

651
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,515
And then I'll...

652
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,422
I'll say something
insensitive or I'll

653
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,126
start ignoring you.
And at first it'll be okay.

654
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,222
It's just House being
House. And then,

655
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,927
at some point, you will
need something more.

656
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:08,469
You'll need someone who
can give you something I can't.

657
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,942
You know I'm right.
I've been there before.

658
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:15,946
Oh.

659
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,117
It doesn't have to be.

660
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,551
It does.

661
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:27,987
It does.

662
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,459
I don't wanna go there again.

663
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,600
I'm sorry, Stacy.

664
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,794
$50 says they're
divorced in a year.

665
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,267
Six months, tops.

666
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:14,431
I'll take that bet. It's
the perfect marriage.

667
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:18,475
There's nothing to fight over if
you never talk about anything.

668
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,506
What did you tell her?

669
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,612
I told her she's
better off without me.

670
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,980
That's probably true.

671
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,552
You're an idiot.

672
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,725
You don't think she'd
be better off without you.

673
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,891
Right. I sent her off on a whim.

674
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:17,902
You have no idea
why you sent her off!

675
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,905
Don't do this. This
was no great sacrifice!

676
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,407
You sent her away because
you've got to be miserable!

677
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,036
This kind of psycho-crap help get
your patients through the long nights?

678
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,477
Or is it just for you?

679
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,415
Tough love make you feel good?
Helping people feel their pain?

680
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,714
You don't like yourself.

681
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,290
But you do admire yourself.

682
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,522
It's all you've got,
so you cling to it.

683
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,930
You're so afraid if you change,
you'll lose what makes you special.

684
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:57,799
Being miserable doesn't make
you better than anybody else, House.

685
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,170
It just makes you miserable.
