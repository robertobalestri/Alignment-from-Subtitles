1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,628
Give me my next change.

2
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,740
I think I'm gonna puke.

3
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,140
Not on this dress. I'm serious.

4
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,940
Kate Moss was doing this at
13. You have two years on her.

5
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,710
Yeah, that's what I
like to see. You got this.

6
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,151
The next show, you're bride.

7
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,251
Did Austin just offer you bride?

8
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,192
It wasn't a real offer, Dad.
He was just being nice.

9
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,793
These shoes are gonna
be impossible to walk in.

10
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,764
You've done this 100
times before, all right?

11
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,376
The runway's just a
little bit longer here.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,311
One of the girls said
Madonna's in the front row.

13
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,965
Sweetie, hey, come on. Are
you gonna be able to do this?

14
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,871
All right, come here.

15
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,346
Here, hold this.

16
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,084
The doctor gave me
these for anxiety, all right?

17
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,680
It'll calm you down.
Here. Come on, it's okay.

18
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,083
Where's Alex?

19
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,430
Alex, you're up!

20
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,626
Go! Go! Go! Go! Knock them out!

21
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,937
Are you okay?

22
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,775
Alex!

23
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,368
How'd you get here?

24
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,306
By osmosis. No helmet?

25
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,611
Didn't seem like riding weather.

26
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,674
And the fact that you can barely
stand upright had nothing to do with it?

27
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,946
Infarctions hurt. House.

28
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,317
It's what they do.

29
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,747
Worsening pain could
actually be a good thing.

30
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,725
It means the nerves
might be regenerating.

31
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,353
It could be good, it could be
bad. Thanks for the differential.

32
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,862
Any other options?

33
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,798
Have you ever considered a
career as a motivational speaker?

34
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,079
Why don't you check out some
rehab? I did the rehab thing.

35
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,148
One session, and you
didn't even finish that session.

36
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,641
The guy wanted me to
"visualize the healing".

37
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,643
I could do that at home. At
least let me get you an MRI.

38
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,805
It's a very simple equation:
more pain, more pills.

39
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,280
Teenage supermodel.

40
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:20,584
Presented with double vision,
sudden aggressive behavior, cataplexy.

41
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,486
You had me at
"teenage supermodel".

42
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,988
You okay? Mmm-hmm.

43
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,527
Wow.

44
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,435
You should be a model.

45
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,773
Are you really 15? Who are you?

46
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,708
I'll be the one saving her life
today, assuming she's dying.

47
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,745
Who are you? He's my father.

48
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,180
Any idea what's wrong with her?

49
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,877
Well, from the looks
of it, not a single thing.

50
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,616
I probably should stop
staring and check out the file.

51
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,324
So what set off the brawl?
She stand in your light?

52
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,260
I didn't even know her. I
didn't know what happened.

53
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,026
Look, I know some models
are notorious for hissy fits,

54
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,260
but Alex... I've never
even seen her get angry.

55
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,304
Even when she was a kid... I'm
sure she was delightful in her youth.

56
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,531
Then you passed out.

57
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,131
I was passed out, but I wasn't.

58
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,473
I knew what was going on,
but I couldn't move or talk.

59
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,881
Yeah, it sounds like a medical
thing. It's called "cataplexy".

60
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,147
Catfight and cataplexy
on the catwalk.

61
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,815
Cool. How much
were you drinking?

62
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,247
She only had one
sip of champagne.

63
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,091
Forget it. I'll find out
from the tox screen.

64
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,685
All right, look, I
gave her a Valium.

65
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,754
Do you think that's
what did this? No.

66
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,694
How long have
you had the sweats?

67
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,436
A couple of days.
Any other complaints?

68
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,032
My stomach's been bothering me
and I've been feeling a little nauseous.

69
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,701
Okay, here's how this works.

70
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,211
My lackeys will be by
shortly to draw some blood,

71
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,714
collect some urine,
any other fluids you got.

72
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,775
I'll do some other doctorly
stuff, and we'll be in touch.

73
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,650
Since when do you
voluntarily go see patients?

74
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,219
Have you seen her? She's 15.

75
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,162
There's something about
her, something in her eyes,

76
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,395
kind of a maturity. Yeah,
yeah, she's an old soul.

77
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,369
This is creepy, even for you.

78
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,929
She's a fashion model,
on the cover of magazines.

79
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,041
We hold her up
as the sexual ideal.

80
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,053
The law says we can't touch
her for three more years.

81
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,545
How hypocritical is that?

82
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,413
Did the history reveal anything,
oh, I don't know, medically relevant?

83
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,144
History, right.

84
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,695
I knew I was
forgetting something.

85
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,121
You should do one of those while
you're running the labs and the tox screen.

86
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,087
The labs show Valium
and heroin in her urine.

87
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,100
A supermodel on smack. Shocker.

88
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,700
Oh, Alex, I expected
so much more from you.

89
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,806
Heroin chic is
so five years ago.

90
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,139
Okay, let's start crossing
out withdrawal symptoms.

91
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,905
A positive test means
she tried it once.

92
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,210
It doesn't mean she's
an addict. She's only 15.

93
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,273
There's no age limit
on addiction. He's right.

94
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,409
She's never menstruated.

95
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,195
Sounds like a symptom
of drug addiction to me.

96
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,120
Or bulimia. Or her age.

97
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,132
Some girls don't start
till their mid-to-late teens.

98
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,285
Evidence to the
contrary, the rounded hips.

99
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,590
The perfectly-sculpted,
bountiful breasts.

100
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,562
Implants. I've seen
some of her photos.

101
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,594
They've grown dramatically
since last summer.

102
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,797
Symptomatic of turning 14.

103
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,740
Two clinic hours says that those
"love apples" are handcrafted by God.

104
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,703
I thought you didn't
believe in God. I do now.

105
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,872
You're on.

106
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,542
Could we talk about her
health instead of her breasts?

107
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,879
It could be relevant.

108
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,216
Come on, Cameron, there's
nothing to be ashamed of.

109
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,754
Many women develop breasts.

110
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,761
No, I'm fine.

111
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,178
Even if she is an addict,
a lot of her symptoms,

112
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,102
the cataplexy, the violence,
it could be neurological.

113
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,447
If we chalk this up
to drugs, we could be

114
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,702
releasing her with Juvenile
MS or Parkinson's...

115
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,606
Detox her. FOREMAN: Fine.

116
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,440
We'll set her up on a program,
they'll wean her onto the methadone.

117
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,879
And in four weeks,
we'll know you're right.

118
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,415
Or, we'll know that
Cameron's right

119
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,680
and the pretty girl will do
Milan next fall in a wheelchair.

120
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,620
Put her in a coma, pump
her full of naltrexone.

121
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,486
Cut the four weeks to one night.

122
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,688
The lab reports show that your
daughter had heroin in her system.

123
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,956
Were you aware of her drug use?

124
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
No.

125
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,427
We think she's suffering
from withdrawal symptoms.

126
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,235
Detoxing generally
takes several weeks.

127
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,209
The danger is that if the drugs
are masking some other illness,

128
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,145
it could worsen before we've
weaned her off the heroin.

129
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,511
Well, how much worse?

130
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,050
We don't know because
we don't know what's wrong.

131
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,111
There is a rapid
detox procedure.

132
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,986
We flush her system
with an opioid antagonist.

133
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,991
It'll end her
addiction overnight.

134
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,655
The process is dangerous
because we have to induce a coma.

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,194
It also means that
if she ever relapses,

136
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,225
there's a good chance she'll overdose
because her body won't react to the drug.

137
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,563
So either way
I'm risking her life.

138
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,810
Do you have to tell
her how dangerous it is?

139
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,113
Is it dangerous?

140
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,325
There are certain risks.

141
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,222
We've gone over
them with your father.

142
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,261
And he's not worried?

143
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,231
He's your dad. He's
always gonna worry.

144
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,464
But he knows we're gonna
take good care of you.

145
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,870
Everything's starting
to hurt. My legs are...

146
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,706
Heroin withdrawal is an
extremely painful process.

147
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,679
But we're gonna put you to
sleep. You won't feel a thing.

148
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,282
You promise? I promise.

149
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,423
That was a pretty
stupid thing to do, huh?

150
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,082
Getting hooked on drugs?

151
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,320
Yeah, not the best
move you've ever made.

152
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,726
Just, I thought it would be fun.

153
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,764
You don't have to explain to us.

154
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,667
A lot of, a lot of the
other girls were...

155
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,897
When you wake up,
you'll feel a lot better.

156
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,838
Nurse! Nurse!

157
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,318
You son of a bitch!
You killed her!

158
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,522
She's not dead. She
had a heart attack.

159
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,226
She's stable now.
The anesthesia...

160
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,824
Get her out of that coma.

161
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,268
I don't think so. Stop this!

162
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,433
All right, I don't
consent anymore.

163
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,142
I want her to do the slow detox.

164
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,814
Did you ever get a paper cut? A
really nasty one, between the fingers?

165
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,843
Multiply that by about a billion

166
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,631
and you'll just barely approach
the kind of suffering she'll experience

167
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,214
if we wake her up now.

168
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,819
We're committed to this.

169
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,589
She's out till morning.
Go get a book.

170
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,478
I haven't slept in weeks,
because my teeth hurt.

171
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,077
The dentist couldn't
find any cavities.

172
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,446
And I'm getting these headaches.

173
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,509
Oh! Poor you.

174
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,290
I think I'm going crazy.

175
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,317
And my stomach, I roll out
of bed and I wanna puke.

176
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,321
I take it you're married?

177
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,765
You must be psychic.
You must be witty.

178
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,703
When's she due? How'd
you know she was...

179
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:28,902
Because I'm doing her.
You've got Couvade Syndrome.

180
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,878
It's just a fancy way of saying
you should stop whining.

181
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,744
Millions of women have got the
same thing. They're not bugging me.

182
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,943
You're suffering from
sympathetic pregnancy.

183
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,552
Gotta go. People dying.

184
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,247
Whole circle of life
thing. It's all in my head?

185
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,757
No, it's all in your hormones.

186
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,286
The good news is, no one's gonna
lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.

187
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,694
Shouldn't she be awake by now?

188
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,502
It's only been a half an hour
since we stopped the medicine.

189
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,118
Well, you said that's
how long it would take.

190
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,509
I said it would take
about a half an hour.

191
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,446
But couldn't this mean something
more... So far, it means nothing.

192
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,492
She had a heart attack.
She could have brain damage.

193
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,281
She could have something
more... She's opening her eyes.

194
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,545
Alex, you okay?

195
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,682
Can you hear me?

196
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,299
I got the cute doctor.

197
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,200
Do you feel any pain?

198
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,372
Good. Let us know
if anything changes.

199
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,907
If your stomach doesn't
feel right, anything.

200
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,276
Hey.

201
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,245
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

202
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,416
I let you down.

203
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,819
No, no. Not at all, sweetie,

204
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,500
I should have been more mature. I
should have handled the pressure.

205
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,890
Stop, stop.

206
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,456
We're gonna get you better,
all right? Nothing else matters.

207
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,828
Excuse me.

208
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,872
I've got you on what
we call a "banana bag".

209
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,631
Plenty of vitamins, nutrients...

210
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,539
I got the cute doctor.

211
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,277
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

212
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,644
I let you down. What's going on?

213
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,620
I should have been more mature. I
should have handled the pressure.

214
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,954
What's wrong with her?

215
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,855
Anterograde amnesia,
short term memory loss.

216
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,297
Evidence of a
hypoxic brain injury.

217
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,264
It might be the result of getting cut
off from the oxygen when she flatlined.

218
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,569
Probably the result of that rapid
detox you told us to push on her.

219
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,109
You gonna put that down?

220
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,946
Are you gonna sulk?

221
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,656
I'm not gonna indulge you.

222
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,282
The treatment for hypoxic
brain injuries consists of...

223
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,161
Cameron, Chase and the Dark One.

224
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,926
Foreman, right?

225
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,160
The patient flatlined
for like, 30 seconds.

226
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,600
You've got to be oxygen-deprived

227
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,346
for longer than that
to lose brain function.

228
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,306
We can't be sure how long
she was... Her brain's fine.

229
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,397
Memory loss.

230
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,119
You're saying that's not
a neurological symptom?

231
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,011
No, I'm saying what I'm
saying. Her brain's fine.

232
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,245
She's faking?

233
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,477
She's got posttraumatic
stress disorder.

234
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,084
We got models
fighting in Iraq now?

235
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,315
Show me a woman on
heroin who looks like that,

236
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,687
and I'll show you a woman
who's been sexually abused.

237
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,488
That's your proof?
That she's good looking.

238
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:39,191
He manages her career, travels
the world with her, at her side 24/7.

239
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,730
He's either a very good
dad or a very bad dad.

240
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,869
You saw that tuchus.

241
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,703
Would the fact that she's
your daughter really stop you?

242
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,712
Her brain is running away from reality
and when the drugs can't do it anymore,

243
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,371
it starts to shut down.

244
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,015
Your theory has the advantages
of being completely un-provable

245
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,315
and completely exculpating you.

246
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,752
When you guys are done
talking, do an MRI and an LP.

247
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,257
When her brain
checks out as normal,

248
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,158
then we'll know that daddy
really, really loves her.

249
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:14,826
Where's House?

250
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,860
He said he was in too much
pain to work. Who's covering?

251
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,304
He called 15 minutes
after his shift started.

252
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,036
It was too late to find
anybody. Exam Room One.

253
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,242
Hi. Where's Dr. House?

254
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,048
I wish I knew.
What's the problem?

255
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,753
It's personal.

256
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,591
And it's so personal he didn't
bother writing anything in your chart.

257
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,459
It's getting worse. What is?

258
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,624
It's personal.

259
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,659
Fine. You can wait. Doctor!

260
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,713
I tell you what.

261
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,941
I am going to give you
Dr. House's personal pager number.

262
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,955
Why would your mind
go to abuse so fast?

263
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,093
Because I had a funny
uncle. You were abused?

264
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,257
What? No. Why'd your
mind go to that so fast?

265
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,726
I just had a funny uncle.
Great stories, always filthy.

266
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,203
I don't know if it's
something with this case

267
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,435
or you got something personal
going on, the whole breakup thing?

268
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,998
It's personal. House.

269
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,544
Your pain is affecting
your decision-making.

270
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,949
You got a problem with a
call I make, question the call.

271
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,382
Don't make it personal.

272
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,818
Are you saying pain
can't affect your mood?

273
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,733
If I'm right about the pain, you're
gonna wanna rush everything,

274
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,385
which is what you're doing.

275
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,286
Don't.

276
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,764
Thank you.

277
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,031
Are you doing your
daughter? What?

278
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,074
We should probably talk privately,
huh? Come on, walk with me.

279
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,655
Come on. He's not!

280
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,715
I'm sure he's not.
She is a babe, though.

281
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,909
We're gonna need
you to keep still. I am.

282
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,710
What do you think that means?

283
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,282
It's either neurological
or psychological.

284
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,464
The only thing we know for sure is
it's gonna screw up the MRI results,

285
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,286
which is gonna make
House think he's right.

286
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,956
This is a waste of time.

287
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,357
Let's just get the LP.

288
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,726
I should take your head off.

289
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,502
Your glands are fine.
See, now, you're my patient.

290
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,769
You got doctor-patient
confidentiality. No worries.

291
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,876
So, what did you do to her?
Why would you possibly think...

292
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,140
Hard to imagine anyone
not wanting to nail her.

293
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,512
You son of... It's a compliment.

294
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,987
That heart-shaped ass, those
perfect, perky, all-natural breasts.

295
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,079
That is my daughter
you're talking about!

296
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,148
No, that's your daughter
you were talking about.

297
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,157
"She just instinctively
knows how to walk.

298
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,823
"Designers just love that
heart-shaped ass, those perfect, perky..."

299
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,890
I'm her manager. I
have to promote her.

300
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,868
Oh, that makes sense.

301
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,965
So you compartmentalize.

302
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,530
When you're dealing with
the press, you're her manager.

303
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,042
When you're helping with
homework, you're her dad.

304
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,342
When you're making sweet,
sweet love, you're her manager.

305
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,473
All right. Do you love her?

306
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,642
I have never touched
her. Do you love her?

307
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,895
What are you doing? Are you
trying to trap me into saying...

308
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,321
Do you love her enough to
admit that you slept with her?

309
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,624
Psychological conditions can manifest
themselves in physical problems.

310
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,292
Sometimes these can
be extreme enough to kill.

311
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,229
There are treatments, but
only if there is a diagnosis.

312
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,849
Are you going to admit that
you slept with your daughter

313
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,865
or are you just
gonna let her die?

314
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,346
One time.

315
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,227
PTSD.

316
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,468
Get her a psyche referral,
pack her bags. He did her.

317
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,507
Don't think so. Daddy thinks so.

318
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,444
He could be mistaken.
He said he was drunk.

319
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,070
Maybe it was some
other daughter.

320
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,676
Elevated proteins in her CSF.

321
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:02,587
You're wrong about PTSD and I was
wrong about the hypoxic brain injury.

322
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,251
Daddy didn't do this to
her. And neither did we.

323
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,996
We have to call Child
Protective Services.

324
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,802
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

325
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,900
Doesn't apply in abuse
cases. You know that.

326
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,502
We're mandated to
report sexual abuse.

327
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,208
Is it okay if I save her life first
or do you want to make sure

328
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,876
that daddy doesn't get
visitation rights to the gravesite?

329
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,949
Okay, elevated proteins in her CSF
could mean dozens of different things.

330
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,253
Viral encephalitis, CNSV,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

331
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,245
So we're just gonna leave a child
molester in the same room as his victim?

332
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,762
It's got windows.

333
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,665
Fine. Arrest him. Use
Cuddy's handcuffs.

334
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,647
If you're too distracted to deal with
this because your leg hurts, then...

335
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,105
Yeah, I'm distracted!

336
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm all hung up on this 15-year-old
patient who's cataplectic,

337
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,643
can't remember what she had for lunch
and is rapidly losing control of her body!

338
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,073
And I want her father here in
case he's got any more secrets

339
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,242
that I need to know about.

340
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,895
Now, if you're not too distracted,
go take out a piece of her brain,

341
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,512
stick it under a microscope.

342
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,423
Wilson! FOREMAN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

343
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,153
Do you really think we need
to jump straight to brain biopsy?

344
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,786
Nope. Let's continue playing

345
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,696
"Pin the diagnosis on the
supermodel" until she's dead.

346
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,900
I heard you killed your
supermodel. Only for a minute.

347
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,734
Just for my own clarity, how many
more patients do you have to kill

348
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,745
before you admit this leg
thing just might be a problem?

349
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:34,938
Three.

350
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,714
I need your help.

351
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,282
We're gonna do something
called a burr-hole biopsy.

352
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,621
We drill a small opening
in the back of your skull.

353
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,965
Doctor, maybe you and I
should talk about this first.

354
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,124
No.

355
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,829
I just think Alex doesn't need
to be overwhelmed right now.

356
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,865
I think she should have a say
in what happens to her body.

357
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,011
Now, we're gonna remove
a small piece of brain tissue.

358
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,847
Do you have to shave my hair?

359
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,850
Hair grows back.

360
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,416
I guess I won't
remember anyways.

361
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,155
There's a good chance the
amnesia is only temporary.

362
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,527
Okay.

363
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,993
Find a way to kick
up the contribution.

364
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,438
What did House do now?

365
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,210
<i>House, this is God.</i>

366
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,480
Look, I'm a little
busy right now.

367
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,355
I'm not supposed to
talk during these things.

368
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,052
Got time Thursday?

369
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,857
<i>Let me check. Oh,
I've got a plague.</i>

370
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,425
<i>What about Friday?</i>

371
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,297
You'll have to
check with Cameron.

372
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,933
<i>Oh, damn it!</i>

373
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,295
<i>She always wants to know
why bad things happen.</i>

374
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,363
<i>Like I'm gonna come up
with a new answer this time.</i>

375
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:43,667
House.

376
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,872
Quick, God, smite
the evil witch!

377
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,109
Are you sitting on evidence that your
patient was sexually abused by her father?

378
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,310
God, why have you forsaken me?

379
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,752
Don't worry. I've contacted
child services for you.

380
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,188
I let you get away with more
than anyone in this hospital.

381
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,123
Shielding a child
abuser isn't covered.

382
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,921
Cooperate with this
investigation or I'll fire you.

383
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,831
What do you think
House is gonna do to you?

384
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,099
No idea.

385
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,640
Well, you did the right thing.

386
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,639
If you hadn't gone to
Cuddy, I would have.

387
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,387
If this guy had known
we'd have to report him,

388
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,380
he'd never have
told House the truth.

389
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,410
She's a child, she
needs to be protected.

390
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,450
She dropped out of high
school to make millions of dollars.

391
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,797
Why does she
need more protection

392
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,620
than some crack whore
shivering in the clinic waiting room?

393
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,182
I think you're just
afraid to piss House off.

394
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,819
There's that, too.

395
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,526
MRI looks exactly the
same as it did two years ago.

396
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,496
The nerves don't seem
to be regenerating.

397
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,366
I figured as much.

398
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,564
Several different
researchers have proven

399
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,937
psychological pain can
manifest as physical pain.

400
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,653
You think I have a conversion
disorder? You want me to see a shrink?

401
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,613
Brilliant idea sending Stacy away.
It's really done wonders for you.

402
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,978
Listen, none of this has
anything to do with Stacy.

403
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,577
Right. Giant coincidence that you've gone
completely off the rails since she left.

404
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,383
Inducing migraines,
worsening leg pains.

405
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,957
Oh, do you miss Stacy, too?

406
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,302
Brain biopsy shows
no white matter disease.

407
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:27,046
Cameron, you gonna tell Cuddy, or
has she already got you wired for sound?

408
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,341
I had to do what I
thought was right.

409
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,716
So, white is out.
It just leaves gray.

410
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:39,053
Neuronal ceroid lipofucinosis,
Heller Syndrome...

411
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,650
Any one of the mitochondrial
encephalopathies.

412
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:42,786
Am I in trouble?

413
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,830
You had to do what
you thought was right.

414
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,099
They call it "gray area" because
you never really know what's there.

415
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,830
We can't test for
any of those things.

416
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,528
So I'm not in trouble?

417
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,800
You can torture
yourself all you want.

418
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:02,138
What if everything we're
seeing is just smoke signals?

419
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,643
Okay. Who's sending them? Tumor.

420
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,487
If she has cancer
anywhere in her body,

421
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,081
she could also have
Paraneoplastic Syndrome,

422
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,184
which could be causing
antibodies to attack her brain.

423
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,660
Antibodies are stupid that way.

424
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,698
Paraneoplastic Syndrome's
awfully rare in a 15-year-old.

425
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,232
15-year-olds who look
like that are awfully rare.

426
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,303
It would explain the aggressive
behavior, the cataplexy,

427
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,737
the memory loss, even
the twitching. It's perfect.

428
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,001
What if it's not?

429
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,271
We could waste a week
searching for a tumor

430
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:32,623
that we don't
even know is there.

431
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,408
Then let's make
sure it is there.

432
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,505
There's no test for
Paraneoplastic Syndrome.

433
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,641
Sure there is.

434
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,582
The "squeeze the tube" test.

435
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,418
What did the biopsy tell
you? It wasn't definitive.

436
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,490
But the twitching should
stop right about now.

437
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,992
Oh, my God.

438
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,899
Could have just
been a coincidence.

439
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,629
Twitching does tend to
stop and start. Let's be sure.

440
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,881
The IVIG vacuums her blood, neutralizes
the stuff that's making her twitch.

441
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,910
It's actually kind of cool.

442
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,049
I wonder if I could make
you dance? Enough.

443
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,823
This is unbelievable.
You did it. You fixed her.

444
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:24,895
No.

445
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,923
All I did was prove
that she has cancer.

446
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,672
I need a favor.

447
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,507
I'm not in a giving mood.

448
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,311
It'll help us both.

449
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,309
I need a shot of
morphine in my spine.

450
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,153
If your leg hurts,
take your Vicodin.

451
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,046
It's not enough.

452
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,554
Get a syringe.

453
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,121
Morphine is
extreme, even for you.

454
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:01,326
Yeah. Write that on the insert.
Get one of your lackeys to do it.

455
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,454
I don't want them knowing...

456
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,262
That you're on the road
to becoming a junkie?

457
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,704
That I'm in this much pain.

458
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,037
I don't want them
questioning my judgment.

459
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,205
I can't ask Wilson, because
he figures it's all in my head.

460
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,372
Well, I agree with
him. I'm going home.

461
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,647
What about this?
What are you doing?

462
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,721
Is this in my head?

463
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,788
Because I could swear I
remember a thigh muscle being here.

464
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,867
I'll get a syringe.

465
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,615
It's gotta be cancer.
It's not cancer.

466
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,753
You seem to be back to
your old miserable self.

467
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,427
So I just randomly predicted
she'd respond to IVIG?

468
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,995
Her twitches are gone,
her memory's getting better.

469
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,162
What did you take?

470
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,468
The increased pain
was psychological.

471
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,007
No drug's gonna help.

472
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,067
If you think it will help, the drugs
will help. The power of the mind.

473
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,203
You're right.

474
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,747
The more I talk to you, the
more the pain floods back.

475
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,910
I knew the twins were
real. Chase owes me.

476
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,118
Did you check the
pancreas? Oh, come on.

477
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,589
You're just making up
organs now, aren't you?

478
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,317
We checked the pancreas.

479
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,994
Obviously, you've taken
something. Did you check the bones?

480
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,774
There are a lot
of bones, I think.

481
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,664
And none of them have cancer.

482
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,565
Ovaries? There's no mass.

483
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,967
If anything, they're undersized.

484
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,267
No leukemia, no Hodgkin's,
we checked everything.

485
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,864
Unless they've invented a
new organ, it's not cancer.

486
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,908
Differential diagnosis.
It's gotta be cancer.

487
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,748
There's gotta be
something we missed.

488
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,414
You've got to learn
to let go, Foreman.

489
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,152
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

490
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,716
It might just still be PTSD.

491
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,318
Just PTSD?

492
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,126
Yeah, Daddy's diddling
her. Nothing to worry about.

493
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,689
Okay, let me rephrase.

494
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,429
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

495
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,765
Oh, my God!

496
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,099
It might be PTSD!

497
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,073
If it was PTSD, the twitching
wouldn't have magically disappeared

498
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,973
when we started the IVIG.

499
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,771
Wrong.

500
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,109
What it wouldn't have done
was medically disappear.

501
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,248
Nothing to stop it from
magically disappearing.

502
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,049
She was watching me
start and stop the medicine.

503
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,986
You think she's faking?

504
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,523
Not consciously.

505
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,151
But if her subconscious is
trying to get away from it all,

506
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,423
cancer's gotta be a
lovely vacation spot.

507
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,281
Tell her you've got
to give her a fresh IV.

508
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:23,266
Don't tell her you're
starting her on saline.

509
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,133
See if the twitching comes back.

510
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,241
How long has the social
worker been in there?

511
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,008
Just went in. She was
in with the dad before.

512
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:39,218
You switched the girl's IV?
About a half an hour ago.

513
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,414
When's she gonna
start twitching?

514
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,318
If she's gonna start twitching.

515
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,686
Another few minutes.

516
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,921
We've got to wait for the
remaining IVIG to clear her system.

517
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,023
That was quick.
What's gonna happen?

518
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,759
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

519
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,846
The father had sex... Do you
have any medical evidence of that?

520
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,216
He admitted... He denies the
conversation ever took place.

521
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,430
But she... She denies it, too.

522
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,974
I'm sure you meant well.

523
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,118
You have to tell her the truth.

524
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,519
Nothing happened.

525
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,252
You don't have to be afraid
of him. They can protect you.

526
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,123
From what? Things are fine.

527
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,459
You think things
are fine. They're not.

528
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,694
He's my dad. He's abusing you.

529
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,266
He's not a bad person.

530
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,306
I seduced him.

531
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:39,502
You're the child.
He's the adult.

532
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,447
He has the responsibility...
I got him drunk.

533
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,074
I had to get him drunk.

534
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,986
I wanted to have sex with him.

535
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,948
You're sexually
attracted to your father?

536
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,315
No.

537
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,724
But by sleeping with him, now
he lets me do whatever I want.

538
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,968
I also slept with my photographer,
my financial manager and my tutor.

539
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,199
If I hadn't, I'd be getting C's

540
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,205
and posing for newspaper
ads back in Detroit.

541
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,840
Come on, we all
do it. No, we don't.

542
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,950
After your father slept with
you, you were traumatized.

543
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,286
My dad was last.

544
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,955
You've never taken a run
at your boss or professor

545
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,630
or somebody else you needed?

546
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,661
You're 15. You're smart.

547
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,862
You don't have... I
am not that smart.

548
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,476
I am that beautiful.

549
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,011
What's wrong with me?

550
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,224
Oh! George, get
your butt over here!

551
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,289
Help me. How'd you
get my pager number?

552
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,493
Please!

553
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,628
The problem is, if I
give you an epidural,

554
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,938
you won't be able to feel
when to push. You're not funny.

555
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,134
I'm pretty sure I am.

556
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,268
You just can't appreciate
it because you're in pain.

557
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,337
George, if you don't get
off your ass and help me...

558
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,349
Oh, shut up!

559
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,685
You've got yourself the
perfect man. A woman.

560
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,921
He's got more estrogen
coursing through his veins than...

561
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,955
Who did her vaginal exam? I did.

562
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,432
Did she have hair?
What are you getting at?

563
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,560
Right now I'm getting at whether
or not she had hair down there.

564
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,198
Not much. She's manipulative,
yet completely docile.

565
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,507
Everybody tells us that outburst
on the catwalk was out of character.

566
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,274
She's never had a period.

567
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,712
You're thinking
this is hormonal?

568
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,080
I'm thinking she's
the ultimate woman.

569
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,618
I need to schedule an MRI.

570
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,852
<i>The twitching stopped.</i>

571
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,123
Because we changed your
medicine back to the real stuff.

572
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,425
Stop talking.

573
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,363
You gave me fake medicine?

574
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:19,493
That's what I said, in the vain hope that
you wouldn't feel the need to also say it.

575
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,062
Stop talking.

576
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,102
Wilson already did an ultrasound.
He said her ovaries were undersized.

577
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,908
The ultrasound would be the way to
go if you were looking for ovarian cancer.

578
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,846
What are we looking for?

579
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,647
That.

580
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,055
Oh, my God.

581
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,690
It looks like a
tumor, doesn't it?

582
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,287
But those are... Yep.

583
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,443
We found a tumor.

584
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,182
She has cancer?

585
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,817
Technically, no.
So it's not cancer?

586
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,920
No, it's cancer,
but "he" has cancer

587
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,897
on "his" left testicle.

588
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,529
I don't have testicles.
She's not a guy.

589
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,165
His DNA says you're wrong.

590
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,369
Frogs and snails
and puppy dog tails.

591
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:37,641
You've got male
pseudohermaphroditism.

592
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,410
You see, we all
start out as girls

593
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,421
and then we're differentiated,
based on our genes.

594
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,222
<i>The ovaries develop
into testes and drop.</i>

595
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,059
<i>But in about one in every
150,000 pregnancies,</i>

596
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,564
<i>the fetus with an XY chromosome</i>

597
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,157
a boy, develops
into something else,

598
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,999
like you.

599
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,998
Your testes never descended,
because you're immune to testosterone.

600
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,435
You're pure estrogen.

601
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,643
Which is why you have
heightened female characteristics,

602
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,012
clear skin, great breasts.

603
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,654
The ultimate woman is a man.

604
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,259
Nature's cruel, huh?

605
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:26,026
This is obviously a
joke. This is impossible.

606
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,635
No. A joke would be
me calling you a homo.

607
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,235
You see the difference?

608
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,800
I'll schedule him for surgery.

609
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:43,174
No! You're wrong!
I'm a girl! Look at me!

610
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,449
How could you
say I'm not a girl?

611
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,248
You see, they're all
looking at me, I'm beautiful!

612
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,185
That anger. It's just
the cancer talking.

613
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:02,129
Put your clothes back on.
We're gonna cut your balls off.

614
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,429
Then you'll be fine.

615
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,295
How's the patient? Post-op.

616
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:44,772
They sent him/her
up for a psyche visit.

617
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,572
Calling her a "him/her"
isn't really helping.

618
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,640
The good news is, I don't think Dad's
gonna be sleeping with him/her again.

619
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,310
You see, now it's gross.

620
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,816
I need another shot.

621
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,728
When did the pain
start coming back?

622
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,195
A few hours ago.

623
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,158
About an hour after
you solved the case?

624
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:13,494
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed,
I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.

625
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,270
Same dosage?

626
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,373
If you'd be more comfortable,

627
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,242
I might be able to deal with
a few less cc's of morphine.

628
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,946
It wasn't morphine.

629
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,081
What did you give me?
I told you I wanted...

630
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,484
It was saline.

631
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,416
I gave you a placebo.
