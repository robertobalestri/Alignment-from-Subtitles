1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,511
It's almost 11:00. She needs
a lot of sleep these days.

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,914
Please, Mrs. Bardach, I
haven't seen her for a week.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,954
I'll see how she's
feeling. Thank you.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,785
You know what to do.

5
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,628
All done? Yeah.

6
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,575
I scrubbed for 45 seconds,

7
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:45,443
did the nails, all the way down
to the elbows, the whole deal.

8
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,174
Are you sick? No. No, no.

9
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,308
Cough? No.

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,761
Sore throat? No,
no. I just, I just...

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,244
Sometimes I sneeze when I
look at lights. I always have.

12
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:59,521
I'm sorry, you better... I would
never get her sick. Please.

13
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,862
A mask.

14
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,927
Got me by the
bouncer. She's crazy.

15
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,200
She's let me out like six
times in the last two months.

16
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,868
Every time's just to go to
the hospital. I'm a prisoner.

17
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,275
It's okay.

18
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,776
It's ugly. No.

19
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,385
I wasn't looking at
the scar anyways.

20
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,361
Take off your mask.

21
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,433
If your mom comes
in here, she...

22
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,030
Hey. Give me a
kiss or I'll kill you.

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,882
Your skin... Are you okay?

24
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,659
Melinda, can you...

25
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,098
What's wrong? What's
wrong? Can you breathe?

26
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,133
What's wrong? What's
wrong? Is it your heart?

27
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,639
What's wrong? Mrs. Bardach!

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,757
Melinda, Melinda, I don't
know how to use this.

29
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,307
I've never used
one of these before.

30
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,099
What did you do to her?

31
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,631
Cuddy called.

32
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,361
I know. I saw the caller ID.

33
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,869
Young girl, anaphylactic shock.

34
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,565
You answered?

35
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,437
Turns out, that's
what stops the ringing.

36
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,037
It's a weird case.

37
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,638
I thought you did the dishes
last night? It was your day.

38
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,914
I did. Those are
new. Midnight snack.

39
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,221
For a midnight snack,
you made a pot roast,

40
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,892
the same pot roast
I made last night.

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,052
Yeah.

42
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,258
Actually, it was after midnight.
Today's your day, right?

43
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,994
You want me out
of here. I get it.

44
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,397
No, it's fine if you stay.
The place I was gonna move,

45
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,482
the guy never called.
Otherwise I'd already be there.

46
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,600
I said it's fine if
you stay. Yeah.

47
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,154
That's why you're
making me miserable.

48
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,737
Maybe I just wanna make sure
you do your fair share around here.

49
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,078
That... What's weird about it?

50
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,782
The girl with the allergies.

51
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,946
Yeah.

52
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,986
She's immunocompromised.
What are you doing?

53
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,754
What? You asked me... You
knew that I was interested.

54
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,626
That gives you a
valuable bargaining chip.

55
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,632
You could've had me
doing dishes for a week.

56
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,328
Okay.

57
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,709
The allergic reaction happened
while she was in a clean room.

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,798
Why does she have a
clean room in her home?

59
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,223
Heart transplant. Immune
system's in the toilet.

60
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,989
So Mommy builds her little angel
a John Travolta-quality bubble.

61
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,529
Six months after the transplant.

62
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,588
She doesn't need to be
confined to a clean room.

63
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,963
Six months without putting out,

64
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,765
Dr. Cuddy doesn't need to wear
thong panties, but it's not our call.

65
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,466
I was wondering when you'd
get around to my panties.

66
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,007
She's had four days of workups.

67
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,286
They've tested everyone who
came anywhere near that room,

68
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,573
everything in the room.

69
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,510
It's like an Agatha
Christie mystery.

70
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,106
Maybe it's not what was
there, it's what she was doing.

71
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,208
Exercise allergy. Love it.

72
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,949
What sort of exercise
could a strapping young man

73
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,786
and a nubile teenage
nymphet possibly...

74
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,952
Mom was in the
room within seconds.

75
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,087
So the boyfriend brought in
an allergen and is lying about it.

76
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,074
Or the girl snuck out,
and she's lying about that.

77
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,966
Or the parents are lying
about the room being clean.

78
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,935
These are your big
ideas? Somebody's lying?

79
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,867
Hasn't let me down yet.

80
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,671
Recheck Mom, Dad, the girl,
the boy, the room and the home.

81
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,450
Any of you have a new
soap, a detergent, perfume?

82
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,282
No, no. Barbara's really
careful about that stuff.

83
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,346
And you haven't
been outside recently?

84
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,357
How could I? I'm
trapped up there.

85
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,902
You're not trapped.
It's just safer...

86
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,624
They won't even tell me the alarm code.
Just tell her I can go back to school.

87
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,289
Until we clear this up...

88
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:42,200
Fine. Find out what I'm allergic
to, and I'll stay away from it.

89
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,362
Then I can go back
to school, right?

90
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,838
It's up to your parents, but,
medically, there's no reason...

91
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,240
Told you.

92
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,810
Could I speak to you
outside for a second, please?

93
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,745
You know, this is hard
enough without you in there...

94
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,281
She asked me my opinion.
She is 16 years old. Lie to her.

95
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,157
When I was eight,
my mom, she hated...

96
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,130
I know. I need to loosen
up. I'm overprotective.

97
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,632
I saw <i>Finding Nemo.</i> I get
it. I don't need another story.

98
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,498
But you're not just
being overprotective.

99
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,914
You're one of the most
overprotective parents I've ever seen.

100
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,840
She has the best private
tutors. I let her friends visit.

101
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,808
I'm not going to apologize.

102
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,777
Just giving you my thoughts.

103
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,609
She almost died three
times during her childhood.

104
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,549
Penicillin, bee stings,
peanuts. I've seen her file.

105
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,076
Six months ago, we leave her home
alone for the first time on a weekend.

106
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:38,148
She goes out, buys one chocolate
chip cookie. Peanut butter in the dough.

107
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,989
She's forgotten her EpiPen.
She drives to the hospital,

108
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,896
passes out, has an accident.
Steering wheel crushed her chest.

109
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,394
She ended up losing her heart.

110
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,597
So when you say to me that

111
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,539
I'm one of the most overprotective
parents you've seen, please,

112
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:59,237
please introduce me to the
ones who were more protective

113
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,774
so that I can find out
what they're doing right.

114
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,215
She's allergic to having
a sucky social life.

115
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,586
Give the parents a break. They're
just trying to keep her healthy.

116
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,494
Everything in here's
labeled "Hypoallergenic."

117
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,157
Check it anyway.

118
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,797
Cameron.

119
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,199
This place is cleaner
than her hospital room.

120
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,307
No alarm on this window.

121
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,472
That's a 20-foot drop.

122
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,209
You can get to the tree from
here. There's some bark scraped off.

123
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,343
Sure, heart-transplant girl
swung down there on a vine.

124
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,197
Maybe she was hooking
up with Tarzan and Cheetah

125
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,553
down by the elephant graveyard.

126
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,684
Or Jane stayed in the tree
house, and Tarzan came up.

127
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,796
Okay, I spent most
of the night, Friday.

128
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,201
But if her mom finds out
about that, she will totally freak.

129
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,899
You guys had sex?

130
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:04,534
Yeah, but, you know, I did everything I
could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

131
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,611
Latex allergy?

132
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,045
What do you mean, like
a condom? We didn't...

133
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,207
You had unsafe sex?

134
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,193
The whole "unsafe" thing
didn't tell you something?

135
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,120
Yeah, but, I mean, look. We didn't,
like, plan on it, you know? It just...

136
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,589
I don't know. We're in love.
We've been dating for two years.

137
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,855
Practically a lifetime. How
about a semen allergy?

138
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,560
We're gonna need a semen sample.

139
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,790
You can use the
bathroom over there.

140
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,234
Right. How do
I... Aim and shoot.

141
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,333
And no thinking about
Dr. Cameron. We'll know.

142
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,805
We should tell her parents.
Why stop there? Call the cops.

143
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,040
Melinda's a minor.

144
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,607
And if we nip it in the bud here,
teenagers will never again have sex.

145
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,796
The parents will find out
when they get the bill anyway.

146
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,831
So you're fine with them finding
out as long as you don't have

147
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,222
to tell them
personally? Pretty much.

148
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,060
Too bad it's not you giving the
sample. We'd be done by now.

149
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,494
Test was negative.
No semen allergy.

150
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,830
Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak
on the night before the anaphylaxis.

151
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,773
I don't buy that it's
unrelated. He loves her.

152
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,677
He did everything he could to
make sure she wouldn't get sick.

153
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,338
What does that mean?

154
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,044
Love is an emotion certain people
experience, similar to happiness.

155
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,553
No. Maybe I should give
a more relatable example.

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,918
Oh, snap.

157
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,717
What did he do to protect her,

158
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,324
Brillo Pad his privates?

159
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,588
I assumed he washed
and he... Oh, good work.

160
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:32,029
Assumptions are so much
faster than actual questions.

161
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,069
You the boyfriend?

162
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,940
I need to borrow you.

163
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,776
What is going on?

164
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,578
Don't worry. I'll return him in
roughly the same condition.

165
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,652
Did you take anything to stay healthy?
Something stronger than an apple a day?

166
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,059
Is he okay?

167
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,963
He's just tired from being in a
coma so long. What'd you take?

168
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,769
Don't worry. He can
keep a secret. Right...

169
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,799
Antibiotics? Penicillin?

170
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,640
Any of those names ring a bell?

171
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,479
Yeah. My friend Elliot, his
dad had, like, a whole bottle that

172
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:27,487
he hadn't finished, so I swiped it
and took a bunch for, like, a week.

173
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,617
I mean, there's no way I was gonna
risk breathing germs on Melinda.

174
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,492
This is the one downside
of teenage sex. You're idiots.

175
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,256
You almost killed your girlfriend.
She's allergic to penicillin.

176
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,664
What, do you think there was still
some on my lips? I brushed my teeth.

177
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,730
Think lower and more fun.

178
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,070
I mean, it can go
through your stuff?

179
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,072
Totally, dude.

180
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,074
There's this administrator here,

181
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,849
whenever she gets sick, she
just gives me the prescription.

182
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,215
But, you know,
they tested Melinda.

183
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,125
They said she wasn't
allergic to my stuff.

184
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,753
Yeah, four days later.

185
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,060
By that time the penicillin
was crusting up a sock

186
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,327
at the bottom of your hamper.

187
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,265
Do you have to tell
her it was my fault?

188
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,230
No.

189
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,607
Great part of being a grownup,

190
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,939
you never have to do anything.

191
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,251
You're releasing her? What
happened? What did you find out?

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,949
Tests on your house ruled
out any environmental allergens.

193
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,218
Yeah, but what caused this?

194
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,731
We believe it's highly unlikely
that this set of circumstances

195
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,889
will repeat itself. What
set of circumstances?

196
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:48,298
It's good news. She's healthy.
But you might wanna talk to...

197
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,768
Cameron!

198
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,429
I can't breathe.

199
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,133
Getting the epi.

200
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,537
Give her the shot!

201
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,909
No murmurs, no friction rubs...

202
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,073
What are you waiting for? Quiet.

203
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,480
She's coughing up white sputum.

204
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,343
Crackling two-thirds
of the way up.

205
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,482
Look at her neck.

206
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,684
Please, she is vomiting.
Would you give her the shot?

207
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,319
It's not an allergy.
It's her heart.

208
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,833
What's the good news?
What's the bad news?

209
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,837
Congestive heart failure.

210
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,134
Is which?

211
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,765
Good news. Why?

212
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,239
I don't know. It just
sounded like you.

213
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,212
New puzzle piece, always
good news. What's the bad news?

214
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,480
We've got two puzzle pieces
from two different puzzles.

215
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,043
Seems that way.

216
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,749
What if her anaphylaxis
wasn't anaphylaxis?

217
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,452
Toxicity from the anti-rejection
meds could cause a seizure

218
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,926
and then heart failure.

219
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,125
And get cured by a mommy-wielded
EpiPen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?

220
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,099
What if they really
are two puzzles?

221
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,160
You think she had two unrelated
rare conditions in one week?

222
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,071
We explained the anaphylaxis.
What do you mean "we"? I did.

223
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,166
At least I thought I
did. Maybe I didn't.

224
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,040
Still, it was all me.

225
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:09,173
And heart problems aren't so rare for
someone who's had a heart transplant.

226
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,877
I say we assume House was
right about the anaphylaxis.

227
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,476
It is tempting.

228
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,553
Heart failure could be either
infection, coronary disease, or rejection.

229
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,785
Sorry.

230
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,896
There's a reason they call it
the whiteboard. It's not my rule.

231
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,795
What ties both these
conditions together?

232
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,677
Okay, we can all stare at
each other, or we can investigate

233
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,183
what caused the heart
failure. Just the heart failure.

234
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,509
You wanna give me
that black marker?

235
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,894
There's no fever, so
it's probably not infection.

236
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,294
Or no fever because she's
been on immunosuppressants

237
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,490
for the last six months.

238
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,898
Let's do a CT, get a heart
biopsy, and then redo...

239
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,800
- Anything?
- Not yet.

240
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,642
So I hear you don't want
teenagers having sex.

241
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,687
Teen suicide rate isn't
high enough for you already?

242
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,179
I just think those
two are brats.

243
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,157
The girl undercuts her
mother any chance she gets.

244
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,325
Yeah, it's the daughter's fault.

245
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,511
It has nothing to do
with Mom infantilizing her.

246
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,696
Good point. Explains why
parents who don't pay attention

247
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,349
get such nice,
well-adjusted children.

248
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,923
What's this?

249
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,727
You think it's vegetation? Yeah.

250
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,659
The kind made of muscle
that opens your heart valves.

251
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,359
It's nothing. She's clean.

252
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,329
It's good news.

253
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,566
You don't show any signs
of coronary artery disease.

254
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,834
So what's next?

255
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:45,106
Well, blood work to rule out infection,
and then a heart surgical biopsy

256
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,510
to rule out rejection.

257
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,141
But you don't think you're gonna
rule out both things, do you?

258
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,240
No.

259
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,082
I'm gonna lose
this heart, right?

260
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,522
Hopefully we'll find
the problem and fix it.

261
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,493
You'll keep your heart
a long time. How long?

262
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:06,192
There could be drug breakthroughs
that allow you to keep it for decades more.

263
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,758
Yeah. That's the answer my
cardiologist always gives me.

264
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,140
I looked it up on the web.
It's like five or 10 years, right?

265
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,634
That's about the average.

266
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,446
That's why I
need to have a life.

267
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,410
Why can't you convince my
mom to let me go back to school?

268
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,479
Melinda, you've got bigger worries
right now than missing school.

269
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,034
Until we figure out what's
wrong with your heart,

270
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,994
the safest place for
you to be is right here.

271
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,778
Where's

272
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,851
the hooker, I assume?

273
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,054
Right up here, buddy.

274
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,925
You said you'd hang the
stethoscope if you were having sex.

275
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,990
I didn't say it had to
be with another person.

276
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,979
Can you think of anything
that would tie together

277
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,938
anaphylaxis and heart failure?

278
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,806
No. I was waiting
out there for hours!

279
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,313
Yeah, well, I need a lot of foreplay.
And then there's the cuddling afterwards.

280
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,848
Any way that anaphylaxis isn't
anaphylaxis even if it responds to epi?

281
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,080
No. Oh, no wonder
you were in the mood.

282
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,645
This month's <i>New Jersey
Journal of Cardiology.</i>

283
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:47,854
Have you seen the centerfold?
There's no way those valves are real.

284
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,327
Any chance that the heart
failure could be unrelated to...

285
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:54,891
No. If you need time alone to
work, you just have to say so.

286
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,163
You don't have to lie
about it. Lying's more fun.

287
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,637
Being lied to...
Not as much fun.

288
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,298
Please have an answer to
this question. What's for dinner?

289
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,811
You still haven't
done the dishes?

290
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,671
You want one of these? I think
I got a couple of blueberries.

291
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,650
Oh, nope. Sorry, just one.

292
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,545
Well, don't look all weepy.

293
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,256
You got a problem with me, deal
with it. Short my sheets or something.

294
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,094
Biopsy was negative
for rejection. Thank God.

295
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,934
And what about the blood
tests? Showed no infection.

296
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,101
So we still don't know what
caused her heart failure.

297
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,054
Let's just be happy she
doesn't need a new heart.

298
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,673
Mrs. Bardach, it could have
just been a one-time thing.

299
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,841
So she has an allergic
reaction and heart failure,

300
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,511
and neither of them
can be explained.

301
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,682
Are they doing any
more tests on her? No.

302
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,279
She's not here.

303
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,459
Notify local hospitals, cab companies,
the state troopers, and local cops.

304
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,998
Any security officers
off duty are back on duty.

305
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,124
<i>We're on it.</i>

306
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,101
And I'm gonna need some pictures.
And go through those drawers.

307
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,469
And I want at least two people
going over the surveillance tapes.

308
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,030
Will that work?

309
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,874
Are those all her clothes? Yeah.

310
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,978
She's obviously still in the
building. So where did she go?

311
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,743
What does she want?
See her boyfriend?

312
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,476
She didn't take her phone.

313
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,786
She wants to be outside.

314
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,065
If you're trying to scare
your parents, great job.

315
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,569
Can we go back now?

316
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,141
I hate her.

317
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,680
When I was eight
years old, I was sick.

318
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,816
Not really sick, but the
point is, my mom, she could...

319
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,049
She was like this before.
Home by 9:00 every night.

320
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,092
Can't go out on the
weekends. Can't do sports.

321
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,002
Transplant just gave her
what she always wanted.

322
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,292
Melinda, you had heart failure.

323
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,397
This is kind of an insane
time to be criticizing your mom

324
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,958
about being overprotective.

325
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,528
I know. I mean, this is
what makes it even worse.

326
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,735
All of her craziness, it just...

327
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,971
It makes sense now.

328
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,548
Everything's gonna be all right.

329
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,549
I didn't even try
to get outside.

330
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,281
I was too scared. Come on.

331
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,159
Whoa, whoa, Melinda.
Please walk back towards me.

332
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,131
Why?

333
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,034
Please.

334
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,347
It feels kind of weird.

335
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,610
It's called steppage gait.

336
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,119
Is it serious? Not necessarily.

337
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,588
All right. Stick your
leg out. Hold it up.

338
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:11,523
She was under anesthesia for
the biopsy. If she lost oxygen...

339
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,589
CT ruled out brain damage.

340
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,802
Put your leg down. Relax.

341
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,464
Why is her leg
twitching like that?

342
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,807
Fasciculation. Is that serious?

343
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,970
It's paralysis,
and it's ascending.

344
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,143
She's gonna lose
the use of her legs?

345
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,379
To start with.

346
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,660
It's ascending fast. She can
hardly extend her leg now.

347
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,429
At this rate, it'll be up to
her lungs in a matter of days.

348
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:54,164
So, anaphylaxis,
heart failure, paralysis.

349
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,677
We couldn't put the first two together. I'm
guessing we can't put all three together.

350
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,075
Tick paralysis?

351
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,223
Could also explain the
anaphylaxis, maybe even the...

352
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,910
Penicillin allergy explains the
allergic reaction much better.

353
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:07,750
Particularly because tick paralysis
is usually accompanied by a tick.

354
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,790
We did two comprehensive
physicals looking for insect bites.

355
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,416
Can we put any two
of those together?

356
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,017
How about we stipulate?

357
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,825
You argued that there must be
something to connect all three symptoms

358
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,661
you mocked us for
not figuring it out,

359
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,031
and finally you let us discuss
the paralysis on its own

360
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,070
because it's what's
gonna kill her.

361
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,664
Now, it's ascending. Her MRIs are
clean, so rule out stroke or aneurysm.

362
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,618
- ALS, MS?
- Progression's too quick.

363
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,838
Spinal lesion from
leukemia? Too slow.

364
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,574
- It's most likely Guillain Barré.
- She's immunosuppressed.

365
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,808
What about botulism?

366
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,544
Not unless she's been walking on
her hands the last couple of days.

367
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,428
Botulism paralysis is
descending, not ascending.

368
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,581
Could be a virus. West Nile, even
polio with her immune system shot.

369
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:47,058
Get an LP and do
PCRs for the viruses.

370
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,322
And get an EMG to
check for Guillain Barré.

371
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,832
Foreman's right. We gotta
find out why she's paralyzed.

372
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,003
But not before staring at
me dumbly for a few seconds.

373
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,114
<i>We ran more tests
on your daughter.</i>

374
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,347
<i>We took a lumbar puncture,
got some spinal fluid.</i>

375
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,546
<i>Then we brought it to the
lab to look for infections</i>

376
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,818
<i>that could be
infecting her brain.</i>

377
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,386
<i>We also did an EMG to check
how her muscles and nerves</i>

378
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,091
<i>are responding to
electrical impulses.</i>

379
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:30,097
<i>Unfortunately, her muscles are showing
increased weakness above the knee.</i>

380
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,070
You mean she's getting worse?

381
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,164
The LP and PCRs ruled
out polio and West Nile.

382
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,232
We think it's Guillain Barré.

383
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,141
The body's immune
response goes haywire

384
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,180
and starts attacking
the peripheral nerves.

385
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,977
It causes muscle
weakness and paralysis.

386
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,609
How bad is it?

387
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,552
It's serious, but Guillain Barré
usually responds very well

388
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,282
to plasmapheresis.

389
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,160
<i>You see, the plasma, the
clear liquid part of her blood,</i>

390
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,565
<i>contains most of the
antibodies which are overreacting</i>

391
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,933
<i>and attacking her
nervous system.</i>

392
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,768
<i>The machine spins
her blood in a centrifuge</i>

393
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,741
<i>and separates parts of
the blood based on weight.</i>

394
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,300
<i>White blood cells are the
heaviest, then the red cells,</i>

395
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,210
<i>then platelets and plasma.</i>

396
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,257
<i>We discard the stuff
that's causing all the trouble</i>

397
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,241
<i>and return the good blood cells
back to her body in a replacement fluid.</i>

398
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,585
<i>If it works, we'll see
results in a couple of days.</i>

399
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:34,333
You didn't get any messages
for me last week, did you?

400
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,493
Nope.

401
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,135
That's funny. The
guy finally called back.

402
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,332
The place I lost, he said
he left three voicemails.

403
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:46,209
Gotta pee. Which I never
got, if that wasn't clear.

404
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,839
He must be lying. You
wouldn't want to live with a liar.

405
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,111
You erased my messages? Yep.

406
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,688
Decided I wanted you to
stay. Told you that, didn't I?

407
00:25:55,754 --> 00:26:00,021
You're miserable, and you're
lonely, and you're gonna trap me here

408
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,052
to keep me every bit as
miserable and lonely, too.

409
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,586
Yeah, and you're
happy, happy, happy.

410
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,225
Okay. Hey, I'm obviously going
through a rough patch here.

411
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,097
Wife leaves, tends
to bum somebody out.

412
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,468
Do you know where my pee went?

413
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,567
You're missing some?

414
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:23,139
No. Came out of me and went right
into the toilet. Now, why would that be?

415
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,381
You're William Tell.

416
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,095
You could pick an apple
off someone's head?

417
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,214
No, it's because there was no
clear plastic wrap over the toilet.

418
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,167
The stuff's in the kitchen.
You had plenty of time.

419
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,252
All that was missing was the
will. This isn't a college dorm.

420
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,727
It could be.

421
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,297
We're not 18!

422
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:42,664
So what? What did I do to you? I
scammed you into doing the dishes,

423
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,193
I made you sit on the
steps. I didn't kill your puppy.

424
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,967
I did not make you miserable.
Oh, so this is therapy?

425
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,604
No, it just makes me smile.

426
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,182
All right. I'm finding a
new place tomorrow.

427
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,150
Right. But not tonight.

428
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,482
Well, I figure you wanna shave
my eyebrows while I'm asleep.

429
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,046
I wouldn't wanna deprive
you of that last smile.

430
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,353
You're not going anywhere.

431
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,452
You're gonna sit on my
couch and depress us both

432
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,848
because you just can't admit
that it's over with your wife.

433
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,490
That's right. I'm
here on vacation.

434
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,761
Have you gotten a lawyer yet?

435
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:20,163
That... That's not... Have
you even called one?

436
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,206
As long as you're
here, it's just a fight.

437
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:29,345
But as soon as you get a
place, then it's a divorce.

438
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,114
Everything sucks.

439
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,325
Might as well find
something to smile about.

440
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,337
Reflexes are marginally weaker.

441
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,873
The paralysis is getting worse?

442
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,342
Sometimes it takes a few treatments
for the plasmapheresis to work.

443
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,209
Why do these things
keep happening to me?

444
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,015
Dan's back.

445
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,318
Hey, baby, did you
hear that? Dan's here.

446
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,554
I don't wanna see him.

447
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,090
I'll tell him to come
back later. No.

448
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,689
Mommy, stay here, please.

449
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,233
Of course.

450
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,670
Is she doing okay?
She's sleeping.

451
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,604
I'm sure she's exhausted.

452
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,337
Mood swings are common
with the anti-rejection meds.

453
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,879
No. She's had mood
swings. This isn't it.

454
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,713
This is... She's given up.

455
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,085
I know you think I'm...

456
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,215
This isn't what I wanted.

457
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,821
She's always fought with me.

458
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,165
Ever since she was a baby,
she was so damn stubborn.

459
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,437
But I never
wanted her like this.

460
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,407
I just wanted her safe.

461
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,656
LEWIS: Doctor! Doctor!

462
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,784
She can't breathe. She can't
even get a whole sentence out.

463
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,080
She's using the
accessory muscles.

464
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,090
O2 sat's down to 90.
Lungs clear? Yeah.

465
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,935
Does your tongue feel
swollen? I can't... no...

466
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,222
Is it itchy? FOREMAN: No hives.

467
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,489
It's not an allergy.

468
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,621
Lips are cyanotic.
We've got to intubate.

469
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,325
What are you doing?

470
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,061
Pushing lorazepam.

471
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,404
She's not getting enough oxygen.
We've gotta assist her breathing.

472
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,382
What was that? Was that
a reaction to the treatment?

473
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,386
It's the paralysis.
It's reached her lungs.

474
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,055
<i>Melinda's dying.</i>

475
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,498
We're all dying. How fast?

476
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,397
Too fast for Guillain Barré.

477
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,439
Cuddy wants to get her an
MRI to rule out a spinal lesion.

478
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,065
Cuddy? What's she doing on this?

479
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,102
The family lost
confidence in us.

480
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,977
I don't blame
them. I'll be right in.

481
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,097
It's like she got poisoned
with a nerve agent.

482
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,409
Glue inhalation. Would explain
why she hasn't admitted it.

483
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,026
Tox screen was clear for pot.

484
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:13,368
Middle-class heart transplant
patient's gonna huff glue?

485
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,930
Pesticides? CAMERON: This
time of year, they're not spraying.

486
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,307
This girl's tough. She
gets what she wants.

487
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,746
She's deprived of human contact.
She gets herself a backdoor man.

488
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,149
Or in her case, a side-window boy.
What else has she been deprived of?

489
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,415
She's on a special diet
because of her allergies.

490
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:33,926
The boyfriend brings the hot beef.
He also brings a side dish, botulism.

491
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,288
This paralysis is
ascending, remember?

492
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,626
Not if the heart problem's
really a paralytic problem.

493
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,666
Why would she admit
the sex and not the food?

494
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,758
She didn't admit anything.

495
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,698
He admitted the sex, and
we didn't ask him about food.

496
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,865
Get me a rat. You have a rat.

497
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,475
What? I'm not gonna kill Steve.

498
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,402
Only way to confirm this,
inject a rat with her blood

499
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,716
and wait for it to get
all botulistic on your ass.

500
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:02,380
In the meantime, I'm going downstairs
to browbeat a scared dying teenage girl

501
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,947
until she breaks down like
a scared dying teenage girl.

502
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,888
You're up early. Cuddy
needed a consult.

503
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,695
We're checking for spinal
lesions from leukemia.

504
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,293
Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly.

505
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,499
Unless this is the patient with
the anaphylaxis, the heart failure,

506
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,893
and the paralysis, in which
case, you're wasting your time.

507
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,308
We wanted a second opinion.

508
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,369
Second? We must have
given you at least eight.

509
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,884
Okay, well, here's
nine. Botulism.

510
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,982
Listen to me, have you
eaten anything abnormal?

511
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,817
Any canned foods? No.

512
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:37,912
You sure?

513
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,481
Lying to your parents is
usually the right thing to do,

514
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,653
but there is an impending
death exception.

515
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:43,854
Don't talk to her like that.

516
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,763
You're right. She never
lies. I was being rude.

517
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:50,667
When your boyfriend snuck
in on Friday night... Surprise.

518
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,398
Perhaps he got you
some sexy little treats, huh?

519
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:58,342
Some honey or some edible underwear,
some massage oils. Come on, anything.

520
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,673
We didn't... Yeah, yeah.
We know about the sex.

521
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,342
Turns out that Danny's
little Danny is full of penicillin.

522
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,215
That's what caused
your anaphylactic shock.

523
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,754
You didn't tell us
that was what...

524
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:14,258
No. It was... He took
clindamycin, what I use...

525
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,431
He said he was on penicillin.

526
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,957
I saw the bottle. That's
a non-penicillin antibiotic.

527
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,467
If the antibiotics didn't
cause the anaphylaxis...

528
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,438
It's still on the table.

529
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,065
Everything is connected.

530
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,952
What did we discuss?
What was the differential?

531
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,535
Cameron said...

532
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,806
When Dan came to your house that
night, he go through any tall grass?

533
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,477
Climbed a fence.

534
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,587
What are you doing?

535
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,719
Your daughter had two
visitors on Friday night.

536
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:54,459
One of them is still in the
room. She has tick paralysis.

537
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,629
Dan tracked a tick onto his
jeans, which wouldn't be a problem.

538
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,141
But being a teenager, Dan
couldn't keep his tick in his pants.

539
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,142
We already checked her.

540
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,005
Now I'm checking her.

541
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,570
Tick bites don't ordinarily
cause anaphylactic shock.

542
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,674
This girl's allergies
are not ordinary.

543
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,946
House, get out of here.
We have to re-intubate her,

544
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,146
get her into the MRI.

545
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,848
The time course is perfect.

546
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:21,292
The bite itself sets off an allergic
reaction. Venom takes four days to kick in.

547
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,089
Heart's vulnerable,
hits that first,

548
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,153
then a day later sets off
the ascending paralysis.

549
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,256
Except that ticks
aren't usually invisible.

550
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:30,666
They are until you find them.

551
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,431
Oh, no. That's dandruff.

552
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,769
Okay, well, that wasn't
nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped.

553
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,900
It just means the next
time will be even better.

554
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,778
What's happening? That's
the tick venom ascending.

555
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,409
Either that or you stressed her
into heart failure. BP's dropping.

556
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,147
Heart rate, 47. I'm
administering atropine.

557
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,449
She's gonna need a
transvenous pacing wire.

558
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:55,551
Okay, magical tick hunt is
over. Only real doctor stuff now.

559
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,323
This is just gonna get worse.

560
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,388
Ticks produce more
toxins the longer they feed.

561
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,799
She's gonna be dead in an hour even
if you pump her heart full of jet fuel,

562
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,148
unless you let me find the tick.

563
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,330
Could he be right?

564
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,272
The only thing I know for sure is
that your daughter's heart won't last

565
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,071
another 20 minutes
without treatment.

566
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,374
Okay, I just need one final instruction.
When I find the tick on the autopsy,

567
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,470
do you want to know?

568
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,107
I'm thinking not, probably
make the coping easier.

569
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:19,617
Stop talking to them!

570
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,176
Page Borsisky in cardiology.
Get her team down here stat.

571
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,031
Get them out of here.
Get House out of here, too.

572
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,456
Dr. Wilson, I could
use your help.

573
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,289
Well, I don't know if the dopamine's
enough. She may need inamrinone lactate.

574
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,922
Why? What's that? She doesn't...

575
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,661
She might need stronger pressors.
They don't have any in radiology.

576
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:39,136
Inamrinone can cause
arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.

577
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,231
Not inamrinone could
cause death. Death's worse.

578
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,175
We have to get
her up to the ICU.

579
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,623
<i>Cardiac team to ICU stat.</i>

580
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,780
<i>Cardiac team to ICU stat.</i>

581
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,884
Sorry, a little crowded here.
House, get out of the elevator.

582
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,690
You're welcome to
wait for the next one.

583
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,561
You got her? Got her.

584
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,408
As long as we're stuck here, this
might be a good time to look for that tick.

585
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,881
Turn the elevator back
on. Just be a minute, honey.

586
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,624
Atropine's wearing
off. So inject her again.

587
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,686
That's just temporary.
Temporary's fine.

588
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,162
We're not hanging wallpaper.

589
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,563
We've gotta get her upstairs
and put her on norepinephrine.

590
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,535
It wasn't penicillin. You still think
the symptoms are unconnected?

591
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,366
We've gotta take care
of her heart before...

592
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,518
You wake up in the morning,

593
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,337
your paint's peeling, your curtains
are gone, and the water's boiling.

594
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,119
Which problem do you
deal with first? House.

595
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,636
None of them. The building's on
fire! We treat her symptoms, she dies.

596
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,878
We find the cause, she lives.
That tick is an IV drip of poison.

597
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,146
We unhook it, she'll be fine.

598
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:13,426
This is my last atropine.
Last us about three minutes.

599
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,898
Let's get her gown up.

600
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,338
Her heart rate falls below 35,
we're getting her to the ICU.

601
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,315
I'm not gonna let her
die in this elevator.

602
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,479
Where are they?

603
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,148
Get maintenance
up here, right away.

604
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,257
Ear canal's clean.

605
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,693
Left foot's clean.

606
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:47,722
If it's not here, we've
only got... Heart rate's 46.

607
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,668
It's here. Looks like a mole or
a freckle, something we missed.

608
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,398
Check the armpits.

609
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,254
Dr. Foreman's an excellent
doctor. He'll be able to handle it.

610
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,373
Yeah? You know that from experience?
You lose a lot of patients on elevators?

611
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,559
The maintenance guy said
it didn't just stop on its own,

612
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,246
that they hit the
emergency stop button.

613
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,811
Well, I'm sure he
must be mistaken.

614
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,287
Perineum. We checked it.

615
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,192
If we get her upstairs,
we still... Maxilla.

616
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,491
Checked.

617
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,234
Down to 38. We don't have
a lot of time. We can still...

618
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,793
Eyebrows, eardrums, pubic hair.

619
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,705
Checked, checked, checked.
We checked everywhere! It's not...

620
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,802
Thirty-five.

621
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,540
We gotta get her to the ICU.
We haven't found the tick yet.

622
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,980
We already kidnapped
her! You wanna add murder?

623
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:42,180
We've looked over every inch of
skin on her body, House! It's over.

624
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,158
Hey, is that the first
time you had sex?

625
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,128
With all the other stuff going on
down there, she might not have realized.

626
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,749
- You sick, miserable...
- What are you doing?

627
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,288
Oh, my God!

628
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,723
See? Told you it'd be
even more dramatic.

629
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,995
Push norepinephrine. Get
her heart back to normal.

630
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,765
She'll be completely
cured by tomorrow.

631
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,734
Foreman, let's get
her into the ICU.

632
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:54,258
Inamrinone was a stupid idea

633
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,258
unless you wanted me to
get that girl in the elevator.

634
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,890
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
Wouldn't respect you if you did.

635
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:13,377
Wow, looks like somebody
filed halfway through your cane

636
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,570
while you were sleeping.

637
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,505
Reflexes back to normal.

638
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,236
Heart's looking good, too.

639
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,109
I'll send in the nurse, we'll
get you transferred out of ICU.

640
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,705
You'll be discharged
in the morning.

641
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,183
Thank God. I just
wanna get home.

642
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,981
And back to school on Monday.

643
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,413
I'm not ready.

644
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,692
You're ready.

645
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,952
I'm sick, Mom.

646
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,122
You're not sick.

647
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,496
You're gonna go to class,

648
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,234
and you're gonna see your
friends and your boyfriend.

649
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,879
<i>What's this doohickey?</i>

650
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,477
<i>A brassiere. You know
about those things.</i>

651
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,383
<i>You're a big boy now.</i>

652
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,611
<i>Well, I've never run
across one like that.</i>

653
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,049
<i>It's brand new.</i>

654
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,089
<i>Revolutionary uplift.</i>

655
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,060
<i>It's explained to
you. I know. I know.</i>

656
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,193
<i>I have acrophobia, which
gives me vertigo and I get dizzy.</i>

657
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,097
<i>What a moment to find out
I had it. Well, you've got it.</i>

658
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,803
<i>There's no one to
blame. Why quit?</i>

659
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,433
<i>You mean, and sit behind
a desk? Chair-borne.</i>

660
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,274
<i>It's where you belong.
What about my acrophobia?</i>

661
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,679
I called a divorce lawyer today.

662
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,781
Does that mean you're leaving?

663
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,854
At some point.

664
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:11,652
You might not want
to sit exactly there.
