1
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,364
Do you feel the Spirit?

2
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:42,776
And in the 39th year of his
reign, Asa was diseased in his feet

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,708
until the disease was
exceedingly great,

4
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,771
yet he didn't seek
help from the Lord,

5
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,983
but from the physicians.

6
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,850
Now, there is nothing
wrong with seeing a doctor.

7
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:58,623
But can a doctor heal through the
power that Jesus gave his disciples?

8
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,190
Men of science can walk
through life with blindfolds,

9
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,696
never knowing that you or I
could not take a single step

10
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,029
if we were not uplifted by God.

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,233
Agnes,

12
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,441
thank you for letting me be an
instrument of God's love for you.

13
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,090
In faith,

14
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,790
all things are possible.

15
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,964
My friends, I want
you to let Agnes

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,808
feel the wave of faith in this church
here today, lifting her into God's hands.

17
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:54,914
Praise God!

18
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,451
You can do it. Come on, sister.

19
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,527
Praise Jesus!

20
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,087
Thanks be to God!

21
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,532
Thank you, Lord!
Thanks be to God!

22
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,493
Thank you, Lord!

23
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,977
Is he all right? No!

24
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,750
My son!

25
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,954
Daddy, I think I need a doctor.

26
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,074
Didn't remember my DVD player?

27
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,439
Well, if you wanted it,

28
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,603
you shouldn't have left it
behind when you moved out.

29
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,842
I get it. It's a drag
watching porn on VHS.

30
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,612
I'll call you as soon
as I'm done with it.

31
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,516
That's if you ever
get a phone installed.

32
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:44,286
Oh, forget it. I'll come by and
get it myself. After work, Thursday?

33
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,554
Won't be home Thursday.

34
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,755
No problem. I still have a
key, I can let myself in and out.

35
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,856
I guess maybe I could
bring it in tomorrow.

36
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,869
After all, how many times can you hit
"pause" at the part where Lindsay Lohan

37
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,031
wins the spelling bee. What
is it about girls who can spell?

38
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,543
It's a math contest. What is
it about girls who can count?

39
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,669
It's poker night, isn't it?

40
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,907
You said weeks
ago that I could play.

41
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,608
Stop making excuses. Gotta go!

42
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,880
Building full of sick people. If I
hurry, maybe I can avoid them.

43
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,032
The abdominal series showed
no evidence of obstruction.

44
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,183
What did you have to eat?

45
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,986
Chicken sandwich. We
travel, lots of fast food.

46
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,891
Thank you, I barely felt it.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,525
You're welcome.

48
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,627
God told me you were kind.

49
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,540
You talk to God?

50
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,908
God's presence often descends
on Boyd to help him guide others.

51
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,914
This been going on
long? Since he was 10.

52
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,213
God told me I would
meet a woman healer

53
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,522
who was harboring vengeful
thoughts about a man she works with.

54
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,820
That's God's job.

55
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,296
I'll keep that in mind.

56
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,830
His urine is dilute.
What does that mean?

57
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,147
Could mean that for some
reason his kidneys aren't purifying

58
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,699
the way they should, which would
let toxins accumulate in his body.

59
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,471
We'll run the blood work
and see what it tells us.

60
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,638
Thank you, I appreciate it.

61
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,511
God talks to him?

62
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,754
It's not psychosis.
He's just religious.

63
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,883
The only medical issue that showed
up on the blood work is low sodium.

64
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,688
No. You talk to
God, you're religious.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,319
God talks to you,
you're psychotic.

66
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:32,332
A lot of people experience their
religion as something more than symbolic.

67
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,776
That doesn't mean...
God ever talk to you

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,029
when you were in the seminary?

69
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,041
No. God's loss, our gain.

70
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,737
He's either psychotic
or a scam artist.

71
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,245
He was actually
really impressive.

72
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,447
Well, yeah, with the burning
bush and all, it's quite the show.

73
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,509
He was intelligent, polite, dignified.
He's not a typical 15-year-old.

74
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,648
And he told Cameron God wants her to
stop being pissed at me over the article.

75
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,383
God knows you stole
Cameron's article?

76
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,293
He knows she's harboring
vengeful thoughts.

77
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,925
I'm over it.

78
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,456
Yeah, I could tell that from the Berlin
Wall of body language between you.

79
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,801
I'm shocked that he picked up on
it. Low sodium. Check for Addison's?

80
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,407
No pigmentation and
potassium levels were normal.

81
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,933
Cirrhosis? Liver feels fine,
transaminases are normal.

82
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,115
We should monitor his saline
intake to correct the low sodium.

83
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,151
No more than 1 meq
per liter, per hour.

84
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,515
Let's push the patient history,

85
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,647
see if there's any evidence of drugs
or other delusions. I'll take care of it.

86
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,957
You're gonna talk to a patient?

87
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,156
God talks to him.

88
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,664
It'd be arrogant of me to
assume that I'm better than God.

89
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,867
So, you're a faith healer?
Or is that a pejorative?

90
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,010
Do you prefer something like
"divine health management"?

91
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,211
Thought God might have
mentioned that I was coming.

92
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,955
I'm okay with faith
healer, Dr. House.

93
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,355
That's a nice one.
You didn't even go with,

94
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,993
"I see an H in a medical coat."

95
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,862
The nurses talk about you a
lot. Yeah, don't believe them.

96
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,561
I keep a sock in my pants.

97
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,163
Faith. That's another
word for ignorance, isn't it?

98
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,083
I never understood how people could
be so proud of believing in something

99
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,269
with no proof at all. Like
that's an achievement.

100
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,041
God's asking for our trust. You can't
love somebody and not trust them.

101
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,672
Trust has to be earned.

102
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,275
You can't trust someone
hiding in a closet.

103
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,117
You don't trust anyone.

104
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,021
You seem lucid. There's
no confusion, no lethargy.

105
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,759
What drugs have you been taking?

106
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,493
Nothing, some aspirin.

107
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,590
I get focused on
something, I forget to eat,

108
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,635
next thing you know, I've
got a hunger headache.

109
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,137
So, aspirin and
hospitals are okay.

110
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,524
That's an interesting attitude for
someone who's kept any number of people

111
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,042
from getting medical help.

112
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,939
Just because I believe in prayer

113
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,948
doesn't mean I don't
believe in germs and toxins.

114
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,383
That bottle's been opened before.
You refilled it at the water cooler.

115
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,187
Yes. How often do you do that?

116
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,023
Few times an hour. He
likes to stay hydrated.

117
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,495
You think germs
might have gotten in?

118
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,100
I think water might
have gotten in.

119
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,337
We can adjust your pain meds.

120
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,804
Again.

121
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,638
Suppose we increase
your oxycodone?

122
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,187
We both know the only
reason I'm talking lucidly now

123
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,221
is because I did not take
my full dose this morning.

124
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,286
You've done your best

125
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,158
and I have been a good soldier.

126
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,166
It's time we accept it's over.

127
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,236
What about the trip you
were talking about taking?

128
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,253
You've wanted to see Florence
since you were a teenager, right?

129
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,371
Yeah, go now all drugged up?

130
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,910
It's not exactly the trip
I'd been dreaming of.

131
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,555
Okay, but you're strong,
you're dealing with this

132
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:22,491
and there is the right combination of
pain meds out there. And we'll find it.

133
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,797
Don't give up on us.

134
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,731
And don't be startled by the
sound you're about to hear.

135
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,035
Excuse me,

136
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,707
I have a friend with
boundary issues.

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,684
Can this wait five minutes?

138
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,754
Is she dying?

139
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,748
Yeah.

140
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,483
Before the end of this consult?

141
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,586
They could build monuments
to your self-centeredness.

142
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,996
Patient, 15-year-old,
faith healer, hotline to God.

143
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,569
What are his symptoms?
He is not a saint.

144
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,082
He figures out what's
going on in people's lives

145
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,041
by watching,
listening, deducing.

146
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,202
And you're worried about
trademark infringement?

147
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,713
Then he passes on advice from
God so he can watch them jump.

148
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,248
It's a power trip.

149
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,479
Oh, and there the similarities
end. Why is he here?

150
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,383
I fear for the human race.

151
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,945
A teenager claims
to be the voice of God

152
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,014
and people with advanced
degrees are listening.

153
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,721
The majority of Americans believe in a
personal god. What are his symptoms?

154
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,559
Massive cramps, low sodium.

155
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,431
Turns out he's been drinking water
nonstop, God told him to purify his body.

156
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,299
Huge water intake
would cause low sodium.

157
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,270
Which would cause the
cramping. Yeah, I got it.

158
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,330
What, that's it? You solved it?

159
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,938
You just brought me out here to
rant because faith annoys you?

160
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,111
Mmm-hmm.

161
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,106
He's all better.

162
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,517
You know, I'd get it if people were
just looking for a way to fill the holes.

163
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,988
But they want the holes,
they wanna live in the holes

164
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,388
and they go nuts when someone
else pours dirt in their holes.

165
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,387
Climb out of your holes, people!

166
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,814
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

167
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,952
<i>Over the hills and everywhere</i>

168
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:35,186
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

169
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,925
<i>That Jesus Christ is born</i>

170
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,891
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

171
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:47,005
<i>Over the hills and everywhere</i>

172
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,907
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

173
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,810
<i>That Jesus Christ is born</i>

174
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,972
Boyd, are you all right?

175
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,516
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

176
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,583
Boyd.

177
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,551
<i>Over the hills and...</i>

178
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,562
Come on, let's go. Can
you tell me your name?

179
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,328
Do you know where you are? Boyd?

180
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,195
Boyd?

181
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,172
God doesn't want
you to be afraid.

182
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,836
He sent me here to heal you.

183
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,519
You think he hasn't heard your
prayers, but he heard them all,

184
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,692
even the ones you didn't say.

185
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,117
I'm sorry, Boyd, come on,
let's get you back to your room.

186
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,212
In faith, all things
are possible.

187
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,515
Let's go.

188
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,890
Lord, I call on you to relieve
the suffering of your daughter...

189
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,952
Grace? And make her whole again.

190
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,864
Hey, hey! What are
you doing? What is this?

191
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,868
He's just had a complex
partial seizure. He's disoriented.

192
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,996
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Well, get him back to his room, now.

193
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,009
You okay?

194
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,409
Are we certain he
even had a seizure?

195
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,155
Him singing and healing, he
does it all the time, doesn't he?

196
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,554
Isn't it interesting

197
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,322
that religious behavior is so close to
being crazy, we can't tell them apart.

198
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:19,423
The repetition, the lack of affect
and awareness. It was a seizure.

199
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,297
Infection? No fever.

200
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,960
Could be Wilson's or maybe
it's a glycogen storage disease.

201
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,803
Or a brain tumor.
Or tuberous sclerosis.

202
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,908
Hmm.

203
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,741
How to settle this?

204
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,180
We could ask our patient to ask
God or we could MRI his brain.

205
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,394
Which way do you wanna
go? 'Cause I'm open to all.

206
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,545
House! Yes.

207
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,383
Why the hell do you let an
unstable patient wander the hallways?

208
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,389
His leash broke.

209
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,934
The last thing a
terminal patient needs

210
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,756
is to hear somebody
taunt them with a cure.

211
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,319
She was freaked, she was angry.

212
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,625
And now she's not freaked
and angry and you are.

213
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,798
She says she's feeling better.

214
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,815
Maybe not singing and dancing,
but she's feeling just a little bit happy

215
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,239
for the first time in months.

216
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,004
A sudden drop in pain
could create euphoria.

217
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,670
Why don't you let
her have her vacation?

218
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,510
Oh, that's great. And
when vacation's over?

219
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,812
When she crash-lands
from all this denial?

220
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,284
She was dealing
with her illness.

221
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,978
Now her expectations are rising.

222
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,399
And you're not the one who has
to be there when all that false hope

223
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,051
gets yanked out from under her.

224
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,827
Don't you guys
have anything to do?

225
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,396
How long have you
been healing people?

226
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,666
You believe that's
what I'm doing?

227
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,307
I'd like to.

228
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,438
But you don't.

229
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,142
Why do you always do
things you don't want to do?

230
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,685
It's okay, I don't
expect a real answer.

231
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,102
God would probably want you
to take the stick out of your butt

232
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,538
and get over this.

233
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,833
If there is some higher
order running the universe,

234
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,674
it's probably so different from
anything our species can conceive,

235
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,577
there's no point in
even thinking about it.

236
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,817
But I doubt it gives a
damn about my butt.

237
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,214
So you believe God might
exist, but you don't think about it?

238
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,098
It's the most important
issue... I think penguins

239
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,954
might as well speculate
about nuclear physics.

240
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,552
Why are we having this
conversation? What? I'm curious.

241
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,008
You cannot tell someone they
are your colleague and not a friend,

242
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,365
and then casually
chat about the afterlife.

243
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,618
You actually keep score?

244
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,591
Your MRI results
aren't done yet.

245
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,063
Go back to your
room. No singing.

246
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,931
Well, you would get a point
for figuring why the low sodium.

247
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,367
What are my guy's points for?

248
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,101
Your trick about the spat between
Dr. Cameron and Dr. Foreman

249
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,574
apparently impressed someone.

250
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,076
And the second point?

251
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,747
Do you think it could be
because I healed Grace?

252
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,787
She's been back
to see me, I like her.

253
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,417
You like messing with people.
That's why you're here now.

254
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:36,351
Maybe you think that your batteries
are powered by God, maybe you don't.

255
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,864
Either way, you
enjoy what you do.

256
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,900
Yes, I like helping people.

257
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,528
I get a rush when I see the look
on their faces when they realize

258
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,129
their burdens are gone.

259
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,403
But you make sure you're in the next
state by the time the endorphins wear off

260
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,000
and the arthritis comes back.

261
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,669
That doesn't happen.

262
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,477
Oh, you do extensive
follow-up studies?

263
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,516
God told me.

264
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,947
You see, that's not
fair. We were having fun.

265
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:07,382
It's hard to keep sniping rationally
when you throw a bomb like that in there.

266
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,767
He spoke with me about you, too.

267
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,599
Forgive my enemies?

268
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,663
Never date a Taurus when
Mercury is in retrograde?

269
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,608
Yeah, I learned that
one myself, the hard way.

270
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,178
God says you look
for excuses to be alone.

271
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,446
See, that is exactly the kind
of brilliance that sounds deep,

272
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,850
but you could say it about any person
who doesn't pine for the social approval

273
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,981
of everyone he meets, which you
were cleverly able to deduce about me

274
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,854
by not being a moron.

275
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,951
Next time, tell God
to be more specific.

276
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,663
God wants you to invite
Dr. Wilson to your poker game.

277
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,906
Don't talk to my patient.

278
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,711
What are you talking about?

279
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,949
You get all huffy when my patient
stumbles into yours in the hallway,

280
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,422
but you got no qualms
about chatting my guy up.

281
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,590
This is fun, it's like <i>Password.</i>

282
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,504
Keep talking. I'll jump
in when I get a clue

283
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,705
what the hell
you're talking about.

284
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,960
God knows about my poker game.

285
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,058
You think I told him?

286
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,728
Either that or I start going
to church every Sunday.

287
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,247
That would mess with
my bowling league.

288
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,706
House, aside from yelling at
him to get back to his room,

289
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,571
I've never spoken
to your patient.

290
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,575
MRI shows an abnormal area.

291
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,648
Tuberous sclerosis.

292
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,699
It's the right neighborhood.
Accounts for all the symptoms.

293
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,123
All of them.

294
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,819
Leading cortical
tuber's identifiable.

295
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,923
We can do this surgically.

296
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,988
Tell our patient,
"Congratulations."

297
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,330
Soon his chats with God
will be a thing of the past.

298
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,237
Tie goes to the mortal.

299
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,149
Did you know the Catholic
Church keeps a doctor at Lourdes?

300
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,154
He hears the same
thing every day.

301
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:22,184
But, out of the thousands of cases of
people who have claimed to feel better,

302
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,127
the Catholic Church has only
recognized a handful as miracles.

303
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,999
But they do recognize a handful.

304
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,530
Well, they're a church.
It's what they do.

305
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,006
Look. For the past
couple of years,

306
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,440
the world's been
getting smaller.

307
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,018
Eight months, six months...

308
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,148
I watch a trailer for a movie

309
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,921
and I think, "Am I gonna be
here when that comes out?"

310
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,759
But maybe there is
still a horizon out there.

311
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:03,160
You know, maybe... Maybe I can
make plans for a year from now.

312
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,101
Two years.

313
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,600
I like the view.

314
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,678
The view is a lie,
and if you believe it,

315
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,147
you're going to crash so hard.

316
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,951
Let me take new
images of your liver.

317
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,216
You can't accept
that it could be true.

318
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,418
Well, if it is true, you
shouldn't be afraid of proving it.

319
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,196
Tuberous sclerosis
is a genetic disorder.

320
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,700
It causes small, benign tumors to
grow in various parts of the body.

321
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,638
In this case, the
brain. You said benign.

322
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,810
They probably are, but benign or
not, they're not in a good location.

323
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,904
We need to remove them.
You're talking brain surgery?

324
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,017
His symptoms are getting worse,
which means the tumors are growing.

325
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,645
Surgery will correct it all, the
chemical imbalance, the seizures,

326
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
the auditory hallucinations.

327
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,713
Hallucinations?

328
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,451
Without the surgery,
it's just gonna get worse.

329
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,423
Might even be fatal.

330
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,933
With the surgery, your son should
be a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.

331
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,394
I'm not normal.

332
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,546
I need you to talk to my
patient. I'll get this one.

333
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,747
Why do I have the feeling
you're plotting world domination?

334
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,018
Moses is refusing
surgery. You have a gift.

335
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,883
People thank you for telling
them they're going to die.

336
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,991
If I can get him to agree to
surgery, I want in on the poker game.

337
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,330
You would let this kid die
just to get into a stupid game?

338
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,131
You'd let him die
just to keep me out?

339
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,977
Hi.

340
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,139
I'm Dr. Wilson.

341
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,246
I knew they'd send
somebody else.

342
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,050
That God has a big mouth. House.

343
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,824
Can I ask why you don't
want the tumors removed?

344
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,652
God put them there for a reason.

345
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:14,131
You think God needs a telephone
in your head to talk to you?

346
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,532
Isn't he everywhere? It's
not a long-distance call, is it?

347
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,071
This is the way God does
things, through natural law.

348
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,631
If he went around doing big
flashy miracles all the time,

349
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,075
nobody would need faith. How
come everyone else needs faith,

350
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,512
but you just get the guy
screaming his existence in your ear?

351
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,682
Your turn.

352
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,157
Do you think God
wants you to die?

353
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,786
This is the way that the Lord
often is with his chosen ones.

354
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,026
He gives the most trials to
those that he loves the most.

355
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,358
How sweet.

356
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,233
You abdicate your authority,
avoid those tricky parental issues,

357
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,569
like whether to let him drive
at 16. Just let him die at 15.

358
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,600
So, you believe your son is

359
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,342
a saint?

360
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,810
The way I understand it, one of
the hallmarks of a saint is humility.

361
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,885
Now, someone with true humility
would consider the possibility

362
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,958
that God hadn't chosen
him for that kind of honor.

363
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,460
Well, he'd consider
the possibility

364
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,834
that he just had an illness.

365
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,476
You have a gift
for manipulation.

366
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,911
I listen, I have an actual conversation
with people, which, shockingly,

367
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,676
does raise the odds
they'll be cooperative.

368
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,842
That's what I'm saying.

369
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,649
You read that kid and you
manipulated the hell out of him.

370
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,614
Bring pretzels.

371
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,931
I know that knock.

372
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,540
Use your key,
I'm not getting up.

373
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:19,251
Game's not till tomorrow
night and those aren't pretzels.

374
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,118
I took some images of
Grace Palmieri's cancer.

375
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,124
Yeah?

376
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,638
Her tumor's shrunk.

377
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,394
Don't tell my patient.

378
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,865
I want all the records
on miracle woman.

379
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,201
Every test, every
treatment she's ever had,

380
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,705
every question she's ever
answered in this hospital.

381
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:11,335
And anything sent from previous doctors.
Go back to neonatal if you have to.

382
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,375
Which part of "keep them away
from each other" confused you?

383
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,852
They're friends. She
thinks he saved her life.

384
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,392
Now we have obligingly offered
medical proof that his delusions are true.

385
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,792
They've withdrawn
permission for the surgery.

386
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,696
I put the lawyers on
it. Her tumor shrank?

387
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,331
I'm on it.

388
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,595
Tell Jesus that we need another 24
hours to normalize his sodium level.

389
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,334
He's already normalized.

390
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,667
Actually, tell Joseph.
Jesus will know you're lying.

391
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,155
And I want you and
Foreman and Cameron

392
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,910
to go over every line of
every file on that woman.

393
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,746
Isn't he the one we're
supposed to save?

394
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:56,819
The only way to save him is
to prove that she is still dying.

395
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,264
MRI machine checks out.

396
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,961
Maybe the radiologist mis-charted
which machine they used.

397
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,333
I checked both.

398
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,339
This is insane, we're
diagnosing a recovery.

399
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,036
What about six months ago?

400
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,270
Maybe there was a malfunction
in her "before" pictures,

401
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,472
some shadow that made the
tumor look bigger than it really was.

402
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,175
I'll go see what I can find out.

403
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,382
Maybe it's a delayed
effect from radiation.

404
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,354
Sometimes it could take a while.
She hasn't had radiation for six months.

405
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,083
Here. Nowhere. Her records...

406
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,149
There's about a dozen appliances
in every home that give off radiation.

407
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,628
Dosages that wouldn't hurt a hamster
if it was tied to the machine for a year.

408
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,961
If the machine's
operating properly.

409
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,297
Sometimes
remissions just happen.

410
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,800
You think House will
just shrug and say that

411
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,272
if one of us doesn't
check the home?

412
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,501
Kings on nines. MAN: Out.

413
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,764
Thank you.

414
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,871
Wilson. This is a dry cleaner,

415
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:30,914
tax accountant, guy from
the bus stop. This is Wilson.

416
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,450
How come he gets a name?

417
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,644
Seniority. Hello.

418
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,935
Find anything?

419
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,442
Do you have any idea how many
electrical devices give off radiation?

420
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,977
All of them. I'm going
to be here all night.

421
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,478
<i>Everybody's a whiner.</i>

422
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,973
Be a doer, not a me-tooer.

423
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,144
Raise.

424
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,113
I'm out.

425
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,414
<i>She's got at least four
different types of pain pills here</i>

426
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,424
<i>and an LED device.</i>

427
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,662
I'll raise your raise.

428
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,895
Keep looking.

429
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,135
Fold.

430
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,940
You were bluffing, he knew you were
bluffing. Your luck's changing tonight.

431
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,451
So, did they find anything?

432
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,999
Or are you gonna
have to accept the fact

433
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,618
that every now and
then remissions happen?

434
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,246
This call had better
be worth my time.

435
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,752
This is what happens when it's not
our patient. We don't know enough.

436
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,652
That's why you're there.
She's got a boyfriend...

437
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:22,321
Unless you think he's radioactive...
who could show up any minute.

438
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,224
The honor of working for you
is not worth a felony charge.

439
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,992
Give me a minute.

440
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:40,003
I'm saying the odds of you having
a straight flush are pretty low.

441
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,010
House?

442
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,628
I'll fold.

443
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,322
Fold. Fold.

444
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,227
I'm screwed, aren't I?

445
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,644
Nine bucks for a straight flush.

446
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,623
He's not coming home. Relax.

447
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:37,794
There's nothing in this universe
that can't be explained, eventually.

448
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,062
Take this game,

449
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,633
only two people knew
that you wanted in on it.

450
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,242
I didn't tell him...

451
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,878
I told you, I didn't tell
him. Why would you?

452
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,541
No, the only person he's been getting
all intimate and conversational with

453
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,983
is your cancer chick.

454
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,447
How would she know?

455
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,106
The subject of my
poker game isn't likely to

456
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,219
come up in the course
of a patient interview.

457
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,704
Well, that's the kind of
thing that you mention

458
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,391
to someone you're used to
sharing the details of your day with.

459
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,128
Don't.

460
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,194
Your rabbi. Guidance
counselor, parent.

461
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,439
She's not your mom, is she?

462
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,669
I'm seriously saying don't.

463
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,803
You've been having sex...
This is so not the place.

464
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,811
With our miracle woman.

465
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,254
Excuse me. May I talk to you?

466
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:34,857
Of course.

467
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,596
Boyd's getting dressed,
he's ready to check out.

468
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,530
He can't check out
without your permission.

469
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,261
His sodium level
still isn't normal.

470
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,358
I told him.

471
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,530
He said that God said
it was okay, he was fine.

472
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,831
Could you talk to him?

473
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,209
Tell them my name isn't Wilson.

474
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:58,914
Most people in your situation just
have their careers to worry about.

475
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,044
You've got that and
divine retribution.

476
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,314
Tell them.

477
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,827
Tell me how it happened, and
I'll tell them whatever you want.

478
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,760
She'd had a bad day, pain-wise.

479
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,592
Her ride didn't show
up to take her home.

480
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,600
So, you offered? Yeah.

481
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,201
She didn't have any groceries,
she was too sick to go out,

482
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,970
I figured I could afford
to take a half hour

483
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,109
and pick her up a few things...

484
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,739
Stay and make sure
she's okay. Yeah.

485
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,409
And never leave.

486
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,618
You told me you
got an apartment.

487
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,053
But you moved in with
her. You lied to me.

488
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,125
Tell them.

489
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,629
His name is not Wilson and
he's screwed up worse than I am.

490
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,690
Okay. Yes, I lied to you.

491
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:49,858
I'm sorry.

492
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:53,372
You know, half the doctors who specialize
in oncology turn into burned-out cases.

493
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,408
But you, you eat neediness.

494
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,999
Lucky for you.

495
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:02,344
Thanks for the game, guys. I
don't think I'll be coming back.

496
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,144
You're a functional vampire.

497
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,913
Sure, you're heroic,
useful to society,

498
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,645
but only because it feeds you.

499
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,852
There's nothing worth
stealing, so don't even look.

500
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:24,000
You don't just have a fetish for
needy people, you marry them!

501
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:25,934
Here we go. You mean it!

502
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,998
And then time passes, and suddenly
they're not so needy anymore.

503
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,474
Your fault.

504
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,011
You've been there
for them too much.

505
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:36,537
They're getting healthy,
independent and that's just ugly.

506
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:40,319
God, you must be pissed at God
right now, making her all happy.

507
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,786
Why are you doing this?
Because you're being stupid.

508
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,454
You know what you're risking
by sleeping with a patient.

509
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,118
Oh, that's crap.

510
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,628
You're not mad because
I'm risking my job.

511
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,273
You're not even mad
'cause I lied to you.

512
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,562
You're mad because I lied
to you and you couldn't tell.

513
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,898
Yeah. You got me nailed. Yeah.

514
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,602
That's why you didn't want
me in your poker game.

515
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,469
Because when it
comes to being in control,

516
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,305
Gregory House leaves our
faith-healer kid in the dust

517
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,073
and that's why religious
belief annoys you.

518
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,178
Because if the universe
operates by abstract rules,

519
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,478
you can learn them and
you can protect yourself.

520
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,520
If a supreme being exists, he
can squash you any time he wants.

521
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,716
He knows where I am.

522
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,952
I think it's yours.

523
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,320
Yeah.

524
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,595
I'll be right there.

525
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,627
Jesus is spiking a
fever. He's delusional.

526
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,868
Tuberous sclerosis
doesn't cause fever. I know.

527
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,874
I'll drive.

528
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:48,483
Pick any random guy off
the street, bring him in here,

529
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,781
examine him exhaustively, you will
find at least three things wrong with him.

530
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,419
This kid has tuberous
sclerosis, a mild case.

531
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,962
But his tumors are growing.

532
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,931
We assumed that the tumors were
growing, 'cause he's getting sicker.

533
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,525
But he could have grown old and
died and never known about them

534
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,695
if he hadn't come here.

535
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,137
We were looking for something, it's more
or less in the right part of the brain.

536
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,643
It's like we found someone standing
over a dead body holding a gun,

537
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,440
we arrested them,
didn't look any further.

538
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:17,972
Well, sometimes people really do
just stumble into a murder scene.

539
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,314
His fever's 103 and rising.

540
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,981
If we don't do anything, he's gonna be
chatting with God face to face real soon.

541
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,082
Fevers don't come from a
long-term underlying condition.

542
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,391
He's a garden-variety religious nut
who happens to have an infection.

543
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,255
It's lumbar puncture time.

544
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,572
No, no, God told me, no
more of man's medicine.

545
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,864
If we have faith in
him, he'll make me well.

546
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,318
It's just a test. Make me well.

547
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,686
We just want to find
out what's wrong.

548
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,475
God knows what's wrong,
God will take care of it.

549
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,677
He's delirious and he's a minor.
This is your decision and not his.

550
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,563
"The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a treasure hidden in a field,

551
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,785
"which when a man finds, he
hides, and for joy he goes and sells

552
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,655
"all he owns and
buys that field."

553
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,285
Buy all the land you want,
don't blow your brains out.

554
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,207
You're watching your son kill
himself. He's out of his mind with fever...

555
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:10,692
Dad! If your faith
is weak, I will fail.

556
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,802
I need you.

557
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:23,846
I'm sorry, you don't even
know what's wrong with him.

558
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,714
God knows the answer

559
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,716
and I would rather leave
it in his hands than yours.

560
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,092
Wilson.

561
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,161
I need you to do your thing.

562
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,269
You do know that I don't
actually have magical powers.

563
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,670
I have faith.

564
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,209
You're better off trying to slip
some antibiotics into a meal.

565
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,246
Which antibiotics? We don't
know what infection he's got.

566
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,712
Go as broad as
you can. Forget it.

567
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,749
Our best hope is
your silver tongue.

568
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,942
What if it's not an infection?

569
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,154
Were you not paying attention when I
was doing my murder scene metaphor?

570
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,849
What if the tuberous
sclerosis is guilty.

571
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,034
It had the gun in its hands,
it was standing over the...

572
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,185
Doesn't cause fever.

573
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,752
It causes everything else. What if
the fever's the innocent bystander?

574
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,698
The fever could have been set off
by something he picked up anywhere.

575
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,234
It could have been
a bug he got here.

576
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,340
Or a bug he gave here.

577
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,171
He gave it to your patient.

578
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,109
That's why her tumor shrank,
the virus went after the cancer first.

579
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,380
Are you saying a virus
attacked her tumor?

580
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:40,722
For 200 years, there've been reports
of wild viruses that target tumors.

581
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,685
Early 1900s, an Italian medical journal
wrote up a woman with cervical cancer

582
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,507
who was injected with
a weak strain of rabies.

583
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,932
I have no idea why they did
that, but her tumor shrank.

584
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,901
You think he gave her rabies?

585
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:55,202
One of the virus types most prone
to go after cancer cells is herpes.

586
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,266
Herpes encephalitis.

587
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,308
It would fit.

588
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,314
Seizure, low sodium,
even the blurred vision.

589
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,074
And it would
mean, if you're right,

590
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,779
Grace's cancer is coming back.

591
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,251
You're not gonna be
able to convince them.

592
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,301
They don't want any more
tests, they don't wanna...

593
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,453
They can't argue
with the mark of Cain.

594
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:22,628
I'm not going to change my mind.
No more tests. God knows the way.

595
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,168
Okay, let's start
with the shirt.

596
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,236
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

597
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,070
I'm on a mission from God.

598
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,644
If you won't let me
undress you, then strip.

599
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,235
What's he doing?
What's going on?

600
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,781
That woman you helped?
You gave her a virus.

601
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,942
No, she's healed, I have a gift.

602
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,111
A gift is jewelry, socks.

603
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,014
What you have is
herpes encephalitis.

604
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,367
And the only way you
could've transmitted it

605
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,155
is by scratching one
of your own sores

606
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,353
and touching another person.

607
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,521
Herpes, that's something
you get from sex, right?

608
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,862
Either that or cold sores.
Your kid got it from the sex.

609
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,801
No, no. No sores.
No, my body's clean.

610
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,113
They examined me when I came in!

611
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,696
No sores. Herpes hides.

612
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,400
You have an
outbreak, it goes away,

613
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,203
it comes back, goes away. Strip!

614
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,036
Maybe you didn't have a sore when
you came in, but you've got one now.

615
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,877
Dad, I've never,
ever... Do you wonder

616
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:13,214
why a perfect child of God
should feel so desperate

617
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,411
to "purify his body" that he needed to
scarf down a dozen gallons of water a day?

618
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,423
Boyd, is he right?

619
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,450
Dad! No, he's crazy!
Help me! Dr. Wilson, help!

620
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,654
God said no medicine,
no procedures.

621
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,457
Taking off your clothes
doesn't count as either of those.

622
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,832
This one's your call.

623
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,367
Son...

624
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,233
Dad, you have to
have faith in me.

625
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,006
I have faith in the Lord.

626
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,672
You, I trust,

627
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,112
as much as you can
trust a teenage boy.

628
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,987
Take off your clothes.

629
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,228
Relax.

630
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,869
A few Hail Marys,
a little acyclovir,

631
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,338
you'll be picking up
angels again in no time.

632
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,254
Come in.

633
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,659
My father told me I
have to apologize to you.

634
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,234
You still hearing the voices?

635
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,844
You're lucky.

636
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,672
You go through life with a certainty
that what you're doing is right.

637
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,983
I know how comforting that is.

638
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:01,990
Good luck.

639
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,903
You're not gonna
give me my final point?

640
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,578
You knew it was me?

641
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:24,510
Who else?

642
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,456
You don't think God should
get a point knocked off?

643
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,862
The tumor shrank.
Because of a virus.

644
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,009
Do you know what the odds are?

645
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:46,198
She had to have the right type of cancer,
he had to have the right type of virus.

646
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,933
The exposure...
She won the lottery.

647
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,239
You say "won the
lottery," he says "miracle."

648
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,906
Yeah, the hand of God reached into
this kid's pants, made him have sex

649
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,439
so he could scratch a rash and
stick his fingers in some woman's face,

650
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,145
give her a few extra months.

651
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,314
Come on, he's just
another liar and manipulator.

652
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,820
Well, nobody's as
perfect as you are.

653
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,990
It is possible to believe in
something and still fail to live up to it.

654
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,939
So, how's your girlfriend?

655
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,178
She got a little extra
time out of this. Not a lot.

656
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,846
She didn't crash.

657
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:42,021
No. She says she's happier when she
believes in something bigger than she is.

658
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,890
She still believes.

659
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,464
Faith. She's going to Florence.

660
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:48,890
You moving out?

661
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,593
Yeah.

662
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,530
Moving back in with me?

663
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,269
I don't think
that's a great idea.

664
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,235
But we're okay?

665
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,442
House, you are

666
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:09,911
as God made you.
