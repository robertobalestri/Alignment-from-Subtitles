1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,599
Deep-fried shrimp. And lobster.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,334
I never had lobster. What,
do they boil them or grill them?

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,842
Which one's better?
Just get them both.

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,145
And I know I need
a strawberry malt.

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,913
And then there's those chocolate
donuts, they come in a box.

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:23,481
We'll do our best to accommodate.
Tomorrow you'll be moved to a holding cell.

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,254
That's where you'll
get your last meal.

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,657
You also have a constitutional right
to a spiritual advisor of your choice.

9
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,701
No, I don't need none of that.

10
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,531
One last thing to think about.

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,571
After I read the
execution warrant,

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,971
you'll be given an opportunity
to make a statement.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,771
You might wanna take some time
and think about what you wanna say

14
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,607
as your final words.

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,144
Yo, Clarence! You hear that?

16
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,053
A spiritual advisor
of my choice.

17
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,723
Don't matter, you're
going to hell anyway.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,760
You think I'll get
another stay? You should.

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,022
Supreme Court said it
ain't right to kill retards.

20
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,620
Cut the chatter!

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,221
Exercise time.

22
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,018
Be back in an hour. Enjoy.

23
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,808
Huh? What?

24
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,877
Why did you hit me so
many times, Clarence?

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,439
You know why!

26
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,209
You could have stopped. You
stabbed me in the back, man.

27
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,982
Look, I never... You
couldn't fight fair?

28
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,522
Like you did?

29
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,014
I had a wife and three kids.

30
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,859
You were a sick bastard!
Open the door! Open the door!

31
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,227
Clarence!

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,992
What'd I ever do to you, man?

33
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,556
You better stay in this place.

34
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,536
I was just minding
my own business.

35
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,110
You can't go in there.

36
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,208
Who are you? And why
are you wearing a tie?

37
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,846
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
Can I tell her what it's regarding?

38
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,756
Yes. I would like to know why
she gets a secretary and I don't.

39
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,728
I'm her assistant, not her
secretary. I graduated from Rutgers.

40
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,898
I didn't know they had
a secretarial school.

41
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,867
Well, I hope you took some
classes in sexual harassment law.

42
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,997
Does the word "ka-ching" mean
anything to you? I'm going in now.

43
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,470
Dr. House, we are in
the middle of a meeting.

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,376
What's with hiring a male
secretary? J-Date not working out?

45
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,276
He is cute, be careful.

46
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,509
She's not like you, she
can't just walk into a bar

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,143
and pick up her soul
mate in 20 minutes.

48
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,653
I met Mark at a fundraiser
that happened to be held at a...

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,949
You met me at a strip club.

50
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,014
You were the worst $2 I've
ever spent. We'll catch up later.

51
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,390
Stacy, it's House. I
know you can handle it.

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,124
Nothing to handle. He obviously
wants to talk to you alone.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,045
If you have a problem
working with Stacy,

54
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,401
you should have said so.

55
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,339
What was I supposed to do?
Ask her to leave? That's just rude.

56
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,607
Death row guy. I want the case.

57
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,310
How do you even know about him?

58
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,324
You don't have access to
the hospital's mainframe.

59
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,442
No, but Party-Pants does.

60
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,785
You stole my password?

61
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,880
Hardly counts as stealing,
it's a pretty obvious choice.

62
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,893
Well, I have already assigned
"death row guy" to Dr. Nolo.

63
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,063
Nolo? Well, I...

64
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,428
I don't wanna say anything
bad about another doctor,

65
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,524
especially a useless drunk.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,125
You are addicted to pain pills.

67
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,899
Yeah, but I'm not useless.
Tell Nolo I'm taking over.

68
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,304
Dr. Nolo is a
board-certified cardiologist.

69
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,276
Well, good. I'm sure he'll
explore all the usual options

70
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:15,179
for why a guy's heart starts beating
so fast it pumps out air instead of blood.

71
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,149
Wait a second. There
are no usual options.

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,181
How badly do you want this?

73
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,552
I will give you two more
clinic hours this week.

74
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,926
Don't bend over for the soap.

75
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,212
Just the heart, or the patient
have any other complaints?

76
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,432
Patient's not
talking to anybody.

77
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,734
Where are we going?

78
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,741
You are going to the
clinic for two hours.

79
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,140
Me? Why?

80
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,137
Talk to Cuddy.

81
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,546
She's got me going to Mercer
State Prison, Capital Sentences Unit.

82
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,413
Aren't there better
ways to spend our time?

83
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,544
Good question. What
makes a person deserving?

84
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,312
Is a man who cheats on his wife

85
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,256
more deserving than a
man who kills his wife?

86
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,294
Yeah, actually, he is.

87
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,928
What about a child molester?

88
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,521
Certainly not a good guy,
but he didn't kill anybody.

89
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,591
Maybe he can get
antibiotics, but no MRIs.

90
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,858
What about you?

91
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,565
What medical care should you
be denied for being a car thief?

92
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,005
Tell you what. Three
of you work on a list

93
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,409
of what medical treatments a person
loses based on the crime they committed.

94
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,811
I'll review it when I get back.

95
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,385
Your patient shanked one
inmate his first month here.

96
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,787
Broke another one's neck. Nearly
decapitated one of my guards.

97
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,155
Relax. I got a great
bedside manner.

98
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,717
Too dangerous to
house him in the infirmary.

99
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,286
You don't have to worry,
we've taken every precaution.

100
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:41,768
I've had my men clear from the
cell all pens, paper clips, and staplers.

101
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,736
Any supplies that might
be used as a weapon.

102
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,806
Open her up!

103
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,980
For your visit, we've got
him cuffed and shackled.

104
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,887
And yet you're
staying out there.

105
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,822
You're gonna have to give me that.
Wouldn't want anybody to get hurt.

106
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,088
Hi. Hi.

107
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,827
I'm Dr. Cameron.
How you feeling?

108
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,528
Little cough, no big deal.

109
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,594
Okay, then what you doing here?

110
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,573
I just got a job at the university,
they need a health clearance.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,872
Apparently, I'm a little anemic, so
they made me get some more tests.

112
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,412
Any family history of anemia?

113
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,915
Not that I know of. My mom
died of cancer when I was a kid.

114
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,975
My dad's heart gave
out a couple of years ago.

115
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,948
Brothers and sisters?

116
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,218
I'm afraid it's a short
family history. That's it.

117
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,318
I had a husband
once, but it didn't stick.

118
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:46,328
My tests should be
back, probably in that file.

119
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,924
Probably. Yeah.

120
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,868
Is everything okay?

121
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,507
Did you redo the x-ray? Twice.

122
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,776
Well, you don't need a consult.

123
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,352
You know the diagnosis.

124
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,321
All she has is a cough.

125
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,530
Bluish tinge to the
fingernails. Lips.

126
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,400
He's hypoxic. What's that mean?

127
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,335
It means he's not
getting enough oxygen.

128
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,670
You know how people say
you can't live without love?

129
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,103
Well, oxygen's
even more important.

130
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,108
He's got fluid in his
lungs. Breathing rate of 50.

131
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,250
He needs to be intubated,
put on a respirator.

132
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,787
Don't have a respirator.

133
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,722
Better get one in about an
hour, or you're gonna lose him.

134
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,454
I'll make out a requisition. State's
already sentenced this man to die.

135
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,361
I think the state was a tad
more specific about how.

136
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,993
This is Dr. Gregory House.

137
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,043
I need an ambulance
pick-up at Mercer State Prison.

138
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,060
Wasted call, my men
will stop them at the gate.

139
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,804
No way a death row
inmate leaves my prison.

140
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,468
At least, not through
the front doors.

141
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,481
You work fast. So do you.

142
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,953
Was that a shot? Yeah.

143
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,855
It was easy, once I convinced the
clerk to take it to Judge Markham.

144
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,724
She's a sucker for Eighth
Amendment arguments.

145
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,421
Stop, I'm getting turned on.

146
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,655
House!

147
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,228
It was just a consult!

148
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,665
You expect us to shut down
an entire floor for this guy?

149
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,054
Did you do something
to your hair?

150
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,126
Stacy!

151
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,447
You said you
cleared it with her!

152
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,782
Come on, you've
known me how long?

153
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,550
And you still can't tell
when I'm joshing you?

154
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,907
Take him back to
prison. Now. No, can't.

155
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,811
See, ironically, I'm bound by this
court order that your ace attorney got.

156
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,310
I have to make
him all better before

157
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,112
shipping him back
for the state to kill him.

158
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,210
Is it just me, or is that weird?

159
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,152
Anyway, we're walking.

160
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,597
Somebody left this on my chair.

161
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,834
It's clever, 'cause it
forces me to either

162
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,999
deal with the file or
never sit down again.

163
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,902
Cindy Kramer. I told
her you'd see her.

164
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,349
Well, you shouldn't
have told her that.

165
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,241
She's got metastatic squamous
cell lung cancer. Six months tops.

166
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,575
Have you even
looked at the x-ray?

167
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,170
No. Just guessing.

168
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,910
It's a new game. If I'm
wrong, she wins a stuffed bear.

169
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,511
A spot on an x-ray doesn't
necessarily mean that she's terminal.

170
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,681
I love children.
So filled with hope.

171
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,020
It could be pneumonia.
It could be sarcoidosis.

172
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,243
Could be. If she
didn't already have

173
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,927
swollen hilar lymph
nodes on the other lung.

174
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,898
Can we at least
brainstorm for other ideas?

175
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,439
Thank you.

176
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,840
I still think pneumonia
and sarcoidosis.

177
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,542
But, we should
check for tuberculosis

178
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,847
and definitely rule out
congestive heart failure.

179
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,985
Five stages of dying.

180
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,115
Exactly.

181
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,553
Personally, I think it's
all just New Age crap,

182
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,253
but from your tear-filled,
puppy dog eyes,

183
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,821
I think I've made my point.

184
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,392
Now go tell Cindy
whatever-her-name-is that she's dying.

185
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,497
Tachycardia. Pulmonary
edema. Likely suspects?

186
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,875
The death row guy?

187
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,571
That's who you're working
on instead of Cindy?

188
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,945
God, I've got to learn not
to beat around the bush.

189
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,780
By "dying," I meant
no matter what we do.

190
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,380
Very, very soon she is going to
be dead. Is that still too subtle?

191
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,055
I took an oath to "do no harm."

192
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,270
Yeah, but it's not like they
make you sign it or anything.

193
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,661
We cure your patient, he
goes back to death row.

194
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,493
He goes back to
death row, they kill him.

195
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,342
He stays here and we
don't treat him, he dies.

196
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,198
And I still don't treat
"Cindy Lou Who."

197
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,736
Can we get on with this?

198
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,329
Yeah, I knew I could count
on your help for your homie.

199
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,467
Exactly. I'm black. I sympathize
with guys who grew up in the inner city,

200
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,067
kept down by The Man.

201
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,113
- Makes sense to me.
- It's a bunch of crap!

202
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,343
You can't blame society for the
fact that you chose to become a killer.

203
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,907
The guy's probably
a heroin addict.

204
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,715
That explains the tachycardia,
which caused the pulmonary edema.

205
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:04,315
How does an inmate on death
row get his hands on heroin?

206
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,684
Are you serious? HOUSE:
Man knows prisons.

207
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,229
When we got a yachting
question, we'll come to you.

208
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,994
Okay, drugs it is. Test his
hair, blood, urine, works.

209
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,472
Thanks for getting my back.

210
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,789
I thought you seminary boys
were against the death penalty.

211
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,247
I've left the seminary.

212
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,306
Over their stance on
capital punishment?

213
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,249
I'm against the death
penalty in principle.

214
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,117
In practice, however, watching
a murderer die causes me

215
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,123
a lot less grief than
annoying my boss.

216
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,921
We gotta check you
out before you go in.

217
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,206
Department of
Justice statistics show

218
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,222
that it's a racially motivated
form of punishment.

219
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,701
Black defendants are 10 times more
likely to get a death sentence than whites.

220
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,847
Doesn't mean we need to
get rid of the death penalty.

221
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,841
Just means we need
to kill more white people.

222
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,770
It's okay. You're in a hospital,
we're taking care of you.

223
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,077
Stay calm, you hear me?
Push two milligrams Ativan!

224
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,127
Water. Water.

225
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,938
What's the differential
for being thirsty?

226
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,636
He was just a little
dehydrated. And out of his mind.

227
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,603
We upped his saline
drip. He's fine now.

228
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,446
Blood and urine tests came back
clean, no sign of opiates in his system.

229
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,007
Don't do that.

230
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,652
What? You have some House
theory explaining heroin use

231
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,985
despite a negative test? Nope.

232
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,357
Only I get to
write on the board.

233
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,490
So it's not drugs.

234
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,856
What else can cause a
heart to do wind sprints?

235
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,164
You got the blood work back,
anything out of the ordinary?

236
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,901
His bi-carb is low.

237
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,140
Yeah, but which column?

238
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,887
It could be the result of the
tachycardia, or it could be the cause.

239
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,783
It's the cause. Why,
because you want it to be?

240
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,956
Let's see how well that
works with your other patient.

241
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,191
We're just talking
semantics here.

242
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,650
We should put him on a
bi-carb drip and send him back.

243
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,849
Right. Buff his numbers, don't bother
trying to figure out the underlying cause.

244
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,652
I thought you cared
about patients.

245
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,336
Our job isn't to make sure he can
bounce his grandkids on his lap.

246
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,489
Our job is to get him healthy
enough to go back to death row.

247
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,192
Our job is to diagnose him.

248
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:32,931
What?

249
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,908
Mommy and Daddy are having a little fight,
doesn't mean we've stopped loving you.

250
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,501
Now, go outside and play.

251
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,015
Get Daddy some smokes,
and an arterial blood gas test.

252
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,494
That was impressive. Okay,
what number am I thinking of?

253
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,091
Are you trying to get me fired?

254
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:05,070
If you didn't want me working
here, why didn't you just say so?

255
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,801
I just don't want you working
right here, in my office.

256
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,740
But anywhere else in
the building is fine. Oh.

257
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,853
It's a really big hospital.

258
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,574
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk.
There's gonna be some overlap.

259
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,376
God, I hope that
was a euphemism.

260
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,643
Cuddy just reamed me!

261
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,360
I hope that one means
what I think it means.

262
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,477
For trusting you.

263
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,697
She figured when she hired
me she'd at least have someone

264
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:22,848
you couldn't walk all over.

265
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,153
The number was six, by the way.

266
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,992
I need to know, can I trust you?

267
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:35,501
If I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's
approval, my patient would be dead.

268
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,763
Great.

269
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,604
Now I know.

270
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,132
Now we can work together.

271
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,341
I'll be drawing some blood
from your femoral artery.

272
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,146
From my what? Runs
through your groin.

273
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,165
You think you're gonna stick
me in the jewels with that?

274
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,751
It's really closer to your thigh.
Technically at this point, it seems like

275
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,954
your jewels are more for
display purposes anyway.

276
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,554
Hold up, hold up. Gimme
some painkillers or something.

277
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,829
A tough guy like you don't need
them. Forget that, numb me up, man.

278
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,773
You got some gang
ink? Let me see that.

279
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,846
It's a Native American symbol.
It means "the force of life."

280
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,851
That's what you tell all these white
dudes so they let you play doctor.

281
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,889
Yup, got them all fooled.

282
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,249
For real, how a brother like you go from
gang banging to wearing that white coat?

283
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,765
How's a brother like you go from
loving a woman to punching her skull in?

284
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,096
Bitch stepped out.

285
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,512
Sorry about that. Guess I
didn't use enough lidocaine.

286
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:58,350
Blood gas came back with a pH
of 7.28, and decreased HCO-3.

287
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,283
Which means two things.

288
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,846
Most importantly, Cameron
was wrong about the bi-carb.

289
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,893
And less significantly,
we have a new symptom.

290
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,492
Anion gap acidosis.

291
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,630
Who's chubby? Come on,
pretend he loves puppies.

292
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,728
Pretend he's a human
being. What do you got?

293
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,296
I think we should
reconsider drugs.

294
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,275
He already tested negative.
That's why I said reconsider.

295
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,744
Back in juvie, I cut up
oregano and sold it as pot.

296
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,590
Is that how you put
yourself through med school?

297
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,393
What if Clarence thought he was
taking heroin, but it was something else?

298
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,683
What "something else" could
lead to anion gap acidosis?

299
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,313
Mudpiles.

300
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,518
Well, you don't have to ask, just
wash your hands before you come back.

301
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,527
Methanol, uremia, diabetes...

302
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,462
Oh, it's a mnemonic.
That makes sense, too.

303
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,466
Paraldehyde, INH,
Lactic acid... Rewind.

304
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,695
INH? Yahtzee.

305
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,263
Drugs for tuberculosis.

306
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,330
Nearly a quarter of the prison
population is infected with TB.

307
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,538
Clever entrepreneur like Foreman here
chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.

308
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,103
INH poisoning would
explain all the symptoms.

309
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,447
Who wants to head over to the
prison and find Clarence's secret stash?

310
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,190
Fine, I'll do it.
Great! Chase it is.

311
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,023
I assume you have a reason beyond
wanting to make me completely miserable.

312
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,530
You got a prettier mouth.

313
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,466
Better chance the
inmates will open up to you.

314
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,026
<i>Perhaps I'll come out
looking just as monstrous.</i>

315
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,538
<i>I mean, isn't that
what I deserve?</i>

316
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,971
Dr. VIVIAN: <i>John,
it wasn't your fault.</i>

317
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,713
<i>If your father hadn't slipped you those
drugs, you would have never done...</i>

318
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,447
The man's in a coma!

319
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,317
He didn't mind. I asked.

320
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,380
You're getting
crumbs all over him.

321
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,155
Why do you think they put TVs
in coma patients' rooms, anyway?

322
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,253
Some people think
they can still hear.

323
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,491
Well, so leave them a radio.

324
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,895
His eyes are closed.

325
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,970
Who thinks they can see?

326
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,438
Do you know why people
are nice to other people?

327
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,305
Oh, I know this one!

328
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,208
Because people are
good, decent and caring.

329
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,247
Either that, or
people are cowards.

330
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,650
If I'm mean to you, you'll be mean
to me. Mutually-assured destruction.

331
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,516
Exactly. Are you
gonna eat these chips?

332
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,689
Are you gonna get to your point?

333
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,961
You need people to like you.

334
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,329
I don't care if people like me.

335
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,569
Yes, but you need people to
like you because you need people.

336
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,532
Unless you think you can get
the next court order yourself.

337
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:38,476
If Stacy can't trust
you, you can't use her.

338
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,452
And, that's not even dealing with
the greater agenda of getting her

339
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,387
to dump her husband and fall
in love with you all over again.

340
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,495
Dr. BRUCE: <i>We were gonna
be with each other forever!</i>

341
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,323
Look, I know you're friends
with her, but there is a code.

342
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,362
"Bros before hoes, man."

343
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,195
Crap. What is it?

344
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,671
Death row guy is dying.

345
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,509
Bradycardia. His heart
rate's dropped to 30.

346
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,853
It's not gonna hold
out much longer.

347
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,870
You just waiting to call time of death,
or are you gonna give him atropine?

348
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,711
Temporary fix. Right.

349
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,445
Don't know why those diabetics
are all hung up on insulin.

350
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,986
They're just gonna
have to take more.

351
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,045
Atropine's only gonna
buy you a few hours.

352
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,599
We don't even know
what's wrong with him.

353
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,421
Just get out of here.

354
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,729
This is Chase.

355
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,000
Did you beat any
confessions out of anybody?

356
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,564
I haven't spoken to any inmates.

357
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,872
Does anybody do
their jobs anymore?

358
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,005
I decided Clarence's life
isn't worth risking mine for.

359
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,639
Appreciate your candor.

360
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,310
Did you even go to the prison,
or are you just out playing polo?

361
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,250
I'm searching both
of Clarence's cells.

362
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,085
I figured if he's on something,
it's stashed somewhere.

363
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,852
Unless he finished it.

364
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,416
Yeah, that'd be a shame. He
could have shoved it anywhere.

365
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,726
There's envelopes stacked to
the ceiling, bottles of copier toner,

366
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,461
<i>boxes of rubber bands,
paper, file folders.</i>

367
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,297
Call it off.

368
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,837
<i>Come on back.</i>

369
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,017
What's going on?

370
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,952
You're dying.

371
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,230
A man deserves a last drink.

372
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,874
You're okay.

373
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,902
Thanks. That means a lot.

374
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,713
All the tests have
been inconclusive?

375
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,780
Diagnostics is more
of an art than a science.

376
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,855
Should I be worried right now?

377
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,064
I work for one of the top
diagnosticians in the country.

378
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,591
We're pouring all of our
energy into figuring this out.

379
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,902
I thought you convicts
knew how to drink.

380
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,732
You're at least
three shots behind.

381
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,276
Now you're four shots behind.

382
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,588
You better get me the next
one, or I'm gonna kill you.

383
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,290
House.

384
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,899
I was just waiting for
test results, I was...

385
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,802
Little busy right now.
Getting my drink on.

386
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,673
Unbelievable.

387
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,311
That's the finest piece
I've seen in 10 years.

388
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,944
I could've hit that.

389
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,607
And you didn't?

390
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,221
Man, you're the one
that should be locked up.

391
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,292
Tell me something. I've
been trying to figure this out.

392
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,789
Why does a guy
who's on death row

393
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,259
suddenly try to off himself?

394
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,798
I know you drank
that copier fluid.

395
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:33,369
It's not as visually dramatic as slitting
your wrists with a homemade shiv,

396
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,346
but it will do the trick.

397
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,753
It just hit me all of a sudden.

398
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,690
It was like, they tell me
when to eat, when to sleep,

399
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,523
when to walk, when
to talk, everything.

400
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,865
I had to take control
of something, right?

401
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,269
When to die.

402
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:02,002
I figured that was
as good as anything.

403
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,782
And that thought just
came to you, just like that?

404
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,315
Man, I told you, for 23 hours...

405
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,016
Look, here's the good news.

406
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,052
The copier fluid you drank

407
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:27,800
contains about 90% methanol,
which is very poisonous,

408
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,927
and you took more than
enough to kill yourself.

409
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,331
The bad news is, the
alcohol you just drank

410
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:39,438
contains so much ethanol
that it's going to bind with that

411
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,911
nasty formic acid
rampaging through your body,

412
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,817
hence you're just
gonna pee it out.

413
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,951
Harmlessly.

414
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,653
Man, you are drunk.

415
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:58,130
Yes, I am. I also
saved your life.

416
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,662
At least for now.

417
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,210
Morning! Your head hurts?

418
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,349
No, you just have
a very grating voice.

419
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,048
You always were a lightweight.

420
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,615
Why are you talking to me?

421
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,753
Can't it be enough that I
wanna cause you pain?

422
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,696
The patient's okay now,
you're gonna send him back?

423
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,165
Absolutely.

424
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,377
Can I trust you? You used to.

425
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:54,283
I still think the patient's
sick. I'm keeping him here.

426
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,221
Yeah. Either you can do your
job and keep the hospital informed,

427
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,690
or you can help me make
sure the hospital is not informed

428
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,556
and buy me some time.

429
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,123
Have you done a
CT? Yeah, I have.

430
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,459
With contrast?

431
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:14,235
She's done everything she needs to do
except tell her patient that she's dying.

432
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,602
I told you, only I get to
play with the markers.

433
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,671
Our prisoner has a new symptom.

434
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,412
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying
until the diagnosis is confirmed.

435
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm not buying that Clarence

436
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,719
was trying to take control
of his life by suicide.

437
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,089
Healthy people
don't kill themselves.

438
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,752
Healthy people
don't kill other people.

439
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:39,390
Guy just filed an appeal in a state
that hasn't actually killed anybody

440
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,161
in about 30 years.

441
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,169
What if it wasn't suicide?
What if it was an escape plan?

442
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,934
Drink enough methanol to get transferred
to a hospital, try to escape from here.

443
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,030
Excellent.

444
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,374
Explains everything except
the symptom that got him here.

445
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,846
His heart went nuts before
he got stuck in that storage cell

446
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,849
and chugged a toner martini.

447
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,351
I think there's something
going on in his head.

448
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,912
Check for intracranial lesions, brain
infections, autoimmune diseases,

449
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,790
do a CT, LP, full workup.
State's paying, so go nuts.

450
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,526
Where'd you get these scars?

451
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,730
I got shivved my first month
in. After I healed up, I got mines.

452
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,502
You guys still think I'm sick?

453
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,939
Obviously.

454
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,435
Why do you care? Why
don't you just let me die?

455
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,707
Well, I'm different than you.

456
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,408
Right. You love me
like your own mama.

457
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,552
That's why the nurse says you kicked
her out when my heart nearly stopped.

458
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,350
Take a deep breath.

459
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,490
Any family history
of mental illness?

460
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,030
I always heard my pop was
crazy, I never met the man.

461
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,259
With my mom, it was the drugs.

462
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,800
Any siblings?

463
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,366
I got a brother, pretty
much raised him on my own.

464
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,907
Inspirational story. He
doing time, too? Hey...

465
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:01,914
He's a good kid. Don't go
judging what you don't know.

466
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,477
How's his health?

467
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:10,279
I haven't heard from
him since I went inside.

468
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,456
Spent 16 years with him,
changed his damn diapers.

469
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,995
Can you imagine your whole life

470
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:23,034
being all about the
worst thing you ever did?

471
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,810
You killed four people.

472
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,642
And somehow making mac
and cheese just the way he wants

473
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,012
kind of loses its significance.

474
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,153
Oh, no. Now you've left
your entire body in my chair.

475
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,861
What does that mean you want?

476
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,557
I need a segmental
bronchoalveolar lavage.

477
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,725
I take it the CT with
contrast came back?

478
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,599
They're not definitive.
Biopsy would be.

479
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,699
Biopsy would be
invasive and unnecessary.

480
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,933
And definitive.

481
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,647
But you don't want definitive, you
want to hang onto your delusions

482
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,700
as long as you can.

483
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,746
A lavage could
prove it's not cancer.

484
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,443
But you need me to approve
the procedure. Must be a bitch.

485
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,919
The answer is no. Why?

486
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,648
Because it's me?

487
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,325
I'm over you! I've jumped
on the bandwagon.

488
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,257
And I hate you, okay?

489
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,629
Great. Let's treat her.

490
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,530
What is it?

491
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,904
You won't help Cindy, but you're
obsessed with this piece of dirt!

492
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,449
Are you just trying to prove that
who someone is doesn't matter,

493
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,375
or that all that matters
is your stupid puzzle?

494
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,474
Fine.

495
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:47,809
Treat them the same,
that's all I'm asking.

496
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,018
One test.

497
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,751
Wow.

498
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,822
That is remarkable.

499
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,328
According to those patchouli
oil-selling New Agers,

500
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,734
it's supposed to be
the terminal patient,

501
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,895
but you're going
through the five stages.

502
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,503
You just made a completely
seamless transition from anger

503
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,131
to bargaining.

504
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,644
Cover two more
of my clinic hours,

505
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,572
and you can have
your one procedure.

506
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,688
No lesions, no aneurysms.

507
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:32,189
Ironically, the mind of a
killer looks completely normal.

508
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,825
If someone asked you
to describe me to them,

509
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,598
what's the first
thing you'd tell them?

510
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,000
Insecure.

511
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,103
What are you asking?

512
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,943
Like if you were setting
me up on a blind date.

513
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,472
Would you describe me to the
girl as the black guy? A neurologist?

514
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,214
Car thief?

515
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:55,420
This guy's really
getting to you, isn't he?

516
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,046
There's no sign of infection.

517
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:31,446
You're gonna have
to do the biopsy.

518
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,920
Your death row guy's still here.

519
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,431
Yeah, sorry. I've just
gotta get him stabilized.

520
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,865
Probably keep him on fluids for a
few more hours, then off he goes.

521
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,962
Oh, yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring
that you still think he's sick.

522
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:53,172
Figuring requires deductive reasoning.
I'm figuring that you did no figuring.

523
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:58,143
Stacy just ratted me out, right?
So much for attorney-client privilege.

524
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,884
I'm the client, you moron.
Stacy has a duty to this hospital.

525
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:04,513
Right. I'm sending
him back to prison.

526
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,319
Can't. Court order.

527
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,854
Court order says he has
to be declared healthy.

528
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,659
Doesn't specify which doctor
needs to make that declaration.

529
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,531
What is it, Clarence? My gut!

530
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,161
Would you describe
it as a shooting pain?

531
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,739
A throbbing pain?

532
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:24,641
Or maybe an imaginary pain because
you don't want to go back to prison?

533
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,237
Where does it hurt? My gut,
I feel like I'm getting stabbed!

534
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,748
Well, he'd know.
Let me take a look.

535
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,615
Oh, so everybody lies
except a convicted murderer?

536
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,027
I don't think he's
faking this stuff.

537
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,126
What do you think, Doctor?

538
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,346
I didn't have any choice.

539
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,992
No, you had to tell Cuddy.
She's your boss, I get it.

540
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,664
Hitler thought he was
doing the world a favor, too.

541
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,723
Yeah, pretty much
on that same level.

542
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,702
Gandhi didn't march to the sea
because his buddies asked him to.

543
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,864
Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers
because he wanted to make friends.

544
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,465
You're not making
friends right now.

545
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,742
I trusted you. I know.

546
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,708
Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.

547
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,615
I had to do what I
thought was right.

548
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,125
It's the only reason
anybody does anything.

549
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:54,396
Surgery went fine. They removed
almost a foot of necrotic bowel.

550
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,901
They're shackling him and
taking him into recovery.

551
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,231
I wonder.

552
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,667
I wonder why Clarence
killed that second inmate?

553
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,546
Fine, I'll bite. What the
hell are you talking about?

554
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,343
Everything we do

555
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,582
is dictated by motive.
Why did he kill his girlfriend?

556
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,555
Because he's a maniac!
Is that the reason he gave?

557
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,591
She was cheating on him.

558
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,789
Jealousy. That gets
him sent to prison.

559
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,527
Where he kills inmate
number one. Why?

560
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,100
Guy attacked him first.

561
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:31,931
Revenge.

562
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,734
Who'd he kill after
that? Prison guard.

563
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,035
Who had a file full
of abuse complaints.

564
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,476
Probably been kicking
Clarence's ass for months.

565
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,878
Clarence is just ridding
the world of bad seeds.

566
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,746
We'll call that one retribution.

567
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,618
Then he kills inmate number two.

568
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:51,648
Anybody know why?

569
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,481
Uh-uh.

570
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,220
It's not in there.

571
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,568
All of a sudden, I
gotta have a reason?

572
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,969
It's an anomaly.
Doctors love anomalies.

573
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,432
Dark spot on an x-ray,
bright spot on an MRI.

574
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,943
Killing that second inmate

575
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:18,143
was the homicidal equivalent
of blood in the urine. It doesn't fit.

576
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:22,046
I'm interested in
things that don't fit.

577
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,055
Tell me why you did it.

578
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,824
Your other victims you
were almost bragging about.

579
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,232
What was different
about this guy?

580
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,972
It happened when
I was in gen pop.

581
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,268
I was in the
library, just reading.

582
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:54,116
And I started feeling real
nervous. This guy was staring at me.

583
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,284
I could feel his eyes digging
holes in the back of my neck.

584
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,686
Made me feel crazy.

585
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,096
Sweat was pouring down my face.

586
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:10,328
I could hear my heartbeat
racing in my ears.

587
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,435
I just raged out on the dude.

588
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,575
So what's the
differential for raging out?

589
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,413
Excess testosterone,
steroids. Adrenalin?

590
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,750
Prep Clarence for surgery.
Care to share with the class?

591
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,815
Oh, come on, do I have to spell it
out for you? Pheochromocytoma.

592
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,292
Actually, I'm not
sure how you spell it.

593
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,989
But you said it
yourself, adrenalin.

594
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,555
Pheochromocytoma sits
on top of the adrenal gland,

595
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,067
randomly spits out oodles
of the stuff. It's perfect.

596
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:46,662
It explains everything, the tachycardia,
pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that

597
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,001
caused the necrotic bowel.

598
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,907
Even explains how he had the
strength to rip the rail off his bed.

599
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,672
But pheo's extremely
rare. I love rare.

600
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,672
Set up an MRI. Where's Cameron?

601
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,811
Like I don't know.

602
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,017
Dr. Cameron, could I
borrow you for a consult?

603
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,995
Bittersweet thing about being
head of the Oncology Department,

604
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,588
I get cc'd on all
the biopsy results.

605
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,031
Yeah, I know.

606
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,527
She's terminal. Yeah.

607
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,263
So I take it you were
in there informing her?

608
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,072
Well, I hadn't exactly gotten
around to that, but I was just...

609
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,409
Doing what? Making friends?

610
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:31,677
Cindy's divorced.

611
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,686
She doesn't have any kids, no
siblings, both her parents are gone...

612
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,190
It's not your job to be her
friend! Do you understand?

613
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,121
And it's not worth it.

614
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:44,593
She feels better her final few days,
and you're not the same, maybe for years.

615
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,258
You don't think it's worth
it? I know it's not worth it.

616
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,729
My husband...

617
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,139
I met him just after he was
diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

618
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:09,454
If I hadn't married
him... He was alone.

619
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:15,122
When a good person dies, there
should be an impact on the world.

620
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,895
Somebody should notice.

621
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,421
Somebody should be upset.

622
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,803
"Pheo" what?

623
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,605
I don't even remember.

624
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,736
It's just a fancy way of saying
"small, adrenalin-secreting tumor."

625
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,843
Yeah, that clarified it for you.

626
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:41,447
All you need to know is,
if I'm right, we can fix it.

627
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,545
Just gotta find it first.

628
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,581
We need an MRI.

629
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,053
It's completely
painless for most people.

630
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,651
But not for me?

631
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,726
I assume you got
those tattoos in prison.

632
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,662
Prison tats often contain
inks with heavy metals.

633
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,635
The MRI is basically
a giant magnet,

634
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,764
suck those metallic
inks right out of your skin.

635
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,723
Stop squirming.

636
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,361
Don't make us do this again.

637
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,903
Big baby.

638
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,531
Still don't see anything.

639
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,343
Turn it off!

640
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,536
There's Waldo.

641
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,511
Found it, Clarence.

642
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,050
Turn it off!

643
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,151
Turn this damn thing off!

644
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,213
Keep him in there until
you guys see it, too.

645
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,283
Son of a bitch.

646
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,229
Looks like they got the
pheo out successfully.

647
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,063
So, what now?

648
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,070
Clarence goes back to death row.

649
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,668
Just like that?

650
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,478
He's cured.

651
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,115
That tumor caused
random shots of adrenalin,

652
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,642
which obviously led to the rage attacks
that made him become a murderer

653
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,279
in the first place.

654
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,982
My God, you're right!

655
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,583
Let's call the surgeons,
we gotta save that tumor.

656
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,889
Put it on the witness stand.

657
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,590
We could testify at
Clarence's appeal.

658
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:37,093
You smell that? I think
that is the stink of hypocrisy.

659
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,371
You wouldn't even consider the
notion that Clarence's social upbringing

660
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,875
was responsible for what he became, but
now you're sprinting to the witness stand

661
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,501
to blame everything
on a little tumor.

662
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,307
A person's upbringing and their
biology are completely different.

663
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,403
Yeah.

664
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,376
Because you only
overcame one of them.

665
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,453
Well, let's just give
Clarence a free pass.

666
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,281
Which is probably gonna piss
off all those other pheo sufferers

667
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,190
who managed to
control their rage attacks

668
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,753
and become lawyers, race
car drivers, or even doctors.

669
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:10,329
Removing that tumor puts a stop
to those random shots of adrenalin.

670
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,603
It doesn't absolve him.

671
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,332
You want him to be executed?

672
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,668
That's not what I'm saying.

673
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,135
Got an opinion?

674
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,006
