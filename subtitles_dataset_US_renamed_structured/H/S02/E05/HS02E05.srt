1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,598
I ought to have this framed.

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,671
My last bill from Princeton.

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,392
And I thought we
were celebrating

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,211
the fact that I
actually graduated.

5
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,875
I always knew you'd
be able to graduate.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,751
What I didn't know was whether
I would be able to pay for it.

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,690
Your mom, she'd
be so proud of you.

8
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,918
You always say that.

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,965
I'm so proud of you. Always was.

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,334
Come on, Dad, you're gonna cry.

11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,101
You wanna be
embarrassed? You got it!

12
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,413
Look, don't party
too hard tonight.

13
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,963
Your grandmother wants a
picture of you getting that sheepskin,

14
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,227
and it'd be nice if you didn't
look completely hung over.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,553
Oh, no, don't worry,

16
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,354
I've had enough
alcohol in the past week

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,951
to last me another four years.

18
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,826
Good, I think.

19
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,731
Drink! Drink! Drink!

20
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,210
More! More! Drink! Drink! Drink!

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,512
12:55!

22
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,483
Man!

23
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,789
You are the man! Tell
me something I don't know!

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,731
Hey, that's not
funny, man. What?

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,928
Yeah, right, you shocked
me. With what? I got nothing.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,600
Well, hey, whoever's
doing that better cut it out!

27
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,246
What the hell's going on?

28
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,730
Maybe there's a short somewhere,
the floor's covered with beer.

29
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,965
No way, no, the outlets are GFI,

30
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,457
plus he's got
rubber-soled shoes on.

31
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,887
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody call 911!

32
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,207
Patient experiences
shock-like sensations

33
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,212
as well as headaches,
nausea, and drowsiness.

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,674
Shocks?

35
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,848
Excruciatingly painful shocks.

36
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,680
ER docs referred
him to a neurologist,

37
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,277
who referred him to five other
doctors in the last seven days.

38
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,085
Shocks could be Lhermitte's
sign. Early symptom of MS.

39
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,319
No. MRI showed no
white matter lesions,

40
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,918
and the shocks aren't
accompanied by neck flexing.

41
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,055
Good morning! It's almost noon.

42
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,292
Really? That must
be why I'm so hungry.

43
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,425
Who's up for lunch?

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,968
What's with the jacket?

45
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,494
It keeps me warm and
cool. How does it know?

46
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,083
We're discussing
your new patient.

47
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,886
Must be a boring discussion, seeing
as I haven't accepted a new patient.

48
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,005
You accepted him the
moment I loaned you 5 grand.

49
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,647
Oh, wait, wait.

50
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,427
When I said I'd do anything for
the money, obviously I didn't mean it.

51
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,250
You're gonna like this. The kid's
getting shocked every few minutes.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,879
Why would you need $5,000?

53
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,720
Bad night at poker, or
great night with a hooker?

54
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,316
Thank you for
saving me the trouble

55
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,386
of deflecting that personal
question with a joke.

56
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,463
College student?

57
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,763
Nitrous oxide's fun at parties.

58
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,235
Caused the shocks, and
drinking till we puke every night

59
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,396
can cause everything else.

60
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,071
Give him some B12.
Been there, done that.

61
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,076
Also ruled out cancer,
MS, pyridoxine toxicity,

62
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,236
and all the popular
neuropathies.

63
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,913
Cervical spondylosis. Doesn't
explain the low white count.

64
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,279
He's black.

65
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,376
I'm assuming he's not just really
dirty, but is of African descent,

66
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,996
which means he'd
have a lower white count.

67
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,353
Not this low. He's a wrestler.

68
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,221
Probably uses
diuretics to cut weight.

69
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,602
That can also cause
low white count.

70
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,492
Not this low. "Not this low."

71
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,189
Behcet's. No skin lesions.

72
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,495
Cervical herpes zoster,
myelitis... No external outbreak.

73
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,633
Something's missing.
Find out what it is.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,932
I don't even know what
that means. Well, figure it out.

75
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,740
Find it out, and then
find me. I'll be at lunch.

76
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,181
- No ideas?
- Lots of ideas.

77
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,018
Too many ideas, that's
why so many tests.

78
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,180
Have you used any
recreational drugs?

79
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,456
What? I'm gonna get mad
at you for getting stoned?

80
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,492
Not today, not here.

81
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,661
At Christmas, one of the
guys had some ecstasy,

82
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,795
I mean, I... It was...

83
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,472
Son of a bitch!

84
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,780
ANA is negative
for lupus, again.

85
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,311
House wants more information, not
the same information done over again.

86
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,448
"Find what's missing."

87
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,118
For all we know, the kid is
dying and he's giving us riddles?

88
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,594
Did a more detailed history,
went back three generations.

89
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,358
And? His mom died
in a car accident,

90
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,490
his mom's mom had arthritis,
and his mom's mom's dad

91
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,092
served in an all-black
tank battalion under Patton.

92
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,660
Fascinating. If it's not a
tumor, it has to be MS.

93
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,830
Wilson already ruled out...

94
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,272
MRI can't rule out
MS 100% of the time.

95
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,470
MS doesn't explain the low
white count. Alcoholism does.

96
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,106
On admission, his BAC was
2.0, liver enzymes off the chart.

97
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,117
It was graduation weekend. He
barely drank in the weeks before that,

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,517
and he didn't drink at all
during his wrestling season.

99
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,556
If you believe him.
I did a tox screen...

100
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,462
It doesn't matter if she believes
him or not, it's already in the chart.

101
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,017
We're supposed to
find out what's missing.

102
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,831
Well, this... This is perfect.

103
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,738
Invite me to dinner
on Thursday night.

104
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,675
Come on, we haven't had
a nice meal together since...

105
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,441
Yesterday, when I loaned
you $5,000 to buy a new car.

106
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,776
My treat.

107
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,812
Two-wheeled vehicles
that travel 150 miles an hour

108
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,085
don't really go well with crippled,
irresponsible drug addicts.

109
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,059
Actually, two-wheeled vehicles that
go 180 miles an hour do not go well

110
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,119
with healthy,
responsible architects

111
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,290
who don't know how to
separate braking and turning.

112
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,891
Good news is, it brings
the price right down.

113
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,493
You're taking it back. Mom!

114
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,274
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Forget dinner, you're gonna kill yourself!

115
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,810
Nice bike! Thank you.

116
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,573
See, that's how you do
it. Compliments, dinner.

117
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,183
What do you do with your cane?

118
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,116
If he buys me
dinner, he'll find out.

119
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,783
Evel Knievel had the same setup.

120
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,521
And he broke every
bone in his body.

121
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,053
We went through all the imaging
studies and redid the blood cultures.

122
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,862
I don't want hand-me-downs,
I want brand-new stuff.

123
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,132
Well, there's nothing...
There's nothing missing!

124
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,798
Sorry, I didn't
catch that last part!

125
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,375
There's... There's...

126
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,751
There's nothing else we can do.

127
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,945
Did you check the
police report? On what?

128
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,419
On his mom's car accident.

129
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,854
That was 15 years ago.
The kid wasn't even in the car.

130
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,449
She veered off a straight,
dry road in broad daylight.

131
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,636
That doesn't seem odd to you?

132
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,323
She probably got distracted
changing radio stations or something.

133
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,607
That's what the police thought.

134
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,831
Of course, they didn't know
that she has a family member

135
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,859
who is frequently incapacitated
by shock-like sensations.

136
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,065
A genetic component seems
unlikely. But it's interesting.

137
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,472
Type II neurofibromatosis
could cause the shocks.

138
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,010
You knew this was missing?

139
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,706
I knew something was missing,
maybe this, maybe something else.

140
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,079
Get a DNA analysis of the
long arm of chromosome 22.

141
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,322
You'd rather have dinner
with your wife? Yes, I would.

142
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,292
If she were speaking to me.

143
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,128
Unlike her, I could
make it worth your while.

144
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,092
Fine.

145
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,291
Shall I drive?

146
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,427
No.

147
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,138
And I'm not letting you in
my car until I see your wallet.

148
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,202
NF2. It's an inherited disease.

149
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,774
It could cause abnormal
growths on the cranial nerves.

150
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,627
It would explain the
shocks and other symptoms.

151
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,620
DNA analysis will
show whether your son

152
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,519
has the specific
chromosome mutation

153
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,682
which causes the disease.

154
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,818
But if it's inherited, that means
someone else in our family would have it.

155
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,452
We think your wife
may have had it.

156
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,054
No. She never had any
sort of health problems.

157
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,532
No odd-looking freckles,
nodules in the iris?

158
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,796
Nothing. I mean, why
would you think she was sick?

159
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,964
We think it may have been
what caused her car accident.

160
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,835
Wait, what do you mean? My
mom's car was hit by a drunk driver.

161
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,503
That's not what the
police report indicated.

162
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,638
Well, you must have
gotten the wrong report.

163
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,181
No. They didn't.

164
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,318
When you started driving...

165
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,428
You lied about how Mom died?

166
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,943
I figured if her death could
somehow mean something, it...

167
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,334
How does lying about
it mean something?

168
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,330
How could you use her
like that, Dad? Her death?

169
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,501
I was just trying to protect
you. What else isn't true?

170
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,772
She wasn't a teacher,
you just wanted me to read?

171
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,245
What's that smell?

172
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,908
I don't smell...

173
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,580
We're gonna need a nurse.

174
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,625
What the hell? It's
okay. We'll take care of it.

175
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,454
You didn't feel anything?

176
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
No.

177
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,523
You feel that? Yeah.

178
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,033
But you didn't feel any of this?

179
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,468
No.

180
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,014
Sphincter paralysis plus shocks
equals Miller Fisher Syndrome.

181
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,415
Not if you add the stool sample,

182
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,885
which is negative for <i>C. jejuni.</i>

183
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,821
He lied to his son
about how his mom died?

184
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,885
He was just protecting him.

185
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,153
Manipulating him.

186
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,056
That's what parents do. They
lie to us because they love us.

187
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,324
Who's getting teary?

188
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,728
Mom's death is irrelevant.

189
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,596
DNA revealed no NF2 markers

190
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,225
or any other inherited disease.

191
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,998
Apparently, she really
did fall asleep at the wheel.

192
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,631
So, what exactly are
we talking about here?

193
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,610
A little peeker, or did the prairie
dog actually come out to play?

194
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,146
Excuse me? Are
we talking explosive?

195
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,416
The hemoccult was
negative for blood,

196
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,251
and I wouldn't say he actually
exploded. More like gushed?

197
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,616
Good, then we're
getting somewhere.

198
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,851
Yeah? Where?

199
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,654
I have no idea.

200
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,984
Of course. Hello?

201
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,223
Love the riddles. Hi, Mom.

202
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,367
Look, I have a business dinner on
Thursday night. I can't get out of it.

203
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,904
I know, I really
wanted to see you, too.

204
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,875
Actually, can I call you back?
I'm in a meeting right now.

205
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,275
Okay, thanks.

206
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,239
Who was that?

207
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,645
Angelina Jolie.

208
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,580
I call her "Mom."
Who thinks that's sexy?

209
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,245
So, explosive or gushing...

210
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,483
She never calls here,
is everything okay?

211
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,425
Great, yeah.

212
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,988
My dad's taking her to Europe.

213
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,463
They got a nine-hour layover
in Newark on Thursday.

214
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,968
If it's gastrointestinal... You lied
to avoid seeing your own mom.

215
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,766
Are you kidding? I
can't lie to my mom.

216
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,670
Seriously, I can't.

217
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,139
Wilson's invited me to dinner.

218
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,677
It'd be rude to stand up a guy
who just loaned me 5 grand.

219
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,507
Transverse myelitis.

220
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,080
Could cause numbness,
anal sphincter dysfunction,

221
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,172
and the shocks.

222
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,946
Thank you for taking
no interest in my mother.

223
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,384
But that begs the question,

224
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,615
what caused the
transverse myelitis?

225
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,124
Well, we've ruled
out cancer and MS.

226
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,352
Leaves infection.

227
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,003
If there was infection,
there'd be a fever.

228
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,928
And his blood and CSF
cultures are all negative.

229
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,194
Maybe the infection's gone
but the memory remains.

230
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,458
Molecular mimicry.

231
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,768
Nice.

232
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,807
Okay, get an immunoglobulin
level and electrophoresis.

233
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,373
You're good, my friend.
I'm sure we'll meet again.

234
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,912
Do you really think that
was his mom on the phone?

235
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,545
Probably, don't know
why he'd lie about that.

236
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,745
Who cares?

237
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,417
You're not the least bit curious
what his parents are like?

238
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,857
I'm sure his mom's
a piece of work.

239
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,622
Only a mother could
do that much damage.

240
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,424
My bet's he was
born the way he is.

241
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,736
Probably tormented his
parents, not the other way around.

242
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,324
Yeah, he was either a fast
runner or one hell of a fighter.

243
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,165
Where are you going?

244
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,701
You guys can
handle the tests, right?

245
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,178
Is there something important that you
and House need to discuss over dinner?

246
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,114
Other than the skyrocketing

247
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,049
interest rates on
personal loans?

248
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,884
You know, this is the fourth
time I've loaned him money.

249
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,049
Not lunch money, money-money.

250
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,217
House's parents.

251
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,351
They have a layover in
Newark Thursday evening.

252
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,460
I'm canceling dinner. No.

253
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,997
I thought maybe you could
just invite a few more people.

254
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,637
An infectious agent's
molecular structure

255
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,369
can resemble the spinal cord's.

256
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,377
And when the immune
system attacks the infection,

257
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,073
it ends up attacking
the spinal cord's as well.

258
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,808
So he has an infection?

259
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,975
They just said I don't.

260
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,713
Even after the infection is
gone, it goes right on attacking

261
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,163
because the spinal
cord is still there.

262
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,227
Is there a treatment?

263
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,450
Depends on what the
original infection was.

264
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,457
All right, you're done.

265
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,053
You need to lay flat after a
lumbar puncture for about an hour.

266
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,097
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

267
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,565
Hey, Dad, can you
get me a Coke, please?

268
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,625
Yeah, that usually helps.

269
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,603
You're done.

270
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,035
If you're nauseous...

271
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,667
No, I'm not nauseous. I
just want him out of here.

272
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,372
He's your dad. He's
gonna be around.

273
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,978
Yeah, I know.

274
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,916
It's not that, it's...

275
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,450
Are these people
completely incapable

276
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,886
of telling the truth
to each other?

277
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,288
He went to Jamaica
with his friends.

278
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,722
No wonder he lied.

279
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,019
Children aren't supposed
to have good times.

280
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,927
One of his friends
flew them down.

281
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,125
Carnell's dad has this thing about
him accepting stuff from rich friends.

282
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,261
He wants him to remember
who he is, where he came from.

283
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,463
Where have you been?

284
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,097
Making dinner plans. What's up?

285
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,335
The boys have
uncovered the shocking fact

286
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,402
that the patient has a crappy
relationship with his dad.

287
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,573
They seem to actually
care. Well, I don't.

288
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,139
There's only one reason any
kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.

289
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,584
It wasn't for marijuana. He
doesn't do anything but drink.

290
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,018
He said that to you or his pops?

291
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,113
Tox screen was negative for THC.

292
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,625
Spring break was
over a month ago.

293
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,069
Even pot would have
washed out by now.

294
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,459
Even if he'd smoked,

295
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,020
no way marijuana
causes transverse myelitis.

296
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,828
True. But the stuff
they put on it does.

297
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,293
Pesticides.

298
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,463
Well, why would he come clean
about the trip but lie about smoking pot?

299
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,167
He wouldn't necessarily have to
smoke to get pesticide poisoning.

300
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,176
He could have eaten
fruit that'd been sprayed,

301
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,303
or been exposed
through his skin on a hike.

302
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,007
Or he could have
smoked it. A lot of it.

303
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,641
Then lied about it because
that's what this family does.

304
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,118
Start him on IV pralidoxime.
Two grams per liter,

305
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,985
and then one gram every eight
hours until you see some improvement.

306
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,889
You have no evidence to
support a poisoning diagnosis.

307
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,417
Which is why it's gonna be so
cool when I turn out to be right.

308
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,394
Cameron.

309
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,196
Who are you making
dinner plans with?

310
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,695
No one.

311
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,309
You bastard.

312
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,780
You invited my
parents to dinner.

313
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,975
Cameron's got a big mouth.

314
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,110
Not as big as yours.

315
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,281
Hey! You used me to
avoid seeing your parents.

316
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,599
Well, what do you care? I don't.

317
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,701
I just thought it might be
interesting to find out why.

318
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,217
You could've just
asked. You would've lied.

319
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,057
And you would've believed me.

320
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,689
Which would've
kept us both happy.

321
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,632
You want your money back?
Is that what this is about?

322
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,761
No!

323
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,634
Wait, have you got the money?

324
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,114
If you have the money, then
why did you need the loan?

325
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,582
I didn't. I just wanted to
see if you'd give it to me.

326
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,516
I've been borrowing
increasing amounts

327
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,714
ever since you lent
me $40 a year ago.

328
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,248
A little experiment,

329
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,258
to see where you draw the line.

330
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:37,420
You're trying to
objectively measure

331
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,557
how much I value our friendship?

332
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,430
Hey, it's 5 grand. You've
got nothing to be ashamed of.

333
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,564
So, what do you say? One
little phone call, one big check?

334
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,101
Fine.

335
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,872
Thanks.

336
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,605
Now, be a grownup

337
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,945
and either tell Mommy and
Daddy you don't wanna see them,

338
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,542
or I'm picking you
up at 7:00 for dinner.

339
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,218
What do you mean?
You just said that... I lied.

340
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,383
I've been lying to you
in increasing amounts

341
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,485
ever since I told you you looked
good unshaved a year ago.

342
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,223
It's a little
experiment, you know,

343
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,094
to see where you draw the line.

344
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,864
How's the patient?

345
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,372
Haven't been in yet, today.

346
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,772
As long as he hasn't
gotten any worse.

347
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,871
We're treating him
for pesticide poisoning

348
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,641
without any proof of pesticides.

349
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,976
I'm gonna have a hell of a time

350
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,482
explaining that to our lawyer.

351
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,576
I told House not to...

352
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,315
Wow.

353
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,158
Lawyer's not gonna believe this.

354
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,623
He's got his appetite back.

355
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,830
Whatever you did, it's working.

356
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,192
He's healthy,
so all is forgiven.

357
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,860
Now I'm feeling nauseous.

358
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,495
He is not healthy.

359
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,802
Nausea and diarrhea
were not his only symptoms.

360
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,273
The shocks have also decreased.

361
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,741
But not disappeared.

362
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,970
And he's out of the diaper,

363
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,324
which is good news for everyone.

364
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,074
What about his low white count?

365
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,844
Well, the little buggers
need time to grow.

366
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,377
Don't worry, our wrestling
Rastafarian will be back on his feet

367
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,446
and sneaking around behind
Pop's back again in no time.

368
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,017
Yeah.

369
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,886
Check it again.

370
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,192
I'll be right there.

371
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,598
What happened?

372
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,999
Apparently I can save money

373
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,698
by switching to another
long-distance carrier.

374
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,103
Oh, I was right, wasn't I?

375
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,768
Oh, yeah, it's always
about you, isn't it?

376
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,854
He has the chills and
his temperature's spiking.

377
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,676
It's nearly 106. KEN:
What's that mean?

378
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,375
I mean, what's happening?

379
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,610
You want the truth,

380
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,811
or you want me to make
something up to protect you?

381
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,751
We think a drunk driver
broke into his room...

382
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,619
What's happening to my son?

383
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,461
The truth is I have no idea.

384
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,973
There's the fever that
Cameron was looking for.

385
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,236
We knew if it was myelitis,
there had to be an "-itis."

386
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,778
This must be the infection
that set it off. Yeah.

387
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,337
Except in this universe,
effect follows cause.

388
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,625
I've complained about it, but...

389
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,810
Maybe the tests were wrong.

390
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,081
No. The tests were right. Yesterday
he had no fever, no infection.

391
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,418
So he just happened to
catch a bug while he was here?

392
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,513
That's all this is?

393
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,523
Yeah.

394
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,071
Because his white blood cell
count was down, he was vulnerable.

395
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,461
Because it's really down, it
might kill him. That's all this is.

396
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,294
Is he still pooping his pants?

397
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,890
It just started again.

398
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:28,967
Again?

399
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,731
It stopped when he
was getting better.

400
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,032
When he was feeling better.
He was never getting better.

401
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,475
So, all we have to answer is,
what causes a 22-year-old kid

402
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,035
to become immunocompromised

403
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,774
with GI involvement and shocks?

404
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,611
Just stop and start
for no apparent reason.

405
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,843
And we need to find an answer

406
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,182
before this infection kills him.

407
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,914
That would be the ideal.

408
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,519
You. Intravenous broad
spectrum antibiotics.

409
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,424
You get a cervical, thoracic, and
lumbar T2-weighted fast spin-echo MRI.

410
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,554
And you, track down all those
Richie Rich's who went to Jamaica,

411
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,089
see if any of them have got
the shocks, the trots or the hots.

412
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,000
The hots, it's the fever.

413
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,530
You guys gonna join
us for dinner Thursday?

414
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,107
Gotta do my laundry.

415
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,910
You're not curious?

416
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,475
I'm curious about crocs, but I
don't stick my head in their mouths.

417
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,279
I'm out, too. Look,
House is a freak!

418
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,115
There's no virus that
causes that, no DNA mutation.

419
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,898
You're gonna have one
dinner with two people.

420
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,983
Sixty minutes, most of it spent
chewing or talking about the weather.

421
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,458
Unless they say something like,

422
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,461
"Do you prefer the
chardonnay or the merlot?"

423
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,259
and, "Oh, we kept Greg
locked in a closet for 17 years."

424
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,765
You're not gonna learn anything.

425
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,066
Okay.

426
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,501
We'd like to talk to
some of your friends,

427
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,232
see if they have any
similar symptoms.

428
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,706
The doctors in the ER
already asked me that.

429
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:42,867
We understand,

430
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,223
but they didn't have all the
information that we have now.

431
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,007
What kind of information?

432
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,680
Would you mind if I spoke
with Carnell alone for a minute?

433
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,881
Is this bad news?

434
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,855
No. It's just confidential.

435
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,357
Why is something
suddenly confidential?

436
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,327
I mean, if you know
something about my son,

437
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,726
I need to know what's going on.

438
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,288
I'm sorry, I have to insist.

439
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,492
I'm his father,

440
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,380
and if I'm going to take care
of him, I need to know the truth.

441
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,529
Dad.

442
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,968
She wants to know who
I went to Jamaica with.

443
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,868
You've never been to Jamaica.

444
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,970
Taddy's dad flew a bunch
of us down over spring break.

445
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,044
You told me you had two
papers to write over the break.

446
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,556
'Cause I didn't want to come
home and work my ass off.

447
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:34,157
I wanted an actual break
during a break for once.

448
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,895
I shouldn't have lied to you.

449
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,263
No, what you should
have done is come home

450
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,768
instead of partying
with your rich friends.

451
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,135
I'm sorry, we need those names.

452
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,207
What do you want?

453
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,277
To apologize.

454
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,247
I realize that my attention to the
clinic has been somewhat lax of late,

455
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,287
and I wanna make amends.

456
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,752
How about tomorrow
night? I take the night shift.

457
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,451
The clinic's closed at night.

458
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,153
Yeah, but I'm sure there's
plenty of things to be done,

459
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,753
there's charts to be reviewed,
supplies inventoried...

460
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,423
Dinners avoided.

461
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:13,765
You're going, too?

462
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,426
I love their Cobb Salad.

463
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:18,871
Give me a reason
to get out of this,

464
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,566
and I'll tell you who
started the rumor

465
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,574
about you being a transsexual.

466
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,178
There is no such
rumor. There will be,

467
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,940
unless you get me
out of this dinner.

468
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,503
No one's making
you do this, House.

469
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,106
Just do what
everybody else does.

470
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,309
Lie to them.

471
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,510
You lie to your mother?

472
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,019
Only since I was 12!

473
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,248
My mom's a human polygraph.

474
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,655
My dad should be taking
her to Vegas, not the Louvre.

475
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,250
Trust me, your mom
would much rather think

476
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,922
you have a business
meeting than you hate her.

477
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,064
I don't hate her. I hate him.

478
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,399
We all had headaches,
nausea, vomiting.

479
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,962
You know, we figured
it was connected

480
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,837
to the massive
amounts of drinking.

481
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,740
What, you think what
happened to Carnell

482
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,954
has something
to do with the trip?

483
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,139
Don't know.

484
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,703
You haven't had
any unexplained pain

485
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,300
or strange feelings
since you got back?

486
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,148
No, except for a little
athlete's foot, I'm fine.

487
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,909
Can I see it?

488
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,182
See what? Your feet.

489
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,818
There's a common
parasite in Jamaica

490
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,226
that can resemble foot fungus.

491
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,392
It's not really my feet.

492
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,564
You know, I figured
fungus is fungus.

493
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,633
It's my groin.

494
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,374
I'm going to need
to take a look at that.

495
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,808
Now?

496
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,921
Unless you wanna come
down to the hospital with me.

497
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,923
No, no, I can't. I mean, I
just started two days ago.

498
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,591
We're right in the
middle of a big merger...

499
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,140
Then drop your pants.

500
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,460
Reilly, I need the... What
the hell's going on here?

501
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,659
She's a doctor.

502
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,856
I'm a doctor, he has a
rash, and a friend of his is...

503
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,568
Right. Well, as soon as
she's done treating your rash,

504
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,119
I need the numbers
on D-Port Technology.

505
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,270
Yes, sir.

506
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,973
And, Doctor, why don't you
leave a card on your way out?

507
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,818
Except for one guy with a rash,

508
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,951
no one else on the trip
has any health issues.

509
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,050
What kind of rash?

510
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,652
I don't know, I took
some scrapings,

511
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,322
it doesn't appear
to be ringworm.

512
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,231
What did it look like,
aside from "not ringworm"?

513
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,825
Basically like diaper rash.

514
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,179
He's been working
around the clock,

515
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,243
he said he hasn't changed
his clothes in three days.

516
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:35,138
Kaposi's Sarcoma can
look like diaper rash.

517
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,800
Any discoloration
around the edges?

518
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,901
Get him in here. We
all wanna take a look.

519
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,004
Even if it is Kaposi's,
it's not related.

520
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,557
Our patient doesn't
have any skin symptoms

521
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,106
and we've already
ruled out cancer.

522
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,879
What are the odds of two friends

523
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,862
who just returned from
a trip outside the country

524
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,378
coming down with unexplained
but unrelated illnesses?

525
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,900
- Get him in here.
- He won't come.

526
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,401
Just started a new
job after graduation,

527
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,791
they're working on
some big merger.

528
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,738
Tell him his friend's
life hangs in the balance.

529
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,594
That's what I told
him the first time.

530
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,963
Still wound up
driving into Manhattan.

531
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,564
Tell him his life
hangs in the balance.

532
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,365
Tell him the rash
is flesh-eating,

533
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,566
and the next course on the
menu is his frank and beans.

534
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,736
Where's Stacy?

535
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,605
Speaking at a conference in
Baltimore. Why, what do you need?

536
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,911
Can I subpoena a patient?

537
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,214
House wants me to lie to
the kid to get him in here.

538
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,311
Well, then you'll be the
one getting the subpoena.

539
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,823
Well, we do need him
to diagnose his friend.

540
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,119
Take the test to the kid.

541
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,683
There is no test, House
just wants to look at it.

542
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,389
Then take House to it.

543
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,124
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

544
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,863
Tell House his parents called.

545
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,459
Said they were coming in early.

546
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,903
He'll go anywhere
just to avoid them.

547
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,407
So, it's okay to lie to
House but not to a patient?

548
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,604
Yup.

549
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,352
What's wrong? KEN: His
stomach's getting a lot worse.

550
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,149
It's rigid!

551
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,588
He's bleeding into his abdomen!

552
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,684
What's going on?

553
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,629
We need a surgeon
and an OR, stat! On it.

554
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,934
Try to hang in there, Carnell.

555
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,871
The infection caused a
perforation in his sigmoid colon.

556
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,005
It's repairable.

557
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,016
But it means the
antibiotics aren't working.

558
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,416
Double the dose, and
add Tygacil to the list.

559
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,953
Soon as he's out of surgery.

560
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,249
Where's Richie Rich?

561
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,017
He said he can't leave work.

562
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,191
Yeah, you told me
that two hours ago.

563
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,658
I'm not gonna lie.

564
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,594
Why, 'cause it's wrong? Or
because you're a coward?

565
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,057
Tough choice.

566
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,691
You'd be wasting two
hours of the kid's time.

567
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,037
Is that deeply and
unforgivably morally wrong? No.

568
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,472
Because it's not a waste of
his time. Unless we're wrong.

569
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,806
Unless his condition's got
nothing to do with his friend's.

570
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,646
You're just afraid
of being wrong.

571
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,181
Your parents called.

572
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,049
They had to catch an earlier...
You don't have to lie to him.

573
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,514
Kid's on his way here.

574
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,718
He got off work?

575
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,752
Yeah, by vomiting blood.
Ambulance is 10 minutes out.

576
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,965
You Taddy? Why?

577
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,940
Love the name.
If I ever had a dog.

578
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,135
Take off his pants.

579
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,233
Hey.

580
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,676
Don't talk to her, listen to me.

581
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,680
He's vomited in excess
of three units of blood.

582
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,059
He needs to be admitted before...
If you wanted to be a doctor,

583
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,561
maybe you should have buckled
down a little more in high school.

584
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,951
Bite me. What are you doing?

585
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,682
Exactly how close
were you and Carnell?

586
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,814
Not so close.

587
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,586
Spend a lot of time
together in Jamaica?

588
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,853
Share a room?

589
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,760
Wait, you don't think...
Look, we're not gay.

590
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,663
I'm not saying you're gay.
I'm saying you had sex.

591
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,135
Look, we're not gay.
We hardly even hung out.

592
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,001
Right. Guess you just
flew him down to Jamaica

593
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,060
'cause he won a contest.

594
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,537
No, he's in my frat.

595
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,116
All right, between
school and wrestling

596
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,871
and going home every break
to work in his father's junkyard,

597
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,105
Carnell didn't have any time
to hang out with anybody.

598
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,306
It's not fungus.

599
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,780
- I - already told you that.

600
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,374
There's no pustules,
it's not staph.

601
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,187
His dad's what?

602
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,621
His dad owns a scrap
metal salvage yard.

603
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,818
Carnell worked
there during breaks.

604
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,399
You lied.

605
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,798
What are you talking about?

606
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,064
Oh, yeah, of
course, in this family,

607
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,231
you probably need
more specifics.

608
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,470
You told us you owned a construction
company, not a salvage yard.

609
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010
I know the way things work.

610
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,512
The better my job, the
better my son gets treated.

611
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,242
Right, that's why I'm mad,

612
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,807
we wasted all that
filet mignon on you.

613
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,547
Did your kid find anything unusual
the last time he worked for you?

614
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,644
No.

615
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,721
Braided wire?

616
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,349
Metal weights on each end, a
lead canister, maybe just a lid.

617
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,417
Probably used it as a
doorstop or a paperweight.

618
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,121
Why would he wanna...

619
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,922
Okay, here it comes.

620
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,727
I gave him an
early graduation gift,

621
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,236
an old plumb I found,
looks like a fishing weight.

622
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,796
Put it on a keychain, so he'd always
remember where he came from.

623
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,842
So he could lie about it later?

624
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,538
Where's the keychain? I
don't know, he never used it.

625
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,103
Just kept it as a
good luck charm.

626
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,308
Kept it where? I don't know.

627
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,612
Why? Why does it matter?

628
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,018
Where are the kid's clothes?

629
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,954
In the bureau back
in his regular room.

630
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,424
You two, get it to
radiology. His clothes?

631
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,484
The bureau. Don't open it.

632
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,223
You, come with me.

633
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,963
Set it down there.

634
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,537
Now get out of here,
this thing's radioactive.

635
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,046
The chances of radiation
causing CNS symptoms?

636
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,118
Whoa.

637
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,525
Call the boys in
the lead pajamas.

638
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,838
The radiation measurements
weren't high enough

639
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,275
to cause central
nervous system damage.

640
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,721
It mightn't have
caused nerve damage,

641
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,044
but it definitely destroyed
his immune system.

642
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,412
And caused tumors.

643
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,850
We don't know that. None
of the MRIs showed anything.

644
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:25,552
Do a PET scan. Check
his cervical spine.

645
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,185
It's not gonna be good news.

646
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,926
Mr. Hall, it's not good news.

647
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,997
The piece of metal
you gave Carnell

648
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,097
was from an industrial
device used to test wells.

649
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,731
People aren't supposed to
just dump radioactive material.

650
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,209
But they do.

651
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,648
So, what now? I
mean, what do you do?

652
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,044
Anyone who's had
contact with the source

653
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,318
will have to immediately get
treatment for radiation sickness.

654
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,359
Taddy carried it on
his lap on the flight.

655
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,155
So there is a treatment?

656
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,094
Transfusions.

657
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,556
And we try to get the fluids
and electrolytes balanced.

658
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,895
Carnell,

659
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,404
he's had much more exposure.

660
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,566
The equivalent of about
70,000 chest X rays.

661
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,108
His ability to create white blood
cells has been completely destroyed.

662
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,606
And that's why he can't
fight off this infection?

663
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,719
Yeah. He's gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

664
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,582
And we did another PET scan.

665
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,051
There's a cavernous angioma
within his spinal cord, it's a tumor.

666
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,720
That's what's been causing
the shocks and CNS symptoms.

667
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,666
He has a tumor inside
of his spinal cord?

668
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,633
The cord is made of strands

669
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:51,438
put together, sort
of like a kite string.

670
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,741
The surgeon should be able to pull
the strands apart and excise the tumor.

671
00:31:56,348 --> 00:32:01,013
But surgery on someone who's as
hemopoetically compromised as your son

672
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,679
is extremely risky.

673
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,826
And,

674
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,400
if you don't do the
surgery? I mean...

675
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,873
The tumor could cause
his breathing to stop.

676
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,340
Possibly his heart as well.

677
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,807
There's no way you
could have known.

678
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,627
Now, you're gonna
have to come with us.

679
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,041
You need to start
treatment yourself.

680
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,590
No. No, no.

681
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,767
I can start my treatment later.

682
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,237
But he can't.

683
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,068
He needs to be in a sterile isolation
room to prevent further infections.

684
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,812
Mom. We're early.

685
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,456
It's great to see you.
Oh, Greg, don't lie.

686
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,458
We came at a bad
time, didn't we?

687
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:19,157
Actually, yeah, I think I
have to take a rain check.

688
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,466
Oh, plans have been
made. Wilson made them.

689
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,567
I asked him to cancel.

690
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,036
I'm dealing with a kind of a
complicated case right now so...

691
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,665
Well, we'll just come back

692
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,868
when things aren't
so out of control.

693
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,344
My team is busy.

694
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,572
You don't wanna see us.

695
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,239
Mom, don't make me feel guilty.

696
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,249
No, no, of course not. Sorry.

697
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,411
I've got a patient who's probably
gonna die of radiation poisoning.

698
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,614
So that means you can't eat?

699
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,954
Come on, let's grab
a bite in the cafeteria.

700
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,619
I'll buy you a Reuben.

701
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,942
Well, I guess I got
time for a sandwich.

702
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:55,966
Good.

703
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:00,905
Yeah?

704
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,235
I just wanted to let you know

705
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,832
that Carnell's
prepped for surgery.

706
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,241
Thank you.

707
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,838
Hi, I'm Allison Cameron.
I work with your son.

708
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,045
Greg's told us all about you.

709
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,118
Really?

710
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:16,780
New, huh?

711
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,346
Nope, just gullible.

712
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,222
I'm sorry, I was just
making fun of my son,

713
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,420
not of you.

714
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,059
We were just about to
go to get something to eat,

715
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,655
would you care to join us?

716
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,701
You don't have a lot
of time with your son.

717
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,872
Maybe another time.

718
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,176
Do you like the
Beatles? They're all right.

719
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,413
My 12-year-old just
turned me back on to them.

720
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,759
McCartney's gotta have
more money than God.

721
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,059
I think that's all
of it. Reverse him.

722
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,692
How's he doing?

723
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,402
Looks pretty good down
here. Do I rock, or what?

724
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,104
His pressure's dropping!

725
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,111
Give him another
two units. I did already!

726
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,908
His heart rate's falling.

727
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,810
He's hemorrhaging.

728
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,993
They're talking about
Mom's last trip to the dentist.

729
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,819
Grown children
talking to their parents,

730
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,454
nothing gets talked about.

731
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,829
Trust me, you're
not missing anything.

732
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,102
So, besides work,
what you been up to?

733
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,229
Not much.

734
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,706
You always say that, "Not much."

735
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,933
It's always the answer.

736
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,445
Any new babes you
might wanna tell me about?

737
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,413
Leave him alone, John.

738
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,943
Got a new motorcycle.

739
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,520
Might have seen it out front,

740
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,954
it's orange with
a gigantic scrape.

741
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,219
Is it the one in the
handicapped parking?

742
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,291
Yeah.

743
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,891
Looks like crap,
but it drives great.

744
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,158
Well, you'll be careful, right?

745
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,666
Last I checked, you
still have two legs.

746
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,133
Actually, three.

747
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,100
You know what your
problem is, Greg?

748
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,503
Shifting gears?

749
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,201
You just don't know
how lucky you are.

750
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,640
Where's the head?

751
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,981
Well, good thing we
got that cleared up.

752
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,083
Oh, he was just trying to help.

753
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,627
I don't need help.

754
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,923
I know.

755
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,256
You're absolutely perfect
just the way you are.

756
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,043
Thank you.

757
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:08,050
So, how much longer do
you think he'll be in surgery?

758
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,754
It's hard to say.

759
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,833
You know, he just started
school when Ann died.

760
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,967
I was a mess.

761
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,715
Still adjusting to being a
parent, much less a single parent.

762
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,516
You know, I used to put cold
pancakes in his lunch box.

763
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,957
I mean, that was the only thing

764
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,688
I could make that he would eat.

765
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:47,558
You did okay, he's
a good kid. Yeah.

766
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,465
Hey. So, how is he?

767
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,539
Well, the surgeon
has removed the tumor

768
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,603
without damaging
the spinal cord.

769
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,342
But, the infection has caused

770
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,577
another intestinal perforation.

771
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:08,912
We stopped the bleeding,

772
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,013
but his white
count keeps falling.

773
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,216
Okay.

774
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,592
So what now? Another
drug, antibiotics, what?

775
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,698
I'm sorry.

776
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,198
The reality is, no
matter what we give him,

777
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:30,106
it's unlikely he's gonna be
able to fight off the infections.

778
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,566
Okay, okay.

779
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,273
The father and the friend are
responding well to treatment.

780
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,178
Things aren't looking
so good for Carnell.

781
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,915
Thank you,

782
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,143
for not eating.

783
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,853
It was none of my business.

784
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,155
They seem perfectly
pleasant, don't they?

785
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,862
They are.

786
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,028
He was a marine pilot.
She was a housewife.

787
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,368
Married 47 years,
they had one child.

788
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,937
Mom is just like everyone else,

789
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,444
she's nice enough,

790
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,480
no great sense of humor,
hates confrontation.

791
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,883
My dad's just like you.

792
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,487
Not the caring till
your eyes pop out part,

793
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,287
just the insane moral compass

794
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,826
that won't let you lie to
anybody about anything.

795
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,828
It's a great quality
for Boy Scouts

796
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,329
and police witnesses.

797
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,324
Crappy quality for a dad.

798
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,575
Hey.

799
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:20,949
How you doing?

800
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,011
I'm hanging in there.

801
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,928
I'm sorry I lied to
you about Mom.

802
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,093
I'm sorry I lied to you, too.

803
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,831
There was nothing good
that came out of her dying.

804
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,271
I'm not mad.

805
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,776
I know why you did it.

806
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,177
It worked.

807
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,018
I never drink and drive.

808
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:01,017
I'm scared, Dad.

809
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,759
Come on.

810
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,798
There's nothing to be scared of.

811
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,070
You're gonna be just fine.

812
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,598
Don't play me.

813
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,342
I wanna know the truth.

814
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,670
I'm telling you the truth.

815
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,944
You're gonna be fine, I swear.

816
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,483
I love you, Dad.

817
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,554
I love you, too.

818
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,638
Why does he hate
seeing his parents?

819
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,513
So his dad tells the
truth, he can't handle that?

820
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,520
He hates being a disappointment.

821
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,080
He's a doctor, world famous.

822
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,422
How disappointed can they be?

823
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,294
You know what I figure is worse

824
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,559
than watching your
son become crippled?

825
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,626
Watching him be miserable.
