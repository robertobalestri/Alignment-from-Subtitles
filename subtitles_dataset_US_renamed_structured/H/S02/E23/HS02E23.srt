1
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,847
I know that one.

2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,645
I was at the studio when
Grandfather recorded it.

3
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,449
You thinking about your mom?

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,359
Mama, everything, my whole life.

5
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:34,628
It was all a lie. I
never knew you.

6
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,331
I never knew you were my dad.

7
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,965
Your life's gonna
be okay, Leona.

8
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,569
You're a good kid.
You got it together.

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,712
You survived the last
eight months on your own.

10
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,144
You're not your
grandfather or your mom.

11
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,017
You're not gonna make
the same mistakes they did.

12
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,651
I'm proud that I'm your father.

13
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,858
<i>I'm proud that I'm your father.</i>

14
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,431
Glad I'm getting this chance.

15
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,658
<i>I'm glad I'm getting this
chance. This chance...</i>

16
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,671
Ready for a cookie, darling?

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,266
We gotta go! Get out of here!

18
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,342
Leona!

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,757
Leona!

20
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,571
<i>You've reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>

21
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,223
<i>and is no longer in service.</i>

22
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,028
<i>If you feel you've reached
this recording in error, go with it.</i>

23
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,865
<i>Hang up. On three. One, two...</i>

24
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,262
<i>House, pick up.</i>

25
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,276
<i>I know it's your day off, and no
doubt got lots of exciting plans,</i>

26
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,905
<i>but I've got a case.</i>

27
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,505
<i>A 16-year-old girl presenting
with cardiogenic shock,</i>

28
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,444
<i>no heart attack.</i>

29
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:22,257
<i>Dr. Willis, 5-2-2-1.
Dr. Willis, 5-2-2-1.</i>

30
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,993
Her heart looks fine. ER
did a full cardiac workup.

31
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,564
Tox screen's clean,
blood shows no infection.

32
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,163
All on the top page.
I'm a real good reader.

33
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,471
Personal chart handoff
means there's something else.

34
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,974
I'm hoping it's not personal.

35
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,243
The guy who brought the
girl in says he knows you.

36
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,718
I thought I'd met
all your friend.

37
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,953
I was also wondering if you
could take a look at these.

38
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,253
When you have a
chance. No hurry.

39
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,952
It's just a couple
of medical histories.

40
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,087
One with a minor cancer
concern. No problem.

41
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,659
G-man!

42
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,204
You thought I was gonna do
it, didn't you? Do I know you?

43
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,433
Come on it's me.
Crandall. Doesn't ring a bell.

44
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,275
Man, I can't believe...

45
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,215
Unless you mean Dylan Crandall,
a man who will believe anything.

46
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,049
See, I just made you believe
that I... You haven't changed.

47
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,824
Heard about your leg. Yeah.
Pulled a hamstring playing Twister.

48
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,383
Just gonna walk it off.

49
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,061
So who's the girl? Jesse
Baker's granddaughter.

50
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,011
You always said you'd give
your right hand to play like him.

51
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,631
No. I said I'd give my
right hand to have his left.

52
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,832
Why is she with you?

53
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,104
She lost her mom in
Katrina, her home, everything.

54
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,543
Wow.

55
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,274
And I'm her father.

56
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,017
Hmm.

57
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,481
Yeah, she looks just
like you, got the same 'fro.

58
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,288
I wrote a book about Baker.
Hung out with him, his daughter.

59
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,229
Yeah, that is how
babies are made.

60
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,834
I never knew. She never
knew. Her mom lied for 16 years.

61
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,361
That's unbelievable. Yeah.

62
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,998
No, seriously, I
don't believe it.

63
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,838
Her mom was pissed
at me about my book.

64
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,105
I trashed her and her dad.
She wouldn't talk to me,

65
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,942
obviously she's not
gonna tell Leona that...

66
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,608
You're a sucker.
You always were.

67
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,348
Does that mean you're not
gonna help her? Why wouldn't I?

68
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,950
She's not scamming me.

69
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,901
Acute myocardial
infarction? ER said no. Retest.

70
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,632
Wolff-Parkinson-White
Syndrome? ER said no. Retest.

71
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,231
And read the damn file.
You just gave them to us.

72
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,834
Delta wave on the
EKG... It's all a no.

73
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,706
Everything about her heart is
healthy. She's a Katrina victim.

74
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,511
It's better than Crandall.
He's a Katrina-victim victim.

75
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,018
I don't think she was
expecting your sympathy.

76
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,611
I think her point was New
Orleans was a Third World country:

77
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,520
toxins, mold, sewage
in the streets...

78
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,616
What if her heart
is like my bike?

79
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:11,221
Runs like crap when I'm by myself, but
I take it to the mechanic, it runs great.

80
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,494
An arrhythmia. A one-time event.

81
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,659
What are we gonna do?

82
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,546
Keep her in her room on a cardiac
monitor till she has another arrhythmia?

83
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,971
That could be
weeks. Months. Relax.

84
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,306
I happen to know she's going to have
one right after lunch. We are golden.

85
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,245
You can't induce an arrhythmia in someone
whose heart nearly gave out 48 hours ago.

86
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,543
Sure you can.

87
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,742
It's kind of technical,

88
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,128
but you stick all these cool
little wires inside her somehow...

89
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,314
I mean you shouldn't. Oh, right.

90
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,366
'Cause it'd be much more ethical to
let it happen in an uncontrolled setting,

91
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,068
'cause there's always
a team of cardiologists

92
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:42,062
having lunch at the
next table. This is Jersey.

93
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,164
She's a minor, she's
gonna need consent.

94
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,026
I'll go talk to him. Oh,
that's an excellent plan.

95
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,514
We'll give him the form, and
tell him it's wrong and dangerous.

96
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,532
I can handle a simple consent
form. Okay, I'll be Crandall.

97
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,570
Dr. Cameron. House, from
what you say, this guy will...

98
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,274
Are you in this scene?

99
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:02,974
Go.

100
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,816
I need to talk to you about a
procedure we'd like to do on Leona.

101
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,822
"Like to do?" Is
this fun for you?

102
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,189
He's not you, he's not gonna
mock me. Stay in character.

103
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,755
I'm so scared, hold me.

104
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,798
In order to figure out
which circuit is misfiring,

105
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,357
we need to map all the
electrical activity in her heart.

106
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:25,030
Swear to me on the Bible
you'd do this if it was your kid.

107
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,631
Goodbye.

108
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:34,608
To map the electrical pathways in a
heart, we send electricity through each,

109
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,980
one at a time, till one fails.

110
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,484
That sounds dangerous.
It's a risk I'm prepared to take.

111
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,351
If she's got an
electrical problem,

112
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,051
couldn't more electricity
blow her whole system?

113
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,527
Well, look who's been watching
<i>Bill Nye, the Science Guy.</i>

114
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,625
The test is perfectly
safe. We do it every day.

115
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,333
All right. And you believe me?

116
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,732
I shouldn't do the test?
It's crazy dangerous.

117
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,339
Just sign the damn form.

118
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,714
I'm not crying. I
can handle this.

119
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,884
Then blow your nose, I
need DNA from somewhere.

120
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,917
You're not running
a paternity test.

121
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,724
She's gonna stay
around just long enough

122
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,856
to get your bank account,
your credit card numbers,

123
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,797
then she's gonna be
off with her next daddy.

124
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,411
With what she's been through,
why would you assume...

125
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,960
Because of what
she's been through.

126
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,471
Because that's your default
position, always has been.

127
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,201
Because she's still alive.

128
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,185
Raised by a junkie,
living on the streets,

129
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,235
that tends to kick the
sweetness out of you.

130
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,874
I figured you'd have mellowed.
Because you're an idiot.

131
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,382
If I let you do the test, it
means I don't trust her.

132
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,752
No. It means I don't trust her.

133
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,662
199,

134
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,890
98... She's out.

135
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,598
<i>Heart rhythm's normal.
Insert the first catheter.</i>

136
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,236
I'm in.

137
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,172
<i>All heart rhythms still normal.</i>

138
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,109
Haven't zapped her yet.

139
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,682
<i>Send the first electrical pulse.</i>

140
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,022
Sinoatrial node is normal.

141
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,386
<i>Next.</i>

142
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,764
Got supraventricular
tachycardia.

143
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,566
Stop the current.
<i>Is she hallucinating?</i>

144
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,870
IV push stat, 12.5 adenosine.
She's crashing. BP's plummeting.

145
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,139
<i>Foreman, is she hallucinating?</i>
No, normal waves.

146
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,807
<i>Then the AV node is not the bad
pathway. All that was, was a heart attack.</i>

147
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,817
<i>Reset her, so we can
find the real problem.</i>

148
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,546
Charging. Clear.

149
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,523
Normal rhythm.

150
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,620
<i>Chase, high right
atrium, please.</i>

151
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:06,097
Her heart's fragile after that last
attack. Chances of tachycardia.

152
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,728
<i>You have my permission to blame
Foreman at any negligence trial.</i>

153
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,131
<i>Send the electrical pulse.</i>

154
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,379
That's the one. She's hallucinating.
It's near the coronary sinus.

155
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,282
<i>Freeze it.</i>

156
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,592
Damaged heart muscle
gone. Cryoablation complete.

157
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,288
EEG's back to normal.
No hallucinations.

158
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,790
<i>She'll be fine by breakfast.</i>

159
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,604
Interesting reading.

160
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,008
Those are my top two
choices for sperm donors.

161
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,870
I wanted your medical
opinion on genetics.

162
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,208
They're losers.

163
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,682
Medically? Or...

164
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:04,349
Donor 1284 likes square dancing.
No one likes square dancing.

165
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,956
613, he's been practicing
medicine for five minutes,

166
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,553
calls himself a
healer, loves Mozart.

167
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,691
I'm not going dancing with them,
I'm looking for healthy sperm.

168
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,632
He's got four
living grandparents.

169
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,967
Who they are, what they
do, that doesn't matter?

170
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,872
I'm leaning toward 613. Oh,
sure, go with the Jewish number.

171
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,144
1284 has a cousin that tested
positive for the BRCA gene.

172
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,323
But his mother was negative,
which means so is your baby.

173
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,958
What about the...
Mediterranean/Dutch factor

174
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,473
on the dad's side?
It's not a problem,

175
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,384
because his dad's mom didn't
carry the thalassemia gene.

176
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,184
Bigger issue is the
jerk and poser genes.

177
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,220
This Mozart lie. People
can't like classical music?

178
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:44,060
You're designing a kid, a loser kid.
He's already getting pummeled at recess.

179
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,356
Here, knock yourself out.

180
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,233
Go find sperm that
can beat up 613's kids.

181
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,436
And thanks for your help.

182
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,972
Pretentiousness is hereditary.

183
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,135
Just 'cause they haven't
found the gene yet...

184
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,050
Could I have some water, please?

185
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,916
Hello?

186
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,592
I just need some water.

187
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,760
Is anyone there?

188
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,184
Mama?

189
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,765
The second hallucination
means we didn't fix her heart.

190
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,269
Maybe we missed something.

191
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,637
Her heart's fine. If she hallucinated,
it wasn't caused by her heart.

192
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:04,439
If? The screaming, the
floundering, it was an hallucination.

193
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,743
What if it wasn't
a hallucination?

194
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,373
We covered... Not finished.

195
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,419
What if it was an atypical seizure?
- Seizure?

196
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,944
She saw her mother. Mother's
dead. Ergo, hallucination.

197
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,457
Anyone wanna explain
that? His leg hurts.

198
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,498
Walking takes his
mind off of it. Flashback!

199
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,694
All that wind and rain from the
hurricane, post-traumatic stress syndrome.

200
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,260
Why are you so bent on her
not having a hallucination?

201
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,635
If she did have a hallucination,

202
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,149
then the heart problem
that we predicted,

203
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,337
found, and fixed was
just a gigantic coincidence.

204
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,978
His leg always hurts.
It's getting worse.

205
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,846
What if the heart
isn't a coincidence,

206
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,648
and isn't what caused
the hallucination?

207
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,319
An arrhythmia hurts.

208
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,928
What if her hallucination
was caused by pain?

209
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:59,293
What if she has a disease that translates
pain into a bizarre physiological response

210
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,960
like a hallucination? She
has an autoimmune disease.

211
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,559
She needs a CRP,
a rheumatoid factor...

212
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,476
I can prove an autoimmune disease
in five minutes. She needs a PET scan.

213
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,050
You can't test for
autoimmune in a PET...

214
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,306
I'm proving that her hallucinations
are a consistent response to pain,

215
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,255
which proves that she has
an autoimmune disease.

216
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,248
How do you test
someone's response to pain?

217
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,146
Easy. Hurt them.

218
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,915
It's not gonna hurt at all.

219
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,124
We just need to make
sure you don't move.

220
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,717
I won't.

221
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,730
Okay, give me your arm. I need
to check your muscle responses.

222
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,137
Okay, turn it over. Palm upward.

223
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,141
Everything okay? Yeah.

224
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,981
What the hell was
that? Diagnostic test.

225
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,916
<i>Cerebral cortex responded
normally. She's not hallucinating.</i>

226
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,680
You know he's not
your father, don't you?

227
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,950
He's my dad, Mama told me.

228
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,514
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

229
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,161
<i>House, leave her alone.</i> Come
on. We both know it's a hustle.

230
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,192
Are the walls closing in?
No. Why are you doing this?

231
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,702
Spiders coming out of
my nose? Let me out.

232
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,501
<i>House, the test is over.
Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex...</i>

233
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,836
Give me your hand. No!

234
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,569
Give me your hand.

235
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,742
Forget him.

236
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,305
He's not the perfect mark,
because he was the perfect mark.

237
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,048
Plenty of people
got there before you.

238
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,055
He's used up,
tainted, pumped dry.

239
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,160
<i>She's hallucinating.</i>

240
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,896
She's lost everything, and
you're breaking fingers. A new low.

241
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,096
Diagnostically, she
needed to be hurt.

242
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,162
I wanted to hurt her. Win-win.

243
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,274
What I didn't consider was a
threshold to trigger the hallucinations.

244
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,221
Otherwise, I'd have done
the finger-bending first,

245
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,214
instead of stabbing her
twice. That was cruel.

246
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,226
If her autoimmune disease is this advanced,
usual treatment is not gonna help.

247
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,228
We don't even know which
autoimmune disease she has.

248
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,729
This could be Lambert-Eaton,
could be Graves'...

249
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,915
Good point. Let's
kill them all at once.

250
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,767
The only way to do that, is to
replace her entire immune system.

251
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,555
Good point. Let's do that.

252
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,091
Bone marrow transplant
requires an exact match.

253
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,596
Leona has no siblings.

254
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:16,602
Good point. She's all alone, poor
thing. No one in the whole wide world.

255
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,399
<i>I asked for this tuned. Did
you get this instrument tuned?</i>

256
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,748
If my daughter
needs bone marrow,

257
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,830
why are you looking in
a bone marrow registry?

258
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,569
Because that's where
they keep the bone marrow.

259
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,974
I'm her father.

260
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,505
How does somebody who
believes absolutely anything

261
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,517
become a non-fiction
writer? Test my bone marrow.

262
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:11,721
Here's how this is gonna end: One
day, you'll be sitting at your computer,

263
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,989
writing one of your little music books,
and your daughter will come home

264
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,190
with a big, angry policeman,
who'll throw you in jail because,

265
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,732
"Daddy touched my poozle."

266
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,563
Test me. Happy to.

267
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,404
Just my marrow. I'm not
authorizing a paternity test.

268
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,641
You're that afraid of the
truth? I know the truth.

269
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,444
Easy-Lay Fay's truth was that she needed
a bus ticket home to see her sick grandma.

270
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,544
You gave her 100
bucks. She bought weed.

271
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,022
I know, because I told her you'd
go for the sick-grandma story.

272
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,321
If our friendship
means anything to you...

273
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,384
Come on. Do you know me at all?

274
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,396
If you do the test, one
of two things happens.

275
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,592
Either you're right or I'm right.
If you're right, I'll be miserable.

276
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,433
And if I'm right, I'll hate
myself 'cause I didn't trust her.

277
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,165
Either way I lose.

278
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,272
They don't itch, not raised.

279
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,653
He's had his MMR,
no one's sick at school.

280
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,416
His father took him camping.
We caught two spiders.

281
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,254
You didn't tell me about the
spider. Did you get a new couch?

282
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,203
Do you think there might
be some sort of toxin...

283
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,525
What color is it?

284
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,824
Red.

285
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,541
Is that where you watch your
cartoons after you take your bath?

286
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,565
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,299
Fall asleep sometimes?

288
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,501
Yes. Bless you.

289
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,376
Need you. Now. Yes, mistress.

290
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,417
I'll write you a prescription for
one of these. Just wet and apply.

291
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:58,029
You didn't tell anyone else
what I'm doing? Not a soul.

292
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,833
Wilson?

293
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,204
Cameron, maybe you
mentioned it to her?

294
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,900
No. I'm a really
good secret-keeper.

295
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,404
I've never told anybody
that Wilson wets his bed.

296
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,945
Oh, you tricked me.

297
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,611
Part of the protocol
for in vitro fertilization

298
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,777
is twice-daily injections
of menotropins.

299
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,449
I can't do it myself.

300
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,090
Turn around.

301
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,626
No clever comments about bending
over? Not unless you want me to.

302
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,927
I'm just not used to
House the professional.

303
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,409
I was just thinking about
what your mother looked like.

304
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,074
'Cause your father obviously
chose her for breeding purposes...

305
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,710
Shut up. Natural
selection sucks.

306
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,881
We pick our mates based
on breast size, cars they drive.

307
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:01,519
They did autopsies on married couples,
found a correlation in pancreas size.

308
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,488
We're hardwired to
pick for stupid reasons.

309
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,395
You have the chance
to pick for smart reasons.

310
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,493
I think the Germans had a
similar theory about 60 years ago.

311
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,971
I'm not advocating wiping
out entire races, I'm just saying

312
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,806
you don't wanna mate with the
first plastic cup that buys you a drink.

313
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,879
I'm pretty sure you got that.

314
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,882
Microbes can be sneaky.

315
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,755
Thanks.

316
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,425
Twice a day. This
is gonna be fun.

317
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,112
I got it.

318
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,158
So why were you
friends with this guy?

319
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,224
We were 20 years
old. He had a car.

320
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,961
If he'd been a woman, I
would have married him.

321
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,468
Is he a match? No.

322
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,773
Lying girl lucked out, we
found one in the registry.

323
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,744
Is he the dad?

324
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,550
I don't think so. You
didn't run the test?

325
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,383
Said I wouldn't.

326
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,055
Okay, so either you lied,

327
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,820
or he has pictures
of you being nice.

328
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,789
Stop the radiation.

329
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,770
What the hell is that?

330
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,141
I have no idea.

331
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,148
Lab results on the black ooze.
You're not gonna believe it.

332
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,189
She pooped out of her mouth.

333
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,748
The sample contained
stool and digested blood.

334
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,418
How did you guess?
'Cause it oozed.

335
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,294
If it was in her stomach,
it would've sprayed.

336
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,707
If it was in her lungs,
she would have coughed.

337
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,964
This oozed, as in squeezed, as in
reverse peristalsis. Who's hungry?

338
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,094
Mexican takeout?

339
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,209
In order for digested
blood to be in her intestines,

340
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,604
she had to have
internal bleeding.

341
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,084
Yeah, but for whatever
was in her intestines

342
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,685
to come back up, there
had to be a blockage.

343
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,768
Liver failure.

344
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,154
There'd be no proteins
to clot the blood,

345
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,123
so it would leak into her
stomach, mess up her intestines.

346
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,117
Means, oops, we were wrong,
because no autoimmune disease

347
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,674
shuts down an
organ in two hours.

348
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,881
We need to do a liver biopsy,
find out what the real problem is.

349
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,528
Hey.

350
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,094
Need to talk to you.

351
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,377
The good news is, she doesn't
have an autoimmune condition,

352
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,281
so she doesn't need a
bone marrow transplant,

353
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,253
and we were able to
stop the irradiation in time.

354
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,223
The bad news, she
has potty mouth.

355
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,922
Her liver is failing which has made
her digestive system go in reverse.

356
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,996
It's actually much
worse than it sounds.

357
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,837
We need to do a liver biopsy.

358
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,765
I don't know what's gonna happen
when we stick a needle into her liver.

359
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,377
She could die
right then and there.

360
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,840
Ease it. Tell me what to do.

361
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,482
No inside information
on this one.

362
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:53,124
Look, Crandall, three days
ago, you didn't even know this girl.

363
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,753
If she'd been hit by a bus, you
wouldn't lose a moment's sleep.

364
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,102
There are people all over this
hospital in just as much trouble,

365
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,468
just as not related to you.
You telling me I shouldn't care?

366
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,941
Prepping me to handle
it for when she dies?

367
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,864
It's brown, it's lumpy,

368
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,837
I'm going to heave all over
my desk. Chicken <i>mole.</i>

369
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,676
Twenty-one herbs and spices.

370
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:53,884
I find it very comforting, you defending
a man you haven't seen in years.

371
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,020
To know my friend, no matter what,
will always be my champion, my protector.

372
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,525
I'm not protecting
him, I'm smacking her.

373
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,060
The modesty of the true hero.

374
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,962
Push me and I'll let her die,
just so you'll stop annoying me.

375
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,801
Here's my theory.
You're jealous.

376
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,626
He's maturing, he's
accepting responsibility,

377
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,567
you're emotionally stuck at 17.

378
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,041
He's manufacturing
responsibility, he's not maturing.

379
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,937
He hasn't changed at all.

380
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,179
So, then why do you care?
That black ooze we saw?

381
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,676
That was a bowel movement

382
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,478
out of her mouth.

383
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,386
You're trying to end this
conversation by grossing me out?

384
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,791
I'm an oncologist.

385
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,921
Half my patients have
their skin sloughing off.

386
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,993
Why are you so
worried about this guy?

387
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,428
He was having a rough
time with his girlfriend.

388
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,970
He was in love,
he's always in love,

389
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,772
he wanted to marry her.

390
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,440
And I thought she was flaky,
was sending mixed signals.

391
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:59,149
So you gave him advice,
and she dumped him.

392
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,613
No. I told him that
I would talk to her.

393
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,852
And you blew it? Technically...

394
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:16,201
I was doing him a
favor. She was nuts.

395
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,490
Stop the biopsy.

396
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:22,025
I'm right at her liver.
It's House. He says stop.

397
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,365
Check it out.

398
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,676
Look, please tell me you didn't
stop the biopsy to play us some tunes.

399
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:39,013
The left hand is very
subtle, very delicate.

400
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,780
This girl is dying.

401
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,619
Be dying a lot faster if I let you do
that obviously unnecessary biopsy.

402
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,749
Now, listen.

403
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,022
<i>I asked for this tuned. Did
you get this instrument tuned?</i>

404
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,462
My God. Grandpa was an
angry drunk. If only we'd known!

405
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:56,433
Here's how to become a
great artist. First, get miserable.

406
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,131
Misery drives you to become a great artist,
but the art does nothing for your misery,

407
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,902
which drives you to drugs,
which makes you a lousy artist.

408
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,568
And this is not lousy.

409
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:09,078
You saying he didn't do
drugs? Not when he played this.

410
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,847
Something was screwing
with his personality.

411
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,513
Yeah. Drugs and
alcohol don't do that.

412
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,648
And that note that he
says is out of tune, it's not.

413
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,353
Which means that something is
screwing with his aural perception, too.

414
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,772
Now, what happens when you
add all of that to the liver disease,

415
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,128
which he supposedly died of?

416
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,224
Too much iron. He could
have had hemochromatosis.

417
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,333
That's genetic.

418
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,679
Unless you can tell me Miles
Davis couldn't play stoned...

419
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,399
Played better when he wasn't.

420
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,839
I think. I mean, no
one knows for sure.

421
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,069
I'll get Leona a TIBC
and serum ferritin.

422
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,975
We can test this
in three minutes.

423
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,557
So, what is she, Foreman,

424
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,185
a light-skinned black chick
or a dark-skinned white chick?

425
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,628
I'm not sure. Can we
hear the music again?

426
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,632
It's too early to see
jaundice from her liver.

427
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:04,727
True. But this is a photograph of
Leona when she was 13 years old.

428
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,264
She's darker now.

429
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,536
She's been living on the
streets for eight months.

430
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,070
No tan line.

431
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,514
So, unless those streets she's
been living on are indoor streets,

432
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,209
I'm thinking she's got
iron deposits in melanin.

433
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,448
Both byproducts of hemochromatosis,
just like Granddad used to make.

434
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,725
SQUID exam to calculate
the amount of iron in her blood,

435
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,285
and treat her with deferoxamine.
She'll be fine by lunch.

436
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,992
'Cause, you see, I was wrong
before about the breakfast.

437
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,554
There's the iron. Lots of it.

438
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,493
I'm not gonna
get this job, am I?

439
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,591
It's a done deal. I knew
it the moment I saw you.

440
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,726
Interview's just a formality.

441
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,832
House, what are you... Lisa
Cuddy, this is Patrick Linehan.

442
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,876
Patrick's gonna be the new
intern rotating in my department.

443
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,383
I didn't even know you were
looking for one. Nice to meet you.

444
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,176
Sorry. I laugh when I'm nervous.

445
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,353
Bet you've been doing
that your whole life, huh?

446
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,652
What kind of medicine are
you interested in, Patrick?

447
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,161
Cancer, infectious
disease. The big devils.

448
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,591
I think that medicine has
become too institutionalized.

449
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:44,628
We need to send a message to
our patients that we're just like them.

450
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,729
I mean, we're all people.

451
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:51,375
"We're all people." I like that.

452
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,977
See, she's all
hard science, facts.

453
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,677
I like to know a person's
hopes and dreams.

454
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,696
What kind of music do you
like, Patrick? Actually, I don't...

455
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,018
I'm a Mozart man.

456
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,881
He says what I feel
but can't express.

457
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,726
I'm late for a meeting.

458
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:14,266
You see, this is why the
face-to-face interview is so important.

459
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,325
You gotta know who
you're getting in bed with.

460
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,267
Get him out of here.

461
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,853
Deferoxamine is
a chelating agent.

462
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,451
It binds to the iron, so
that her liver can get rid of it.

463
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,118
Once the iron's
out of the liver,

464
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:45,631
it's finally evacuated by
the body in the form of urine.

465
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,632
Should be quick and painless.

466
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:09,764
Leona? What's happening?

467
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,121
Crash cart. She's
not getting any air.

468
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,073
<i>CT showed her lungs
are Swiss cheese.</i>

469
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,107
Ventilator's helping, but at
this rate, her time's basically up.

470
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:44,014
We developed a theory,
hemochromatosis.

471
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,389
Like good scientists, we tested
that theory. We proved that theory.

472
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,327
We acted based on that
proof and we treated her.

473
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,490
As a result of which, she
is on the verge of death.

474
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,865
Is it just me, or have we discovered
a flaw in the scientific method?

475
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,905
Walk me through it step by
step. What is supposed to happen

476
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,405
when you give
someone deferoxamine?

477
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,942
It's a chelating agent. And
what does the chelating do?

478
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,910
It removes excess
iron from the liver. How?

479
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,641
The iron is heavy, it gets stuck.
Deferoxamine is like a lubricant.

480
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,240
It makes the iron slick, so
it can move around again.

481
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,444
Moves around where?

482
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,488
It's supposed to be
discharged through waste.

483
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,756
Her waste system is a
little screwy right now.

484
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,760
Means the iron can't
go where it wants to go.

485
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,990
What if it moved to her lungs?

486
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,761
Then whatever's in her lungs likes
iron, bound with it, started poking holes.

487
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,199
What likes iron?

488
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,602
Oxygen attaches itself to iron, which
increases her chance of infection.

489
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,267
No, we started massive
antibiotics prior to the radiation.

490
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,901
Some neurodegenerative
diseases like iron. MRI was clean.

491
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,776
No iron deposits on the
brain. Fungus likes iron.

492
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,911
No objections to that one?

493
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,311
If a fungus is doing
all this, she's dead.

494
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,685
There are 25 antifungals, if
we don't know which fungus...

495
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,848
When in doubt, go broad.

496
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,325
Most common is aspergillus.
Continue to ventilate her lungs.

497
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,558
Get her on a voriconazole drip
and hope she has aspergillus.

498
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,603
The process is confidential.
You violated his privacy.

499
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,699
But how did you even...

500
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,302
I looked up "loser"
in the cryobank.

501
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,142
You wouldn't go within
100 miles of that idiot.

502
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,911
Yet you're willing
to have his baby.

503
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,904
I'm not looking for a
date, I'm tired of looking.

504
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,948
Cotton ball?

505
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,928
I don't care if you marry this guy,
date this guy, go through his garbage,

506
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,659
but you should know.

507
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,463
Genes matter. Who
you are matters.

508
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,628
Find someone you trust.

509
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,133
Someone like you?

510
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,070
Someone you like.

511
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,316
Listen... Oh, sorry. Okay.

512
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,014
It's not what you
think. I rub his leg.

513
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,217
Oh, Ingrid.

514
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,549
Hi.

515
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,255
Okay, you feel guilty about
stealing the guy's girl, I get that.

516
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,424
And I'm glad, it's a good thing.

517
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,662
But you did the paternity test.

518
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,428
And either the paternity
test comes back negative

519
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,133
and you shove it
in the guy's face,

520
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:19,701
or it comes back positive, and you
shut up, and your leg starts hurting.

521
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,212
Or I never ran the test.

522
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,783
Not what you think. CAMERON:
Leona's lungs collapsed.

523
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,684
The treatment's not working.
We've got the wrong fungus.

524
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,085
You can stop. She ruined it.

525
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:38,091
Three rules for hunting fungus:
location, location, location.

526
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:41,497
Crandall says she was living at
the children's shelter in Ridgeland.

527
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,592
Okay. The one thing
we know for sure

528
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,103
is she was not living in the
children's shelter in Ridgeland.

529
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,572
Why would he lie about that?
- He wouldn't.

530
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,960
But he'd believe her story about the sweet
little girl trying to do the right thing.

531
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,208
We can't ask Leona where
she was. She's intubated.

532
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,197
Don't try to talk.

533
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,962
You got a big medical
thing in your mouth.

534
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,901
Just blink if you understand me.

535
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,768
Fantastic.

536
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,871
Blink if you lied to
Crandall about everything.

537
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,551
You picked up a
fungus somewhere.

538
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,016
If you were living at this shelter,
like you told your new daddy,

539
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,992
then I got nothing to
go on and you will die.

540
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:47,359
So, did you lie to Crandall?

541
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,062
You're a lousy con artist.

542
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,875
First rule of the game
is know your mark.

543
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,777
Once you got Crandall to bite
on the papa thing, you had him.

544
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,940
You could have told him
that you were servicing

545
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,881
Al-Qaeda suicide
bombers for crack,

546
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,513
and this guy would still have let you
pick out the colors in your new room.

547
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,552
Did you lie to Crandall?

548
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,667
Where were you?

549
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,483
And the winner is...

550
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,253
Oh, you read it, I just get
so nervous at these things.

551
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,584
Recording studio?
She read the book.

552
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,324
She knew how much Crandall
hated that place, what went on there.

553
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,062
- She overplayed her hand.
- She was desperate.

554
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,913
If she didn't sell this,
she was stuck in hell.

555
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,838
Recording studio
doesn't help us medically.

556
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,533
Recording studios.

557
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,668
Why are these buildings
different from all other buildings?

558
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,713
Sound-proofing. Absorbs
sound, also absorbs moisture.

559
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,080
Where there's moisture, a
lot of it, say Katrina-moist...

560
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,609
Zygomycosis. Only occurs
at the highest levels of mold.

561
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,681
Start her on an IV drip of amphotericin
B with colony stimulating factors.

562
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,385
She'll be fine by

563
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,289
dinner.

564
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,763
She's gonna be fine. She
said she'd never go back there.

565
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:41,274
She lied to you. She's
your kid. Get used to it.

566
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,313
Thank you for the injections.

567
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,155
You're welcome.

568
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,624
You came all the way up
here just to tell me that?

569
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,754
No.

570
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,141
Pretty much normal. Liver
function tests are good.

571
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,007
Thanks, G-man.

572
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,621
What makes you think
you'd be a good father?

573
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,824
I don't know.

574
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,450
It feels right.

575
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,718
It feels good.

576
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,123
Well, at least you
got a good reason.

577
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,497
Feels good is a
good enough reason.

578
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,797
What's happening? She's
choking. She can't breathe.

579
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,843
Get him out of here, will you?
- Come on...

580
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,003
Out!

581
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,679
Quick, the curtain!

582
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,487
You're breathing on your
own. The choking's normal.

583
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:42,290
I lied to him. I ran
a paternity test.

584
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:49,701
Your lie was a bad one.

585
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,136
He is your dad.

586
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,751
We're even.

587
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,736
<i>Your machine's broken,
there's not even a message.</i>

588
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,512
<i>House? Are you there? Okay.</i>

589
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,616
<i>See you Monday, I guess.</i>
