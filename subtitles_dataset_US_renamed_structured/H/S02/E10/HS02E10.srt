1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:07,972
So there I am, on my 25th birthday,
driving from Wheeling, West Virginia,

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,239
to Bensonhurst, in a
Dodge Dart with no radio

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,712
and a gunrunner
named Barrelhead,

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,849
who insisted we sing every
Jimmy Buffett song he could recall.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,852
What could I say? The
man was heavily armed.

6
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:25,552
So, 500 renditions of
<i>Margaritaville</i> later... My first cover.

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:29,187
Eight thousand words on how Barrelhead
and his friends were transporting handguns

8
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,255
for sale to New York City.

9
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,426
The day the magazine hit the
stands, the DA hit me with a subpoena.

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,902
He wanted to know
Barrelhead's real name.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,202
And Greta had been managing
editor for three whole days.

12
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,776
So she invited me across
the street to the fancy bar

13
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,176
where they use real glasses.

14
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,313
And after about the
sixth vodka and tonic,

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,511
she said, "Fletch, I want you to
know the magazine is behind you."

16
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,349
Well, I was impressed.

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,365
I said, "You think you can
get the DA off my back?"

18
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,827
And she said, "No, but when you
get out of jail, you'll still have a job."

19
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:06,129
I'm 45. I've given up a lot.
I've given up the road, that life...

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,937
Thanks, Elizabeth. No
regrets. My lovely wife.

21
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,871
I've given up drinking.
I've given up drugs.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,334
Greta taught me there's
two things you never give up.

23
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,846
One's rock and roll. The
other's a source. Greta Sims.

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,776
- Great memories, Greta.
- We'll miss you, Greta.

25
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,546
I only hope you can adjust
to the lack of stress in your...

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,084
Fletch? Fletch?

27
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,455
Fletcher?

28
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,888
Fletch?

29
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,591
Fletcher?

30
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,755
Fletcher?

31
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,163
Honey? Sweetie? Are you okay?

32
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,994
Are you okay?

33
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,375
I flung the investment.

34
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,040
What did you say?

35
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,987
I flung the investment.

36
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,418
Why consign?

37
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,521
Why consign?

38
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,089
I'll call 911.

39
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,296
It's proficient.

40
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,399
Why disqualify the
rush? I'm tabled.

41
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,743
I'm tabled.

42
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,216
Need your advice.

43
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,926
What's the best diagnostics
department within 60 miles of here?

44
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,190
We are.

45
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,390
Yeah. "We" aren't here.

46
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,899
House is in Baltimore lying
to Medicaid about his billings.

47
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,798
So? I'm board certified.

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,461
You are not House.

49
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,632
Why'd you put me in charge of the
department if you think I can't handle it?

50
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,075
Because it's temporary,
and because I was ordered to.

51
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:32,972
What are the symptoms?

52
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,412
Oh, come on.

53
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,911
You're gonna diagnose
him without meeting him?

54
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,714
Prove that you're
as brilliant as House?

55
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,948
I need to know the symptoms to
know which hospital to recommend.

56
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,488
EMT's report: patient struck his
head and is suffering from aphasia.

57
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,197
A neurological problem.

58
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,831
You know, I know a lot
of good people in that field,

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,233
seeing as I happen
to be a neurologist.

60
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,363
You're pouting. Not at all.

61
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,668
Taylor's pretty good.

62
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,734
House was ready to hire
him till he got my resume.

63
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,335
It's Fletcher Stone.

64
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,473
Wrote 12 books, exposed
three administrations.

65
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,848
Before he exposes
us... I get it.

66
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,409
Famous patient
needs famous doctor.

67
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,453
I'll call Taylor. Thank you.

68
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,855
Or maybe you should call him.

69
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,690
What if I say something stupid?

70
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,093
God. House is easier.

71
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,773
You taking any drugs?

72
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,710
I displaced my
function. Accolade.

73
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,109
He used to drink regularly,

74
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,015
but he's been clean and
sober for nearly a year.

75
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,643
Mr. Stone, you think
you're speaking normally,

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,848
but your speech is impaired.

77
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,016
He knows what he wants to say,
but when he reaches for a word,

78
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,583
he finds something else.

79
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,788
I grapple average.

80
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,290
Tanzer glisten?

81
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,301
He doesn't know that
he's saying it wrong?

82
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,429
It all sounds right to him.

83
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,398
I want you to write your
name and draw a face.

84
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,622
It's called agraphia.
Loss of ability to write.

85
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,753
Most often, it's temporary.

86
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,695
How hard did he hit his head?

87
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,630
It was a pretty good crack.

88
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,827
It made a really ugly sound.

89
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,870
Do you understand
what I'm saying? Of golf.

90
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,269
Don't give me a sentence.
Just say "yes" or "no."

91
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,139
Do you understand me?

92
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,937
Yes.

93
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,375
Elizabeth. Fletch. Is he okay?

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,349
We don't know.
This is Fletch's editor.

95
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,111
Greta Sims.

96
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,885
I wanted to make sure that
the EMTs told you the right story.

97
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,517
How many stories are there?

98
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,052
He didn't trip. He just
fell. Out of the blue.

99
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:07,624
His foot jerked a little bit, first.
That's what made it look like a trip.

100
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,334
Don't say anything.

101
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,153
Don't attempt to defend
your billing practices.

102
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,839
Your billing practices
are indefensible.

103
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,244
We've been over this.

104
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,680
If I thought you were
capable of listening, I'd shut up.

105
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,775
That makes no sense at all.

106
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,657
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

107
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,767
Every case you have rates a
five on the complexity scale?

108
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,773
Dr. House has a rather
specialized practice.

109
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,101
Ah.

110
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,836
Okay. Then let's
go through these.

111
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:54,971
All of these?

112
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,246
If you have lunch
reservations, cancel them.

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,951
All right. Patient...

114
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,125
If he didn't trip, something
made him fall. Stroke, seizure?

115
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,096
Thirty people saw him trip.
One person says he didn't.

116
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,187
Who are we gonna believe?

117
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,342
His symptoms can all be
explained by the head trauma.

118
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,393
It causes a contusion or a
seizure. That causes the aphasia.

119
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,562
We should get an EEG.

120
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,382
If it was a stroke,
could be a clotting issue.

121
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,207
Even if he fell, drug use is far
more likely. I'm ordering a tox screen.

122
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,178
Chase. We're not
done with the differential.

123
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,875
You're not my boss.

124
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,908
I'm House's boss. House is your
boss. The math is pretty simple.

125
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,146
Are you signing my paychecks?
Are you hiring and firing?

126
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,450
This is not about that.

127
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,958
The only thing you've been
asked to do is supervise House,

128
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,891
in case he does
something insane.

129
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,453
Which might, you
know, save a life.

130
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,592
Somebody's gotta
be in charge. Why?

131
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,158
What, do you think we should
all just do whatever we wanna do?

132
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,635
Maybe have a race
to the diagnosis.

133
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,799
I think it should be a
discussion among peers.

134
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,274
I think we're grown-up
enough to reach a consensus.

135
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,514
Patient, 62 years old.
You prescribed Viagra.

136
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,117
I look in vain for the
words "erectile dysfunction"

137
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,681
in the notes for Dolores Smith.

138
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,451
She had a heart condition.

139
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,291
And you ran out
of nitroglycerin?

140
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,425
She also had low blood pressure,
so nitro would be dangerous.

141
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,737
The little blue pills improve
blood flow. They're vasodilators.

142
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,997
That's why you
sometimes get headaches.

143
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,803
I think Dr. House understands...

144
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,504
Of course I do. The woman has a
heart condition, she's on her own.

145
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:35,572
A man can't nail his office
assistant, it's national crisis time.

146
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,651
Are you seriously expecting us to foot
the bill for off-label use of medication?

147
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,654
Fine. I'll pay for it.

148
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,720
How much are the pills?
She took how many?

149
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,654
Put the money away.

150
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,059
Are you trying to bribe me? No.

151
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,297
I could. There's an
ATM in the lobby.

152
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,163
My client's an idiot.

153
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,001
But is he wrong about the pills?

154
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,274
Off-label use is
not sanctioned...

155
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,469
You're retiring in three weeks.

156
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,444
You've been doing
this job nearly 20 years.

157
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,210
Aren't you tired of administering
policy that you disagree with?

158
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,850
I never said I disagree...
What can they do to you?

159
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,251
And Dr. House is sorry
about his earlier outburst.

160
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,289
Absolutely.

161
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,191
You do background checks
on Medicaid personnel?

162
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,895
I do what's necessary for my
client. Wow. New personal record.

163
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,098
Yeah. Timing's good for me, too.

164
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,371
Got a reservation at a little
place in the Inner Harbor.

165
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,809
You booked us
dinner reservations?

166
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,711
Best Maryland crab in Maryland.

167
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,944
Don't you have a plane
to catch? Not for hours.

168
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,278
Your flight leaves at 7:00.

169
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,751
You did a background
check on me?

170
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,224
And mine doesn't leave till 9:00
p.m. It looks like you'll be dining alone.

171
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:56,627
You checked on my flight so you
could be sure to be on a different one.

172
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,463
I thought we were past
the avoidance stage.

173
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,331
I didn't think we'd
be finished this soon.

174
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,836
Where's your crucifix?

175
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,438
I left it at the jeweler's
to be cleaned.

176
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,205
Right.

177
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,546
This will show us if there's a
problem with your carotid artery

178
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,348
that might cause a blood clot.

179
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,716
If it went to his brain,

180
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,758
it could explain the
aphasia and the falling down.

181
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,453
And you're giving him an
EEG. Is that for the same thing?

182
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,725
It's just a precaution. I think
the trauma caused some swelling

183
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,097
and we need to keep him stable
until the body can repair the damage.

184
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,999
And you think
they're both wrong?

185
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,369
We're just covering all the
bases. We're being safe.

186
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,237
His O2 stats are going down.

187
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,246
Fluid in his lungs.
I'll push 40 IV Lasix.

188
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,287
We need to intubate. He's
losing his respiratory drive.

189
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,522
Put him down. Put him down.

190
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,319
And then there were two.

191
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,823
Aphasia and fluid in the
lungs. Seizure can't cause both.

192
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,084
Neither can a stroke.

193
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,819
Unless he had an
abnormal heart rhythm.

194
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,330
And then there was one. Urine
test was positive for amphetamines.

195
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,296
Amphetamines don't
cause pulmonary edema.

196
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,357
They do if you smoke them.

197
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,427
Well, in one of his books, he talked
about giving up drugs and alcohol.

198
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,234
How it changed his life.

199
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,831
Everybody lies.

200
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,647
When he started wanting to
hear every minute of my day,

201
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,548
it should have been a clue
he was the jealous type.

202
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,587
But you know, in that
first stage of a relationship,

203
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,248
where it's like your body's
full of these chemicals that

204
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,521
make you think everything
they do is charming.

205
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,962
Excuse me.

206
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,031
<i>Hello.</i>

207
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,192
Hey, honey. How are the
kids? Do they miss me?

208
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,337
This may take a minute.

209
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,665
<i>So, what's new with Mr. Aphasia?</i>

210
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,369
Cuddy called you?

211
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,737
Everybody covers their ass.

212
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,839
Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen.
It came back positive for amphetamines.

213
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,282
He did the dance of victory.

214
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,411
I'm betting there's
another shoe.

215
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,921
I thought the kids
didn't call you.

216
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,455
I know the way you tell stories.

217
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,191
Foreman went to talk to Stone about his
drug test, found him running a temperature.

218
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,758
So it's not the drugs. They've
just got such a bad rep.

219
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,534
Honey, you shouldn't do that.

220
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,540
Okay, I gotta hang up. They're
probably trying to reach me.

221
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,045
You don't have call waiting?
I'm hanging up on you now.

222
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,741
<i>It's $5 a month.</i>

223
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,289
Drugs don't cause fever.

224
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,088
Encephalitis or meningitis
are the obvious suspects.

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,321
Start him on antibiotics.

226
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,593
It could be an autoimmune
disease. Lupus, Behcet's...

227
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,376
We could start him on
a high dose of steroids.

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,861
Except if he does have encephalitis,
steroids could weaken his immune system.

229
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,961
Foreman.

230
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,701
How high a fever?

231
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,375
Put me on speakerphone.
And why haven't you called me?

232
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,804
101. How'd you know?

233
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,282
What? You think you guys can have a
party as soon as the parents are gone,

234
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,784
and I won't hear about it?

235
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,686
<i>Start with broad-spectrum antibiotics
for possible bacterial meningitis,</i>

236
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,919
and an antiviral in case we luck
out and it's herpes encephalitis.

237
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,483
What if it's autoimmune?

238
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,224
Well, then we're screwed, which
is why we need more information.

239
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,423
Any genetic issue
with the family?

240
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,128
<i>The man can't talk. His
medical records are sketchy.</i>

241
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,171
And the wife's only known
him a couple of years.

242
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,207
<i>MRI show anything?</i>
The CT scan was negative.

243
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,668
"CT." That's like
short for "MRI," right?

244
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,206
<i>Excellent. That's going
to save us a lot of time.</i>

245
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,376
We've got an MRI scheduled in 20 minutes.
Earliest Foreman could get the machine.

246
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:15,286
I teach you to lie and cheat and
steal, and as soon as my back is turned,

247
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,983
you wait in line?

248
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,154
Get an MRI and get a
better medical history.

249
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,888
The man can't talk!

250
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,157
Who cares? He's
probably gonna lie anyway.

251
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,029
My flight's a little late,
I'll be back in a few hours.

252
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:32,132
So, you're in charge of us
because you're in charge of him?

253
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,509
Any family history of
neurological problems?

254
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,606
No.

255
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,711
Have you been out of the
country in the last five years?

256
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,913
Yes.

257
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,813
Three years?

258
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,083
Yes.

259
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,691
Two years?

260
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,889
He stopped traveling for work
two years ago, after we got serious.

261
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,560
Any vacations?

262
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,000
His last one was six months ago.

263
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,995
This golf resort
at Key Biscayne.

264
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,166
No way it was a golf resort.

265
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,505
Knowing Fletch, I assumed he was working
his way through every bar in the Keys,

266
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,070
a last hurrah
before settling down.

267
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,116
Alcohol? No.

268
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,885
Amphetamines?

269
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,279
No.

270
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,218
You tested positive.

271
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,086
He doesn't use
drugs. I told you.

272
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,190
When we got engaged, we decided
we wanted a different kind of life.

273
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,927
And he dropped the macho journalism.
No more taking crazy chances.

274
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,362
That includes his health.

275
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
He asked me not
to tell Elizabeth.

276
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,148
So he's been lying to
her about his drug habit?

277
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,076
Well, yes and no.

278
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,674
BE, before Elizabeth, he
used drugs recreationally.

279
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,380
I wasn't crazy about it, but that
thrill-seeking behavior is what made him

280
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,184
the kind of journalist
that he was.

281
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,917
And now? AE?

282
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,293
Man's twisted himself into knots for
her. Completely cleaned up his act.

283
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,628
But the drugs? They're
medicinal. Sort of.

284
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,934
He was having trouble sleeping.

285
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,234
This new suburban lifestyle. Lack
of excitement was throwing him off.

286
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,405
So he started
with sleeping pills.

287
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,172
When they knocked him out, he
needed something to perk him back up

288
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,769
during the day.

289
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,211
Every day?

290
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,750
No slippery slope there.

291
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,717
Keep the stain!
Knife can't force.

292
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,290
We're not gonna tell
your wife. We're not cops.

293
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,909
There's a little edema, brain
swelling, and an area of scarring.

294
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,637
Is that what's
causing the aphasia?

295
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,344
Actually, that's what's odd.

296
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,181
The scarring's not in the area
of the brain normally associated

297
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,620
with conduction
aphasia. And it's old.

298
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,020
Happened before he hit his head.

299
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,821
Maybe a small stroke or some
other underlying condition that

300
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:07,986
could be causing this.

301
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,053
Or it might have
nothing to do with it at all.

302
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,895
Have you ever had head
trauma before? An accident?

303
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,196
Ever had any numbness on
one side before? Dizziness?

304
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,168
What is the durable?

305
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,243
No.

306
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,629
<i>All departing passengers
for Flight Number 870,</i>

307
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,713
<i>the plane will be
delayed by one half-hour.</i>

308
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,280
<i>We apologize for
any inconvenience.</i>

309
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,354
I got you some coffee.

310
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,472
So, what do you
want to talk about?

311
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,146
The scarring on the
MRI could be anything.

312
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,624
MS, toxins, any one of
100 demyelinating diseases.

313
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,662
If it's meningitis, we
have to ID the bug fast.

314
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,009
We need to do a lumbar puncture.

315
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,931
I'm not doing an LP with this
edema. We could paralyze him.

316
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,059
What does House say?

317
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,937
"The person you are
trying to reach is out

318
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,832
of the area or has
turned off their phone."

319
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,997
So, what are your orders?

320
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,167
We need more information.
There is no more information.

321
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,336
We'll break into his place.

322
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,078
Have fun.

323
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,183
How's the patient? Fine.

324
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,846
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.

325
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,001
Oh, well, I'll join you, and
you can bring me up to speed.

326
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,324
Oh, sorry. Reservation for two.

327
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,559
When people give themselves
away, it's by little things.

328
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,701
That woman over there...
She's not sneering at her coffee.

329
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,365
She's recovering
from Bell's palsy.

330
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,977
And the cashier at
the coffee place...

331
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,381
She doesn't want anyone to
know, but she's dying of ALS.

332
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,717
There's a particular sort of
twitchy, stiff arm that's characteristic.

333
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,854
And then there's you.

334
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,986
Why aren't you
wearing your cross?

335
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,161
I told you I left it at...

336
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,963
You keep jewelry cleaner under the sink
so you won't have to go a day without it.

337
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,402
True, you forgot it that
morning that our pipes burst,

338
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,400
but then you went back and
waded through the flood to retrieve it.

339
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,139
So, why no wading today?

340
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,806
Didn't you bring a book
to read, or something?

341
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,053
Nothing.

342
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,227
Caffeine pills and amphetamines.

343
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,925
Same stuff he told
us he was taking.

344
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,236
And Topamax.

345
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,236
An anticonvulsant? But he said
there was no history of prior seizure.

346
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,901
It's not even prescribed to him.

347
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,535
Still doesn't explain his fever.

348
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,639
He's probably just using it for
weight loss. Just gives us another lie.

349
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,616
He must really be devoted.

350
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,913
Should we check the home?

351
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,629
If he wanted to hide
something from his wife,

352
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,212
why wouldn't he
hide it in the office?

353
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,655
Or maybe she's hiding something.

354
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,727
Nothing but aspirin and
flu meds in the bathroom.

355
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:15,131
Looks like this stuff's
been sitting here for weeks.

356
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,231
Home improvement.

357
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,243
He probably thought he
could take the project on,

358
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,144
then realized it was a little
more than he could handle.

359
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,759
You got a point to make, or
did you just feel like giving a long,

360
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,412
unnecessary explanation for
something medically irrelevant?

361
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,597
What happened to the Foreman
who always has an answer?

362
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,715
The guy who practically
wears a sign saying,

363
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,782
"I'm as good as
House, but I'm nicer."

364
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,882
I never said that.

365
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,521
I guess it's safe to be confident
when House is there to overrule you.

366
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,690
Now that it's all on you...

367
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,864
It's different. Yeah.

368
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,501
Either you left it behind
on purpose, or by mistake.

369
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,744
The only reason you'd
leave it behind intentionally

370
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,805
is if it no longer
meant anything to you.

371
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,713
But since it was a
gift from your mom,

372
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,327
that would mean you
had a fight with her.

373
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,616
But since you don't talk
to ghosts, that's unlikely.

374
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,882
Leave it alone, Greg.

375
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:07,518
Yeah, I'm good at that. So that
leaves forgetting it unintentionally.

376
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,206
But then we have to explain why you
didn't go back for it when you realized...

377
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,028
I didn't realize until
I got to the airport.

378
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,932
Nope. You were wearing
makeup when you got to the airport.

379
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,300
You can't put on makeup
without looking at yourself.

380
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,415
You can't look at yourself
without touching that thing.

381
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,567
Why does this matter to you?

382
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:26,240
It's an anomaly.
Anomalies bug me.

383
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,606
Then you're gonna suffer.

384
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,922
I think it's his stomach.

385
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,700
I teal indigent.

386
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,759
Was it something you ate?

387
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,167
He keeps doing that.

388
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,102
I teal indigent.

389
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,607
Are you hungry? No.

390
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,886
No, he's in pain.
Is it a sharp pain?

391
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,745
No. Teal indigent!

392
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,581
Taste? Yes.

393
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,884
A metallic taste? Yes!

394
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,950
I'll be right back.

395
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,924
I suppose it's also possible
that the clasp broke,

396
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,141
but then you'd be carrying
the thing around in your purse...

397
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,565
We had a fight.

398
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,126
We had a fight, and I was
angry and not thinking straight,

399
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,403
and I walked out without my
makeup and without my cross.

400
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,158
I stopped at the drugstore to buy
makeup, but I couldn't buy a cross,

401
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,770
because they don't have an
aisle for personal talismans!

402
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,744
So you had a fight.
I'm sure it'll blow over.

403
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,116
It was about nothing.
Of course it was.

404
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,714
Mark's tired. He's worried.
He's got mobility problems.

405
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,223
It's normal to blow
up over little things.

406
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,870
I don't mind fighting
over little things.

407
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,854
I didn't mind fighting over big
things. That I could understand.

408
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,031
We fight over nothing.

409
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,364
You know, a mailbox with a sign
that says, "Last pickup 5:00 p.m."

410
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,305
Does that mean last pickup
to go to the post office,

411
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,901
or last pickup to leave the post
office and be sent out of town?

412
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,372
You fought over mail delivery?

413
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,972
I tried to get him to drop
the subject, but he wouldn't.

414
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,541
I told him he was right. He
thought I was being condescending.

415
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,881
You were.

416
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,220
He's pushing me out of his life.

417
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,153
Maybe you're misinterpreting.

418
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,223
Did I misinterpret with you?

419
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,959
At least, this
time I recognize it.

420
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,866
That's the benefit of convincing
the only two men you've ever loved

421
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,234
they're better off without you.

422
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,699
Yeah, it's all your fault.

423
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,342
You know, "Stacy" in the original
Greek means "relationship killer."

424
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,225
I'm going to go wash my face,
so I look like a grownup again.

425
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,828
Hello.

426
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,106
It's for you.

427
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,909
House. Do you know
your phone's dead?

428
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,501
Do you ever recharge
your batteries?

429
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,578
<i>They recharge?</i>

430
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,341
I just keep buying new phones.

431
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,680
I thought you should know
your aphasia guy is tasting metal.

432
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,046
Where's his creatinine?

433
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,088
<i>6.8. He's got kidney failure.</i>

434
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,249
Cameron's got him on dialysis,
and he's stable for the moment.

435
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,520
Unlike Cuddy, who's suicidal.

436
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,790
It's either meningitis or
encephalitis. Or maybe autoimmune.

437
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,091
That's perfect.

438
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,431
Seems like you really
narrowed it down over dinner.

439
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,832
Here's the plan.
We talk to House.

440
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,744
We've been trying. He's
not answering his cell.

441
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,584
It's obvious we have to
do the lumbar puncture.

442
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,634
There's no choice anymore.

443
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,546
<i>You have to do it just right.</i>

444
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,843
What are you talking about?

445
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,477
Either you've decided to do a
lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me

446
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,512
so that I can't fire all of you
as soon as I get back in charge.

447
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,989
Is Cuddy there, ranting?

448
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,050
If I'd known you'd
be out of contact...

449
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,788
They can handle it. - <i>Right.</i>

450
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,330
So far, only three organ
systems have failed.

451
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,298
<i>Okay, they can't.
Doesn't matter.</i>

452
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,096
The guy's not stable
enough to move.

453
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,898
So go rant in your own office.

454
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,268
Fine. Call me when you're done.

455
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,538
What do you mean by
doing the LP just right?

456
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,807
We're not gonna screw it up.

457
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,974
The odds are, this guy
knows something we don't.

458
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,913
He could know the answer to the
meaning of life, the man can't communicate!

459
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,511
<i>Have you had any indication</i>

460
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,682
<i>that he's tried to communicate
something important?</i>

461
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,918
No.

462
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,191
Well, that's because you guys
haven't scared him enough.

463
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,991
I'm sure you've been all, "Oh,
we'll take real good care of you."

464
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,395
<i>Why should he say anything?</i>

465
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,435
When you prep him,
tell him he's gonna die.

466
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,465
<i>Crush all hope. Don't
let Cameron do it.</i>

467
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,009
Cuddy, you got a
problem with any of that?

468
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,512
You're scheduled
for a lumbar puncture,

469
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,381
but you shouldn't count
on that having the answers.

470
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,148
If your husband
continues to decline...

471
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,520
You'll die.

472
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,095
If there's anything
you haven't told us...

473
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,845
How you holding up?

474
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,821
I know what you just
heard is scary as hell, but...

475
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,052
Couldn't tackle the bear.

476
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,290
Couldn't tackle the bear.

477
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,263
They took my stain.

478
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,130
<i>Attention, please.</i>

479
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:57,643
<i>Due to weather conditions, all
flights are grounded till further notice.</i>

480
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,710
<i>Cots are being provided
on the lower level.</i>

481
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,714
<i>We apologize for
the inconvenience.</i>

482
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,477
I don't believe it.

483
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,980
You want me to run down and
reserve you a cot with a view?

484
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,884
Where's your knapsack?

485
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,686
Checked it through.

486
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:16,122
That's right. I forgot. It's
hard for you to carry and walk.

487
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,290
I booked a room at the airport hotel
when I saw how bad the weather was.

488
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,094
It's the last one available.

489
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,865
Your leg can't handle
a night on a cot.

490
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,833
Thanks.

491
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,072
I'm ready.

492
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,969
Right.

493
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,543
The hotel's upstairs.

494
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,942
Does Mark know about this?

495
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,262
Mark knows that
when things are bad,

496
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,279
I always like to have
an escape route planned.

497
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,976
I have to know
what's going on here.

498
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:17,713
Because when you have a fight
with Mark and you try to avoid me,

499
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,634
then I have to think that...

500
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,150
That I'm feeling vulnerable,
and I don't want to be around you,

501
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,696
because it might
lead to something.

502
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,958
Right.

503
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,025
But then, a hotel room...

504
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,231
Might also lead to something.

505
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,630
So, which is it?

506
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,043
Our relationship's
like an addiction.

507
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,913
It's like...

508
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,313
Really good drugs?

509
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:51,184
No, it's like Vindaloo curry.

510
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,556
Okay, sure.

511
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,618
Really, really hot Indian curry
they make with red chili peppers.

512
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,357
I know what it is.

513
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,796
Didn't think it was addictive.

514
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,836
You're abrasive and annoying,
and you come on way too strong.

515
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,736
Like Vindaloo curry.

516
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,645
And when you're crazy
about curry, that's fine.

517
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,734
But no matter how
much you love curry,

518
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,075
you have too much of it, it
takes the roof of your mouth off.

519
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,310
And then you never want to see
curry for a really, really long time.

520
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,977
But you wake up
one day and you think,

521
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,982
"God, I really miss curry."

522
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,264
You're a jerk.

523
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,670
I know.

524
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,204
If you hadn't just
had a fight with Mark...

525
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,002
For once in your
life, will you shut up?

526
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,252
<i>House.</i>

527
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,359
You're on speakerphone.

528
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,090
How did the LP go?

529
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,064
Give me the <i>Reader's
Digest</i> condensed version.

530
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,570
<i>Preliminary results are
some kind of infection which</i>

531
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,268
<i>narrows it down...</i>

532
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,336
From infinity, yeah.

533
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:54,242
At the rate his organs are
deteriorating, he's got maybe a day or two.

534
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,608
Okay. Well, call me back
when you have something.

535
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,174
<i>He was trying to
tell us something.</i>

536
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,358
What did he say?

537
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,886
You were wrong. It wasn't the
fear. He opened up to me when I...

538
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,058
A sympathetic presence
after a traumatic moment.

539
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,864
Classic interrogation
technique. What did he say?

540
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,498
You knew that I'd...

541
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:24,100
Act the way you always do?
Yeah, I did. What did he say?

542
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,038
He couldn't tackle the bear.

543
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,414
Now all we need is the
English-Aphasic dictionary.

544
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,041
A fluent aphasic retrieves
words that are stored

545
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,429
somewhere close
to the one he wants.

546
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,423
They could be filed by
sound or by meanings.

547
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,287
So if he wants to say "table,"

548
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,384
he could say "label"
or he could say "chair."

549
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,896
Or he could just say
"jabberwocky." There's no way to tell.

550
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,798
He also said,
"They took my stain."

551
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,297
Hold on.

552
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:59,567
I'm gonna take this phone downstairs,
so I don't disturb you. Is that okay?

553
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:00,837
Sure.

554
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:04,375
Keep him talking. Write
down everything he says.

555
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,846
Stacy.

556
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,215
That new makeup you bought,
do you mind if I borrow it?

557
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,796
What did you mean by
"stain"? Dirty, soiled...

558
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,796
No, no.

559
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,475
What about rhymes? Pain? Brain?

560
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,170
Thane?

561
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:37,539
He is dying from some kind of infection,
and you all are playing word games?

562
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,346
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

563
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,552
Let's start this again.

564
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,934
"Bear." Is it "bare"
as in "naked"?

565
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,538
Crimson Desire shows
up well on Sheetrock.

566
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,675
That's why I chose it.

567
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,821
<i>You must have gotten one new
phrase out of him. Something.</i>

568
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:00,855
We've been talking to him for
hours. Maybe he's just given up.

569
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,712
You sure you've told me everything
you found at his home and office?

570
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,464
No, we're hiding something.

571
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,130
Maybe it's not a
rhyme or a synonym.

572
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,503
What else is there?

573
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,769
You think we should just
start guessing randomly?

574
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,640
Maybe House is wrong.

575
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,537
Hope that's not the
end of the thought.

576
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,812
He mentioned "stain" once before,
when Chase was giving him the MRI.

577
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,079
Before we scared him. He did?

578
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,916
It's in your notes.

579
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:27,255
<i>So he only talks during
MRIs and lumbar punctures?</i>

580
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,461
Your theory is he can only talk
with a needle in his back or...

581
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,895
When his wife's not in the room.

582
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:39,399
The more devoted,
the more reason to lie.

583
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,298
That's cynical.

584
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,703
You disagree?

585
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:47,212
No, I'm just <i>kvelling.</i>
Our little girl is growing up.

586
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,446
Okay, what's the best way to rip a
woman from the side of her dying husband?

587
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,509
You woke me up to
lie to a patient's wife?

588
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,454
Tell her there's been a miscommunication
over their insurance coverage.

589
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,047
Not a big deal.

590
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,286
Tell me. If it is
your aim to sell me

591
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,798
the same crazy ideas that House does,
how are you an improvement on House?

592
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,799
I brought you a coffee.

593
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,640
Your flight's been
boarding for 20 minutes.

594
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,835
I'll take a later one.

595
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,275
Greg, they can't
leave without you.

596
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,506
You checked your knapsack.

597
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,915
Are we in? Yeah.

598
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,282
Hi. I'm Gregory House.
I'm your attending physician.

599
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,251
Your wife's not
there. Start talking.

600
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:34,917
They took my stain. I
couldn't tackle the bear.

601
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,626
They took my stain.

602
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,132
Okay, shut up now. Nice work,
Cameron. Give him the list again.

603
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,099
Let us know when
something sounds right.

604
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:47,162
Dirty, soiled, pain, brain...

605
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,297
Yes.

606
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,464
Where does that get us?

607
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,773
We're already paying
plenty of attention to his brain.

608
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,608
We've got an MRI, got a CT...

609
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,877
Are we sure he wasn't reacting
to "pain"? He's been on painkillers.

610
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,474
<i>Oh, come on, Chase.</i>

611
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,553
Drugs didn't do this to
him, even if he is an addict.

612
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,623
I dissuade the tonal category.

613
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,217
Oh, please, Mr. Sleeping
Pills, Amphetamines,

614
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,893
Bring Me Up, Bring Me Down...

615
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:14,531
<i>Will passenger Gregory
House please report to Gate 7.</i>

616
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,727
<i>Gregory House to Gate 7.</i>

617
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,239
Ever hear this one?

618
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:25,869
<i>You build a house. Each
wall has a southern exposure.</i>

619
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:30,208
A big bear comes wandering
by. What color is the bear?

620
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:34,342
White. It's a polar bear. You
built your house in the North Pole.

621
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,650
Polar. Whatever your name
is. Patient! Are you bipolar?

622
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,725
<i>What? I can't see.
Is he nodding?</i>

623
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,887
Yes.

624
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,792
Topamax isn't just off-label for weight
loss. It's off-label for mood disorders.

625
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:53,100
Plenty of bipolars are manic in
the daytime, depressive at night.

626
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:56,699
He's been medicating for years with
alcohol, sleeping through the bad hours.

627
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,243
<i>It explains the
danger journalism.</i>

628
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,177
<i>Explains everything,
including the kitchen sink.</i>

629
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,957
<i>Okay, technically, it's
the kitchen cabinets.</i>

630
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,075
He starts a project,
then he stops.

631
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,382
Except bipolar disorder
does not cause seizures.

632
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,888
<i>And it doesn't shut down your
kidneys. But what it does do...</i>

633
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,333
<i>Excuse me, sir.
May I see your ID?</i>

634
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,053
<i>I'm on the phone.
I'm on the phone.</i>

635
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,218
<i>Now, please.</i>

636
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,625
House? What is it?

637
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,822
<i>I'm a doctor. This
is an emergency call.</i>

638
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,729
You have to come with me, sir.

639
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,234
I'm not going anywhere. Do you
think you're gonna take me on?

640
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,031
I kick and I bite.

641
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,100
You're either on that plane,
or you're going into custody.

642
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:37,381
<i>House?</i>

643
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,472
Are you still there?

644
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,409
Being bipolar
makes you take risks.

645
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,422
You seek excitement,
you make up stories.

646
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,023
I dime value tale lever!

647
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:51,256
Fine, maybe your stories are legit.
But people would start to wonder.

648
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,959
<i>Annoyed politicians, entire
governments would be on your ass.</i>

649
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,969
So you couldn't tell anybody
you were bipolar. Which was fine.

650
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,072
Until you fell in love.

651
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,134
And you wanted that life.

652
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,481
And you hear that
there's a surgical cure.

653
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,748
You can give the woman
you love the life she wants.

654
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,582
All you have to do is change.

655
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,829
Bilateral cingulotomy.

656
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:28,190
<i>An experimental surgery that some
people claim helps mood disorders.</i>

657
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,100
And if it's done by Gamma
Knife, there's no trace of cutting.

658
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,929
That's the neural scarring
we saw on the MRI.

659
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:36,169
Which explained nothing, because
it wasn't even in the right area.

660
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,972
It's not the surgery,
it's the secrecy.

661
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,470
What causes recurring fever,

662
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,605
neurological problems,

663
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,650
lethargy that you fight with
caffeine pills and amphetamines?

664
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,982
<i>It wasn't your secret
psych disorder.</i>

665
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,188
<i>It wasn't your
secret daily drug use.</i>

666
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,588
<i>It was your secret trip
for your secret surgery</i>

667
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,990
<i>in Caracas or Buenos Aires.</i>

668
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:58,220
Which, by the way, didn't work,
given the state of your kitchen cabinets.

669
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,561
House. Shut up.

670
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,460
What's going on?

671
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,606
Is he right?

672
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:17,013
Your doctors know
you better than I do.

673
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,509
That man on the speakerphone,
he never even met you,

674
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,986
and he knows you
better than I do.

675
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,292
You love me?

676
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,691
Yes. Yes.

677
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,868
You just don't trust me.

678
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,504
<i>Get some blood on a slide.</i>

679
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,543
Do not put it through
a computer this time.

680
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,703
Yeah.

681
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,818
Cerebral malaria.

682
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,289
I'll get him started on
intravenous quinidine.

683
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,269
If a human being had actually looked
at his blood anywhere along the way,

684
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,570
instead of just running
tests through the computer,

685
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,106
the parasites would have
jumped right out at them.

686
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,573
Price of the electronic age.

687
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:38,757
Fletch.

688
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,523
She'll be back.

689
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:49,431
Give her time to miss you.

690
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,060
<i>Final boarding call
for Flight Number 7...</i>

691
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,178
I'm counting on you to
get me off the no-fly list.

692
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,983
Is your patient
gonna be all right?

693
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:07,082
Physically, his chances
are good. Physically?

694
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,988
Two people who weren't
meant to be together.

695
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,963
Maybe they'll get a happy ending
just because they both want it so much.

696
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,193
Yeah, that's usually
the way it works.

697
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,794
He loved her enough to
convince himself he could change.

698
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,540
But he couldn't, could he?

699
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,476
Thank you.

700
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:32,543
You know what Woody
Allen said about relationships.

701
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:35,143
Irrational and crazy, but we
go through it all because...

702
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,881
We need the curry.
