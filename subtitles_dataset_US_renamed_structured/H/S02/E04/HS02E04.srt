1
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,614
Hey!

2
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,994
Dr. Sebastian.

3
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,768
Two pallets of
antibiotics for tuberculosis.

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,830
We've got six pallets
worth of patients.

5
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,968
Stoia Tucker needs a math
lesson. I'm headed back tomorrow.

6
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,137
Hey! Hey!

7
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,586
Come on, come on. Come
on, kids, let the truck through.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,860
Move those boxes quick, quick.
Let's move! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

9
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,956
Let's go! Let's go, man! Hurry!

10
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,527
I've got some very special medicine
here. It's from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

11
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,034
One per person. One per person.

12
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,007
Let's calm down,
kids. Wait, wait.

13
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,351
Help! Help! Dr. Sebastian!
Come quickly!

14
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:32,383
My son, he fell. He fell on this log.
We were just waiting for his friends.

15
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,900
I got no breath sounds
on the left. Give me that.

16
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,677
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

17
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,507
The fall didn't cause
him to drop a lung.

18
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,645
The lung caused him
to fall. TB chewed it up.

19
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,350
He'll be lucky to
live another year.

20
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:07,361
This is Sarni. I picked up the
tab for the back brace myself.

21
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,622
The funny thing is,

22
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,187
is that the brace cost
more than the medicine

23
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,893
that would have prevented
her from needing it.

24
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,797
It's your medicine.

25
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,703
All of the antibiotics that
we need are right here

26
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,703
in your warehouses,
in your factories.

27
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,904
We provide over 10,000 doses
a year. Which is not enough.

28
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,140
You know we'd love to do
more, but our hands are tied.

29
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,443
New car, Jerry?

30
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,094
I saw it on the way in, looks
beautiful. Don't make this personal.

31
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,815
All the way from Germany,
too. I know that's a lot of red tape.

32
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,516
I'm not like you. I'm not
ashamed of making a living.

33
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,821
And I know you didn't become
a chem major for the money.

34
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,329
Now, you want the same
things that I want. You just...

35
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,757
You have to... You just
have to push a little...

36
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,131
You have to push
a little bit harder...

37
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,466
Harder for it. Sebastian?

38
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,542
Call 911.

39
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,643
Okay. Is he okay?

40
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,842
Isn't someone here a doctor?

41
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,554
Selling subscriptions? I heard
20 and you get a new bike.

42
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,426
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed
during a presentation at Stoia Tucker.

43
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,591
Really? Crushed under
the weight of his own ego?

44
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,701
Wow! Is there nobody you admire?

45
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,801
Well, there is this gal I met in Nam who
could blow out a candle without using...

46
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,603
He thinks it's TB.

47
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,740
Good thing he's not the syphilis
expert. He wants a second opinion.

48
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,678
Second to his own. Okay.

49
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,751
It's not TB. What is it?

50
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,284
Oh, you want specifics?

51
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,222
Lemma, big Knicks fan.

52
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,457
You've never had an
episode like this before?

53
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,429
No. He died last month.

54
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,532
Stupidly tried to share
his meds with his cousin,

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,694
and they only had
enough for one.

56
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,770
Dr. House, I'm
Sebastian Charles.

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,376
Patients aren't usually part
of the diagnostic process.

58
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,371
Well, I'm a doctor.

59
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,553
Listen, I know you guys
don't make a lot of money...

60
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,746
I wrote your people a check last
month. Oh, well. Write us another one.

61
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,254
Talk to Chase. He's
rich. My dad, not me.

62
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,654
Every minute four
people die of TB.

63
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,353
Wow! How can you sleep at night?

64
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,055
There's people dying in Africa
of a disease that we cured over...

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,462
Yeah, I know. I saw the concert.

66
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,830
Seriously. Let's see, you sleep six
hours. That means every night you kill

67
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,604
1,440 people.

68
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,930
I guess you got to get
some sleep, but come on.

69
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,409
If you'd stayed up another 10
minutes, you could have saved 40 lives.

70
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,188
Do you send notes to the
families in the morning?

71
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:16,809
That's gonna take at least 10 minutes. So
that's another 40 dead, another 40 notes.

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,678
Why don't you go wrack yourself
with guilt in your own room?

73
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,087
No, thanks. I'll stay. I'd
like to hear the differential.

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,287
Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it's
not a good idea for the patient to be here.

75
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,522
He's an immunologist
and a TB expert.

76
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,760
That'll be very useful if we
need somebody to say the words,

77
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,563
"I think it's TB."

78
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,601
What is that?

79
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,140
Oh, that. I'm sorry,
that's my body powder.

80
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,407
It's the only thing I've found
that works in the Sahara.

81
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,035
I'm kind of used to it.
I don't even notice it.

82
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,546
Who thinks it smells like
an elephant-dung smoothie?

83
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,139
It smells okay to me.

84
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,218
That is exactly why the
patient shouldn't be in the room.

85
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,530
If you can't tell a man that his
cologne makes you want to puke,

86
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,354
how are you gonna tell
him that he's an idiot?

87
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,255
He's not an idiot.

88
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,227
Sure, you say that now,
while he's in the room.

89
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,560
Look, I don't have time
for this. It's TB. Nope.

90
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,599
The symptoms are too varied.

91
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,033
Well, if you haven't seen 10,000
cases, I agree that's what you'd think.

92
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,366
I told you he's an idiot.

93
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,408
You said you wanted a
second opinion. No, actually,

94
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,999
my backers wanted
a second opinion.

95
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:20,013
Yeah, doesn't look good if you drop dead
while wearing your shoe sponsor's logo.

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,141
It's TB and I'm not dying. I'm
gonna want you to plant a PPD

97
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,259
and induce a sputum
to confirm the TB.

98
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,677
Imaging studies will
determine the progress,

99
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,247
and I think we should probably
take a CT scan of my lungs

100
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,056
just so that nobody second
guesses us. Wouldn't want that.

101
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,432
Hello? No, I'm
feeling much better.

102
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,564
Well, what you can do is, you
can get your board to approve

103
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,336
the increased med
shipments that... Sorry.

104
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,977
No, don't, don't, don't
try. No, don't do your best.

105
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,516
Just get it done, okay?

106
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,755
That's Stoia Tucker, and they're
the nice pharmaceutical company.

107
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,384
I'm sorry, but it's against hospital
regs. Oh, I need the phone.

108
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,429
Why don't we focus on
getting you better right now?

109
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,728
What'll you do, throw me
out? No, just the phone.

110
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,893
Sorry. We've got an emergency.

111
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,163
Got to go.

112
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,701
There's a phone in your room.
Yeah, I figured that there would be.

113
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,075
Right. I just thought...

114
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,307
It's not like the hospitals
you may be used to in Africa.

115
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,476
I don't know what the
facilities were like, so...

116
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,644
Thank you.

117
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,819
You're welcome.

118
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,448
And thanks for that check.

119
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,720
I should go.

120
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:48,798
The nameless poor have a face,
and it's a pompous white man.

121
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,464
Yeah, what a jerk, saving
all those lives like that.

122
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,338
What's the emergency?

123
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,167
I can't remember how
to do "walk the dog."

124
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,506
The guy's sick, maybe dying.

125
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,421
And you've forgotten all about
doing a differential diagnosis.

126
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,647
You just sent us off to test him for...
Well, I had to get him out of there.

127
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,814
Now we can all sit around
and call him an idiot.

128
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,754
- Who wants to go first?
- He's right.

129
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,225
Tuberculosis could present
hundreds of different ways.

130
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,990
Well, by that logic, everyone in
the hospital should be treated.

131
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,157
Not everybody in the hospital has
been exposed to it for the last 20 years.

132
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,962
TB takes years to kill you.

133
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,627
Two weeks ago, he
was perfectly healthy.

134
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,398
Now he's got a
whiteboard full of symptoms.

135
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:28,966
What about something metabolic?
Welcome aboard the Good Ship Ass-Kisser.

136
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,407
Nice day for a sail.
Pucker up, me hearties.

137
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,813
It's not metabolic. Kidney, liver and
thyroid are all normal. No diabetes.

138
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,249
What about his heart?
Obviously big as all outdoors.

139
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,756
Abnormal heart rhythm.
Wave forms show PR variability.

140
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,287
It's subtle, but it's there.

141
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,419
You think it's his heart?
Sick sinus syndrome?

142
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,363
Loose throttle. Sometimes
beats too fast, sometimes too slow.

143
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,299
Causing him to pass out. It
would account for the episode.

144
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,746
I'll put him on telemetry, do a
stress test and an echocardiogram.

145
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,330
Treat him like every
other hospital patient.

146
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:03,702
I want to see that pious, body-powdered
tush hanging out of his gown.

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,942
Could you give me a
hand with this thing?

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,688
I don't recall asking for a
stress test or an echocardiogram.

149
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,050
What are you gonna do, walk out?

150
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,987
Corporate sponsors
aren't gonna like that.

151
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,527
I need your forearm.

152
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,094
What's House thinking?

153
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,964
Sick sinus syndrome. Well,
that's a lot more serious than TB.

154
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,168
Is that a PPD?

155
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,212
If it changes color
in the next 48 hours...

156
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,614
Yeah, if House doesn't think it's TB,
why would he have you test for that?

157
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,686
Just covering all
his bases, I guess.

158
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,315
Uh-huh.

159
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,555
He doesn't seem like
a guy who does that.

160
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:59,088
We have you scheduled for
a 10:30 echo. Good for you.

161
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,630
Every minute that we
refuse to love one another,

162
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,141
another puppy
cries another tear.

163
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,611
You're just mad because he's
closer to a Nobel Prize than you are.

164
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,980
And yet I've nailed more
Swedish babes. Crazy, crazy world.

165
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,210
It's not just a trip to
Stockholm, you know.

166
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,084
It comes with a cash prize.

167
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,582
Seriously?

168
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,060
No wonder everybody's
going after that peace thing.

169
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,025
He cures thousands
of people every year.

170
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,893
You cure what, 30?

171
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,992
McDonald's makes a better hamburger
than your mother because they make more?

172
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,661
Oh, I see.

173
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:41,197
So you hate him because the lives he
saves aren't as good as the lives you save?

174
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,243
Yeah, that's the reason.

175
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,677
Nobel invented dynamite. I
won't accept his blood money.

176
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,683
The top of my head's killing me.

177
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,548
We spent a week doing
"top of head" in anatomy.

178
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,620
I know just where it is.

179
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,261
That is not the top of my
head. Close enough for clinic.

180
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,496
Your sinuses are clogged.

181
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,461
Judging by the scratches on
your hands, I'm guessing a new cat.

182
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,197
It was my mother's. She's dead.

183
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,141
You keep a dead cat?

184
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,176
No. My mother's dead.

185
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,917
Poor cat. You're allergic.

186
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,815
We can control it
with antihistamine.

187
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,854
One pill a day. Pills?

188
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,791
You don't like to
swallow. Not surprised.

189
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,657
Forget the pills. We'll
give you a nasal spray.

190
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,990
Steroids?

191
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,127
Is there something
else you can give me?

192
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,332
Well, if you live by
the river, I've got a bag.

193
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,833
Hey. Stress test was normal.

194
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,875
But his EKG was not
normal. Echo's normal.

195
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,509
Two for you, one for
me. We need a tiebreaker.

196
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,177
Echo and stress tests are
more reliable. Tilt table tests.

197
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,884
That never works.

198
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,480
I'll bet you a week's
clinic duty it does.

199
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,317
You're on.

200
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,357
You like this guy?

201
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,464
You always tell us our opinion
of the patient's irrelevant.

202
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:18,129
Medically, it's irrelevant. It
says something about you.

203
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,332
You figure anybody who gives a crap
about people in Africa must be full of it?

204
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,408
Yes.

205
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,705
There's an evolutionary imperative why we
give a crap about our family and friends.

206
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,477
And there's an evolutionary imperative why
we don't give a crap about anybody else.

207
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,954
If we loved all people
indiscriminately, we couldn't function.

208
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,390
So the great humanitarian's
as selfish as the rest of us?

209
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,391
Just not as honest about it.

210
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,265
Well, you also always tell
us motives are irrelevant.

211
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:49,693
<i>Dr. Charles, your heart's handling
the changes in orientation just fine.</i>

212
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,998
<i>No pauses on your EKG.</i>

213
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,201
And House drives in for
the lay-up and no, rejected!

214
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,237
What does this knobby thing
do? I'm within protocol range.

215
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,905
You're not gonna
get a different result.

216
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,883
The way I figure it is, this
could show you problems at six,

217
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,584
imagine what it'll tell
you if you crank it to 10.

218
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,317
House, is that you?
Does it go to 11?

219
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,792
Would you stop? You lost. I'm scheduled
for clinic duty Thursday and Friday.

220
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,590
All right, I'm beginning
to feel nauseous.

221
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,097
Would you turn the damn
thing off before you break it?

222
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,133
Okay, I'm getting dizzy.

223
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,691
I can't see and
I'm gonna pass out.

224
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,969
I win. At those speeds,
astronauts throw up.

225
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,466
I'm not talking
about the nausea.

226
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,603
The test revealed the problem.
Yeah? House is insane?

227
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,475
What he just did...
Abusive and unprofessional.

228
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,814
If he hadn't done it, we
wouldn't have seen the problem.

229
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,678
You've got an
abnormal PR interval.

230
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,189
It could be dangerous, possibly
fatal, particularly if you're in Africa

231
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,726
away from advanced medicine.

232
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,024
I'm gonna need a pacemaker?

233
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,663
You're scheduled for
surgery this afternoon.

234
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,529
We'll be able to maintain
your pacemaker from anywhere.

235
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,885
You just need to get yourself to
a phone line every few months.

236
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,936
Better yet, you could join
me at one of my clinics.

237
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,776
I'm kind of spoiled. Well,
we'll get you a hut with a view.

238
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,283
Do you like sand?
I meant medically.

239
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,485
No PET scans, no
MRIs... This is ridiculous.

240
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,920
Dr. Charles... I know. I
know. Hospital regulations.

241
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,356
Darling, have a seat. Come on.

242
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,724
You're smart. You'll adapt.

243
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,426
We're going up or
down? Basement.

244
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,692
All right.

245
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,735
You might even find that
without the technological crutches,

246
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,360
you become a
better diagnostician.

247
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,995
My heart can handle this, right?

248
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,132
So far, just carnival
rides have set you off.

249
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,943
When you meet these
people, it changes you.

250
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,942
We should talk
about it over dinner.

251
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,145
Are you asking me
to Africa or on a date?

252
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,746
I can ask you halfway around the world, I
can't ask you to a restaurant a block away?

253
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,624
Well, one's a job, and the
other's... Yeah, hospital regs.

254
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:59,632
You can't date patients, right? I wouldn't
wanna risk your precious objectivity.

255
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,096
You haven't answered
either question, by the way.

256
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,966
You don't think
objectivity's important?

257
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,200
I think doctors like
House cling to objectivity

258
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,472
like a three-year-old to a
blanket. Don't get too worked up.

259
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:15,379
Stay calm. Stay cool and
maintain the correct perspective.

260
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,541
The only flaw in their argument is that
when you have millions of people dying,

261
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,215
the correct perspective is to be
yelling at the top of your lungs.

262
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,792
Sorry. My head is killing
me. Here, sit on the step.

263
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,593
So, are you gonna
go out with me or not?

264
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,705
Your heart rate's normal.

265
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,470
Yeah, of course it is. It's one
flight of stairs. I'm gonna be fine.

266
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,637
Hand's a little...

267
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,189
Call a code, second
floor stairwell!

268
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,930
You were wrong.
Hey, I have feelings.

269
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,629
I'm trying my best. Isn't
that enough for you?

270
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,162
The abnormal EKG was real.
It's not sick sinus syndrome.

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,335
Thank God we found out
before we put the pacemaker in.

272
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,880
And thank God you dragged him
into a stairwell to get his heart racing.

273
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,267
We were taking the stairs.
They keep them in the stairwell.

274
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,285
The guy's a selfish
jerk. Why would you...

275
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,649
Why would you say he's selfish?

276
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,087
Because he's been talking to Foreman.
No, I haven't. I'm just giving my opinion.

277
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,434
This kind of altruism
doesn't just naturally...

278
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,458
Excellent briefing.

279
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,518
Hey, the guy's still sick.
Can we talk about that?

280
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,622
Now, headaches point to a
neurological problem. Acoustic neuroma.

281
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,497
A brain tumor causes
dizziness, loss of consciousness,

282
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,559
messes with breathing
patterns, heart rhythms...

283
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,934
Get an MRI.

284
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,199
Hello?

285
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,801
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be
right down. No problem.

286
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,039
I'll do an extra
hour to make up.

287
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,445
I'm late for my clinic duty.

288
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,145
Here, go be me for
a couple of hours.

289
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,815
Explosive diarrhea,
fever, it's probably the flu.

290
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,863
Wow. You're good.
You a Harvard boy?

291
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,459
You're not Hill, Oliver. No.

292
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,568
Carter, Cecelia.

293
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,000
They put you in the wrong
room, Cecelia. Mrs. Carter.

294
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,339
Sorry.

295
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,673
I'll just be a few more minutes.

296
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,905
Don't take these in order,
everything falls apart.

297
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,241
I have cancer.

298
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,111
I felt a lump.

299
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,709
I'll go get a nurse. Yeah,
see you in an hour or two.

300
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,453
Lie flat.

301
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,093
Lift your left arm up
and under your head.

302
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,965
Right there? Yeah.

303
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,972
I felt it this morning.

304
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,903
Oh, my cousin
had the same thing.

305
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:58,968
It's nothing.

306
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,843
We should check it
again on your next cycle,

307
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,439
but you really don't have
anything to worry about.

308
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,041
That's what they told Donna.

309
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,144
She was dead in six months.
Listen, the edges are smooth.

310
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,621
It has mobility. It has all
the earmarks of a benign...

311
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,682
Why should I believe you?

312
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,428
Because you're trying
to rush me out of here?

313
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,430
The risks of a false positive
on a biopsy outweigh...

314
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,865
Either you do the biopsy,
or I talk to your superior.

315
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,332
Which is it, Dr. House?

316
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,867
I'll arrange the biopsy. Thanks.

317
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,917
He asked me out. I'm shocked.

318
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,384
I'm shocked when
patients don't ask you out.

319
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,689
He also asked me
to come to Africa.

320
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,600
Boy, he moves fast.

321
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,295
I think the two questions
had two different objectives.

322
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:03,468
Do you like him? Good-looking
single guy, genius doctor,

323
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,936
cares about the world.
I take it you said no.

324
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,040
You think I'm that hung up
on rules? He's not House.

325
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,243
There's nothing there.

326
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,324
Yeah, there is.

327
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,021
Did I ask you to plant a PPD?

328
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,191
It was positive. He's got TB!

329
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,294
Well, of course he's got TB. The
guy's been in the jungle for 20 years.

330
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,306
If he tested positive for pinkeye,
would you think that was his big problem?

331
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,901
I did a test. It was positive.
Why is that a problem?

332
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,470
Because now he's got the
big red target on his arm,

333
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,347
the stubborn jerk thinks he's right.
He won't let us do any more tests.

334
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,750
Well, maybe he's not
the only stubborn jerk.

335
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,221
I did an LP, too. Low glucose,
and he has an increased sed rate.

336
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,418
Everything screams
tuberculosis! Not everything!

337
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,759
If any of the symptoms are caused by
the TB, it would throw off our diagnosis.

338
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,727
You're right. We
gotta treat the TB.

339
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,836
Who knows? Maybe
he'll just get better.

340
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,910
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

341
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,617
So, it's TB, but not TB?

342
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,893
I'm complicated. The guy
does know tuberculosis.

343
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,372
If he says it can manifest...
The guy's not even a real doctor.

344
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,332
He's a human telethon. Is
that your problem with him?

345
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,800
You see hypocrites every
day. Why is this guy so special?

346
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,497
You think I have a hypocritical
attitude to hypocrisy?

347
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,235
The problem is, there are 26 letters in
the alphabet and he only uses two of them.

348
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,436
He treats thousands of
patients with one diagnosis.

349
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,502
He knows the answer
going in. It's cheating.

350
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,448
So it's all because he's one
of them useless specialists?

351
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,351
Oh, did I hurt the big-time
oncologist's itty-bitty feelings?

352
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,186
You're a big help to patients
who actually have cancer.

353
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,523
Other times you're just
annoying. You've outdone yourself.

354
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,856
I'll say. My salad's
covering a free T-bone steak.

355
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,192
Cecelia Carter, remember her?

356
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,792
Last week they said it was
mystery stew. They owe me.

357
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,328
She was just in my office crying
because of the way you treated her.

358
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,896
That doesn't sound like you.

359
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,636
Then it probably wasn't.

360
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,543
I get that you like
to shock people,

361
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,943
stun them out of
complacency, out of stupidity.

362
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,241
But this woman
thought she had cancer.

363
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,617
She had a lump in her breast.
What were you trying to accomplish?

364
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,055
Let me ask you something.
If this were another doctor,

365
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,954
if the patient were complaining
about, let's say, I don't know, Foreman,

366
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,795
you'd just dismiss this as the paranoid
bitching of another paranoid bitch.

367
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,198
And file it under
"P" for... Paranoid?

368
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,630
Am not.

369
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,804
You're right. Good.

370
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,070
Apologize to her before
the end of business today.

371
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,045
What did you do to
Ceci? I have no idea.

372
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:58,176
Just the salad
today. Big breakfast.

373
00:21:58,284 --> 00:21:59,411
Hey.

374
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,623
Levofloxacin?

375
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,820
You have a
resistant strain of TB.

376
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,529
Wow, you just walk right in with
these. That's what we doctors do.

377
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:16,057
We write down the name of some
medicine, and someone gives it to us.

378
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:20,596
You know, there's parts of the world where
you get knifed walking around with this.

379
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,700
I mean, the regular
stuff is bad enough,

380
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,512
but the treatment for
the resistant strain?

381
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,915
They get $6 a tablet for that.

382
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,449
And I take it for two years.

383
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,080
Streptomycin. Now,
that's two grand.

384
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,427
Ten grand, cure one person.

385
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,836
I had a patient in Djani once.

386
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:58,604
It was a mother,
had three little boys.

387
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,913
She had resistant TB.

388
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,712
She couldn't afford these.

389
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,909
She couldn't afford bread.

390
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,847
We gave her the
regular stuff, but

391
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,185
no surprise, she died. Sorry.

392
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,470
I'm not taking these pills.

393
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,409
Because she couldn't get them,
you're not gonna take them?

394
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,114
That's insane. Why?

395
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,877
'Cause I'm better than her?
Because letting her die was wrong,

396
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,442
but letting you die
is just as wrong.

397
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,887
Maybe I won't die.

398
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,989
Maybe somebody will pay a
little more attention to my story.

399
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,796
He figures the
pharmaceutical companies

400
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,611
need something big to
force them into action.

401
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,969
This'll get a lot more media play
than 1,000 African villagers dying.

402
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,530
So, he won't take the pills.

403
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,406
<i>Newsweek's</i> calling you. And
he won't agree to any more tests.

404
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,569
He has his diagnosis.

405
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,088
See what happens when
you don't listen to me?

406
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,978
Maybe millions
of lives get saved.

407
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,040
Yeah. That's my point.

408
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,381
Increased heart
rate, night sweats,

409
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,389
loss of consciousness. Besides rough
sex, what do they all have in common?

410
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,015
T... It's not TB!

411
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,626
His autonomic nervous system?

412
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,152
We know that it's not a brain tumor.
So what else could be eating his nerves?

413
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,391
Fabry's. Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

414
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,197
Shy-Drager syndrome. It doesn't
matter. He won't let us test him.

415
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,903
In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian
Charles is an idiot.

416
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,271
Yeah, you can
quote me. C-U-D-D-Y.

417
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,083
Sebastian is refusing
life-saving treatment.

418
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,023
He's refusing TB treatment.
You don't think he has TB.

419
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:56,119
Ergo, you should care less.
He won't let me test him.

420
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,222
And what do you want me
to do about it? Hold him down.

421
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:02,097
Have you apologized
to Cecelia Carter yet?

422
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,796
Trust me, she doesn't
wanna hear from me.

423
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,270
Look, the guy
is killing himself!

424
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,773
Am I the only one who
realizes this is a bad thing?

425
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:13,108
If he was a Christian Scientist
refusing meds, we'd have 18 attorneys...

426
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,247
You're putting on makeup.

427
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,183
That's not a good
sign for my side, is it?

428
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,552
Sebastian has called a
press conference for 3:00.

429
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,284
He's asked me to be there to confirm
the diagnosis and the prognosis.

430
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,988
You are as big a
media whore as he is.

431
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:33,931
Of course I am. It couldn't
possibly be that I think he's right,

432
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,298
and that I'd like to be a
small part of what he's doing.

433
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,169
Oh, whores can like the sex.
Doesn't mean they're not whores.

434
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:44,604
And with that eye shadow, I
am totally screwed, aren't I?

435
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,040
Totally.

436
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,441
How you feeling? A little weak.

437
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,316
You're having a good day.

438
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,582
The symptoms will quickly focus
more and more on your lungs.

439
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,969
You'll find it difficult to talk
and eventually breathe at all.

440
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,904
I think I know what I'll
have to look forward to.

441
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,928
I know.

442
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,431
I just came to ask if you'd be
willing to accept any treatment.

443
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:12,233
No, if you're trying to scare me
into... No. Palliative treatment.

444
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,200
Narcotics.

445
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:17,243
Fentanyl patch, morphine
drip, whatever it takes.

446
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,369
We can make your last
days fairly comfortable.

447
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,010
And if you have another
good day, maybe dinner.

448
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,853
Thank you.

449
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,901
You want Third World
treatment? You got it.

450
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,430
Boy, is it hot here in
Djani. What are you doing?

451
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,872
What am I doing?

452
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,467
Putting everything
on the floor of the hut.

453
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,506
What's the magic box
with the moving pictures?

454
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,742
You think he's a
hypocrite? Hypocrite? No.

455
00:26:56,815 --> 00:27:00,047
Everybody in Africa's got
cell phones and running water.

456
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,490
This thing just will not flush.

457
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,755
Do you really think that if you
come in here and make it a little hot,

458
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,022
make it smell a little,

459
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,759
that I'm just gonna fold and abandon
everything that matters to me?

460
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,362
Lousy sanitation
over there, too.

461
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,738
You are not the same as
them. Your life is not the same.

462
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,585
And you're cheapening everything they're
going through by pretending you are.

463
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,077
I am the same. I'm not special.

464
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,546
You can't demand to be treated
like any Third World sick person

465
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,709
and call a press conference!
They treat me special!

466
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,951
That doesn't mean I am.

467
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,551
And what kind of selfish jerk
wouldn't take advantage of that fact?

468
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,437
It's all preventable.

469
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,109
Stoia Tucker makes medications
right here in New Jersey.

470
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,876
They have warehouses full of the stuff.
There's more than enough to go around.

471
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,043
So if I can get them,
why can't Lemma?

472
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,277
Why can't Quesmo?
And why can't Sarni?

473
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:17,520
Another person just died.
Where is your outrage?

474
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,560
<i>No, I have no intention
of martyring myself.</i>

475
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,725
<i>I'm just putting myself...</i>

476
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,599
Sure, they're dying,
but it's got a great beat.

477
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,967
Must be hot as hell
under those lights. Yep.

478
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,872
Hey, why the page?

479
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,911
He okay? He's in a coma.

480
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,913
I need you to apologize
to Ceci, Cecily.

481
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:40,817
Mrs. Carter? For what?
For whatever I did.

482
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,946
You didn't do anything. That
has been my position all along.

483
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,049
<i>His chest x-rays are negative,
so he's not contagious at this point.</i>

484
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,650
<i>His condition is
currently stable.</i>

485
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,562
Do you ever notice how all the
self-sacrificing women in history,

486
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,290
Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa,

487
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,933
can't think of any
others, they all die alone.

488
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:03,065
The men, on the other hand,
get so much fuzz it's crazy.

489
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,632
It's an unfair world.

490
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,375
House, she was scared and unreasonable.
Insulting a woman with breast cancer,

491
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:14,384
that's a move best left to the pros.
Frankly, you don't have the chops.

492
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:19,049
I didn't insult her! I did the
unnecessary biopsy like she wanted.

493
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,059
It was negative like
I knew it would be.

494
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,118
What'd you do, call them perky?

495
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,755
You are years away
from mad skills like that.

496
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,767
I need you to apologize.

497
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,637
Cuddy's only doing this
because she thinks it's you.

498
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,536
Welcome to the world.

499
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,241
Everyone's different,
everyone gets treated different.

500
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,279
And you try fighting that,
you wind up dying of TB.

501
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,542
What are you doing?

502
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,312
Testing the patient's
autonomic nervous system.

503
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,186
Of course. His internal heating
and ventilation should be off.

504
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,690
He shouldn't be able to sweat.

505
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,954
That's why he's got
that awful body powder.

506
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:58,327
Take it away, crank up the
heat, stick him under the lights,

507
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,164
he can't cool himself. He
should be turning bright red.

508
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,702
The picture's fine.

509
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,464
<i>Yeah.</i>

510
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,170
<i>I'm asking Stoia Tucker</i>

511
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,875
to save these lives,
millions of lives,

512
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,814
including my own.

513
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,982
Dr. House, I would
appreciate it if you left us...

514
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,286
Get that out of my face. CUDDY:
<i>What are you trying to prove, House?</i>

515
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,036
<i>Dr. House, I would appreciate
it if you left the room while...</i>

516
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,392
He's sweating like a pig.

517
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,973
It's 100 degrees in here, House,
because you turned up the thermostat.

518
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,762
Did they hear me? The
media, did they listen?

519
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,428
He's disoriented.
They have to hear me.

520
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,529
His arteries are clamping down. I
want everybody out of here now!

521
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,417
Get the crash cart. He's
having a cardiac arrest.

522
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,041
- Get it set up.
- All right.

523
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,337
Get them out!

524
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,747
Everyone. I want
everyone out of here now!

525
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,178
Clear.

526
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,458
Come on, Sebastian.

527
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,525
Clear.

528
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,222
I've got sinus rhythm.

529
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,041
<i>That is not TB.</i>
Compelling television.

530
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:26,981
Do whatever tests you want.
I want to treat you for TB.

531
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,956
Dr. Cameron found low sugar
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

532
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,857
It's a classic finding of TB. Oh,
now you think TB's the problem?

533
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,727
No.

534
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,459
If TB caused cardiac
arrest on a hot day,

535
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,468
your work in Africa would be
even more futile than it already is.

536
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,333
Can you get to
your point, please?

537
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,034
That whiteboard in my office, we're
up to about a dozen symptoms now.

538
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,804
Cardiac arrest, clearly not TB.

539
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,205
CSF sugar clearly is TB.

540
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,507
The rest of them
could go either way.

541
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,813
Unless we know which ones
are which, I can't diagnose you.

542
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,487
I'll take any other tests or
treatments you might want to prescribe.

543
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,422
So you're not
special, but TB is.

544
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,593
People die of TB because
we let them. It's our choice.

545
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:20,069
People die of malaria because we
let them. They die of dysentery. They...

546
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,700
No, TB's my disease.
You own a disease?

547
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,345
Well, I'm sorry I missed
the IPO on dengue fever.

548
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:31,777
Look, I know I have a way about
me, and I know I piss a lot of people off.

549
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,011
And a whole lot
more I just annoy.

550
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,212
But you're the first
person that I've ever met

551
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,917
who I think is actually
annoyed by what I do.

552
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,992
Do you think I'm not saving
any lives, or is that a bad thing?

553
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,587
Right now, I'm just
trying to save your life.

554
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,031
Or do you just have
a problem with hope?

555
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,429
You know, the difference between
our jobs is not numbers or styles.

556
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:58,340
It's that I know I'm gonna fail.
Even if I save a million people,

557
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,506
there's gonna be another
million. You couldn't handle that.

558
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,710
I think you resent
anyone who can.

559
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:09,153
Can't we just agree that
you're incredibly annoying?

560
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,854
Take the pills,
or I'll let you die,

561
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,415
do an autopsy, call my
own press conference

562
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,563
and make sure the world
knows that you didn't die of TB.

563
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,191
Corporate sponsors will be disappointed,
but they'll find another disease.

564
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,894
Why would you do that?

565
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,535
Because I'm just a
mean son of a bitch.

566
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,777
So, we still have to explain PR
variability, syncope, headaches

567
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,476
and

568
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:43,738
low sugar?

569
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,546
That was classic
TB. Apparently not.

570
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,118
You rerun the test? Yeah.

571
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,982
This is good. Good?
This is bizarre.

572
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,424
"Bizarre" is good.

573
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,325
"Common" has hundreds of
explanations. "Bizarre" has hardly any.

574
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,093
What else could
cause low CSF sugar?

575
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,958
I get to ask the questions.

576
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,869
I've found you look a lot smarter asking
questions than dumbly not answering them.

577
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,669
High insulin levels in his blood.
They'd have to be very high.

578
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,404
Okay, very high insulin
levels in his blood.

579
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,309
How could he get
high insulin levels?

580
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,178
We've checked daily
blood sugars, all normal.

581
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,013
See how smart she looks?
'Cause she asked the question.

582
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:23,078
And it's not glucagonoma
because he has no rash.

583
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:26,249
It's not self-induced
because he's not an idiot.

584
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:30,590
And it's not a tumor because the
CT and the MRI were both negative.

585
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,426
Which just leaves tumor.

586
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,647
Why do you do this? Why do you
ignore what I say like I'm not even...

587
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,106
Small tumor.
Really, really tiny.

588
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,641
So small we can't see it.

589
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,472
Nesidioblastoma.

590
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,741
An abnormal growth of the
insulin-secreting cells in his pancreas?

591
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,977
That only intermittently secrets insulin...
- In response to stress,

592
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,055
like if, I don't
know, if someone

593
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,784
accidentally puts the
mechanical bull on 11.

594
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,254
Easily removed by surgery.

595
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,624
Except if it's so
small we can't see it,

596
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,253
how are we even
gonna prove it's there?

597
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,922
She asked, looking clever.

598
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,934
Just start hacking away at his
pancreas until he gets better?

599
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,201
How do you prove something
exists when you can't see it?

600
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,036
Does God exist?
Does the wind blow?

601
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,167
We know because the
leaves move. Look for effects.

602
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,939
You should look the other way.

603
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,072
There's Cuddy with your patient.
- Dr. House!

604
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,117
Dr. House has an emergency.

605
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,979
We can't avoid her
forever. Eventually she'll die.

606
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,018
You sure she doesn't
have breast cancer?

607
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,586
We think you have a tumor.

608
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,389
Easily removed surgically.
We're gonna poke it with a stick.

609
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,726
And if there's no
tumor? Nothing happens.

610
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,036
Splenic artery, it's a
hard left off the celiac.

611
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,062
If there is a tumor?

612
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,236
What usually happens when
you poke something with a stick?

613
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,436
Pokes back.

614
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,805
He's stuck in the
superior mesenteric.

615
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:58,740
I knew we should have
stopped for directions. Men!

616
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,844
I'm there.

617
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,349
We're gonna inject
calcium into your pancreas.

618
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,115
The beta cells
will release insulin.

619
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,684
If there are too many beta
cells because of a tumor,

620
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,390
your blood sugar
will drop precipitously.

621
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,193
How do we know
it won't go too low?

622
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,633
Fingers and toes crossed.

623
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,567
Go ahead.

624
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,679
Glucose is holding steady at 75.

625
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:42,560
No leaves rustling. Blow harder.
I already gave him one amp.

626
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,256
Well, I guess now would be the
time to give him more than one amp.

627
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:01,509
Fifty. It's starting to drop.

628
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,576
Forty-five. I think
my arm's shaking.

629
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,953
I'm gonna start him on a
glucose drip. He's gonna seize.

630
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,115
Not yet.

631
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,090
It's continuing to drop.
- Not fast enough.

632
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,328
He's seizing. We've
got to reverse this.

633
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:33,578
He's at 40, 38, 35.

634
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,752
Push an amp of D50.
You want to kill the guy?

635
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,629
We're back to 40.

636
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,401
Congratulations.
You have a tumor.

637
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,044
Are you gonna go out with him?

638
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,708
Is that any of your
business? Nope.

639
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,983
I don't think so.

640
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:18,182
Two days ago, you were
holding his hand. What's changed?

641
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,593
He practically lives in
Africa. There's no future.

642
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,660
On the other hand, maybe
there's too much of a future now.

643
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,700
You weren't attracted to him because
he was prepared to die for a cause.

644
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,932
You were attracted to him
because he was actually doing it.

645
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:37,066
Right. It's that simple.
That was simple?

646
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,272
I put a label on him and go
from there. Everybody does it.

647
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,940
We are who people think we are.

648
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,355
People think he's a great
doctor, so they give him stuff.

649
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,319
He is a great doctor.
The reality is irrelevant.

650
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,150
I'll prove it.

651
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,688
People who know me see me
as an ass, treat me as an ass.

652
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,428
People who don't know me see
a cripple, treat me like a cripple.

653
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,262
What sort of selfish jerk wouldn't
take advantage of that fact?

654
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,486
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

655
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,852
Yeah. I am so sorry.

656
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,828
It was completely my fault.

657
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,625
It's nothing. I'm fine.

658
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,632
Well, I'm very
relieved. I feel terrible.

659
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,262
Please don't worry about
it. I'm fine. You sure?

660
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,498
Okay.

661
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,645
How's everything?

662
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,544
I'm gonna go. My
foot's killing me.

663
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:00,217
What did you do to... It was
nothing. It was all my fault.

664
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,995
Yeah, listen.
Bogale, relax, okay?

665
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,465
I'm gonna be back on Tuesday.

666
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,967
Tell Sarni I'm gonna bring
her a new brace. All right.

667
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,102
Just in case. You get them?

668
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,676
Six-months' supply.
Should fix you right up.

669
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,587
I'll see you when you
come back for a refill?

670
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,307
Yeah, I'll see you
in two months.

671
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,110
You gonna give them away?

672
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:28,041
Well, you know how these things
happen. You leave a bag on the airplane,

673
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,418
you drop some
pills down the drain.

674
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:35,121
I have an idea. You could
bring me the refill in Africa.

675
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,293
I don't think so.

676
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:41,331
You actually like working for
House? You find this satisfying?

677
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:14,960
There he is.

678
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,777
It's good to see you.
Dr. Sebastian. Thank you.

679
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,635
Thank you. I appreciate
that. I appreciate the support.

680
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,036
It's not about the kids
dying every eight seconds.

681
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:27,704
It's about the media stroking,
adulation, the pats on the head.

682
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,147
That's your problem
with him, isn't it?

683
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,117
Look at him.
Loves it, eats it up.

684
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,952
Yeah, the man actually
enjoys what he does.

685
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,953
Listen, I saved his life.

686
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,858
That means I get credit for every
life he saves from here on out.

687
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,527
I'll make sure Stockholm knows.
