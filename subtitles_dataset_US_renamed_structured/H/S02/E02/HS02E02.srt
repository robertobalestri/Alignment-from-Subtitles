1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>To all your friends,
you're delirious</i>

2
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:17,006
<i>So consumed in all your doom</i>

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:23,756
<i>Trying hard to
fill your emptiness</i>

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,424
<i>The piece is gone</i>

5
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,324
Ten-minute warning. I'm fine.

6
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,888
What about your
meds? Got it, Mom.

7
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:37,533
<i>You are beautiful no
matter what they say</i>

8
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,806
House!

9
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,908
Need you. Forget
it. I'm going home.

10
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,718
Hay fever? Oh, you must
be a doctor and everything.

11
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,118
Two minutes. No.

12
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:05,148
The purple thingie on the file
means that whoever is one of yours

13
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,626
which means cancer, which
means no way it's two minutes.

14
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,856
Fine, I'm lying. 30 minutes.

15
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,463
Mystery of life.
Benadryl might help.

16
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,567
Already did 1,000
milligrams. Steam room?

17
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,947
Why, Jimmy. We'll talk
about this in the morning.

18
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,816
I got a 9-year-old with cancer.
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

19
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,014
Terminal kid trumps
your stuffy nose. Not yet.

20
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,119
She's hallucinating.

21
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,087
So the rhabdo's in her brain.

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,095
Make her comfortable.
She's got about a week.

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,189
Yeah, except there is
no cancer in her brain.

24
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,864
Pristine CT scan, blood tests,
protein markers, all negative.

25
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,961
The cancer's in remission.

26
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,737
Which means the
hallucinations are unconnected.

27
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,470
Fascinating, huh?

28
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,780
And not that it matters, but if you
fix whatever's going on in her head,

29
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,783
you give her maybe another
year. Long time for a 9-year-old.

30
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,613
No. It'll just fly by.

31
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,986
Five major surgeries, a
bone marrow transplant,

32
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,062
fourteen rounds of
chemo and blast radiation.

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,996
If it was me, I'd just stay home
and watch TV or something,

34
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,693
not lie here under a microscope.

35
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,365
Don't worry. Anything happens
to you, nobody's gonna lift a finger.

36
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,634
Differential diagnosis.

37
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,908
On your marks, get set...
Hallucinations could be caused by...

38
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,778
Whoa! Wait for it.

39
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,579
And go.

40
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,014
Latent neurotoxicity from
the chemo treatments.

41
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,388
No, patient's last round of
chemo was two months ago.

42
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,258
We would've seen it by
now. Genetic component?

43
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,694
Nothing on mom. Dad
split when she was pregnant.

44
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,095
His medical history's
also clean. What a guy.

45
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,864
What about graft versus host disease
from the bone marrow transplant?

46
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,839
Infection travels to her
brain, she has hallucinations.

47
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,067
Blood work and LP were clean.

48
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,305
But where there's infection,
there's meningeal swelling.

49
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,472
That CT shows no
meningeal involvement. True.

50
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,773
Get a tox screen and an MRI.

51
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,285
We can do that, if you wanna
ignore what we just discussed.

52
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,411
Sounds good.

53
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,649
Toxic exposure doesn't
make any chronological sense.

54
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,089
I guess there is a third
option. She's making it all up

55
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,855
because she doesn't wanna
get in trouble for breaking a mirror.

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,228
Unfortunately we can't test
for that, so tox screen, MRI,

57
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,267
and you stay away from
the patient. What'd I do?

58
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:32,363
Oh, well, you'll just get all warm
and cuddly around the dying girl,

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,739
and insinuate yourself. Probably
end up in a custody battle.

60
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,538
Chase, you handle the mom.

61
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,046
Tell her that you'd just sit
home and watch TV and die,

62
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,557
but you've got to go
through the motions

63
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,949
and try to save her daughter's
life. It's a doctor thing.

64
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,784
What the hell is this?
Black walnut and ginger.

65
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,021
It's nice.

66
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,758
I'll just lay you down and
I'll attach this thingamajiggy.

67
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,662
Sat monitor. Oh, a pro.
Don't have to explain anything.

68
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,035
I like it.

69
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,669
Central line for the chemo. Yeah.
Doesn't hurt or anything, does it?

70
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,873
No, it's awesome.

71
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:17,941
Instead of an IV, it saves me a lot
of time and a bunch of needle sticks.

72
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:22,183
Oh, I don't think I've ever heard anyone
say they like their central line before.

73
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,252
All right, can I interest
you in a walk in the park?

74
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,356
No, thanks. Okay.

75
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,057
Don't want any
butterflies, either.

76
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,934
Doesn't matter what the walls look
like, you're still looking for cancer.

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,838
Not today. We're looking for
an infection. But I get your point.

78
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,375
You comfortable? Yup.

79
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,968
All right. Let's get
this over with. A pro.

80
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,540
I like it.

81
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,547
Whoa! Look at the time.

82
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,417
I should've been out
of here 20 minutes ago.

83
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,549
You've only been here 20 minutes.
I can't slip anything by you, can I?

84
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,026
There's a patient in One.
Nah, I'm taking a sick day.

85
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,360
Take some Claritin.
Everyone's a doctor suddenly.

86
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,966
Patient in One
requested a male doctor.

87
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,332
Balls are in your court,
doctor. Union rules.

88
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,702
I can't check out this guy's seeping
gonorrhea this close to lunch.

89
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,070
Exam Room One.

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,038
Well, it's sexist, and a
very dangerous precedent.

91
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,956
If people could choose
the sex of their doctors,

92
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,449
you gals would be out of
business. Exam Room One!

93
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,153
Sore throat?

94
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,628
Well, it's not lupus. Well, not
everyone can operate a zipper.

95
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,495
You know, the up,
down, what comes next?

96
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,192
My new girlfriend
never been with a guy

97
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,603
who wasn't circumcised.

98
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,701
So she freaked, and... Ah-ha.

99
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,040
And you wanted Rivkah
to feel all <i>gemutlicht.</i> I get it.

100
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,672
It's a <i>shandah.</i>

101
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,349
I got some box cutters
and... Just like Abraham did it.

102
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,123
I sterilized them,
which I was told...

103
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,424
Stop talking.

104
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,566
I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon.
Get the Twinkie back in the wrapper.

105
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,313
House. Hey, House.

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,679
Andie's MRI and tox screen were
clean. No infection, no neurotoxins.

107
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,099
Oxygen saturation is
94%. Check her heart.

108
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,862
Her oxygen saturation is normal.

109
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,129
It's off by one percentage
point. It's within range, it's normal.

110
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,641
If her DNA was off by one
percentage point, she'd be a dolphin.

111
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,938
We've got a patient who for no
obvious reason is hallucinating.

112
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,412
Since it's not obvious, I
thought we'd go with subtle.

113
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,642
It doesn't matter. If her
sat percentage is off,

114
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,593
that means her blood
isn't getting enough oxygen.

115
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,395
That's a problem with
her lungs, not her heart.

116
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,230
And a lung problem isn't
causing hallucinations.

117
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,189
But the lungs could lead
us somewhere that is.

118
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,749
Welcome to the end of the thought
process. Primary pulmonary hypertension?

119
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,728
Maybe PE or pulmonary fibrosis.

120
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,765
Could be some bizarre
case of kyphoscoliosis.

121
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,125
I'm going home.

122
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,137
While I'm resting, you guys
get some arterial blood gases,

123
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,106
once you confirm that she is
hypoxic, I want a plethysmography,

124
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,199
chest x-ray, CT and V-Q.

125
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,612
But if all that comes back negative,
then snake a catheter into her lungs.

126
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,079
Don't worry, if I don't
sleep in, I'll get bagels.

127
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,246
You ever had this test
before? What's it for?

128
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,391
This goes all the way up the
vein by your hip, into your lung.

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,928
If I find something up there
blocking anything, I pull it out. Simple.

130
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,560
It's gonna be easy. The doctor at
Sloan told me I had a great aorta.

131
00:08:55,668 --> 00:09:00,129
Oh, you have had this test before.
Sorry. I just like hearing you talk.

132
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,141
I've never kissed a boy.

133
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,377
There's time yet for that.

134
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,746
There was a boy last summer.

135
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:22,395
I was at one of those cancer camps.
I just never had the guts to ask him.

136
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,203
You know, there's a good chance
I'm not gonna walk out of this hospital.

137
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,338
Even if I do, I'm nine.

138
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,897
Not a lot of kissing
going on in the third grade.

139
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,176
You will walk out of here, all
right? And you will kiss a boy.

140
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,944
There you go. A smile.

141
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,582
Will you kiss me?

142
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,787
No. No one will ever know.

143
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,156
I'm sorry. I can't.

144
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,835
I won't tell anyone. Listen,
you're nine years old.

145
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,062
I'm 30.

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,470
I just wanna know
what it feels like. Once.

147
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,079
This isn't your
last chance for that.

148
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,748
What if it is?

149
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,312
Please kiss me?

150
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,191
Bagels. FOREMAN:
You didn't sleep in.

151
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,354
Didn't sleep, didn't
breathe. I'm dying.

152
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,588
Pulmonary angiogram of
Andie's lungs was clean.

153
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,863
Arterial blood gases and
CT scan were also normal.

154
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,433
Her heart and lungs are fine.

155
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,869
Which gives us no explanation
for the diminished sat percentage.

156
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,069
Yeah, oddly enough,
sometimes normal is normal.

157
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,443
Sometimes we can't see
why normal isn't normal.

158
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,981
Get her symptoms on the board.
You're letting me touch the markers?

159
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,281
It's written out in my
advanced health care directive.

160
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,878
Should I be incapacitated in
any way, you run the board.

161
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,392
Then Foreman. Chase,
you're just not ready yet.

162
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,088
What else? Guys, I know
we sort of ruled out infection,

163
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,757
but if we forget the
labs for a minute,

164
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,892
there is one infection we didn't
test for because of her age.

165
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,834
Neurosyphilis. There's no way.

166
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,838
If the infection dipped
into her cerebral cortex,

167
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,650
all peripheral functions
could be compromised.

168
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,200
No. She hasn't
had sex. She's nine.

169
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,179
Maybe it wasn't her idea. I mean,
she's been around a lot of adults.

170
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,483
All the hospital visits, the
counselors at the cancer camps.

171
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,848
You think she's been molested?

172
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,030
And hiding it pretty well if
there's any of that going on.

173
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,081
Yeah. All girls who've been
molested wanna talk about it.

174
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,260
Break out the rape
kit. She hasn't had sex.

175
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,388
Why are you so sure? She
told me she'd never kissed a boy.

176
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,933
You read her diary, too?
She asked me to kiss her.

177
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,030
I rest my case.

178
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,869
A regular 9-year-old girl
does not have sex on the brain,

179
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,273
not when a doctor's threading
a catheter through her vein.

180
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,972
But she's not a regular 9-year-old.
She's got terminal cancer.

181
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,378
Cancer doesn't make you special.

182
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:32,385
Molestation on the other hand...
She wanted one kiss, before she dies.

183
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,889
If she's never kissed a boy,
it's a fair bet she's never had sex.

184
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,790
Tell that to all the hookers
who won't kiss me on the mouth.

185
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,890
Hey, here's a theory.
She has been molested,

186
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,024
seeks refuge in romantic fantasies
with older men with great hair,

187
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,831
and I think you left
out the punchline.

188
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:54,137
Victims of molestation learn to
work the angles, manipulate people.

189
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,174
You did it, didn't
you? You kissed her.

190
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,609
It wasn't sick. It was
one kiss for a dying girl.

191
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:10,282
One small... One small
kiss before she dies.

192
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,415
Thank you. Thanks.

193
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,325
This is exactly why you
can't touch my markers.

194
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,160
Go see if she's had sex. Okay.

195
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,263
No one's ever touched
me. We just need to be sure.

196
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,633
I like your hair.

197
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:33,510
I used to have really curly hair. I
always wanted it to be like yours is.

198
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,115
Thank you.

199
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,144
All right, that's
it. You're fine.

200
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,921
With a patient. She dying?

201
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,760
No. Then she can wait.

202
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,658
Will you excuse
me just two minutes?

203
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:33,164
If only she'd been molested.
Then we'd have something to go on.

204
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,966
No forced entry.
One hallucination.

205
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,435
Maybe it was just bad
pork, maybe there's nothing...

206
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,071
She's not fine.

207
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:47,182
Her sat percentage dropped another point.
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.

208
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,285
Lung wouldn't explain
the hallucination.

209
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,483
CT scans showed
both lungs were clean.

210
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,822
Which means there's a tumor in
her heart. Not a chance! Give me that.

211
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,758
I loosened it. I opened it.

212
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,298
We've got an MRI and an echo
of her heart. There's nothing there.

213
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,602
Give me one other explanation
for low oxygen saturation.

214
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,768
I can't. There's only one
condition that simultaneously affects

215
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,642
the heart and brain, but
she... Perfect, let's go with that.

216
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:17,741
Tuberous sclerosis in a kid that
also has alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma?

217
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,879
Two different unrelated cancers at
the same time is a statistical no-no.

218
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,480
What's the rate of cancer
in the general population?

219
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,550
One in 10,000? Don't.
Don't start with the numbers.

220
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:31,530
Way I figure it, one in 10,000 of
them should have another cancer.

221
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,199
Little girl won
the lottery twice.

222
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,698
It happens. So you're
gonna cut her open?

223
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,066
Exploratory surgery.
I gotta find this thing.

224
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,508
You're just gonna grope around inside
an immunocompromised 9-year-old?

225
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,240
She could die on the table. I
know it's somewhere near the heart.

226
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:51,114
House... you've got
to do better than that.

227
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,263
Why are we here?

228
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,373
Better acoustics.
Now listen to this.

229
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,042
It's a mitral heart valve. No.
Get the wax out of your ears.

230
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,281
This is the patient's
aortic valve.

231
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,291
I downloaded the audio
of her echocardiogram.

232
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,623
What are we trying
to hear? Tumor.

233
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,687
They tend to keep quiet on account
of them not having any mouths.

234
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,528
But we could hear an abnormality
in the sound of the valve,

235
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,035
which would indicate the
presence of something.

236
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,267
The tumor, for example. If we
could tell the surgeon where to look,

237
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,705
this is no longer an exploratory
surgery, it's a precision strike.

238
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,769
Her aortic valve
sounds normal. Too bad.

239
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,476
Now listen to the dulcet
tones of Andie's tricuspid valve.

240
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,520
Normal. And this
is her mitral valve.

241
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,922
I don't hear anything weird.

242
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,389
You guys make me
sad. Listen again.

243
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,665
She's had one hallucination.
Why are we operating on her?

244
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,266
Why are we risking her life?

245
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,864
Because Wilson thinks it'd
be nice to give the girl a year

246
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,671
to say goodbye to her mommy.

247
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,803
Guess maybe she stutters or
something. Now shut up and listen.

248
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,346
Tricuspid.

249
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,081
Mitral.

250
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,519
Again. CAMERON: Wait.

251
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,487
There.

252
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,657
There's an extra flap.

253
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,060
I'm gonna ask the surgeon
to look at the mitral valve first.

254
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,229
Chase, I want you there.

255
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,069
I don't like reading surgeon's
reports, they're boring.

256
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,735
I'm not really sure I should be
spending more time with her.

257
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,438
She'll be unconscious.
You'll be safe.

258
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,457
I'll be there when you wake
up. I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

259
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,474
Brave kid. She even
gave her mom a pep talk.

260
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,673
Mature, brave. She's a wonder.

261
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,411
What's your problem?

262
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,780
These cancer kids, you can't
put them all on a pedestal.

263
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,685
It's basic statistics. Some of them
have got to be whiny little fraidy-cats.

264
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,946
You're unbelievable.

265
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,022
If there's not one
yellow-belly in the whole group,

266
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,424
then being brave doesn't
have any meaning.

267
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,291
Andie handles an impossible
situation with grace.

268
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,456
That's not to be admired?

269
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,075
You see grace because
you wanna see grace.

270
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,377
You don't see grace because
you won't go anywhere near her.

271
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,700
Idolizing is pathological
with you people.

272
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,069
You see things to admire
where there's nothing.

273
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,539
Yeah, well, we're evil.

274
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,167
You find things to admire where
you shouldn't be sniffing at all.

275
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,510
Like Debbie in
Accounting. She's nice.

276
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,206
You shouldn't know
that. You're married.

277
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,251
So, the little kid dying of
cancer, I shouldn't like her?

278
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,684
If you're dying, suddenly
everybody loves you.

279
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:19,249
You have a cane, nobody even likes
you. I'm not terminal, merely pathetic.

280
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,192
You wouldn't believe the crap
people let me get away with.

281
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,646
They found a tumor. It's in her
lung, extending into her heart.

282
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,382
It wasn't visible on the MRI because
it's growing along the heart wall.

283
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,351
Now, because of the placement,

284
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,621
the surgeon has to temporarily
remove Andie's heart.

285
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,321
<i>It's called an explant.
They cut out the tumor,</i>

286
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,400
<i>replace any damaged heart
muscle with bovine patches.</i>

287
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:38,698
That's a patch made
from the cow's pericardium.

288
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,899
It's a sac that
encloses the heart.

289
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,935
What are her chances?

290
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,536
The problem is, there
might not be enough heart left

291
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,706
once they remove
all of the tumor.

292
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,585
And if the tumor's metastasized,
there's nothing we can do.

293
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,137
Dr. Murphy. Just
let me tie this off.

294
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,734
Doctor! What?

295
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,174
She's got a bleed in her eye.

296
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,879
They got the tumor, repaired her
heart, but she bled out of her eye.

297
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,056
She didn't bleed out of
her eye from a heart tumor.

298
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,857
True. The cardiac tumor
was benign. That's impossible!

299
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,829
Statistically... Oh, shut up.

300
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:41,459
If the tumor's benign, that means
it didn't cause her hallucinations.

301
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:45,369
That's why I'm mentioning it.
So, the tumor's a coincidence?

302
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,571
This is bad. You're
starting to state the obvious.

303
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,237
No, you said it would be there and it
was there. It can't be a coincidence.

304
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,607
A 9-year-old with
terminal cancer

305
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,309
gets an unrelated benign
tumor growing in her heart.

306
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,750
Why? It's benign?
That's impossible.

307
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,130
Talk to Wilson. And the retinal
bleed, another coincidence?

308
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,666
A clot could create pressure
behind the eye, cause the bleeding.

309
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,369
A clot could explain the eye, but
doesn't explain the hallucinations.

310
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,603
A clot could cause
mini seizures.

311
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,806
Great. Another thing that's
not causing the hallucinations.

312
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,040
Post-seizure psychosis.

313
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,795
The brain sort of corrects itself
after the seizure by hallucinating.

314
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,978
The clot could explain the
eye and the hallucinations,

315
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,061
but what about the tumor?

316
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,834
Tumors the size of an octopus
wrapped around a little girl's heart

317
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,067
are not just a coincidence.

318
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,785
She's not healthy,
she's never been healthy.

319
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,176
What's the theory here?
This girl's body's a lemon?

320
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,874
Faulty manufacturing,
everything's falling apart?

321
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:34,853
The tumor is Afghanistan,
the clot is Buffalo.

322
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,388
Does that need more
explanation? Okay.

323
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,685
The tumor is Al-Qaeda,
the big bad guy, the brains.

324
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,890
We went in, wiped it out, but it
had already sent out a splinter cell.

325
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:50,130
A small team of low-level terrorists
quietly living in some suburb of Buffalo,

326
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,295
waiting to kill us all.

327
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,034
Are you trying to say the tumor
threw a clot before we removed it?

328
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,703
It was an excellent metaphor.

329
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:02,242
Angio her brain before this
clot straps on an explosive vest.

330
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,495
Angio was clean.

331
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:28,732
There's no clot? There's
a clot, we just can't find it.

332
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,039
You can't do exploratory
surgery on her brain.

333
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,546
Are you sure you're
not a neurologist?

334
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,843
Okay.

335
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,145
She's gonna die. Well, the
clot's not gonna go away quietly.

336
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,749
It could blow at any time.

337
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,796
Are you gonna let
them know? I guess so.

338
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,090
Can I come with? To tell
Andie she's gonna die?

339
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,702
That's very un-you.
She's such a brave girl.

340
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,504
I wanna see how brave she is
when you tell her she's gonna die.

341
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,778
Go to hell.

342
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,345
What would you do if you
were told you were gonna die?

343
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,638
I don't know, I'd be devastated.
You'd cry like a baby.

344
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,315
Everybody would.

345
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:49,448
She's not doing anything.
She's a rock. She's brave.

346
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,413
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why?

347
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,789
She's gone through more
than most people do in a lifetime.

348
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,852
So what? Does that
mean she's ready to die?

349
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,998
What if her bravery
is a symptom?

350
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,933
The clot is causing hallucinations
and messing with her emotions.

351
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,233
You think her bravery
is chemically based?

352
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,240
It would tell us where to look for
the clot. Where's the fear center?

353
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:12,301
The amygdala, near the hippocampus.
It's a big area and a busy one.

354
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,075
You blindly cut in
there, you'll kill her.

355
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,384
Only time you're gonna
see this clot is at autopsy.

356
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,185
Then let's do that.

357
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,358
Is it still illegal to perform an
autopsy on a living person?

358
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,422
Are you high? If it's
Tuesday, I'm wasted.

359
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,291
It's Wednesday.

360
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,064
I want to induce a
hypothermic cardiac arrest.

361
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,301
Once the patient's on bypass,
we siphon off two liters of blood,

362
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,103
perfuse the brain
while she's in an MRI.

363
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,719
You're actually
talking about killing her.

364
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,743
Just for a little while.
I'll bring her right back.

365
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,806
Oh, well, in that case, go
ahead. Why are we even talking?

366
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,818
If we do nothing, she's
dead in a day, maybe a week.

367
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,814
The kind that lasts.

368
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,558
We need FDA approval
for any surgical technique

369
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,526
that's used for diagnostic
purposes. Absolutely.

370
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,859
If we were doing anything invasive.
But there's nothing invasive...

371
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,532
You know, I'm not cutting into
her head. I'm just looking for a clot.

372
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,004
Not invasive?
You're killing her.

373
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,940
Don't split hairs. If
it works, she lives.

374
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,709
Make sure the mom understands
that this is a million-to-one shot.

375
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,553
I'll see that Wilson
passes that along.

376
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,021
The plan is

377
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,622
basically to reboot
your daughter.

378
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,229
Like a computer. We shut
her down. Then restart her.

379
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,934
How do you restart
a 9-year-old girl?

380
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,305
We cool her core body
temperature to 21 degree Celsius.

381
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,745
Use blankets, ice.
Sort of like hibernation?

382
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,409
Not quite. In hibernation, a
bear's heartbeat is just very slow.

383
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:02,580
In cardiac arrest, there is
no heartbeat. So she's dead.

384
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,786
Temporarily, yes.

385
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,758
By cooling her, we limit the risk of
damage when we remove her blood.

386
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,757
Not all of it, two to three
liters. Half her blood?

387
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,799
Then we put it back. It's
called perfusing the circuit.

388
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,768
In this case, her brain.

389
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,570
And using an MRI, we'd
have a very brief window

390
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,441
to hopefully see
the outline of the clot.

391
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:32,509
If it's there, and it's
operable, we go get it.

392
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,117
And Andie walks out of here.

393
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,570
Signed consent
forms. Great, thanks.

394
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,069
You sound better.

395
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:01,040
I stacked a combo of
Mentholatum, a few Vicodin,

396
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,981
and something else
which I can't remember.

397
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,709
Should be able to ride
the high for a couple hours.

398
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,358
What did Andie say? About what?

399
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,922
About this? I
didn't talk to her.

400
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,597
She doesn't need to know
the specifics of this procedure.

401
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,432
What if you're right about her?

402
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,303
What if she just is that brave?

403
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,968
That doesn't mean she's mature
enough to handle this kind of decision.

404
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,673
Either she understands, or she's
not brave. You can't have it both ways.

405
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,114
If she does understand,

406
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,152
then she deserves to
know what's going on.

407
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,179
I'm Dr. House. I've
seen you around.

408
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,084
Your mom tell you what
we're gonna try? Sort of.

409
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,222
Tomorrow's test
could take 10 hours.

410
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,527
Given your present condition,
you might not even make it through.

411
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,106
My mom's done a lot of
research. How do you feel about it?

412
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:43,007
If we figured maturity came
from how much time you've got left

413
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,108
instead of how long you've
been here, this would be your call.

414
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,381
I don't have a choice, right?

415
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,754
I could give you one.

416
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,524
I wanna get better.

417
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,193
You've got cancer.

418
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,292
If I fix this... I have a year.

419
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,304
A year of this.

420
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,698
A lot of people
wouldn't want that.

421
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,305
A lot of people would
just want it to be over.

422
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,842
Are you asking if I wanna die?

423
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,049
Nobody wants to die.

424
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,253
But you're going to.

425
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,453
The question is, how? How
much you're gonna suffer, and

426
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,861
how long.

427
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,198
I'm asking if you
want this to be over.

428
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,806
What would you tell my mom?

429
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,649
I would give her 10
excellent medical reasons

430
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:56,052
why we can't do this procedure.

431
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,954
I can't just leave
her 'cause I'm tired.

432
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,892
But you can't
stay for her, either.

433
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,665
But she needs me here.

434
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,434
This is your life.

435
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,205
You can't do this just for her.

436
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,279
I love her.

437
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,721
Thank you for joining me
for tonight's dress rehearsal.

438
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,525
Playing the part of
Andie is Morty Randolph.

439
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,431
For his donation to
science, we give our thanks.

440
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,026
Once Andie is cooled
and goes off bypass,

441
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:47,664
we have 60 seconds to get
two liters of blood out of her body,

442
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,005
back into her for the pictures
to find the clot in her head.

443
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,977
If our star is bumped tomorrow,

444
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,717
while my MRI is on,
these red lights will go off.

445
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,218
Which will mean we
have no usable test results.

446
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,778
No test results, it's
goodbye Broadway.

447
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,518
You guys'll be wearing
bad cat suits in Des Moines.

448
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,992
We'll have neurosurgeons
here with a view of the monitors,

449
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,139
cardiac surgeon there in
case we need to open her up.

450
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,190
Anesthesiologists, one by
the cardiac bypass machine,

451
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,360
one by the cooling apparatus.

452
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,164
Girls in the chorus, if you're
over 5'10", stick with me.

453
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,866
Okay, give me 60
seconds on the clock.

454
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,677
Show time. A five,
six, seven, eight!

455
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,132
Siphon off the blood
through the arterial line.

456
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,741
Whoosh.

457
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,445
Sound of blood
draining. More whoosh.

458
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,391
And we kill her.

459
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,086
Again.

460
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,840
Sorry, my hand slipped.
How hard can this be?

461
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,060
It's a little busy
down here. Again!

462
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,979
If we didn't have to
lavage her gastrointestinal...

463
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,198
Again!

464
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,668
Again!

465
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,569
We could bolt it to the table.

466
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,514
Gruesome and
low-tech. Kiss me, I love it.

467
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,481
A five, six, seven, eight!

468
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,086
Here you go, Doctor.

469
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,227
This'll make you sleep.

470
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:21,400
A lot of people. Big
musical number, kiddo.

471
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,871
A lot of people here to make you look
good. You're kind of freaking me out.

472
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,907
He gets that sometimes.

473
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,100
Deep breath, honey.

474
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,748
Okay, go!

475
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,053
Intubate her.

476
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,548
Is that one okay?

477
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,566
Charge.

478
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,874
Here.

479
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,213
Body temperature
37 degrees Celsius.

480
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,218
Start the cooling.

481
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,293
You, go.

482
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,336
She's shivering. 200
milligrams of Vecuronium.

483
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,239
24 degrees Celsius.

484
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,920
We have afib.

485
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,753
What? She's dead,
that's the whole idea.

486
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,086
Go!

487
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,590
One liter out.

488
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,173
Two liters.

489
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,037
Okay, put the blood back
in. Reperfuse the circuit.

490
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,410
Anything, people,
anything at all.

491
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,394
Internal carotid artery in
cavernous sinus is fine.

492
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,778
Ten seconds!
Vestibulocochlear nerve intact.

493
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,416
- Middle meningeal artery clear.
- Five seconds!

494
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,753
Nothing.

495
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,707
We're over the limit. We've
got to start rewarming her

496
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:33,841
or there'll be permanent damage.

497
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,356
Keep looking!

498
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,161
There!

499
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,898
I didn't see
anything. It was there.

500
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,432
You sure?

501
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,840
Four millimeters lateral to
the hippocampus, I saw it.

502
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,321
House, she's out of time,
she's gonna be a vegetable.

503
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,643
I saw it!

504
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,177
That's good enough for me.

505
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,926
<i>They were able to restart her heart.
She's doing as well as could be hoped.</i>

506
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,764
<i>So they found the
clot? We think so.</i>

507
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:16,239
<i>The neurosurgeons are
attempting to remove it right now.</i>

508
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,907
<i>And when will we know
if there was any damage?</i>

509
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,411
<i>A few hours.</i>

510
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,683
Four millimeters lateral
to the hippocampus.

511
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,745
That's where I am.
There's nothing there.

512
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,359
You're not there yet,
keep going. I'm there.

513
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,160
Are you sure you
saw... There it is.

514
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,326
I think I can get it.

515
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,286
Hi, Mom.

516
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,590
Oh, hi.

517
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,949
You're treating your
stuffy nose with cocaine.

518
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,985
Diphenhydramine. Antihistamine.

519
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,719
New delivery system. It's
a blood-brain barrier thing.

520
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:20,991
It's all about speed, isn't it? One
thing to another, never standing still.

521
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,438
You're pretty good at that. I
know my way around a razor blade.

522
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,939
It's time.

523
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:35,909
Just a couple more
rocks. Andie's going home.

524
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,443
Right.

525
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,752
The parade of the
small bald circus freaks.

526
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:47,484
Sorry, I've got a thing. I
read her surgeon's report.

527
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh? The clot was
nowhere near her amygdala.

528
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,295
Means her fear emotions
were working perfectly.

529
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,435
Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,499
So her bravery
was not a symptom.

531
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,705
Yeah. I was wrong.

532
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,016
She genuinely is a
self-sacrificing saint,

533
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,613
whose life will bring
her nothing but pain.

534
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,123
Which she will
stoically withstand

535
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,220
just so that her mom doesn't
have to cry quite so soon.

536
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,387
I'm beside myself with joy.

537
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,202
She enjoys life more
than you do. Right.

538
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,633
She stole that kiss from Chase.
What have you done lately?

539
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,304
I'm pacing myself. Unlike
her, I have the luxury of time.

540
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,346
She could outlive you.

541
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,636
In case you wanna
see real butterflies.

542
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,669
I'm not gonna kiss you.
No matter what you say.

543
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,203
It's sunny outside. You
should go for a walk.

544
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,805
Not much for the
long walks in the park.

545
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,204
Now get.

546
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,520
0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds.

547
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,556
Four-stroke, four
cylinder, liquid cooled.

548
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,856
You gain a lot of
torque according to...

549
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,501
Right leg?

550
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,667
Your right leg?
You can still ride.

551
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,702
We got excellent financing
right now. It lists for ten-eight.

552
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:29,304
I'll let you steal it out
the door for ten-three.

553
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,214
No, thanks.

554
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,519
Could I test drive
one of these things?
