1
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,016
Gosh! I guess he got away.

2
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,528
Can Baby Shoes come out to play?

3
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,165
Come on! Hands on
your head. Climb out.

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,232
I can't climb out if my
hands are on my head.

5
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,247
Just keep them where I
can see them, man. Come on.

6
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,150
You high, popo? Yeah, man.

7
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,318
Catching morons makes me high.

8
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,724
Lift your shirt up by your
collar and turn around.

9
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,232
Would you look at that?
Dude's got a weapon.

10
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,401
All right. You have the
right to remain stupid.

11
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,908
Watch the gun.

12
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,275
Anything you say will be
completely incomprehensible.

13
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,369
Seriously, man! Careful!

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,779
Seriously, man? Seriously?

15
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,476
Does your mama know what you do?

16
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,822
Oh. It's sweet.
Your dad's proud.

17
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,095
You made the local
paper. For my article.

18
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,903
Give it a rest. You read
what he wrote in the margin?

19
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,601
"Our friend Lazarus sleeps
but I go that I may wake him up."

20
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,042
Yeah. He's not proud of
me, he's proud of Jesus.

21
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,601
Everything I do
right is God's work.

22
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,615
Everything I do wrong
is my own damn fault.

23
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,208
Cop with a sense of humor.

24
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,047
Differential diagnosis.

25
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,981
Guy's in the ER,
bleeding on everybody.

26
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,651
Drugs? He's a cop.

27
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,991
Good point. How about drugs?

28
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,726
Tox screen was clean. He
did, however, get hit by a bullet.

29
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:20,757
Just mentioning.

30
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,827
He was shot? No,
somebody threw it at him.

31
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,068
I'm thinking trauma. He got
bullet fragments lodged in his brain.

32
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,905
According to Baby Shoes the cop
was laughing before he got shot.

33
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,376
Baby Shoes? The
guy who shot him.

34
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,913
Reliable witness.

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,341
His name is Baby Shoes.
How bad can he be?

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,214
The fragments are in the wrong
part of the brain to cause euphoria,

37
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,755
so let's expand the search.

38
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,757
Factor in the cough
and the cloudy lungs.

39
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,759
Why are we ignoring
the elevated heart rate?

40
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,885
Because he's in shock.

41
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,080
What if the heart was
already fast before he got shot?

42
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,893
You mean after the foot race?

43
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,695
He's giddy. Indicates
a blockage of oxygen.

44
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,963
Carbon monoxide gas
would elevate the heart rate,

45
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,947
cause coughing and
impair neurological functions.

46
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,237
He got CO poisoning
outdoors? Yeah.

47
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,640
All 'cause those
bastards didn't ratify Kyoto.

48
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,311
Or he got CO poisoning
indoors and then moved outdoors

49
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,850
before he'd inhaled enough
to make him drop dead.

50
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,812
Test his arterial blood gas.

51
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,481
If his carboxyhemoglobin
levels are higher than 15%,

52
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,387
stick him in a
hyperbaric chamber.

53
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,352
You go check the
cop car for gas leaks.

54
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,420
If it was the cop car,
his partner would be sick.

55
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,899
Maybe she is, but just doesn't
have as good a sense of humor.

56
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,960
Also, check his personal
car, his work, home.

57
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,267
I'll check the precinct.

58
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,668
The blood test confirmed you have
low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.

59
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,405
We're putting you inside a
high-pressure chamber that...

60
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,210
You don't really care, do you?

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,117
Do you live near a gas supply?

62
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,490
Yeah, me. After,
like, a huge enchilada.

63
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,328
Anything toxic you
have at your home?

64
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,424
Any paint solvents,
anything unhygienic?

65
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,771
No. No, I keep a
pretty clean home.

66
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,192
If you start having trouble
breathing you can press this button

67
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,650
and the chamber will decompress.

68
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,517
Like this? Not now.
If you have trouble.

69
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,078
It's broken.

70
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,515
All right. Well, if you have
problems we'll push it for you.

71
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,959
Muscle contracture.

72
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,587
How bad does
it hurt? Not at all.

73
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,057
Looks wild, though, huh?

74
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,897
Your brain's not getting enough
oxygen. You're losing motor function.

75
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,436
We should start this right away.

76
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:45,662
Should I be scared?

77
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,950
No, you probably have a carbon
monoxide leak in your place.

78
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,670
We have a guy there
checking things out.

79
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,596
Sounds okay.

80
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,334
How about the gas
intake valve? Looks great.

81
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,308
It's down in the furnace room.

82
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,510
Your system's fine. If you
had a carbon monoxide leak,

83
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,046
half the force would be sick.

84
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,809
Then why are you here?

85
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,118
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor.

86
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,849
Yeah.

87
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:41,088
I've got a disability.

88
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,798
These are speeding
tickets. A lot of emergencies.

89
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,903
He's feeling better
now but you never know.

90
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,773
I'll see what we can do.

91
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,809
Where does your partner sit?

92
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,587
The place is a cesspool, but I
don't think I need to test for anything.

93
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,594
Nope. Waste of time.

94
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:18,290
You know about the marijuana?
I've heard rumors since junior high.

95
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,391
The cop's acting high
because he is high.

96
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,698
He's got...
Legionnaires' disease.

97
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,495
It's a good thing Joe got
shot or the whole precinct

98
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,007
would have gotten wiped
out. Anarchy on the streets.

99
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,585
It takes 48 hours to
test for Legionnaires'.

100
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,976
But only two seconds to
recognize that the symptoms fit

101
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,140
while staring at the rancid,
unchanged water of an AC unit.

102
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,241
Marijuana explains
the high carboxy,

103
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,047
the cloudy lungs
and the happiness.

104
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,146
Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's
gotten worse since he was admitted.

105
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,495
Why don't we agree to disagree?

106
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,468
Actually, why don't we agree
that you'll disagree with me

107
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,518
while treating him
for Legionnaires'?

108
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,290
It's not as pithy, but...

109
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,726
<i>I feel a lot better.</i>

110
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,666
The meds are working.

111
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,795
Heart rate is normal. COHb
levels are down. No fever.

112
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,668
Take some deep breaths.

113
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,611
You seem disappointed.

114
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,739
I'm glad you're feeling better.

115
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,339
- You got a problem with cops?
- Please don't talk.

116
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,477
In my experience people who
just don't like cops have a reason...

117
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,077
I need you not to talk.

118
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,218
No rales.

119
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,428
These clouded areas
of the upper lobes,

120
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,326
they're the infiltrates
we found yesterday.

121
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,831
They're not there anymore?
They're clearing up.

122
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,000
You had Legionnaires'.
Now you don't.

123
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,535
So, you didn't find
anything at my place?

124
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,873
Nothing medically relevant.

125
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,873
So there's nothing I
need to worry about then?

126
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,573
Not this time.

127
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,314
What are you doing?

128
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,620
I want to make sure
he sees what's involved.

129
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,727
What we found
was fairly advanced.

130
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,456
These cloudy
areas here and here,

131
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,397
these parts of your lungs
simply weren't functioning.

132
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,492
But they're okay now, right?

133
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,270
Everything's okay now.

134
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,846
I'm fine.

135
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,718
You're blind.

136
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,291
I bumped into something.
That doesn't mean I can't see.

137
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,139
I'm sure this is frightening,
but you only think...

138
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,859
What's Doctor Cameron wearing?

139
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,934
Dark blue pants,
white shirt, black shoes.

140
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,273
Almost, except for the
pants, shirt and shoes.

141
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,901
You're blind.

142
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,722
He really thinks he can see?

143
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,147
He can physically see. His
brain just can't process it.

144
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,946
No chance this is a
practical joke? No way.

145
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,645
Anton's blindness indicates
damage to both occipital lobes.

146
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,799
It must be from the trauma.

147
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,055
Bullet fragments just happened
to hit the same spot in both lobes?

148
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,856
A stroke could cause Anton's
blindness and euphoria.

149
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,764
Officer Krupke is
clotting in his brain.

150
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,302
Start heparin to thin the blood.
Find the clot and yank it out.

151
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,136
The clot would be at the top of
the bilateral vertebral arteries.

152
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,301
Great. Chase, stick
your fingers in there

153
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,810
and grope around
until you find it.

154
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,072
Oh, wait.

155
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,670
When you turn him
into a vegetable,

156
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,216
then there's going to
be frivolous lawsuits.

157
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,784
You know what would
be better? Contrast MRI.

158
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,211
Do we have one of those?

159
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,532
You can't do an MRI. If the
bullet fragments are magnetic,

160
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,996
they'll move and
rip his brain apart.

161
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,085
Well, let's flip a coin.
Heads MRI, tails he dies.

162
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,925
Police-issue Kevlar vests don't
have the ceramic plate insert

163
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,108
that would shatter a bullet.
They would just catch it.

164
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,376
So, the bullet
shattered on its own.

165
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,995
Meaning Baby Shoes was
using .38 caliber hollow points,

166
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,834
which unfortunately
are ferromagnetic.

167
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,675
It's just so cool
that you know that.

168
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,913
We could do an angio
to find the clotting.

169
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,345
Waste of time. The skull
creates too much artifact.

170
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,784
We'll never get a decent view.

171
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,151
It's the next best thing to
an MRI. And a waste of time.

172
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,817
An angio might show...
Oh, God, it's a coup!

173
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,918
Fine, go do your angio.

174
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,157
When you're done wasting your
time, meet me down in the morgue.

175
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,864
We're going to snake a
catheter into your femoral artery

176
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,063
and up into your brain
so we can check for clots.

177
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,597
Keep this on throughout
the procedure,

178
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,939
unless the pot's
already made you sterile.

179
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,939
I have a stressful
job. You got no idea.

180
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,848
I grew up with cops like you.
One part bully, nine parts hypocrite.

181
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,724
What is wrong with you?
Just having some fun.

182
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,229
The man is sick and scared.
The man's a crooked cop.

183
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,375
Maybe you should take
yourself off the case, Foreman.

184
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,391
You don't have to like
someone to be their doctor.

185
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,436
<i>Hey, how you doing there, buddy?</i>

186
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,938
<i>Just sit still and we'll
have you back out there</i>

187
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,998
<i>scaring the crap out
of people in no time.</i>

188
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,007
Happy?

189
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,947
What did the angio tell us?

190
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,977
What are you looking for?

191
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,079
I called my mom.
She didn't pick up.

192
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,081
What did the angio tell us?

193
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,987
That Foreman
should be off this case.

194
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,491
He's a neurologist.

195
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,187
Unless you think the patient's
optic nerve is in his spleen.

196
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,923
He doesn't like cops.

197
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,363
Foreman, policemen
are our friends.

198
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,076
If you and I ever get
separated shopping...

199
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,535
I was just busting
the guy's chops. See?

200
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,367
He was just busting
the guy's chops.

201
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,566
Foreman is essential
to solving this case.

202
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,836
Medically, what
did the angio tell us?

203
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,749
There appears to be some clotting,
possibly around the circle of Willis.

204
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,510
Based on the progression of
symptoms, the clot is growing.

205
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,641
We need to cut into...

206
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:41,620
Saying that there appears to be clotting
is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.

207
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,682
Is it a ten-car pile-up, or just a
really slow bus in the center lane?

208
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,456
And if it is a bus, is it a
thrombotic bus or an embolic bus?

209
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,156
I think I pushed that
metaphor too far.

210
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,427
Angio can't tell us
that kind of information.

211
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,345
Oh, so you're saying it
was just a waste of time?

212
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,929
It gave us some information
without killing him.

213
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,567
You don't know that an MRI will kill
him. The bullets have a ferrous base.

214
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,612
Little tiny pieces trapped in his
head. They're not going anywhere.

215
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,705
Maybe it's worth attempting
surgery to remove the fragments.

216
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,410
Surgeons say inoperable and
the patient's on blood-thinners.

217
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,975
Other than that, perfect plan.

218
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,487
You got a better plan? Much.

219
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,697
The bullet's identical to the one
that Baby Shoes popped Joe with.

220
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,563
Let's see how magnetic it is.

221
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,999
Did anybody hear a...

222
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,995
I shot him. He's dead.

223
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,813
The bullet split into four
fragments. No exit wounds.

224
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,480
I only used a
half-load of gunpowder.

225
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,451
It won't be exactly precise comparing
the locations on an X-Ray to an MRI.

226
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,648
How unprofessional was Foreman?

227
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,850
Ask him yourself.
He's right here.

228
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,122
Worse than usual.
Better than you.

229
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,460
He berated Joe
for being a bad cop.

230
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,993
Berated or humiliated?

231
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,128
I'm not sure. I didn't have
my thesaurus with me.

232
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,399
One implies that he
took pleasure in it.

233
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,469
I want to know if it was repressed
black anger or just giddiness.

234
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,837
You think I'm sick?

235
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:17,144
I think that an appropriate response
to watching your boss shoot a corpse

236
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,582
is not to grin foolishly.

237
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,883
The fact that I've grown bored
by your insanity is proof of nothing.

238
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,523
<i>Doctor Foreman, Doctor
Chase requests your assistance.</i>

239
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,260
I can't even imagine
the backwards logic

240
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,391
you used to rationalize
shooting a corpse.

241
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,096
Well, if I'd shot a live person,
there's a lot more paperwork.

242
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,048
Then it won't be a problem for you
to stand beside the casket at the wake

243
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,217
and explain why a cancer patient
has a bullet hole in his head?

244
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,210
The man donated
his body to science.

245
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,337
Yes, it's a tragedy.
If I hadn't shot him,

246
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,791
his body could have spent the next
year letting first-year med students

247
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,249
use the carpool lane.

248
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,785
He's set. Do not
turn that on, House.

249
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,821
You're mad because I
put a bullet in his head.

250
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,152
At worst, all I'm doing
now is taking it out.

251
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,261
My bad.

252
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,885
They have to shut
down the magnet to fix it.

253
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,554
MRI is going to be out of
commission for at least two weeks.

254
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,887
Oh, it doesn't matter. We
obviously can't use it on this patient.

255
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,492
No, but there are other doctors
in this hospital and other patients.

256
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,627
That helps explains how they
can afford all the fancy equipment.

257
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,332
I'm sure not pulling my weight.

258
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,067
Is doing nothing an option?

259
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,109
I'm just saying, maybe the
clot will break up on its own.

260
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,808
The giddiness seems to have
gone away. The blindness hasn't.

261
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,250
Echo his heart.
Looking for what?

262
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,842
The problem is
obviously neurological.

263
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,753
The clots are in his brain. The
source of the clots may not be.

264
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,053
Do a complete transthoracic
echocardiogram.

265
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,094
Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the
clots are coming from his heart.

266
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,692
Heart's clean. Where
else could we look?

267
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,261
We could ultrasound
his legs, look for a DVT.

268
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,431
I need you to move over.

269
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,909
Joe, are you okay?

270
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,377
Tachycardia. Heart
rate 150 and rising.

271
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,638
Saline wide open.
He's bleeding out.

272
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,874
House wanted to thin his
blood. He sure did a good job.

273
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,112
BP's crashing. He's
going into shock.

274
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,131
Intracranial bleeding. We
need to relieve the pressure.

275
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,817
We need a surgical team.

276
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,256
Foreman, get out!

277
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,024
Boy, is he screwed.

278
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,589
We clot his blood, he
dies. We thin it, he dies.

279
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,195
Am I the only one
who finds this funny?

280
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,504
Oh, man!

281
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,081
I'm not sick!

282
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,653
Did you hear the one about
the guy who bled into his brain

283
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,784
and had to have a hole drilled in
his skull to relieve the pressure?

284
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,052
Hilarious.

285
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,961
Someone laughs, they're
dying? That's absurd.

286
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,425
But not funny.

287
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,661
If I'm not sick, all you're doing
is locking me up with the source.

288
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,135
I'll get sick, prove you right.

289
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,149
If you're not sick, it's not contagious
and you've got nothing to worry about.

290
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,052
If you are sick, the two of you are
staying in here until we find out why.

291
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,443
So you might want to
make friends with the pig.

292
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,938
The good news is I
can finally get my MRI.

293
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,041
No, you can't! You
blew up the machine!

294
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,415
Not the portable one, chuckles.

295
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:45,616
Chase and Cameron are bringing it
to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

296
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,622
Where are you going?

297
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,685
To the office. Got work to do.

298
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,691
Eat your meals, take your
temperature every half-hour

299
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,757
and any meds I
command you to take.

300
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,234
So I'm just a regular
patient now? No.

301
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,765
You get your own thermometer.

302
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,673
Check your blood.

303
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:16,312
Anyone with an elevated sed rate
gets to be Foreman's new roomie.

304
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,850
He should be a part
of this. He's a patient.

305
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,586
He's not irrational.
He's not objective.

306
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,095
He's got the most motivation
to get this diagnosed.

307
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,791
Right. You're not even friends
with him. Why would you care?

308
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,659
There is an area of increased T2
attenuation in the cingulate cortex.

309
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,537
Kind of mushy. Cingulate
cortex controls emotions.

310
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,167
This mushy spot
explains the euphoria.

311
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,687
The question is what's
causing the mush?

312
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,306
A question you might
want to ask a neurologist.

313
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,273
Foreman is a selfish
jerk, but he's a neurologist

314
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,328
and he's the only one
who's been in that apartment.

315
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,082
This is why he
shouldn't be here.

316
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,389
You wouldn't call him
a jerk if he was here.

317
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,459
If you think he screwed up at that
apartment you'd keep it to yourself.

318
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,495
No! I... Well, we'll never know.

319
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,063
As long as he's not here,
he's just like any other patient,

320
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,327
which means we can
dump on him all we want.

321
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,861
What's eating the
selfish jerk's brain?

322
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,270
West Nile or Eastern
equine encephalitis would...

323
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,830
Test Foreman's blood.

324
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,769
Given that he's the
only one who got it,

325
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:14,371
person-to-person transmission is
less likely than some sort of deadly toxin

326
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,780
that Foreman picked
up in the guy's home.

327
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,979
Who wants to go next?

328
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:32,523
You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a
guy who doesn't consider you a friend?

329
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,968
He's just the patient,
right? It's the job.

330
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,029
Hey.

331
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,497
You don't have to go anywhere.

332
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,509
Joe's apartment is right
downstairs in the lab.

333
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,909
Foreman brought back
samples of everything.

334
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:49,846
What was that, "Who wants
to go next"? Some kind of test?

335
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,645
Don't worry. You
made the right call.

336
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,482
Foreman stumbled into
whatever it is without knowing.

337
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,848
And he's way
smarter than you are.

338
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,105
Damn, Chase!

339
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,068
You suck at this.

340
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,342
Sorry, it's this damned suit.

341
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,781
I can do it myself.
And I'll throw that out.

342
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,488
What'd the MRI show?

343
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,447
I can't be a part
of the differential

344
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,619
and I can't even know
what the differential is?

345
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,253
You'd have told any other
patient what you found out.

346
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,267
MRI showed a lesion
on your cingulate cortex.

347
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,538
What's the thinking?

348
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,935
Toxins are in the lead,
viral's a distant second.

349
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,841
Do you think the lesion
could be an abscess?

350
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,813
It's just a small, soft area.
More mush than anything.

351
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,577
Was there inflammation in
the lining of the ventricles?

352
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,343
There was an increased
signal there, yeah.

353
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,816
What are you thinking?

354
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,955
Staph infection.

355
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,084
Toxins lead to neurodegeneration
which causes the lesion.

356
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,926
Not without a fever.
The cop had a fever.

357
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,242
Mine could be coming. I could
have got it directly from him

358
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,132
or a dirty dishtowel
at his place.

359
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:17,670
Give us Ommaya reservoirs.

360
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,867
Deliver linezolid directly into
our brains, and we're cured.

361
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,180
Samples tested negative
for toluene, arsenic and lead.

362
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,374
What about the blood?

363
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,713
Negative for West Nile
and Eastern equine.

364
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,185
We have to go back to Joe's
apartment, get more samples...

365
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,121
No one goes back to that place
until we know what we're looking for.

366
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,296
Get some of that cop tape, stick
it over the doors and the windows.

367
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:44,024
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions.
The chance of infection is next to nothing.

368
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,407
Yeah, I was never
that great at math,

369
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,492
but next to nothing is
higher than nothing, right?

370
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,399
It's not your fault he got sick.

371
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,232
But it would be
his fault if we did.

372
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,432
We should get a sample
directly from Joe's brain.

373
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,599
We can't do a biopsy.

374
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,610
There's too much edema from the
bleeding because you gave him heparin.

375
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,306
I don't think this is the
time to be pointing fingers.

376
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,611
I didn't give Foreman any.

377
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,145
You want to give
Foreman a brain biopsy?

378
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,054
Come on. Really, who doesn't?

379
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,193
This could be a simple staph
infection causing neurodegeneration.

380
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,463
Without a fever? Not a chance.

381
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,658
Joe had a fever. He
also had <i>Legionella.</i>

382
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,226
The mush might be forming an
abscess, and since there was inflammation

383
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,272
of the lining of the
ventricles, it makes sense.

384
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,933
The staph releases toxins,
causes neurodegeneration,

385
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,000
causes the lesions.
This is a waste of time.

386
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,443
We should put an Ommaya
reservoir in Foreman's brain

387
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,990
and start administering
antibiotics...

388
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,950
If I'm going to be arguing with
Foreman, I may as well do it directly.

389
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,133
Kernig's sign, negative.

390
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,797
Brudzinski's sign,
single positive.

391
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,647
Patient Joe Luria, distal and
proximal arm contractures.

392
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,308
Duration four seconds.

393
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,717
Staph infection most
commonly presents on the skin.

394
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,521
Most commonly?

395
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,118
You want to treat me
like any other patient, do it.

396
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,764
But the House I know never
uses phrases like "most commonly."

397
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,267
You're not laughing anymore. No.

398
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,671
You think that's a good thing?

399
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,839
Sort of doubt it.

400
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,536
Staph would be in your heart,
lungs, spleen, liver or kidneys

401
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,138
before it gets to your brain.

402
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,945
Your organs are
clear. It's not staph.

403
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,486
The infection could be
limited to a brain abscess.

404
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,886
Which I would have
seen in your MRI.

405
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,119
Sign this so I can take
out a piece of your brain.

406
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,291
Let me see the MRI.

407
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,333
There was no abscess on
the image. Let me see it, then.

408
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,931
I liked you better
when you were jolly.

409
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,443
MRI was taken over an hour ago.

410
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,577
That soft spot could
now be an abscess.

411
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,181
If it was staph you'd have
a fever, which you don't.

412
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,220
101.6.

413
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,154
What idiot gave you that?

414
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,426
Put the Ommaya reservoir in
my skull and treat me for the staph.

415
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,941
Triangle.

416
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,606
This one?

417
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,807
Circle.

418
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,981
Next.

419
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,584
Foreman, why aren't you
answering? Is there a problem?

420
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,014
Square.

421
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,456
Tell me your date of birth.

422
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,255
Is that House? Yeah.

423
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,227
Next? Square again.

424
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,027
Why is he here? Because my
neurologist is having surgery.

425
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,567
I thought I was
just another patient.

426
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,500
You didn't believe
that crap, did you?

427
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,865
Date of birth.

428
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,930
The Ommaya reservoir is
inserted in the parietal lobe.

429
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,476
My spatial recognition is
the issue, not my memory.

430
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,875
Oops. Did you say Ommaya?

431
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,914
I could have sworn
you said biopsy.

432
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,881
Hey, I'm just messing
with your head.

433
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,275
Mother's maiden name, please.

434
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,083
Get out of my
temporal lobe, House.

435
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,031
Hello?

436
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,635
Are you awake?

437
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,670
They told me somebody
was sick like me.

438
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,103
I'm up.

439
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,844
Your voice...

440
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,179
Aren't you my doctor?

441
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,546
Not anymore.

442
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,282
You're the guy who
doesn't like cops?

443
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,290
Yeah.

444
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,393
Can you see?

445
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,832
You can't? Not a thing.

446
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,967
You've been blind a while.

447
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,810
The fact that you're aware of it
now could be a sign of improvement.

448
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,078
It hurts so much, doesn't it?

449
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,617
I'm okay.

450
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,117
It's going to hurt.

451
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,389
The morphine barely
takes the edge off.

452
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm going to die, aren't I?

453
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,366
You die, I die. It's
not going to happen.

454
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,609
Why not?

455
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,238
Are you just too
stubborn to die?

456
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,513
They took a piece of my brain.

457
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:09,110
Whatever is wrong
with us, they'll find.

458
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,119
Do you believe in prayer?

459
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,664
Not really.

460
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,603
Neither do I.

461
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,315
My dad always prays.

462
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,047
So does mine.

463
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,787
Do you want to try it?

464
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,926
Try praying?

465
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:55,692
Okay.

466
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,121
How is he? Still dying.

467
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,918
Well, you've almost mastered
another skill, though. That's good.

468
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,154
We have Foreman's
biopsy results.

469
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,364
Non-specific signs
of inflammation.

470
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,860
That's it?

471
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,267
I've also swabbed for staph.
Negative. He's not even a carrier.

472
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,271
Well, at least Foreman
was wrong, too.

473
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,480
Yeah, there's that.

474
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,051
Can I go to Joe's
apartment now? No.

475
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:52,049
Go back to the lab and start retesting
all the samples that Foreman collected.

476
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,059
For what? Everything.

477
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,856
Bacteria, toxins, fungus,
anything that likes to feast on brain.

478
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,565
That's thousands
of... Better hurry.

479
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,702
Cameron, suit up. You're
going to monitor Foreman.

480
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:07,200
He's on to hand contractures.
He'll be at Anton's blindness soon.

481
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,100
Run hourly checks, because
when he does go blind

482
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,252
he won't be able to tell us.

483
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:15,213
We'll use the data to construct a timeline
so we can see how far behind Joe he is.

484
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,683
Why are you still here?

485
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,988
You're being cautious.

486
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,522
You're being common.

487
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:36,878
When you don't give a crap...

488
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:40,134
How many of your guys have
caught cancer from their patients?

489
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,171
Let me know when that happens,
then we can have this conversation.

490
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,310
It's just another case, huh?

491
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,371
I'll bet you can even have unprotected
sex with your cancer patients

492
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,076
without catching a damn thing.

493
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,012
Boy, I wish I had your job.

494
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,530
Biopsy showed nothing.

495
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,781
How can it be nothing? You
cut out a piece of my brain.

496
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,865
It's nothing personal, we
just didn't find anything.

497
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,773
Can you up his
morphine for God's sake?

498
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,438
He's already maxed out.
20 milligrams per hour.

499
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,741
What about toxins?
Everything was negative.

500
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,215
There was a cupboard above
the stove. Did you see it?

501
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,912
I didn't check all the food,
but could be listeriosis.

502
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,182
I didn't go back. Follow right.

503
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:31,915
Who did?

504
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,982
House said we shouldn't
go. Too dangerous.

505
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,995
The answer's got to be in that
apartment. Not going is too dangerous.

506
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,361
I'm sorry. You're thankful.

507
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,776
If House would've pointed
at you instead of me,

508
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,530
you'd be the one in here.

509
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,547
Look straight forward. Tell
me when you can see the light.

510
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,837
It's your job to go back! You're a
doctor! You go where the disease is!

511
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,206
Say when you can see the light.

512
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,836
I'm dying and you're sitting
here measuring how fast I go?

513
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,040
Tell me when you can see
the light. My vision is fine!

514
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,948
Your left-side periphery is
reduced. It's fine! I'll prove it!

515
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,411
Son of a bitch!

516
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,749
Now we're both exposed.

517
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,587
You got two choices.

518
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,129
You can go tell House what just happened
and get your own cot brought in here,

519
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,463
or you can go back
to that apartment.

520
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,570
You save me, the
cop and yourself.

521
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,839
It's not SSPE.

522
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:29,006
I checked your past
vaccinations against Joe's.

523
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,309
No batch matches.

524
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,317
Did the blood show
antibodies for Coxsackievirus?

525
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,420
Guys, can you
please shut him up?

526
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,380
He's over his limit on morphine.

527
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,856
Where's Cameron?

528
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,926
She said she had some stuff
to do. Said she'll be back soon.

529
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,112
What are you doing?

530
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,343
Foreman!

531
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,554
Imagine being constantly reminded
of the pain you're about to be in.

532
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,854
I can't take it!

533
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,561
Just stop it! Stop
it, stop it, stop it!

534
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,626
Mainlining morphine into his
carotid could stop his heart!

535
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,931
So could pain-induced
stress cardiomyopathy.

536
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,971
Either the morphine
kills him or the pain does.

537
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,198
You're condoning this?

538
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,571
I'm certainly not going
in there to stop him.

539
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,209
I'm going to make
you feel better.

540
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,628
Joe has a new symptom.

541
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,335
Hyperalgesia.

542
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,843
The infection's spreading
into the pain center of the brain.

543
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,150
Please stop! Please stop!

544
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,188
His brain is telling him that
his whole body is in pain.

545
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,658
Because of the location,
painkillers do nothing.

546
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,723
Suit up.

547
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,489
Put the guy in a coma
before the pain kills him.

548
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,732
What if he used cedar
wood to hide the pot smell?

549
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,666
<i>Aureobasidium</i> fungus
could grow there.

550
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,432
Did you find any cedar wood
anywhere? No, but maybe...

551
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,802
Maybe what?

552
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,941
Maybe somebody could
go back, take a second look?

553
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,243
And why aren't you pissed off
that Cameron's playing hooky

554
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,372
while your life
hangs in the balance?

555
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,939
Why doesn't anyone
listen to me anymore?

556
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,637
I decided you were wrong.

557
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,245
God, you are weak.

558
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,846
Guy steals your article,
tells you you're not his friend,

559
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,514
and you still want to
risk your life for him.

560
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,621
Foreman broke my skin
with a tainted needle.

561
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,955
Wow! Yeah.

562
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,359
God, you're weak.

563
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,267
The guy tried to kill you.

564
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:14,939
First thing on my list of things to do
would be to stab him back, shoot him.

565
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,075
I've got a gun in my desk.

566
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,210
The last thing on my list would
be to lie to my boss about it,

567
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,213
and then give the bastard
everything he wanted.

568
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,909
I'm not here for Foreman.
I'm here to save myself.

569
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:30,077
Even with a needle stick, your
chances of infection are pretty slim.

570
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,187
That's why you're
wearing a suit.

571
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,790
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.

572
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,828
What does that guy have
to do to make you hate him?

573
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,439
Give me the bag.

574
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,256
Mildewed dishtowel.
To re-test for staph.

575
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,393
What is that? Mouse droppings?
Hamster droppings. Could carry <i>Toxocara.</i>

576
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:12,988
It'd explain the blindness.

577
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,191
Now that I recognize
as oven crud.

578
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,361
Could be meat with <i>Trichinella.</i>
It would explain the high fever.

579
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,031
What's with the rye bread?

580
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,598
Mold could be responsible
for ergot poisoning,

581
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,837
which could explain
the contractures.

582
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,376
There are three loaves. So?

583
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,485
You're going back in there.

584
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:40,451
A guy who lives on take-out pizza
does not buy three loaves of rye.

585
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,858
That's looking too
far into the future.

586
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,128
<i>Unless he cares about
something a lot more than his diet.</i>

587
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:50,561
<i>Are you on the roof
yet?</i> Yeah, I'm here.

588
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,036
I don't see any birds.
<i>Whistle or something.</i>

589
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,232
Do that "come hither" thing.

590
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,188
<i>They came that fast because
it's their behavior pattern.</i>

591
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,782
Joe's been feeding them.

592
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,225
Now look down. Do you
see a river of pigeon turd?

593
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,630
No. There's barely any.

594
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,996
<i>It's not weird, it's cheap.</i>

595
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,297
Joe's a guy who
looks for the easy way.

596
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,838
<i>Probably been stealing
cable from his neighbors.</i>

597
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,932
Why not steal fertilizer
from rats with wings?

598
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,704
You see a shovel or a dust pan?

599
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,840
I found a scraper.
It looks used.

600
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,008
Sitting on a bucket.

601
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,442
A bucketful of pigeon crap,

602
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,744
the perfect home for
<i>Cryptococcus neoformans.</i>

603
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,584
Yup.

604
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,290
Fungus enters the brain
through the sphenoidal sinus,

605
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,156
where it dances
its triple threat

606
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,129
of happiness, blindness
and intractable pain.

607
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,894
Let's hope this experience
teaches our cop a lesson.

608
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,366
Don't cut corners when
you're growing your pot.

609
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,733
See you back home.

610
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,772
I was there.

611
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,701
I should have found it.

612
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,642
Yeah, you could have
saved us a lot of time.

613
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,341
Get me a flush of
ampho B and flucytosine.

614
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,342
I'll start us both.

615
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,580
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
I haven't heard from House yet.

616
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,612
Look at his EEG.

617
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:21,190
Theta band's been increasing
steadily since we put him under.

618
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,694
The guy's unconscious
but still in pain.

619
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,492
Theta bands could indicate at
least half a dozen different things.

620
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,396
One of which is pain.

621
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,967
The fact that he's no longer
screaming makes us feel better,

622
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,867
not necessarily him.

623
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,400
Chase?

624
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:41,936
How's Cameron?

625
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,711
She's not giddy.

626
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,521
Fever's down. White
count's improving.

627
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,349
Has she said anything to you?

628
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,617
You mean, like, "I completely
understand why Foreman did what he did

629
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,288
"and I hold no grudge?"

630
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:10,297
What I did, did save my life.

631
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,745
Get in here and
help! Forget the suit!

632
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,680
He's tachycardic. Wide
complex. Looks like V-tach.

633
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,518
It's not <i>Cryptococcus!</i> What?

634
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,231
House was wrong. The
samples were negative.

635
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,450
So what is it? We don't know.

636
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,752
Give him the amio.

637
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,885
Do we have any more
leads? That was our lead.

638
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,984
Foreman!

639
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,581
So this treatment
isn't doing anything.

640
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,766
Foreman, he's in V-fib!

641
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:48,870
No good. Hit him again.

642
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,738
Come on, man. Come on, Joe.

643
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,411
Hit him again!

644
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,842
Give him an amp of epi.

645
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,757
Nothing.

646
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,591
He has multiple system failure.

647
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,664
Foreman!

648
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,941
Foreman.

649
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:29,573
Foreman!

650
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,474
Time of death?

651
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:32,977
No!

652
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,185
Time of death,

653
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,233
12:26 p.m.
