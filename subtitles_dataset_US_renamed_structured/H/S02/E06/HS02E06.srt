1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:07,069
<i>As the riders begin Lap Two,
Jeff Forster is leading the pack.</i>

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,620
<i>They're jockeying
for position, now...</i>

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,038
This is so cool.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,274
Did we miss anything?

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,374
They've got,
like, 11 laps to go.

6
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,437
We gotta find a good place where
he can see the sign when he goes by.

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,486
Wait up, kids!

8
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,181
<i>There is a strong chase pack
forming led by Vernonski...</i>

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,622
<i>At this point in the race,
things are still too close to call.</i>

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,857
<i>It's anybody's race,
but Forster looks...</i>

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,663
Turn six. Come on.

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,730
<i>Mike Larson has made a
nice break from the pack</i>

13
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,969
<i>and has closed the gap on
Forster and the lead group.</i>

14
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,053
That's it. Up there.

15
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,513
Can you see anything?

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,253
Did you bring his inhaler?

17
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,419
Crap!

18
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,328
I think it's in the
car. I'll go get it.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,298
Are you okay? Your
dad's gonna be right back...

20
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,683
I can see him.
He's right up front.

21
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,107
Honey, you're wheezing.

22
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,667
Here they come. Go, Jeff! Yeah!

23
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,470
You're number one!

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,341
He doesn't look so good.

25
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,427
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Forster is down.</i>

26
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,071
Yeah!

27
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,875
We need to talk.

28
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:28,015
Oh, God. Are you pregnant? 'Cause
I really wanna finish high school.

29
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,348
You have to renew
your credential.

30
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,851
They're good for
two more months.

31
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,012
Three weeks. And the
paperwork takes forever.

32
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,989
Your application, your
malpractice insurance,

33
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,184
criminal records check.

34
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,098
And you know that's
gonna take some explaining.

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,528
You know, our relationship was way
better when we were sleeping together.

36
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,441
Why did we stop doing
that? Did you get married?

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,435
Yeah. Otherwise I'd be
on you like red on rice.

38
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,336
Look, rice
isn't... Oh, I get it.

39
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,998
You're also behind
on your dictations.

40
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,598
I don't do dictations.

41
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,166
Cameron does them, or somebody.

42
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,303
And you can't have your
sole female employee

43
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,779
doing your clerical work, which
you'd know if you'd attended

44
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,679
the required sexual
harassment seminars.

45
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,742
Now, I'm gonna pause so you
can make a crack about harassment.

46
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,843
Joke killer.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,219
House, got a patient.

48
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,622
Sorry. Can't play anymore.
My mom's calling me.

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,396
We just admitted a
world-class cyclist.

50
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,694
You gotta fire Stacy.

51
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,098
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

52
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,605
Jeff Forster, respiratory
arrest at 30 miles per hour.

53
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,163
She's loading me up
with pointless paperwork.

54
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,414
Well, you're way behind
on your pointless paperwork.

55
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,604
O2 sats are in
the... She's hostile.

56
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,810
You know me, hostility
makes me shrink up like a...

57
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,708
I can't think of a
non-sexual metaphor.

58
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,652
She's gonna stand over my desk
with a ruler, checking my spelling...

59
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,365
ER checked for lung
infiltrates. Nothing there.

60
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,349
Professional athletes, Cuddy. It's
like watching an old movie at 2 a.m.

61
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,122
Reliving all the
classic moments.

62
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,892
The part where
he denies it's drugs.

63
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,297
The part where the good
guys ride in, tests a-blazing,

64
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,834
prove that it is drugs.

65
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,235
Oscar clip. He can't imagine
how they got into his body.

66
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,373
It's so familiar, so comforting.

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,965
She can't handle
working with me.

68
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,442
Oh, right. Yeah.

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,378
She's still got a thing for you,
making it impossible for her to deal.

70
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,574
It makes perfect sense,
except for the pronouns.

71
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,078
Anyway, thanks for getting
me out of that meeting.

72
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,714
He's not denying the drugs.

73
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,994
I'm thinking he's actually sick.

74
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,532
Jeff Forster, this is...

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,399
I'm a doctor.
You're a sick person.

76
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,969
And you are a loved
one. Actually, manager.

77
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,632
We've been together for 7 years.

78
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,610
So what's the drug <i>du jour</i>
on the bike circuit these days?

79
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,136
Still erythropoietin, or are you
guys just chugging battery acid?

80
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,580
There's no way I'd touch EPO.

81
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,650
Too many guys
stroking out and dying.

82
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,778
Damn.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,516
10 bucks for the ticket,
six for the popcorn.

84
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,555
I do straight blood doping.

85
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,684
Plot twist.

86
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,986
That's a very daring confession.

87
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,826
We've got
confidentiality, right?

88
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,367
Assuming I'm more
ethical than your client.

89
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:05,168
So, injecting yourself with donor
red blood cells for fun and profit.

90
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,672
Any other tricks up your sleeve?

91
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,471
Well, nothing much recently.

92
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,713
I'm in town for a charity
ride, so it didn't matter if I won.

93
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,313
The kids just needed to see me.

94
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,475
If you go slower,
they see you longer.

95
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,282
Let's say that our health could be affected
by things we did before last Friday.

96
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,653
Well,

97
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,856
I usually sleep in a
Hyperbaric Chamber.

98
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,298
I've been pumping up
electrolytes with an IV drip.

99
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:36,064
Anabolic herbal supplements,
amphetamines and diuretics.

100
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,066
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But why would you be sick?

101
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,268
I know that doping has risks. I
know that it's outside the rules.

102
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:48,647
But I do what I have to to
kick ass at my job. Don't you?

103
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,709
Dr. House is a firm believer in
good old-fashioned hard work.

104
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,659
This guy doesn't even get
sick like a regular person.

105
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,021
Instead of a list of
symptoms and no cause,

106
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,087
we have a list of possible
causes for one symptom.

107
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,926
Is the symptom death?

108
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,592
Respiratory distress.

109
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,228
Insanity doesn't
cause it. I looked it up.

110
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,740
It's the doping. Injecting extra red
cells boosts your endurance level

111
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,469
but it also thickens your blood.

112
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,841
Thick blood equals clots
equals respiratory distress.

113
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,039
Not with a clean
spiral chest CT.

114
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,791
The guy's sleeping in
a Hyperbaric Chamber.

115
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,681
Over-oxygenation
can cause cell damage,

116
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,328
and if the cells in the
lungs are damaged...

117
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,392
That'd cause pulmonary
edema, which he doesn't have.

118
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,719
The supplements he's
been taking contain yohimbe

119
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,553
which can cause nerve paralysis.

120
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,059
Tox-screen was normal.

121
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,422
All the tests were normal.

122
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,192
There's no clot, no edema,
and yet he still can't breathe.

123
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,825
So there's something
in here that we can't see.

124
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,528
Air.

125
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,664
Come to Papa.

126
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,241
This guy's been injecting
himself how many times a day?

127
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,787
All it'd take is one slip of the
needle to cause an air embolus.

128
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,677
So, air is keeping
him from breathing air.

129
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,409
Well, let's go with
that for the irony.

130
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,312
Get a VQ scan and
check his veins for bubbles.

131
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,114
Xenon 133.

132
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,628
It's just radioactive enough for us to
track the air moving through your lungs.

133
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,186
Was my accident on the news?

134
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,289
Yeah, you made
Plays of the Week.

135
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,359
A few more of those, and cycling
will be as popular as NASCAR.

136
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,400
We inject similar stuff into your
blood so we can watch it circulate.

137
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,709
If you accidentally
injected a bubble,

138
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,269
we'll see good air flow
but poor blood flow.

139
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,175
I'm careful, man.

140
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,709
With all due respect, man,

141
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,653
I doubt there's anything wrong
with you that you didn't do to yourself.

142
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,850
There's this kid in oncology, she's
got a picture of Jeff above her bed.

143
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,488
Mickey Mantle was an alcoholic.

144
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,841
At least he hit his
own home runs.

145
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,766
He didn't physically
alter himself.

146
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,565
We take drugs to help us
fall asleep, to stay awake...

147
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,215
Yeah, but we don't make careers
out of who can stay awake the longest.

148
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,801
Really? Ever been to, oh,
I don't know, med school?

149
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,675
Guys, he plays a game
for a living. Who cares?

150
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,237
You don't even like sports.

151
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,545
He's making millions of
dollars ripping off fans.

152
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,778
Anyone who thinks they
should pay a guy money

153
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,686
because he can throw a ball
really far or pedal really fast

154
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,795
deserves to be ripped off.

155
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,825
Yeah, stupid, stupid kids.

156
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,555
I've got an uncle. He can
spit a cherry pit 50 yards.

157
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,093
He's working part-time at
a lube shop. Life isn't fair.

158
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,002
Maybe it is.

159
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,129
You were right.

160
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,405
Now, there were
three wasted words.

161
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:32,139
There is a bubble in his lung. We
should do a Swan-Ganz catheterization.

162
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,613
I love when you do both
sides of the conversation.

163
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,843
It's like white noise.
It's very peaceful.

164
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,461
Is there a light somewhere
that goes on when I have food?

165
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,627
Green for food, orange for
beverages, red for impure thoughts.

166
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,233
That bulb burns
out every two weeks.

167
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,395
How's your biker?

168
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,200
Pumped an air bubble
into a vein in his lung.

169
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,107
The things people
do. Doping, Vicodin...

170
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,611
Hey, you're talking
about me, aren't you?

171
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,393
I'm just trying to function. He's trying
to win himself some little yellow jerseys.

172
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,710
Oh.

173
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,015
What?

174
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,420
Trouble in paradise. 2 o'clock.

175
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,548
Your 2 o'clock or my 2 o'clock?

176
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,718
There.

177
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,762
She seems perfectly happy.

178
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,663
Obviously they huddled in the
hall and worked up this circus act

179
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,980
on the off chance
you'd be in here.

180
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,905
She was unbelievably
pissy three hours ago.

181
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,099
Hmm.

182
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,536
Pissy with you, happy
with her husband.

183
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,942
Yes, there can only be one
possible explanation for that.

184
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,379
When she's angry
she gets sarcastic.

185
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,106
When she's annoyed she's funny.

186
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,783
But when she's
frustrated she gets pissy.

187
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,717
Yes, yes, I'm with you so far.

188
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,722
She's miserable with
Mark because he's not me.

189
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,490
So she's gotta make me not me,

190
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,169
so she makes my
professional life miserable.

191
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,391
If I can't do my job... You
really, really need to get some...

192
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,625
Oh, I get some
"some" all the time.

193
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,624
It's why I always need
to borrow some money.

194
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,365
Hi, James. Greg, you
gotten to that paperwork?

195
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,864
I've been pissy.

196
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,034
Pardon me?

197
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,976
I've been busy.

198
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,346
When you save someone's
life, they owe you forever.

199
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,576
You're right. Take Stacy.

200
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,717
Oh, wait, she'd probably
just leave you all over again.

201
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,219
How's your recovery going? Gotten
around to the small muscles yet?

202
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,691
It's not the size of the muscle,
it's where you get to put it.

203
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:31,297
My goodness, it's like watching Oscar
Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade.

204
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,593
Excuse us.

205
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,468
How awkward was that?

206
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,605
What's he doing here anyway?
He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.

207
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,246
Mark is in group therapy for
people coping with disability.

208
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,290
He was thinking about
developing a drug addiction,

209
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,314
but that would be stupid.

210
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,284
Hey, you're... You, again.

211
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,534
You're not gonna make some
joke about Mark being in therapy?

212
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,159
What's there to say? He's
doing the responsible thing.

213
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,971
I'm sure he's got
a lot to deal with.

214
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,797
You're making me nervous.

215
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:15,032
Every time an athlete goes
down, you guys assume it's drugs.

216
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,905
Look, the doctors say
it's probably acid reflux.

217
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,646
Yeah, look, call me tomorrow.
There's a good chance he'll be released.

218
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,308
Okay. Bye-bye.

219
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,452
So, is this fixing him?

220
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,250
If his acid reflux isn't worse
than we thought, yeah.

221
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,019
I gotta be in
Spain in four days.

222
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,758
Shouldn't be a problem.

223
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,953
Great.

224
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,327
If I could just find the little bugger,
should be able to suck it out.

225
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,802
My legs feel weak.

226
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,775
You're under mild sedation
for the test. It'll wear off.

227
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,168
There it is.

228
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,621
Got it. Fantastic,
I'll pack his things.

229
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,750
Not yet. I wanna monitor him for a
couple of hours, make sure he's okay.

230
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,396
Give him time to sign a picture
for me, maybe even a jersey.

231
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,623
"To Doctor Chase, I
owe you everything."

232
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,618
It doesn't have to
be that personal.

233
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,993
Not too many eBay shoppers
named Doctor Chase, huh?

234
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,337
Still trying to unload the
Barbara Walters spit cup.

235
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,566
Here you go.

236
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,678
Seriously, anything's fine.

237
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,377
Jeff!

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,183
You all right?

239
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,623
Jeff, can you swallow?

240
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,761
What makes a guy start drooling?

241
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,660
Chase, were you
wearing your short shorts?

242
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,895
Muscle fatigue in
his neck and jaw.

243
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,195
He's obviously got something
worse than an air embolus.

244
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,261
Why?

245
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,273
Because you don't
drool from your lungs?

246
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,038
Maybe the problem is not the
embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment.

247
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,305
Maybe you hit
a nerve, literally.

248
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,879
The embolectomy was
clean. His legs were tired, too.

249
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,452
I thought it was from
the sedation, but if not,

250
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,764
it means he's got
something systemic.

251
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,708
Which means it would have nothing
to do with the stunts he's been pulling.

252
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,025
Lupus or polymyositis.

253
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,740
It explains the progressive
muscle weakness.

254
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,788
It could be ALS.

255
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,060
He's too young for that.

256
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,567
Some type of muscular dystrophy?

257
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,068
He's too old for that.

258
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,128
So what would be
just right, Goldilocks?

259
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,842
Full blood workup,
including ANA for lupus.

260
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:33,312
And get a muscle biopsy. Find out if
we're talking myopathy or neuropathy.

261
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,881
I'm late for my session.

262
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,075
Session?

263
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,885
It's all a part of the process.

264
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,577
You get angry
and then you get...

265
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,180
Yeah. I'm right on schedule.

266
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,288
So, when am I gonna be done?

267
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,025
No, I need to know,
'cause I got plans to make.

268
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,530
When can I safely
book a game of squash?

269
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,666
When am I gonna
stop being angry?

270
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,894
Not today.

271
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,994
I've come for the healing.

272
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,568
Dr. Harper, as you
know, I have a bum leg.

273
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,778
What you don't know is I'm
upset about it. I need to talk.

274
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,710
You know House. You
know we have a history.

275
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,277
You've been telling me for
years that I should come by.

276
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,054
Here I am. Hi, guys.

277
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,419
I've got a Thursday
group. Poker night.

278
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,559
Monday morning? Book club.

279
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,233
Well, look, if it's a problem, I'll
just go deal with my rage privately.

280
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,324
Wait.

281
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,766
If you two could
resolve this tension,

282
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,738
you could really
help each other.

283
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,537
I'm tired of fighting.

284
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,709
So either I say
yes or I'm the jerk?

285
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,910
Oh, God, I know that feeling.

286
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,647
I took the muscle
specimen from Jeff's thigh.

287
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,368
I figured that's where we'd have
the best chance at finding something.

288
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,384
The most painful
place to cut into.

289
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,190
I assume that's caffeine-free.

290
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,684
Wouldn't want to be artificially
boosting your performance.

291
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,133
Don't start her up again.

292
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,464
Caffeine's legal.

293
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,966
All about the rules, eh?

294
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,631
It's a bike race,

295
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,500
a completely arbitrary set of
rules that everyone complies with

296
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,375
for no other reason than that some
committee says that they should.

297
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,646
But that's the point.
That's what the game is.

298
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,879
So, if you break an arbitrary
rule, Cameron damns you to hell.

299
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,896
But if you break a rule
that actually has a reason

300
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
that's designed
to protect people,

301
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,414
Cameron develops
a crazy crush on you.

302
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,823
House doesn't pretend
to be some golden boy.

303
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,987
He does it to help people,
not to glorify himself.

304
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,257
So why don't you report
Jeff to the biking authorities?

305
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,265
Ethics.

306
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,358
Well, you wouldn't be
doing it to glorify yourself.

307
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,165
You'd just be trying
to make a better world.

308
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,572
At least you can still
get around on your own.

309
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,670
Yeah, I know.

310
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,043
But you're starting to walk.
You're gonna get better.

311
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,940
You have a job, a
way to be productive.

312
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,614
And you have a wife.

313
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,616
Which gives greater meaning?

314
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,088
A wife could make things
harder, too, I suppose.

315
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,320
This isn't about Stacy.

316
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,696
When it happened to
me, Stacy was great.

317
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,191
She kept telling
me not to rush it.

318
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,236
I never believed her.

319
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,271
She means it.

320
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,767
I know, but...

321
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,436
Stacy. She shouldn't
have to wait, right?

322
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,613
And you know she feels it, too.

323
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,150
There's more time at work.
There's more satisfaction from work.

324
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,582
She didn't get married
to be a nursemaid.

325
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,091
She wants a man.

326
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,629
How the hell could she have loved a
manipulative son of a bitch like you?

327
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,139
That's an interesting question.

328
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,074
Maybe she was attracted to
different things in the two of us.

329
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,166
She left you.

330
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,554
But why was she
with me to begin with?

331
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,807
She made a mistake.

332
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,371
Maybe it's that simple.

333
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,048
Or maybe she saw
something in me,

334
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,550
something she
doesn't get from you.

335
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,642
I'm not an ass.

336
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,812
Maybe she wanted an ass.

337
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:01,911
She obviously did once.

338
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,320
Either he goes or I go.

339
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,100
You think that's the kind of
thing you can just turn off?

340
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,322
Get him out of here! Dr. House,
cancel your book group.

341
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,026
You're coming on Mondays.

342
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,835
Here's my new theory. The
drooling's another competitive edge.

343
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,230
Nobody can draft behind
it. The road gets slick.

344
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,851
He's the only one
not racing in the rain.

345
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,867
He can barely move
his arms and legs.

346
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,945
Paralysis? No, just
general weakness.

347
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,245
Muscle biopsy is
negative for polymyositis.

348
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,683
And ALS and muscular dystrophy.

349
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,812
ANA for lupus, also negative.

350
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,765
Maybe his bike shorts
are just on too tight.

351
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,520
So, by your rationale,
House shouldn't use a cane.

352
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,084
He should just drag his bum
leg around as God intended?

353
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,359
House has a handicap. All
he's aiming for is normality.

354
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,956
And who decides what's normal?

355
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,525
What if we find a drug that
makes people live 20 years longer?

356
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,946
Should we ban that
because it's not normal?

357
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,337
Jeff doesn't want normal.
He wants superpowers.

358
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,898
So why is he normal?

359
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,704
Oh, God, you too?

360
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,869
He's shooting for extraordinary.

361
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,437
So why is everything
so ordinary?

362
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,643
I mean, this guy's breathing,
drinking and injecting himself

363
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,957
with everything he can find
to amp up his body chemistry,

364
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,249
and yet every test is normal.

365
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:12,023
He's artificially raising his red
blood count, so why isn't it raised?

366
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,389
Maybe his count is raised.

367
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,395
Maybe what's normal for
us is out of whack for him.

368
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,258
Can't slip anything by you.

369
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,442
Well, if that's true, his
white cells are up, too.

370
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,230
Which would point to
some kind of infection.

371
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,635
Muscle weakness, exhaustion.
He could have encephalitis.

372
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,765
That's kind of a long shot.
- Yeah.

373
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,085
But it's been over an hour
since we've poked the patient

374
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,704
with something sharp.
So, get a lumbar puncture

375
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,041
and order
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

376
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,849
No, it's not about judging.

377
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:41,684
It's just that on a dating
service you should post a photo.

378
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,182
I have to go.

379
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,990
I am so sorry to bother
you. Nope, not a problem.

380
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,495
I was just accounting.

381
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,395
I'm Jeff Forster's manager.

382
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,933
He's been here a whole day,

383
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,993
and it doesn't seem like
we're any closer to a diagnosis.

384
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,833
Jeff Forster. A whole day, huh?

385
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,133
Mmm-hmm.

386
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,608
I was just wondering if I
could help speed things up.

387
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:07,044
Your client's had a muscle
biopsy, a full blood workup

388
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,548
and he's scheduled for a lumbar
puncture at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

389
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,243
Jeff is in the Lucas Wing.

390
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,809
If Mr. Lucas showed up
needing a lumbar puncture,

391
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,582
would he have to
wait until tomorrow?

392
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,783
Mr. Lucas is dead. Good.

393
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,052
Then there's an opening.

394
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,661
Jeff is used to doing whatever
he has to to be first, isn't he?

395
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,323
It's been very
lucrative for him.

396
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,333
He feels it's important that
he give something back.

397
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,233
I hear you've been raising funds
for your nuclear medicine department

398
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,266
or whatever.

399
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,717
Thank you, guys,
for working so late.

400
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,915
Glad to be here.

401
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,757
The lumbar puncture will tell us
what kind of infection you've got.

402
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,352
In the meantime, we're
administering antibiotics.

403
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,295
Do you like being a hero?

404
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,864
It's a living.

405
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,837
You don't feel a
sense of responsibility?

406
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,466
There's kids out
there that worship you.

407
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,669
When I was a rookie on the tour,

408
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,246
I got a letter from
a guy in Wisconsin.

409
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,478
He wanted me to
send a note to his son.

410
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,286
He said he worshipped me.

411
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,720
You know what worship
means? I looked it up.

412
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,962
It means to love
unquestioningly and uncritically.

413
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,395
So the kid doesn't even
know me, but he loves me

414
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,239
unquestioningly
and uncritically.

415
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,935
So you decided to
take advantage of that.

416
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:49,607
What should I have done?
"Dear sir, I'm just a guy

417
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,850
"who rides a bike pretty good.

418
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,148
"You and your kid
are out of your minds."

419
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,982
My arms feel funny.

420
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,793
The sats are dropping.
He's in respiratory arrest.

421
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,265
He can't be. We fixed that.

422
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,124
Apparently not.

423
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,552
So glad we cured
his respiratory arrest.

424
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,947
It freed him up to
develop respiratory arrest.

425
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,081
LP was negative
for encephalitis.

426
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,434
The white count's
still the same,

427
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,757
but the red count's
fallen to 29%.

428
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,226
What was my theory yesterday?

429
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,127
That I screwed up
the embolectomy.

430
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,923
We'll get a chest
x-ray to check.

431
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,434
I didn't screw up.
Why would you...

432
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,834
How can you be so petty,
Chase? He's down a quart.

433
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,630
Either he's losing blood
because you nicked something

434
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,884
or he's just not
producing blood,

435
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,900
in which case, we're
talking acute anemia

436
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,287
combined with a
muscular disorder.

437
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,939
Paraneoplastic syndrome?

438
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,608
Either you screwed
up or he's got cancer.

439
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,655
I think I should
start smoking again.

440
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,823
You want a medical opinion
supporting that decision?

441
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,092
The symptoms started
as soon as I quit.

442
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,565
Symptoms meaning diarrhea.

443
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,893
A lot of diarrhea.
10 or 12 times a day.

444
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,429
It's really embarrassing.
I'm a flight attendant and...

445
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,687
Well, on the up side,
my hiccups are gone.

446
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,974
You went to his group.

447
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,845
Well, you were the one who was all,
"Greg, you need to confront your feelings."

448
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,940
That was five years ago.

449
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,280
Well, I've been pissy.

450
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,912
Fine, you don't want help. Does
that mean nobody should get it?

451
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:39,720
Mark's looking for help because,
what, he's resentful, overwhelmed?

452
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,986
I'm asking because I care.

453
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,119
Not about him.

454
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,595
You still wanna jump me, so
you don't care whose marriage...

455
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,757
Listen, I can get my
rocks off any time I want.

456
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,664
What I don't seem to
be able to do is my job

457
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,430
without you hanging
over my shoulder.

458
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,266
How many packs?

459
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,606
A bit over one a day, but
they were lights, and I quit.

460
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,282
You used to go out with her?

461
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,409
Yeah.

462
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,149
What was I thinking?

463
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,489
I'm talking about the gum you're chewing
to replace smoking as an oral fixation.

464
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,886
How many packs?

465
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,051
Six, maybe seven.

466
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,524
I'm trying to protect you.

467
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,622
Cuddy and I may be the only people
stopping you from jumping off a cliff

468
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,809
just to prove that
you... You're pissy.

469
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,301
Oh, I am angry! Pissy.

470
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,394
You only get pissy when
you're frustrated. Shut up.

471
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,032
Okay, I'm wrong.

472
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,500
This is unbelievably difficult
for Mark, which you should know.

473
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,077
Which you should be able to
summon up some level of empathy for.

474
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,013
Right. The crippled boys.
We should start a band.

475
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,145
I have a good thing with Mark.

476
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,651
We are handling this the
best way we know how.

477
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,517
And none of this has
anything to do with me?

478
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:46,719
No, nothing, except that
you can't or won't just let it go.

479
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,685
Let it go.

480
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,766
You're being poisoned.

481
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,171
By gum?

482
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:05,405
Sugarless gum uses
sorbitol as a sweetener.

483
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,379
We use sorbitol as a laxative.

484
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,453
This will tell you if he's
got cancer in his blood?

485
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,390
If he does, we'll see
abnormal cells in the marrow.

486
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,453
How long will the tests take?

487
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,395
I'll get them in
as soon as I can.

488
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,966
And if he doesn't have
cancer, what else could it be?

489
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:33,164
It's possible some damage was done
during one of the tests we gave him.

490
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,072
So either one of your doctors
screwed up a simple procedure

491
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,370
or he's got cancer.

492
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,774
We can't know anything for
sure until the biopsy comes back.

493
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,083
It stings, I know.

494
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,743
No, he wants the tube out.

495
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,150
I can't do that, Jeff.

496
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,384
If you wanna say something,
you've gotta write it down. Okay?

497
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,150
Here.

498
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,076
If it's cancer, it's possible.

499
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,238
There's no way to know for sure.

500
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,476
Phone not working?

501
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,656
One of the morgue attendants
asked me to bring this to you.

502
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,773
Wonder why they're calling me.

503
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,026
Yeah, me too, actually.

504
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,365
I was wondering why the
<i>Times</i> was returning your call.

505
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,129
You a doctor or
the bicycle police?

506
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,799
He's cheating. He
shouldn't get away with it.

507
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,379
Have you actually
told them anything yet?

508
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,525
You worried about the precedent?

509
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,074
I'm worried about you.

510
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,244
You gonna turn me in?

511
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,612
No.

512
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,920
He's made a mistake.
Revealing the truth doesn't undo it.

513
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,858
Kids love him, and he's not
who they think he is. It's not right.

514
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,457
Who cares if he's what he
says he is? Who the hell is?

515
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,732
If love is based on lies, does
that mean it's not a real feeling?

516
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,831
It doesn't bring
the same pleasure?

517
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,705
Are we still talking
about the patient?

518
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,611
Have you ever cheated?

519
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,353
Well, I have.

520
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,254
You wanna punish
him? Good for you.

521
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,121
But you can't do it without
punishing the people who love him.

522
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,097
Is that how you justified
lying to your wives?

523
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,395
I always told them.

524
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,698
Well, he's negative for bleeds.

525
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,671
Congratulations,
Chase. It's cancer.

526
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,612
Clean him up and let oncology
have him. It's their party now.

527
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,549
He doesn't have cancer. Biopsy
shows he's got pure red cell aplasia.

528
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,717
There's no way PRCA
could manifest so suddenly.

529
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,918
Unless it's drug-induced. He's
lying about not being on EPO.

530
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,657
Why would he lie?

531
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,127
What does it matter?

532
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,130
People lie for thousands of
reasons. But there's always a reason.

533
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,567
Philosophically interesting,
medically irrelevant.

534
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,169
Unless he's not lying.

535
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,268
You've got a leak. The press
is all over the Jeff Forster story.

536
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,713
On the off chance that one of
you was stupid enough to call

537
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,012
from your own office, I'm
pulling your phone records,

538
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,347
including your cell phones.

539
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,650
I assume if I point out the fact
that you have no right to do that,

540
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,350
you'll interpret that
as a sign of guilt?

541
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,882
Wilson's chatty, plus he's
got two ex-wives to support.

542
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,320
You want me to
tell him he's fired?

543
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:46,355
Until we figure out who's behind
this, I'm sitting in with you guys.

544
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,458
You have the ethics of a 4-year-old.
I'm gonna treat you like one.

545
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,767
How am I supposed to practice medicine
with a lawyer sitting on my shoulder?

546
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,273
Responsibly. You
know I can't do that.

547
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,937
Cameron.

548
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,103
I'm not the leak.

549
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,613
Somebody once told
me that everybody lies,

550
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,725
and since you're the only
people who know he has cancer...

551
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:04,944
He doesn't have cancer.

552
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,781
The point is, you're
his medical team.

553
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,882
He's threatening to sue.

554
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,946
Why would Cameron leak cancer?

555
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,183
How does cancer
make the guy look bad?

556
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,159
He's on EPO.

557
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,604
Your anemia is caused
by pure red cell aplasia.

558
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,332
This is gonna hurt,
but we gotta talk.

559
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,605
What the hell are you doing?

560
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,976
He'll be fine, sort of.

561
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,649
I just don't have time to
watch him write out answers.

562
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:42,918
PRCA comes in two
varieties, chronic and acute.

563
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,955
Since it came on fast,
you have the acute version.

564
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,320
He doesn't have cancer.

565
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,486
Is the good news.
The bad news is

566
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,025
pants are on fire.

567
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:56,334
Acute PRCA is caused by
drugs, most commonly, EPO.

568
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,297
Ready, and action!

569
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,602
But I haven't used EPO.

570
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,309
Okay, but this time,
with more anger.

571
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,771
Remember, this guy's
accusing you of cheating.

572
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,411
I haven't used that stuff.

573
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,948
I believed it. It was simple, it
was pure. Did you believe it?

574
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,918
I guess it's silly to cast
someone after the first audition.

575
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,857
Why don't you do a
reading? Give me that.

576
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,192
He doesn't do EPO.
What did you think?

577
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,358
It's a different way to go, but,
I don't know, I just didn't buy it.

578
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,843
Does she handle
any of your injections?

579
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,859
You think I'm giving it to him?

580
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,503
Test him.

581
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,233
Gee, that's a great idea.

582
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,743
I sure hope that EPO's not one of those
drugs that's undetectable after six hours.

583
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,142
Hey, you know what we
can test for? Phone calls.

584
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,083
Take her cell phone.
Push the redial button.

585
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,244
Even money says you'll be
connected to the newspaper

586
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,519
that leaked your cancer story.

587
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,216
Okay.

588
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,321
Okay, I should have told you.

589
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,520
It's not just about
the races, Jeff.

590
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,326
It's about your image, okay?

591
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,933
If you come back from cancer,
those sponsors will be all over you.

592
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,472
Okay, so I messed up. Okay?
But I did not give you EPO.

593
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,806
That stuff could kill me.

594
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,474
Come on, give her a break.

595
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,787
She was only doing what she
has to to advance her career.

596
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,012
Don't you have that
tattooed on your tushie?

597
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,322
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

598
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,515
Who are you gonna believe,

599
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,693
the manager you've
trusted for years?

600
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,789
I've been to college.

601
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,633
You're fired.

602
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,676
Okay.

603
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,143
You're basing this whole
diagnosis, everything,

604
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,756
on the idea that I was
slipping him illegal drugs.

605
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,288
You're gonna kill him.

606
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:24,013
If Doctor House is so sure,
why do you need to stay?

607
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,914
He's a very cautious man.

608
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,320
Your breathing's better.
Let the prednisone do its job.

609
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,788
Get some sleep.

610
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,559
Jeff?

611
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,545
His red blood cell
count plummeted to 16%.

612
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,947
He passed out, had to be resuscitated,
and he still can't move his legs.

613
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,850
That's not possible. The drugs
should be flushing out of his system.

614
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,820
Can't leave if they don't exist.

615
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,824
The EPO use explains
every one of his symptoms.

616
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,588
He's been lying and cheating,
and now it's coming back to bite him.

617
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,459
The only problem with that theory
is it's based on the assumption

618
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,362
that the universe
is a just place.

619
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,560
If it were, then his poor manager
wouldn't have been fired for no reason.

620
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,661
Lambert-Eaton.
His chest was clear.

621
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,206
So we run an
electromyography test.

622
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,469
You're still not
explaining the PRCA.

623
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,837
What's his red count now?

624
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,354
I had to give him
a blood transfusion.

625
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,778
He's back around 30.

626
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,939
He needed a transfusion?

627
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,684
Well, he was losing blood, so, I
thought maybe he needed blood.

628
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,383
Go forth and scan his neck.

629
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,551
His neck?

630
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,589
Or repeat everything
I say in question form.

631
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,268
She came into the
clinic and yelled at me.

632
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,547
Then she left, she came
back and yelled some more.

633
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,009
Hmm.

634
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,945
Yelling. That might be a clue.

635
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,650
I know what the yelling means. It's
the coming and going I find interesting.

636
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,056
It's not rational.
Anger is not rational.

637
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,490
Some anger is.

638
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,496
She could have pulled me
aside, screamed at me privately.

639
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:21,833
Her beef is simple
and well founded.

640
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,294
But she was out of control.

641
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,803
You're having fun, aren't you?

642
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,931
She's in my face. I
need to know why.

643
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,573
Professional reasons.

644
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,700
Why else?

645
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,842
Do you really think this is
going to end well for anyone?

646
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,879
After this, let's scan some
other totally random body parts.

647
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,025
50 bucks says we find something.

648
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:49,593
Find what?

649
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,997
Don't have a clue. We on?

650
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,122
No way.

651
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,133
No. We'll find something.

652
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,937
We found a thymoma. How'd
you know to look in his neck?

653
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,776
Thymoma's usually
present in the chest.

654
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,679
I knew it wasn't in his chest.

655
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,551
All we've done since he
checked in is look at his chest.

656
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,383
All the more reason not to think...
There are two types of PRCA.

657
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,253
Acute comes on suddenly,
chronic takes its time.

658
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:22,370
We all thought Jeff's was acute
because it happened right in front of us.

659
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,920
But what if it'd been there
for months, maybe years?

660
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,941
There's no way. It would
have kept him from racing.

661
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,246
With that kind of anemia, he
would have needed constant...

662
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,396
Blood transfusions.

663
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,269
Which he was getting in
convenient blood doping form.

664
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,366
He was treating himself
without even knowing it.

665
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,879
Up to half of patients with
chronic PRCA have a thymoma.

666
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,572
And up to half of
patients with a thymoma...

667
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,585
I've always wanted to do this.

668
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,690
I'm not getting any better.
Does that mean I'm...

669
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,231
You are healed. Rise and walk.

670
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,831
Are you insane?

671
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,931
In the Bible, people
just say, "Yes, Lord,"

672
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,942
and then start right
in on the praising.

673
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,705
First you tell me
I've got cancer.

674
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,182
And then you tell me
that my manager...

675
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,126
What did you do?

676
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,528
No, "What did you do, Lord?"

677
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,328
Thymoma is a tumor
on the thymus gland.

678
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,300
He's a bit of a wimp, but he
hangs with the tough guys.

679
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,867
PRCA and an autoimmune
disease called myasthenia gravis.

680
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,437
MG causes muscle fatigue

681
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,482
including respiratory problems
and difficulty swallowing.

682
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,246
And it can hit you that fast?

683
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,652
The treatment for PRCA
is blood transfusions.

684
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,849
The treatment for
MG is hyperbaria.

685
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,753
You were doing both as part
of your regular freak show.

686
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,886
When you took a break,
everything went to hell,

687
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,698
which is not an uncommon
reaction in Jersey.

688
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:10,861
So, the whole thing
with my manager...

689
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,597
Oops. No, no EPO.

690
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,475
This has nothing to do
with anything you did.

691
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,875
You can let her know
she's in the clear. I could.

692
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:24,114
Or 10% of a Nike contract

693
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,083
is a hell of a lot of cash.

694
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,216
You don't need your thymus.

695
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,999
If we take it out, everything
else is manageable.

696
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,719
Manageable? I thought
you just cured me.

697
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,455
Uh-uh. This is just diagnostic.

698
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,090
Tensilon erases the symptoms
of MG for five or six minutes.

699
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,902
Sometimes less.

700
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,840
This is exactly why
I created nurses.

701
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,010
Clean up on Aisle Three!

702
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,638
If you've come to search my
office, you should wait 10 minutes.

703
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,062
I'll be out of your hair.

704
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,328
Here, start with my purse.
Just save me some mints.

705
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,696
What do you wanna
know? My sex life with Mark?

706
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,864
My guilt over crippling
your damn leg?

707
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,666
Or are you just here to gloat
because you weren't the leak?

708
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,508
I want to apologize.

709
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,116
Maybe I've

710
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,281
been punishing you
for a little too long.

711
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,550
And maybe you've
been punishing me.

712
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,291
If we're going to work
together, I need to know.

713
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,835
Do you hate me
or do you love me?

714
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,201
Either way, I think
we've got a problem.

715
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,569
I hate you and I love you.

716
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,346
And I love Mark.

717
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,950
And you don't hate him.

718
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,115
No.

719
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,228
So what do we do?

720
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,491
We deal with each other.

721
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,892
Right.

722
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,028
That plan's been
working great so far.

723
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,074
It'll get better.
It'll get easier.

724
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,209
Why? I don't know.

725
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,870
That's what my
therapist tells me.

726
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,677
<i>In the professional cycling
world, we are subject to</i>

727
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,035
<i>what seems like constant
witch-hunts and finger-pointing.</i>

728
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,275
<i>But I want to thank Dr. House
and the excellent medical team</i>

729
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,901
<i>here at Princeton-Plainsboro.</i>

730
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,911
<i>My hope is that this diagnosis</i>

731
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,791
<i>will put to rest any
rumors that I would ever...</i>

732
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,977
He needs blood
transfusions every two weeks,

733
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,986
which means he
can dope all he wants.

734
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,187
He's got a doctor's pass.

735
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,454
It's medicinal.

736
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,392
He got away with it.

737
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,090
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,689
He cheated and won a game.

739
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:32,194
Life's more complicated than
who gets to the finish line first.

740
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,340
I fell in love with my
husband's best friend.

741
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,715
Near the end, I was at
the hospital every day,

742
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,147
and Joe would
come by after work.

743
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,121
We'd go for walks and try
to talk each other through it.

744
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,318
We kind of clung
on to each other.

745
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:03,858
My wife

746
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,840
wasn't dying. She
wasn't even sick.

747
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,802
Everything was fine.

748
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,438
But I met someone who

749
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,874
made me feel funny.

750
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:23,511
Good.

751
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,182
And I didn't want
to let that feeling go.

752
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,795
What happened to you?

753
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,997
How can anyone go
through that alone?

754
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,397
You can't control your emotions.

755
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,566
No.

756
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,473
Just your actions.

757
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,721
You didn't do it, did you?
You didn't sleep with him.

758
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,421
I couldn't have
lived with myself.

759
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,399
You'd be surprised
what you can live with.

760
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,047
Hey.

761
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,020
I need you to open a door.

762
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,185
It's not allowed.

763
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,055
Yeah, I was having
therapy in here today

764
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,590
and I left my cane.

765
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,860
Sorry.

766
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,536
Dude,

767
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,238
I'm crippled.
