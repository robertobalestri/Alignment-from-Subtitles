1
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,090
Honey?

2
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,368
Are you all right? Yeah.

3
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,702
Yeah, I'm just fighting off
a stomach bug. I'll be fine.

4
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:47,370
Did he sleep okay? Great,
as long as I was holding him.

5
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,512
I can't wait for
colic to be over.

6
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,952
Hold on, Mikey.
Bath time's coming.

7
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,524
He lifted his head yesterday.

8
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,890
Take the day off.

9
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,989
I mean, you're sick anyway,
and you hardly ever see him

10
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,057
or me.

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,734
I can't.

12
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,967
I've got a meeting with Crandall's
Kitchens. I think that deal's gonna close.

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,741
They called about
the car payment again.

14
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,701
It's two months late.

15
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,113
We're gonna be fine, honey.

16
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,283
Enjoy your bath, little man.

17
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,938
You know, honey?

18
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:52,804
Honey, I'm not gonna go in.
I'm coming down with something.

19
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,776
Honey?

20
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,245
Kara?

21
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,383
Kara?

22
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,619
Kara!

23
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,194
Mikey!

24
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,864
Mikey!

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,232
Kara!

26
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,002
Mikey!

27
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,455
Four-week-old infant submerged
in a bathtub. Don't know how long.

28
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,072
Non-responsive at the scene.

29
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,325
Get a trauma team for six.

30
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,011
Obviously breathing now.

31
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,350
Continue the Bodybox. Stat portable chest.
- Caucasian female, 32.

32
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,050
Where am I? EMT: Tonic-clonic
seizure in the bathroom.

33
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,724
- Brent, where am I?
- On one, two, three.

34
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,389
- Where am I?
- One, two, three.

35
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,591
You're in the hospital,
honey. You're in the hospital.

36
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,977
Honey, Mikey's here, and the
doctors say he's gonna be okay.

37
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,061
Hopefully. He needs to be
checked out by the NICU.

38
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,434
What happened?

39
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,972
You passed out. KARA: What?

40
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,440
Mikey fell. Has your
wife had a seizure before?

41
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,567
No.

42
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,612
I can't move my
head! I want to see him!

43
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,959
He's right here, honey.
He's okay. He's right here.

44
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,440
Tonight. <i>L Word</i> marathon.

45
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,719
You watch <i>The L Word?</i> On mute.

46
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,581
I'll pass.

47
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,390
Dinner with Cuddy.

48
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:51,087
Still sucking up so she'll fund
your play space for the chemo kids?

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,931
They really ought to save their
energy for other things, like crying.

50
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,269
She's the suck-up.

51
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,868
She asked you?

52
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,445
She's smart. She knows if
she buys me enough alcohol

53
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,106
my defenses just
might be weakened.

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,108
It doesn't make sense.
Unless she ran out of batteries.

55
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,916
Hey. I'm recently
single, she's single.

56
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:21,157
You're too nice for her to like you.
She's not needy enough for you to like her.

57
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,529
She's got an agenda, just not one that
includes an appearance by little Jimmy.

58
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,867
I'll poll my peeps. How many
of you think that Cuddy asked...

59
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,903
Or, rather, peep.

60
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,254
Chase caught a case in the
ER. He wants us to take a look.

61
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,301
Unless Chase broke his
neck falling off his polo pony,

62
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,404
he had no reason
to be in the ER.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,815
Cuddy put him on a two-week NICU rotation.
Patient had an unexplained seizure.

64
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,150
Seizures are cool to
watch, boring to diagnose.

65
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,590
What about Foreman? He needs
to get his malingering butt back here.

66
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,991
He almost died.

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,428
"Almost" being the
operative word. Hey.

68
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:02,397
How are you doing? You
look great. Thanks. I feel great.

69
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,731
Glad you're back. Cameron
makes lousy coffee.

70
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,540
I take mine black, the way I take
my brain-damaged neurologists.

71
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,246
Happy to help.

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,552
How are you coming along?
Tell her everything's great.

73
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,687
Neither of us wants to deal
with her guilt. I don't feel guilty.

74
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,657
Of course not. Hell,
if people felt guilt

75
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,693
every time they accidentally
lobotomized a guy...

76
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,422
I was trying to save his life.

77
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,896
Yeah. Your heart
was in the right place.

78
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,358
It's just his brain that's not
quite where it's supposed to be.

79
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,001
Tell her everything's
great. It's true.

80
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,533
No more left side/right side reversals.
Still some short-term memory loss

81
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,776
and spatial processing problems, but
I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.

82
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,745
Yeah, might pull a muscle.

83
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,077
We have a case? Seizure that
can't be explained by epilepsy

84
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,055
and accompanied by
elevated calcium levels.

85
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,990
Still bored. Tell her why.

86
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:03,497
Because seizure with mildly elevated
calcium is diagnostically simple.

87
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,500
It's either hyperparathyroid, cancer,
or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity.

88
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,561
Well done.

89
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,472
But until you can remember how to
make coffee, hands off the patients.

90
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,634
House.

91
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,369
All those reasons this case bores
you, the ER has already ruled them out.

92
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,520
Lungs are clear. Get an EEG.
Confirm the brain function is okay.

93
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,188
Can we focus on
the task at hand?

94
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,525
Why did Mommy twitch so hard that
she tossed the baby in with the bath water?

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,729
You don't need me for this. Of
course I need you. We're a team.

96
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,467
Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed
arteries in the brain cause seizures.

97
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,271
Inflamed arteries in the
kidneys cause calcium buildup.

98
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,246
You're a moron. Did you even look
at the file? Kidney function is fine.

99
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,078
Whipple's? What?

100
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,384
Whipple's. Test her.

101
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,285
Cameron thinks it starts
with a "W". I'm thinking "V".

102
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,727
The dad vomited this morning.
Maybe they've both got strep.

103
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,437
You think you can do
a strep-throat culture

104
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,657
without the swab ending
up in the guy's poop chute?

105
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,131
"V" for "vasoconstriction."
That'd be my guess.

106
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,532
Excess calcium makes blood
vessels in the brain clamp down.

107
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,470
Best case scenario,
seizure. Worst case, stroke.

108
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,871
Do a digital
subtraction angiogram.

109
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:25,003
Foreman can't tell up from down, Cameron's
a girl. All that mechanical stuff.

110
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,343
Sorry. Cuddy
says I'm stuck here.

111
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,895
You're late.

112
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,303
And you are in my locked office.

113
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,366
Again. What you got there?

114
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,002
Special panties for
your date with Wilson?

115
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,309
It's not a date. And it's
none of your business.

116
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,281
If it's not a date,
it is business.

117
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,046
And if it was business, you wouldn't
say it was none of my business.

118
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,553
What do you want? I want to
talk about your date with Wilson.

119
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,555
It's not a date. This is fun.

120
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,052
Spring Chase from NICU
and I'll shut up about your date.

121
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:17,187
NICU is short-staffed. Have
you suddenly lost the ability to lie?

122
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,432
Nobody's quit NICU in two years.

123
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,463
And if you're making up reasons,
that means there is no reason,

124
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,074
which means he asked for
the assignment, didn't he?

125
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,111
If Chase needs a break
from you, he should take it.

126
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,110
Absolutely.

127
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,724
Both Mom and Dad
are negative for strep.

128
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,935
You'll be back playing
with the big toys soon.

129
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,495
Or not. Either way, I'm fine.
You don't have to say that.

130
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,307
It's okay. I could always
work in a research lab or teach.

131
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,977
And you'd be okay with
that? Why wouldn't I be?

132
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,812
You were planning on pursuing grants
of your own, running a department.

133
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,012
I'm alive.

134
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,315
Changing jobs,
not making coffee,

135
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,156
if that stuff bothers me now, I
don't deserve this second chance.

136
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,702
They say that physical contact
helps the healing process.

137
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,893
What's happening?

138
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,097
Your son's not getting enough
oxygen. Take Mr. Mason outside.

139
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,837
Lung's collapsed. He's not getting
any air. I need an IV catheter.

140
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,907
Another seizure?

141
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,263
Her chest muscles aren't
contracting. It's something else.

142
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,458
Her whole back is spasming. I need
two milligrams of lorazepam, stat!

143
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,896
He's okay.

144
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,079
His lung wouldn't
collapse if he was okay.

145
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,408
What the hell's
happening? I have no idea.

146
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,790
So what causes seizures,

147
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,770
hypercalcemia, and the thing
where Mommy bends like Gumby.

148
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,000
Little busy here. Uh-oh.

149
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,973
Baby's lungs are gonna conk out any
minute. Probably want to deal with that.

150
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,741
I'll get right on it as soon
as I finish indulging my boss.

151
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,339
Multi-task. Chemical
pneumonitis.

152
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,908
Bubble bath got into the baby's
lungs when he was underwater.

153
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,387
Start him on prednisone.
Keep him on high Fl02.

154
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,954
Let the indulging commence.

155
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,521
Lithium could cause all three
of the mother's symptoms.

156
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,120
No record she's on lithium.
And the tox screen was negative.

157
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,826
Lithium doesn't show on a
basic tox screen, Scarecrow.

158
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,767
Myelomatous meningitis
could also cover everything.

159
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,263
Rare complications of a rare blood
cancer. You're not totally hopeless.

160
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,333
Get an S-PEP and an MRI
for myelomatous meningitis.

161
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,140
Search the patient's
place for lithium.

162
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,376
The baby's lung problem is bacterial
and not chemical. Start ECMO.

163
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,442
While you're searching for the lithium,
take a water sample and check the pipes.

164
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,886
You want me to write
this down for you?

165
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,459
I ask you, is almost dying
any excuse for not being fun?

166
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,790
I'm not putting that
baby on ECMO.

167
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,199
The chance of there being
bacteria in bathwater...

168
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,397
Why don't you
want to work for me?

169
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,866
I'm nice, I'm fun at parties.

170
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,367
I'm not working
NICU because of you.

171
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,481
The baby's x-ray suggested
chemical pneumonitis.

172
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,951
Not to me. The x-ray
was too consolidated.

173
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:36,087
So, why are you down here?
Hoping to expand your make-out pool

174
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,057
to include the preemie to
nine-year-old demographic?

175
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,595
I needed a break.

176
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,866
From the patients.

177
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,400
They lie to us all the time.

178
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,398
Foreman almost died trying
to save a drug-dealing cop.

179
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,506
I just wanted to get
away from that for a while.

180
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,915
What a complete load of crap.

181
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,352
What am I? A nurse you're trying
to prep with this vulnerability thing?

182
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,982
ECMO could kill him.

183
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,288
You don't start him on ECMO and that
infection could rampage through his body

184
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,726
like Pistons fans
after a championship.

185
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,329
But you do it your way. Nothing
more honest than a dead baby.

186
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,567
ECMO stands for extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation.

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,270
Basically, we remove your son'
s blood... Okay, all of his blood?

188
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:35,714
We run it through a machine which
takes out carbon dioxide and adds oxygen.

189
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,946
Then we re-warm the blood
and run it back into his body.

190
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:44,254
There is a significant risk of internal
hemorrhaging, and he may also suffer...

191
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,123
You put him on antibiotics. Won't
that take care of the infection?

192
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,559
Not fast enough.

193
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,097
Are you sure this
is Mikey's best shot?

194
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,229
Absolutely.

195
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,862
Cuddy's trash? Not anymore.
I paid good money for it.

196
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,429
Look at what she bought.

197
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,002
Red clover. What is red
clover used for, Dr. Wilson?

198
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,972
Also used to treat asthma,

199
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:41,477
psoriasis, joint pain... She
doesn't wheeze, flake, or ache.

200
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,743
And she didn't ask a pulmonologist
or a dermatologist for dinner.

201
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,750
She invited an oncologist.

202
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,915
It's not a date. It's a consult.

203
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,795
Mom's MRI was negative
for masses, abscesses.

204
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,863
There's no sign she has
myelomatous... Fascinating.

205
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,992
Call me when we have...
She has a subarachnoid bleed.

206
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,632
So, why is our patient
bleeding into her brain?

207
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,140
Her blood workup shows
her pro-time's elevated.

208
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,008
She's bleeding because she's not
clotting. So, why is she not clotting?

209
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,188
What did you bring us, Daddy?

210
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,910
The only mood-altering drug
was vodka at the back of a drawer.

211
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,546
Hiding booze is a classic alcoholic
behavior. That'd explain the bleeding.

212
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,679
What bleeding?

213
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,282
You don't remember? She bled
all over you this morning. Kidding.

214
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,425
Idiots are fun. No wonder
every village wants one.

215
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,457
If she's an alcoholic, she would
also be more prone to hypercalcemia.

216
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:36,264
But the tox screen was negative
for alcohol. Hey, it was your idea.

217
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,430
Now, it's even better. Mommy
quits. She gets the DTs.

218
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,532
Even explains the seizure. It
also fits conversion disorder.

219
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,067
They're deep in debt, he' s working
around the clock, they got a new baby.

220
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,944
I think the seizure was a physical
response to psychological stress.

221
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,984
Boozy Mommy
covers more symptoms.

222
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,452
Put her in a nice phenobarbital
coma before the DTs kill her.

223
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,682
Where are you going? To
put her in a pheno coma.

224
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,660
What if I'm wrong? What
if Daddy's the drunk?

225
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,405
Do you want us to give
her the pheno or not?

226
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,606
I want him to argue his point.

227
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,724
I assume you considered
the father and ruled him out.

228
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,167
What's that saying? When you assume,
you become a pain in the ass to me.

229
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,296
Why should I argue?
You'd just overrule me.

230
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,103
Enough! Get a pony
or a watermelon farm.

231
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,007
House? I need him to react.

232
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,705
I need him to act
like a human being.

233
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,045
I need him to get over this
boring near-death rebirth.

234
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,574
I have changed. That's
not something you get over.

235
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,384
Nearly dying changes everything
forever. For about two months.

236
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,719
Two months is too long. I
need the guy I hired back. Now.

237
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,423
No matter how much your misery
loves company, it's not getting mine.

238
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,398
I'll talk to the dad.
Cameron can take the mom.

239
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,025
We'll figure out if Mom was
the drinker. Waste of time.

240
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,627
Put her in a coma
before the DTs kill her.

241
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,615
So,

242
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,256
is this a separation, or...

243
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,863
Well, lawyers have been
hired, friends divvied up.

244
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,629
Oddly, she didn't
fight me for House.

245
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,130
At least there aren't kids involved.
You just have each other to deal with.

246
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,143
If there had been kids, maybe
we would have done more of that.

247
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,348
Do you want kids?

248
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,751
Listen, is there anything in
particular you wanted to...

249
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,089
Hospital business
or... Catching up.

250
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,502
I mean, you know, it's not like

251
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,057
either one of us has
anybody to run home to.

252
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,028
No.

253
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,906
How are you feeling?

254
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,316
Okay. A little groggy.

255
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,948
There's somebody
here to see you.

256
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,794
Hey, Mikey. Mommy's awake.

257
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:25,632
Oh, Mikey. Gosh,
I was so scared.

258
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,531
Oh, I love you.

259
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,111
I love you so much. Oh.

260
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,544
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,587
You don't have anything to
be sorry about. You were sick.

262
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,363
Turns out she and
her husband met in AA.

263
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,837
Obviously, she
slipped. Good call.

264
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:04,240
It wasn't hard, considering my other
choice was your stupid psych theory.

265
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,503
Which was not stupid.

266
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,145
I'm telling you, I'm gonna
drop the N-bomb if I have to.

267
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,913
You're addicted to conflict.
Did they change the name?

268
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,685
You could have handled this
patient without dragging Chase in.

269
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,784
But the fact that he
didn't want in killed you.

270
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,694
Just like the fact you
can't get a rise out of me.

271
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,867
Where's the baby?

272
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,413
Get off me! No!
I have to do this!

273
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,973
No breath sounds.
Crash cart and epi! Stat!

274
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,046
I told you your psych
theory wasn't stupid.

275
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,789
Your son is stable.

276
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,159
But the lack of oxygen
damaged his kidneys.

277
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,755
She must have rolled
over on him by mistake.

278
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,068
Mr. Mason, I was there.

279
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,399
Your wife tried to
smother your son.

280
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,502
That's impossible. Kara
would never hurt Mikey.

281
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,445
He knows. They said Mikey knows.

282
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,983
You hear voices?

283
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,457
They wouldn't quit saying that
Mikey would be better off if...

284
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,128
They were right.

285
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,179
We've been trying to diagnose
a seizure that didn't exist.

286
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,173
She faked it when her husband
caught her. I don't think she faked it.

287
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,266
She just happened to seize right
in the middle of drowning her child?

288
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,435
Lucky break for the kid.

289
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,641
Hey, take it easy on Foreman. He's
playing with one lobe tied behind his back.

290
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,081
Postpartum psychosis makes
her want to drown her kid.

291
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,846
The internal conflict
triggers a seizure.

292
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,980
You know what else might be a trigger? A
physical illness. It's a wild idea, I know.

293
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,656
Especially since she doesn't have
any obviously physical symptoms,

294
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,594
like internal bleeding or excess
calcium. I'll draw some blood, test for...

295
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,531
Oh! Jeez! You've done it
again! Will you argue with me?

296
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,734
Drinkers don't eat right. That
explains the bleeding and the calcium.

297
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,203
This might just be
some crazy drunk,

298
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,072
and I'm telling you that she's about
to die of myelomatous meningitis.

299
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,736
We already tested for...
Exactly. It's an insane idea.

300
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,110
Okay. What do you want me
to do? Have an original thought.

301
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,359
In the meantime, stress her
into having another seizure.

302
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,113
We can't. She's on haloperidol.

303
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,383
You also can't because it's
dangerous and highly unethical.

304
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,767
Therefore, if you get caught,
pretend you can't make coffee.

305
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,987
Mental defectives
get tons of slack.

306
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,121
Take her off the haloperidol,
hook her up to an EEG,

307
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,638
flash some lights, make her
pant, shoot her up with a placebo.

308
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,831
When she starts twitching, if the
machine twitches along, it's real. If not,

309
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,738
well, call the cops, 'cause
she's a psycho killer.

310
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,077
Stop pushing him.
Stop protecting him.

311
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,549
He needs it. Not if
he wants to get better.

312
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,815
He might not be able to get better.
Well, then, I need a new neurologist.

313
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,927
He got sick doing his job.

314
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,447
If he got killed doing his job, I
wouldn't keep him on the payroll.

315
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,394
I don't care how guilty you feel or
how touched you are by his reborn spirit.

316
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,140
I am not touched.
Then you're guilt-ridden.

317
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,065
I'm not guilt-ridden.
Then you're pathetic.

318
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,192
Right now, I'm annoyed.

319
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,711
Keeping him up all
night in the seizure lab

320
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,000
is not the way to advance
his recovery. It's too much.

321
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,164
You're right.

322
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,300
You should stick around.
Make sure he doesn't screw up.

323
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,380
<i>Kara, look directly
into the light.</i>

324
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,451
Keep looking.

325
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,890
Thought you'd be
gone for the day.

326
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,862
Thought I'd wait for the
bone marrow biopsy results.

327
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,195
House sent you to baby-sit me, didn't
he? He asked me to wait for the results.

328
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,532
Cameron, it's
fine. Of course it is.

329
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,506
Look, a few weeks ago, you were
upset that I didn't consider you a friend.

330
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,669
Now you're upset that I'm happy?

331
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,245
What can I say?
Apparently, I'm a bitch.

332
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,247
I didn't say that.

333
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,408
It's annoying.

334
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,027
Insisting every day of
your life is a blessing

335
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,418
is basically calling
everyone else shallow.

336
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,183
It gets old. Sorry.

337
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,391
Oh, give it a rest.

338
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,994
How was dinner?

339
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,866
Cuddy did not mention cancer.

340
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,794
She lost her
nerve. It was a date.

341
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,474
What are you doing? PCR test.

342
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,114
You're doing it yourself
in the middle of the night.

343
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,910
On a spoon.

344
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,348
Cuddy's spoon. I'm checking
her saliva for cancer markers.

345
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,917
Yeah. I do that after
all my dates, too.

346
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,999
People think you're the nice one.
Why are you so worried about Cuddy?

347
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,596
You go first. You desperately
want this to be a date.

348
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,800
Because the
alternative is cancer.

349
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,104
Just admit that you like her.

350
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,112
She's smart, funny,
got a zesty bod.

351
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,744
I think it's great you can look
beyond the fact she's the devil.

352
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,217
I stole a spoon. You
stole her garbage.

353
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,548
She's my boss.

354
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,914
If she gets sick, the hospital might
replace her, especially if she dies.

355
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,423
I'd have to learn how to
manipulate someone new.

356
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,422
Whoa.

357
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,523
I think I'm gonna cry.

358
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,993
Find me when
the results come in.

359
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,570
Mr. Mason,

360
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,877
because of the damage done to your
son's kidneys, his potassium is climbing.

361
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,145
That's causing
irregular heartbeats.

362
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:49,220
I'm doubling the meds
and starting him on dialysis.

363
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,984
But unless we get
his potassium down,

364
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,251
he's gonna have a heart attack.

365
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,923
Kara, just another few minutes.

366
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,369
Biopsy's back. She's negative
for myelomatous meningitis.

367
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,664
And she's not seizing.

368
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,168
So, we're wrong and House is
wrong. And you're okay with that?

369
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,975
She's seizing.

370
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,681
She's not doing anything.

371
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:24,117
Her brain activity isn't
accelerating, it's slowing down.

372
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,961
Muscle rigidity, involuntary
grasping and sucking motions.

373
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,193
She's in an
encephalopathic delirium.

374
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,393
Hmm.

375
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,935
A genuine physiological illness.
That rules out a few things.

376
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,064
Like what, I wonder?

377
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,008
Postpartum psychosis
and conversion disorder.

378
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,046
The thing about being a
good loser, you're still a loser.

379
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,205
Ouch.

380
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,825
The delirium means her
brain is shutting down,

381
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,647
reverting to its most
instinctual functions.

382
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,950
And since it's progressing, I think
we can assume it's progressive,

383
00:25:56,021 --> 00:26:00,186
which means it won't be long before
the brain closes shop altogether. Ideas?

384
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:07,697
He's in V-fib. His
potassium's still too high.

385
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,996
No pulse. Get him
off the machine.

386
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,374
Charge to 10. Clear.

387
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,112
Still in V-fib.

388
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,940
Another amp of epi.

389
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,580
Chase shouldn't be
wasting his time in NICU.

390
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,723
Could be Wernicke's.

391
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:38,253
No. Treatment for Wernicke's is thiamine.
We gave her that together with the pheno.

392
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,156
Delirium points to lithium. I
know we didn't' t find any, but...

393
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,498
She'd have to be smuggling
it in to be getting sicker.

394
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:47,062
Whipple's causes encephalopathic
delirium. The test was negative.

395
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,371
The test could have been
wrong. Ideas are not soda cans.

396
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:54,871
Recycling sucks. Give me
something new and shiny.

397
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:59,817
Or go retro. Take an old idea,
shine it up, and add a new symptom.

398
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,016
Encephalopathic delirium.

399
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,621
Pellagra.

400
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,119
She drinks.
Alcoholics get pellagra.

401
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,595
They eat lousy
diets, so no niacin.

402
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,792
He agrees with me. What
a shock. Well, you're right.

403
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,666
Lack of niacin starves the
brain. Neurons shut down.

404
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,672
Causes seizures, encephalopathic
delirium and psychosis.

405
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,970
We give Kara niacin, she'll
come out of her delirium

406
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,509
and she'll be totally sane.

407
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,136
Don't think she's ever
gonna be sane again.

408
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,814
Her son just died.

409
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,479
How do you feel?

410
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,242
Uh...

411
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,484
My stomach kinda hurts.

412
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,351
I need to ask you some
questions, see how you're doing.

413
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,620
Mmm-hmm.

414
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,661
Tell me your name.

415
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,626
Kara Mason. Is my son here?

416
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,869
When were you born?

417
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,496
Please. Where's
Michael? Is he okay?

418
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,735
Do you hear any other
voices besides mine?

419
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,504
No. Answer me.

420
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,742
You've been suffering
from delusions.

421
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,748
They were caused by a
vitamin deficiency, pellagra.

422
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,812
It made you believe
things that were not real.

423
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,588
Like the voices.

424
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,520
I

425
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,861
Remember doing things to Mikey.

426
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,770
Were those real?

427
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,239
I'm afraid so.

428
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,878
So, I...

429
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,947
You tried to suffocate
your son. But...

430
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,125
You... You stopped me.

431
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,189
And

432
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,957
that other doctor, he
got Mikey breathing.

433
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,796
Your son's organs were
damaged too severely.

434
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,274
He passed away this morning.

435
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,643
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

436
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,186
No!

437
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:54,989
Oh, my God! No! Oh, my God!

438
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,161
Pellagra doesn't
cause bloody vomit.

439
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,878
She's still sick
and getting worse.

440
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:08,363
So what causes pellagra
and crimson spew?

441
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,906
Dead baby, while sad, not our problem. I
should have given him more polystyrene.

442
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,814
You killed him. If you don't get
over it, you're gonna kill Mama, too.

443
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:21,183
Her alcoholism caused the pellagra.
Maybe it also explains the vomiting.

444
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,745
Gastritis. Gastritis
meds aren't helping,

445
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,521
which may confirm her
story. She only slipped once.

446
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,219
You remove drinking
from the equation,

447
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,195
internal bleeding, hypercalcemia,
seizure, and pellagra are all back in.

448
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,528
Chase, will you get your
head out of the dead baby's butt

449
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,533
and focus on the barely alive?

450
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,578
How much polystyrene
did you give the kid?

451
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,733
One gram.

452
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,600
His potassium just kept rising.

453
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,761
I need your son.

454
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,827
Who are you?

455
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,571
Your wife's doctor. Your son may
have had the same condition she does.

456
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,631
My son didn't have a
condition. She killed him.

457
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,469
If I biopsy her intestine,
she'll bleed out.

458
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:25,709
He obviously won't. You're not
using my son's body to help her.

459
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,085
Okay. How about
trading him for a beer?

460
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,590
Or maybe you're
more of a whiskey guy.

461
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,261
You didn't have strep or a stomach
bug the morning you came in.

462
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,597
You puked because
you were hung over.

463
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,134
Accuse a recovered drunk of slipping
and most of the time, you'll be right.

464
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,332
So I drink.

465
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,867
You're acting like this is my fault.
People are gonna feel sorry for you,

466
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,189
and they'll tell you that you
can't anticipate the unthinkable.

467
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,273
The fact is, you can.

468
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,042
It's just not all that pleasant.

469
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,261
Look, you don't
know anything about...

470
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,463
I know that people don't get
crazy enough to kill someone

471
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,548
without first being crazy
enough for someone to notice.

472
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:09,286
How many times did you go out
for a drink because she was crying?

473
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,195
How many times
did you stay at work

474
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,722
because you couldn't listen to her
telling you what a bad mother she is?

475
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,269
You were relieved
when she shut down

476
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,796
and just sat staring
for hours at a time.

477
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,942
She held the pillow over his
head. You slept while she went nuts.

478
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,280
Not exactly a draw, but...
What is wrong with you?

479
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,174
What kind of a person
says those things now?

480
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,287
Let me do the test.

481
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,891
It'll be one less thing for
you to feel crappy about.

482
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,232
I got a dead baby
for you to biopsy.

483
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,228
Let Cameron do it.
Love working NICU?

484
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:59,408
I could get you transferred. I told
you. I just wanted to trust patients.

485
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,743
You don't give a
crap about patients.

486
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,013
Your paycheck.

487
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,185
You've been double-dipping.

488
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:15,082
Taking your vacation time here,
while drawing a salary in NICU.

489
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,190
Strange. Rich boy doing
all that for some extra cash.

490
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,603
I'm not rich. But your
dad was. Now he's dead.

491
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,373
If you're not rich, that
means that Daddy cut you out.

492
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:31,938
I'm not rich.

493
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,308
Don't let it change you.

494
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,349
And do the test.

495
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,830
God of compassion, take
Michael into your arms

496
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,839
and welcome him into paradise.

497
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:09,113
Let there be no sorrow,
no weeping, and no pain.

498
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,480
Peace and joy forevermore.

499
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,882
I'm sorry.

500
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,142
It was a date. Cuddy's
negative for all cancer markers.

501
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,348
It was a date.

502
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,092
The baby's intestine
shows slight villous atrophy.

503
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,298
Why would a baby
have flattened villi?

504
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,661
He was being treated
with polystyrene.

505
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,934
Polystyrene
shouldn't... It didn't.

506
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,971
The question is, what do they
use in the NICU to bind it together?

507
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,069
Wheat gluten. It's great stuff.

508
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,508
Unless your body
can't tolerate it.

509
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,947
The baby didn't have
colic? He had celiac disease?

510
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,281
Just like Mom.

511
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,784
Celiac can be triggered
by all kinds of stress.

512
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,055
Bills, childbirth,
drunk husband...

513
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,030
Every time she had a bowl of pasta or
a slice of bread or a slosh of soy sauce,

514
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,431
her small intestine
became more damaged,

515
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,732
less able to absorb the vitamins
and minerals into her bloodstream.

516
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,796
Her body couldn't absorb
enough niacin, caused the pellagra.

517
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,172
Couldn't absorb vitamin
K, caused the bleeding.

518
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,269
And celiac is why the
baby's meds didn't work.

519
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,509
His body just
couldn't absorb them.

520
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,654
Switch Mom to IV
nutrition. It's gluten-free.

521
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:57,613
That'll spruce
her villi right up.

522
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:02,184
No. Celiac causes nutritional deprivation.
Our patient has excess calcium.

523
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,027
Tell them what causes excess
calcium with a chaser of bloody vomit.

524
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,827
Celiac patients are susceptible
to cancer of the stomach lining.

525
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:16,199
She has MALT lymphoma.
Well, she's your patient, now.

526
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,768
And it wasn't a date.

527
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,820
You don't have cancer.
You don't have dwarfism.

528
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,521
You have no proof of that. I,
on the other hand, have this.

529
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,433
You ran a PCR on me
without my consent?

530
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,593
Hey, it's good news. Really?

531
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,072
It's just hard to access because of this
overwhelming sense of personal violation.

532
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,966
Deal with it on your own time.

533
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,301
Bad news.

534
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,342
Estrogen is too high.

535
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,315
No matter how many
people you tell otherwise,

536
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,842
I am and always have been
a woman. Estrogen is normal.

537
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,152
Not this much. Not for,
at least, another week.

538
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,653
That's when you ovulate.

539
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,820
You monitor my periods

540
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,162
based on when I get bitchy or...

541
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:20,972
Once a month, when you leave the
kids' cancer ward, your eyes glisten.

542
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,240
And about three days later,
you break your ban on sugar

543
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:28,644
and chow down a bucket of frozen yogurt
in the cafeteria. Sprinkles included.

544
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,780
Based on the last yogurt sighting,
you've got another week before you ovulate.

545
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,617
You're on fertility meds.

546
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,817
With red clover as
an herbal booster.

547
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,597
And the dinner with
Wilson was an audition.

548
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,066
It's too bad he didn't land the
gig. He would have had fun.

549
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:56,104
I was considering a
donation. Not a party.

550
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,110
So when's our dinner?

551
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,445
Oh, he's gonna be
so disappointed. Right.

552
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,450
You two are gonna
have a lot of fun with this.

553
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,387
Your patient won't
let me touch her.

554
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,033
I killed my son.

555
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,399
Is it my turn to say
something obvious now?

556
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,675
Oh, I know. You were insane.

557
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,147
I did it. I chose to do it.

558
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:40,208
Yeah. Like diabetics
choose to not produce insulin.

559
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,888
Listen. Someone got
sick. Someone died.

560
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,183
It happens every day.

561
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,497
The only difference in this case
is, it wasn't the same someone.

562
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,089
I could have stopped.

563
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,968
I didn't have to
listen to those voices.

564
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,796
Spoken like a true sane person.

565
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,602
This is not your fault.

566
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,178
You're healthy now.

567
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,039
Except for the cancer.

568
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,208
Those voices felt as real to me

569
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,179
as Michael's hand

570
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,486
right here, when he nursed,

571
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,286
and the smell of his hair.

572
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:33,432
You do not deserve to die.

573
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,900
Maybe.

574
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,407
I don't want to live.

575
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,954
She said no.

576
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,349
So we get her declared
unstable, appoint a medical proxy...

577
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,529
She was unstable. Now, she's sane.
She's entitled to refuse the treatment.

578
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,647
You have to change her
mind. You can't just walk away.

579
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,732
Fine! Go on in there and tell
her that every day is a blessing.

580
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,972
"So you killed your baby? Shake it off.
Think positive. At least you're alive."

581
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,307
Hmm.

582
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,845
Kinda hard to sell when
you don't believe it, huh?

583
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,181
And you never believed it.

584
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,812
You just wanted all that crap you
went through to mean something.

585
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:27,121
Well, it didn't mean anything.
It never does. Welcome back.

586
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,323
Why are you doing
this to me? I was happy.

587
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,494
You were aspiring to be content.

588
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,559
Don't give me a semantic argument. I
was content with the way things were.

589
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,161
That's what happiness is. Yeah.

590
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,766
If we were all just satisfied with what
we had, what a beautiful world it would be.

591
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,937
We'd all slowly starve to death in our
own filth, but at least we'd be happy.

592
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,880
Listen. I need your
self-worth to hang on this job.

593
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,045
Kicking ass here to be all that
lets you rise above miserable.

594
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,145
If waking up in the morning
is enough, I don't need you.

595
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,746
I can live with that.

596
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,260
No, you can't. Not anymore.

597
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,483
If you got treatment,
then maybe we could...

598
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,272
When you see Mikey,

599
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,171
tell him his dad
says he's sorry.

600
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:08,685
Hi.

601
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,888
Night. Night.

602
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,601
Did you tell Cuddy we
tested her for cancer?

603
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,331
Yeah. And?

604
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,638
It wasn't a date.

605
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:29,179
Turned out she had some skin lesions.
Guess there was no genetic predisposition.

606
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,279
You TiVo <i>The L Word?</i>
