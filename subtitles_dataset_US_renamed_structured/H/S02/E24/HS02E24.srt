1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,777
He's got a temperature of 103.

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,608
And why do we care?

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,581
Because we're human
beings. It's what we do.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,114
He said he was at
a luncheon meeting.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,585
You took his history?

6
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,815
The guy looks like Harpo.
You should see him.

7
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,984
You asked him what book
he's currently reading?

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,391
It's hilarious to
watch him try and talk.

9
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,487
I asked him anything
I could think of.

10
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,862
Favorite color. "Blwoo."

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,067
Favorite dessert topping?

12
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:41,709
Trust me. You never know what fact
may prove the key to saving your life.

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,310
Whipped cream.

14
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,942
I asked him if he was
sure. Where are you going?

15
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,449
You're an ass.

16
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,041
I know. Where are you going?

17
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,452
This is either a toxin, an
infection or an allergic reaction.

18
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,922
I assume you gave him
epi, so that rules out allergies.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,255
Put him on antibiotics
in case it's an infection,

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,659
and if it's a toxin, we'll
keep him here overnight,

21
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,594
let the swelling go
down, send him home.

22
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,633
I'm going to the movies.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,560
Which one of you is House?

24
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,601
Skinny brunette.

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,840
No, that's Dr. Cameron.

26
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,273
I'm skinny. How do
you know her name?

27
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,040
I was a patient of yours.

28
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,674
Oh, well, if you wanna leave
the chocolates downstairs...

29
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,479
Stay! Stay away from him.

30
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,863
Shocking, isn't it?

31
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,732
Who'd want to hurt you?

32
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,216
You're pathetic.

33
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:46,194
Judging by the growth, I'd say
I've been unconscious for two days.

34
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,444
You been sitting
there the whole time?

35
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,561
No.

36
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,232
Judging by the oily buildup in
your hair, I'd say you're lying.

37
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,798
I was scared.
Pardon me for caring.

38
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,212
Did I lose any organs?

39
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,879
The bullet to your abdomen pierced
your stomach, nicked the bowel,

40
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,644
lodged in the posterior rib.

41
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,313
I always say if you're gonna
get shot, do it in a hospital.

42
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,821
The one in your neck...

43
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,929
I don't remember that one.

44
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,221
Went right through,
severed your jugular.

45
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,503
The shooter turns
out to be a guy...

46
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,527
Don't care.

47
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,265
You don't care why a guy walked
into a hospital and shot a doctor?

48
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,391
Shot you?

49
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,402
I assume his
reasoning was faulty.

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,896
So what was it? Infection?

51
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,998
The surgery went fine.
You've had no post-op...

52
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,806
Not me. The patient. Harpo.

53
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,870
You just got shot,
House. You should rest.

54
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,473
I got shot.
Diagnostically boring.

55
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,248
Big fat tongue, on the other
hand, endlessly entertaining.

56
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,456
We biopsied his tongue.

57
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,352
And it was negative.

58
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,761
And the blood
tests were negative.

59
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,422
I didn't say we did blood tests.

60
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,989
You don't biopsy a tongue
unless you have to biopsy a tongue.

61
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,594
And you don't have to biopsy a tongue
unless you've already come up with nothing

62
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,903
on a routine battery of tests which
don't involve torturing the patient.

63
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,036
Any new symptoms other than
the increased intracranial pressure?

64
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,577
Any guesses on how
I figured that one out?

65
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,810
You knew the next step
would be a lumbar puncture.

66
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,823
A lumbar puncture would almost
certainly give us a definitive answer.

67
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,792
Since we don't have a definitive
answer, we must not have done an LP.

68
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,594
And the most common reason to not do
an LP is increased intracranial pressure.

69
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,893
He was shot by
security trying to...

70
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,871
House, what are you...

71
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,570
House.

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm talking to Cuddy.

73
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,877
Lie down. You've
gotta be in pain.

74
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,977
Not today. Today
I'm on morphine.

75
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,878
You're gonna rip
your stitches out.

76
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,250
Check Harpo's trash.

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,879
Forget about the patient.

78
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,447
Come on, you're curious.

79
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,919
Trash?

80
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,462
You don't know what I'm talking
about, but you know it's good.

81
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,997
You can't just be
walking around.

82
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,063
Well, then stop me.

83
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,996
You've lost blood.
Physically stop me.

84
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,728
You could damage... You can't.

85
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,713
Because that would involve
physically touching me.

86
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,730
And then things would
get so sexually charged...

87
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,346
I'm twice your size.
Get your hands off me.

88
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,578
Everything that lives, eats.
And everything that eats, poops.

89
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,420
That's why every organ has a
sanitation department, the lymph system.

90
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,517
Whatever's doing the damage
is dumping its waste in there.

91
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,892
That's what you meant by trash.

92
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,490
Biopsy the lymph
node under the jaw.

93
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,875
I'm sorry, I know it's crazy,
but there's no other place.

94
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,540
It's the ICU. It stands for Intensive
Care. He needs intensive care. So do you.

95
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,082
He needs to be shot again.

96
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,176
He is handcuffed to his bed. He is
sedated. He's not going to hurt you.

97
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,654
If your security was any good, I
wouldn't have been shot in the first place.

98
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,521
He is where he's supposed to
be, where you're supposed to be.

99
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,685
Who did my surgery?

100
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,771
Gillick. Why? Are you
gonna send him a fruit basket?

101
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:02,990
He screwed up.

102
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:06,056
It's annoying enough
dealing with your Vicodin habit.

103
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,657
Quit upping your morphine.

104
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,734
I'm not.

105
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,332
I'm reducing it.

106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,975
And you're not in pain?

107
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,942
I'm feeling better.

108
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,572
Gillick is very good.
Your recovery time...

109
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,482
This stomach kills me,
my neck is throbbing.

110
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,520
My leg feels better.

111
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,722
That's amazing.

112
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,814
It's unbelievable.

113
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,987
Since getting shot is not an
FDA-approved treatment for anything,

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,792
it means something must've
gone wrong in the surgery.

115
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,663
Yes, terribly, tragically wrong.

116
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,830
Enjoy the mistake.

117
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,396
He must have nicked something
in my peripheral nervous system.

118
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,443
If it's alleviating pain, who
knows what else it's doing?

119
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,570
Get back to the ICU before
you rip out your stitches,

120
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,172
and I have to chain
you to your bed.

121
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,464
Why did you try to kill me?

122
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,272
I didn't.

123
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,405
Then the gun thing might
have been a mistake.

124
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,175
If I'd have killed you, it
would have been over.

125
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,081
I needed you to live,

126
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,083
'cause I want to see you suffer.

127
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,144
Get the needle out of there.

128
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,549
He can't breathe.

129
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,959
House.

130
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,401
The test was negative.

131
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,099
Are you sure you
want to be doing this?

132
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,868
I'm fine, I think.

133
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,674
Cameron, have
you got my records?

134
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,008
They don't like to release
patient's operative notes.

135
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,309
Yet you're holding them.

136
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,849
And whispering.

137
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:36,915
He's sleeping.

138
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,754
Yeah, killer needs his rest.

139
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,188
Otherwise, he's grumpy all day.

140
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,089
Hey, wake up!

141
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,184
Watch me save a life.

142
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,492
Almost for sure it's
some sort of infection.

143
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,283
We've got him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

144
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,994
but it's not even
slowing the thing down.

145
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,502
Unless we figure out what
type of infection, we can't treat.

146
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,698
And we can't figure out what
type because we can't do an LP.

147
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,071
Do an LP.

148
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,710
See what I did there? Couldn't
have done that if you'd killed me.

149
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,043
We would have done an LP
two days ago if we could have,

150
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,891
but that much pressure,
something's bound to go...

151
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,259
We would've done
an LP two days ago

152
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,878
if the risks hadn't so obviously
outweighed the benefits.

153
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,650
We just cut a hole in his throat.
The equation has changed.

154
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,817
Couldn't have
put it better myself.

155
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:31,804
Pressure is 120 milliliters,

156
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,810
H2O, with small, visible excursions
related to respiration and pulse.

157
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,572
Well within normal, that's good.

158
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,772
No. That's weird.

159
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,884
You wanna hear a story?

160
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,750
I have a rule.

161
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,426
People who shoot
me forfeit the right...

162
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,497
My wife was sick.

163
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,433
None of the doctors
could figure out why.

164
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,562
Oh, I know this story.

165
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,138
She died.

166
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,968
So you selected one
of her doctors to kill,

167
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,377
because that would make
everything right again.

168
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,745
No, she lived. You cured her.

169
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,884
I'm truly sorry I did that.

170
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,856
In the course of
investigating her illness,

171
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,121
you convinced me that
everything was relevant.

172
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,460
You needed the truth.

173
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,666
I confessed to you
that I'd had an affair.

174
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,841
But it turns out that it had nothing
to do with why she was sick.

175
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,870
Genetic predisposition
to brain aneurysms.

176
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,244
You told her that.

177
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,988
You also told her
about my affair.

178
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,854
And you caught
crap, she left you,

179
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,985
and now I've got to pay

180
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,792
because you couldn't keep
your little killer in your pants.

181
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,096
She killed herself.

182
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,327
What sort of a hospital
has glass walls?

183
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,326
That's my husband.

184
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,795
Really?

185
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,137
You thought I just liked watching
people get needles poked in the back?

186
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,369
No.

187
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,176
I figured a co-worker
or a sister, not wife.

188
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,407
Why?

189
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,711
Don't worry, it's not
insulting. At least not to you.

190
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,156
You're satisfied by that answer?

191
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,751
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

192
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,455
You're not going to
shoot me, are you?

193
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,691
You treated a friend of mine.

194
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,495
She told me you only talk
to people if you have to.

195
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,629
And then you insult them, while
showing off how insightful you are.

196
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:23,703
Sevens marry sevens, nines
marry nines, fours marry fours.

197
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,810
Maybe there's some wiggle room

198
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,076
if there's enough money
or somebody got pregnant.

199
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,786
But you've got at least
three points on your husband,

200
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,879
and your frock says you
didn't do it for the money,

201
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,515
and your breasts say that
you haven't had any kids.

202
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,618
So you figure my marriage
is a mathematical error?

203
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,356
Numbers don't lie.

204
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:47,367
We're having trouble finding out
what infection your husband has,

205
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,028
and the most likely
culprit is an STD.

206
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,507
You want to know if I've had an affair
with someone closer to my integer,

207
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,806
and I have to tell you the
truth or my husband will die.

208
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,106
Is your friend single?

209
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,178
No.

210
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,414
And I've always been faithful.

211
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,822
I would've bet money
something would go wrong.

212
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,790
Let's rotate him back.

213
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,888
He's bleeding
into his ocular orbit.

214
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,727
LP wouldn't do this.

215
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,735
Lots of pressure
behind. Gotta relieve it.

216
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,772
What's going on?
What are they doing?

217
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,213
I should go.

218
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,980
I seem to have torn my stitches.

219
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,897
You collapsed in the
hall, tore your stitches.

220
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,803
I remember. I was there.

221
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,570
How's your gut? It's hurting?

222
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,805
You shoot the guy
who sold her the gun?

223
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,747
She locked herself in the
garage, and she started the car.

224
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,453
You shoot the guy who sold
her the garage-door opener?

225
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,116
You're an ass.

226
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,284
Now that is a bold position
to take given that I shot you.

227
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,225
The shooting just
makes you an idiot.

228
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,210
You're an ass because
you're trying to wrap

229
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:25,129
it in the flag, like
you did a good thing.

230
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,598
You're an ass and a hypocrite.

231
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,295
You don't believe in rules. You
do whatever you think is right.

232
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,838
That's all I did. You
were my role model.

233
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,339
Watch out, you're
getting crumbs on the flag.

234
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,343
I didn't commit to honor her. I
didn't commit to never lie to her.

235
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,346
If you'd kept your mouth shut, she'd
be alive, and you wouldn't be shot.

236
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,314
If you'd kept your
pistols in your pants...

237
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,874
It's my fault she's dead!

238
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,084
I know it.

239
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,719
But why can't you admit that it's
maybe just a little bit yours, too?

240
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,296
That maybe it's not just medical
mistakes that screw things up.

241
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,499
Here's how life works.

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,928
You either get to ask for an
apology, or you get to shoot people.

243
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,267
Not both.

244
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,083
Infections don't make
your eyes pop out.

245
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,456
We should get back. You're
supposed be chained to your bed.

246
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,110
I'm not done eating. Got to be
some sort of bleeding disorder.

247
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,951
This is really stupid.

248
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:26,855
If my stitches pop out again, I
got three doctors to save me.

249
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,053
Could be some sort of weakness
in the lining of the ocular veins.

250
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,133
Okay, I'll be you guys.

251
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,495
No way, mate, too much
blood to just be a vein.

252
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,435
No way, Hizzy, if it was an
artery, he'd still be bleeding.

253
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,476
Actually, he'd be dead.

254
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,909
He could've had a granuloma
in his sinuses that bled,

255
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,539
which could've been
caused by Wegener's.

256
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,741
You'd think the surgeon
would've noticed a giant growth

257
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,445
while he was sticking
the eyeball back in.

258
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,453
Tongue and eyes are
sick, what about the nose?

259
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,386
It's right in between
them. Why isn't it sick?

260
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,550
So it's not spreading.
It's got a common source.

261
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,183
Which can only be what?

262
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,387
The brain, except
the CT was clean.

263
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,363
Check the brain's trash.
See what it's hiding.

264
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,921
The brain doesn't
have a lymph system.

265
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,830
I know. All its
garbage just blows off,

266
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,335
gets caught in the snow
fence by the side of the road.

267
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,339
You're referring to
the blood-brain barrier.

268
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,299
What else? Biopsy the barrier.

269
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,174
Wouldn't it be safer to make
a few educated guesses first?

270
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,237
Try some relatively
safe treatments?

271
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,614
Biopsy the barrier. But first, start him
on Mebendazole in case it's a worm.

272
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:28,212
And Levofloxacin in case it's an infection
that slipped by the first antibiotic.

273
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,654
And Azithromycin for STDs.

274
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,861
I really don't think the wife is
the kind to be messing around.

275
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,208
If I was married
to her, I certainly...

276
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,791
House.

277
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,735
The patient isn't
married. He's a widower.

278
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:50,501
Really, it's more helpful if you
do the prescribed rehab yourself.

279
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,305
My body is fine.

280
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,347
My mind, on the other hand...

281
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,042
Maybe she was a girlfriend.

282
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,244
Or maybe she was just
trying to jerk you around.

283
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,514
I spoke to every one of
the nurses on that floor.

284
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,987
The patient only
had six visitors,

285
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,524
two females, no babes.
His mother and his aunt.

286
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,753
So they missed someone.
They're not security.

287
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:11,161
My posse never saw her or me
talking on the other side of the glass.

288
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,563
They were a little busy
trying to save the guy's life.

289
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,228
There's only one
possible conclusion.

290
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,370
It was a hallucination.

291
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,767
What does that look
like to you? Point six?

292
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,866
Anesthesia?

293
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:27,380
No. It's got to be six
smudge. Let's say you're right.

294
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,939
It wouldn't be that uncommon after
a trauma, after that much blood loss.

295
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:34,476
If my perceptions are compromised,
then my judgment is compromised.

296
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,719
What if his wife told me that the patient
just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leper?

297
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,692
So pull yourself off the case.

298
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,887
And the next case?

299
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,987
You take two weeks, you recover.

300
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,063
What if I don't?

301
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,566
What if it wasn't the shooting?

302
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,727
The guy who sees
connections between everything

303
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,931
sees no connection between being
shot and minor brain disruptions?

304
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,234
What if it was the surgery?

305
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:59,177
What if it was the fact that you tore out
your stitches and lost two pints of blood?

306
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,782
Why did Gillick give me
Ketamine during my surgery?

307
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,151
Working.

308
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,221
We need to talk.

309
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,752
Get back to the ICU.
Who uncuffed you?

310
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,557
Why would a surgeon
administer Ketamine?

311
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,461
Who showed you
your surgical file?

312
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,692
How do you know it's mine?

313
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,167
Because your patient hasn't had surgery,
and you don't care about anybody else.

314
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,535
My anesthesia was almost
nonexistent, and yet I wasn't awake.

315
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,872
For some reason, somebody
decided to put me in a dissociative coma

316
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,672
instead of just putting me out.

317
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,337
There are plenty
of reasons to use...

318
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,349
Fine. I'll go beat the truth out
of my surgeon. Gillick, right?

319
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,623
It worked.

320
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,495
There's a clinic in Germany.
They've been treating chronic pain

321
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:58,231
by inducing comas and letting
the mind basically reboot itself.

322
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,172
There's about a 50% chance
your pain will come back,

323
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,938
which of course means there
is a 50% chance that it won't.

324
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,671
You had no right.

325
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,772
To heal you?

326
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,147
You messed with my brain.

327
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,810
Why are you so upset?

328
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,715
Are you experiencing any
neurological symptoms?

329
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,452
Dizziness, tremors,
hallucinations?

330
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,525
No.

331
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,387
It's a point of principle.

332
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,564
Test was negative.

333
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,968
No trash against the fence.

334
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,348
Is your leg really better?

335
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,398
Don't worry, I'm sure
something else is wrong.

336
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,170
We did find blood.

337
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,436
On which side? The wrong side.

338
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,741
First thing that makes sense.

339
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,214
The wrong side's the wrong
side. It can't make sense.

340
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,081
It'd mess with his brain,
wouldn't cause fever.

341
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,848
He's been sleeping a lot lately.

342
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
You worried?

343
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,586
I marked a change
of meds on his chart.

344
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:57,219
Foreign object, body wants to
get rid of it, that causes the fever.

345
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,525
Blood's a foreign object?

346
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,122
In the brain lining it is.

347
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,394
Blood dyscrasia means cancer.

348
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,491
Find it.

349
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,469
All the tests...
Have been negative.

350
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,439
What do you do if
your trashcans are full?

351
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,200
You use your
neighbor's trashcans.

352
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,246
Except it's still light outside,
your neighbor will see you.

353
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:17,215
So you go out the back way into an alley
and drop off your trash by their garage.

354
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,344
We'll check the lymphatic
system in the chest.

355
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,684
You got that from
trash cans in the alley?

356
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,417
The saliva glands
from the tongue

357
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,789
are connected to the
lymphatic system in the lungs.

358
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,385
It's the next
lymphatic system over.

359
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,090
Yeah.

360
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,494
Go get lung lymph.

361
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,771
How did he know that?

362
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,277
I wouldn't have hired
him if he wasn't smart.

363
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,508
Right.

364
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,119
'Cause you have nothing
but respect for him.

365
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,250
Maybe he knew the
answer because the question

366
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,457
wasn't nearly as
tricky as you thought.

367
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,898
Maybe he's not getting smarter,

368
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,636
you're getting dumber.

369
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,927
You pretend to buck the
system, pretend to be a rebel.

370
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,298
You claim to hate rules.

371
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:44,167
But all you do is substitute
your own rules for society's.

372
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,473
And it's a nice simple rule,

373
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,336
tell the blunt, honest truth

374
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,476
in the starkest, darkest way.

375
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,508
And what will be, will be.

376
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,419
What will be, should be.

377
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:06,515
And everyone else is a coward.

378
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,491
But you're wrong.

379
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,259
It's not cowardly to not
call someone an idiot.

380
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,696
People aren't tactful or
polite just because it's nice.

381
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,467
They do it because they
got an ounce of humility.

382
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:33,010
Because they know that
they will make mistakes,

383
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,821
and they know that their
actions have consequences,

384
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:42,121
and they know that those
consequences are their fault.

385
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,598
Why do you want so bad
not to be human, House?

386
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,880
No, he's awake.

387
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,710
House, we need to talk to you.

388
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,719
How the hell did you
know I was awake?

389
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,778
Your nostrils flare
when you sleep.

390
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,448
No, they do not.

391
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,523
Fine. I'm lying.

392
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,658
Test was negative. You knew?

393
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,220
Force of habit.
Showed no cancer.

394
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,959
No reason why he's
got a fever of 103,

395
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,843
and no reason why his
tongue won't fit in his mouth.

396
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,029
He's post-op. Chase is
getting him up and around.

397
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,301
It's important that you're
up ASAP after surgery.

398
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,599
You think you can urinate?

399
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,647
It's getting bigger!

400
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,888
Are you getting aroused?

401
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,948
No! Not that part!

402
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,153
Oh, God, it hurts!

403
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,756
It's not stopping!

404
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,663
Surgeons found no
evidence of a burst artery.

405
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,833
The blood had to come from
somewhere, you took a shower in it.

406
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,508
Trauma?

407
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,443
Do you think someone snuck in
here just to kick him in the jewels

408
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,981
and poke out his eye
and swell up his tongue?

409
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,175
Keep riding.

410
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,686
I got a bet with my physio that
I can do 100 klicks by Friday.

411
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,187
What about blood
from the kidneys?

412
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,423
Kidneys drain into the bladder,
which drains into the ureter.

413
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,986
There's no way it would
mess with the scrotum.

414
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, basic human anatomy.

415
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:32,068
Therefore, I think it's safe to assume
that the problem lies elsewhere.

416
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,971
But given that this case doesn't
make any kind of sense whatsoever,

417
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,906
maybe we should even
question the basics.

418
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,410
Maybe he's not human?

419
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,811
An anatomical defect would seem more
likely, but let's not rule that one out.

420
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,044
Even more likely, he is human, his
anatomy is where it's supposed to be,

421
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,313
but he has testicular cancer.

422
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,854
We tested for cancer.

423
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,498
We tested the lymph
system in his chest.

424
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,733
Surgeons found no growths.

425
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,277
Surgeon was trying to put
everything back where it was.

426
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,658
They weren't doing an inventory.

427
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:59,859
May have been lucky. You don't
catch testicular cancer early, it kills.

428
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,298
Probably eroded some vessel.

429
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,460
Yeah, yeah, I know.

430
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,332
The question is
why I didn't think of it.

431
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:07,396
Well, eyes popping out is
a rather odd presentation.

432
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,942
Sack blowing up,
on the other hand...

433
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,309
If you could think of everything yourself,
you wouldn't need a team to annoy.

434
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,211
I screwed up some basic anatomy,

435
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,581
and I missed connecting a testicular
explosion with a testicular problem.

436
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,851
You think there's any way I would've done
that before Cuddy messed with my brain?

437
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,857
She was trying to
help you, and it worked.

438
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,087
Yeah, I can run like the
wind, but I can't think.

439
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,225
And seeing as how I'm too old
to become a professional athlete,

440
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,289
it looks to me as if she
screwed me over big time.

441
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,735
You don't want a healthy leg.

442
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,966
Oh, here we go.

443
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,272
If you've got a good life, if you're
healthy, you've got no reason to bitch.

444
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,641
No reason to hate life.

445
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,788
Well, here's the flaw
in your argument.

446
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:49,179
If I enjoy hating life, I
don't hate life, I enjoy it.

447
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,444
I didn't say it was rational.

448
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,013
HIV testing is 99% accurate,

449
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:58,285
which means there are
some people who test positive,

450
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,054
who live with their own impending
doom for months or years

451
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,754
before finding out
everything's okay.

452
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:06,788
Weirdly, most of them don't react
with happiness, or even anger.

453
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,825
They get depressed.

454
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,199
Not because they wanted to die,

455
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,829
but because they've defined
themselves by their disease.

456
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,670
Suddenly what made
them them, isn't real.

457
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,903
I don't define myself by my leg.

458
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,276
No. You have taken
it one step further.

459
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,977
The only way you could come
to terms with your disability

460
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,918
was to somehow
make it mean nothing.

461
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,189
So you had to
redefine everything.

462
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,860
You have dismissed
anything physical,

463
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,954
anything not coldly,
calculatingly intellectual.

464
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,126
Why are you protecting her?

465
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,007
Because she's
done nothing wrong.

466
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,802
You're completely comfortable
with what she did to me?

467
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,541
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

468
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,082
You agonize over moral choices.

469
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,051
You're not completely
comfortable with anything

470
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,184
until you've taken days to get your
head around every possible side.

471
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,361
I've known what
she did for six hours.

472
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,228
How come you're acting
like you've known for days?

473
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,194
What do I have?

474
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,100
You're not sick. What do I have?

475
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,297
You need to calm down!

476
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,862
I have my brain! That's it!

477
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,373
We were trying to help you.

478
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,343
Yeah, nobody tries to
screw up, they just do.

479
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,107
You were out of control.
You were shooting morphine.

480
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,978
I can make people better.

481
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,415
And you two decide to
trade that for jogging shoes!

482
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,215
If you're suffering from
side-effects, then we can look at that.

483
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,949
You value the physical so much.

484
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,924
Let me put this in terms
you can understand.

485
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,494
You're unbelievable.

486
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:49,000
Even when you're out of
your mind with anger and fear,

487
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,559
you still couch it
in logical terms.

488
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,798
Are you hallucinating?

489
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,871
Yeah, I'm hallucinating.

490
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,736
No, I mean right now.

491
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,503
<i>Are you hallucinating?</i>

492
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,113
How did you know I was...

493
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,082
You were yelling at me.

494
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,376
You were calling me Wilson.

495
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,451
No.

496
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,456
You're losing it, House.

497
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,025
I never call Wilson by his name.

498
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,286
Yeah, right.

499
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,124
Now the hallucinator is going to
tell the hallucinatee what happened.

500
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,495
You're not the hallucinatee.
Wilson was the hallucinatee.

501
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,932
You think maybe you're
focusing on the wrong thing here?

502
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,960
Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.
The bathroom was the hallucinatee.

503
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,836
Bathroom. It figures.

504
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,532
What figures?

505
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,873
You wet your bed.

506
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,543
Damn it.

507
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,117
Test was negative.

508
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,209
No.

509
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,313
AFP and beta HCG
say no testicular cancer.

510
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,086
So, let's recap. We've
just ruled out everything,

511
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,252
which doesn't make sense.

512
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,819
So the answer has to be
something that doesn't make sense.

513
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,525
Do a cystoscopy.
Make sure he's human.

514
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,094
The test was negative.

515
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,534
For him being human?

516
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,663
Everything was right
where it's supposed to be.

517
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,449
All the tubes go where
they're supposed to go.

518
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:05,035
Most likely scenario, some
kind of bacterial prostatitis.

519
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,922
Did you find out if
his father hunched?

520
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,424
His father have trouble peeing?

521
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,460
His father have sex
with his own mother?

522
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,899
If the answers to any of those
questions is yes, assume you're right.

523
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,699
If the answers are no,
assume you're right,

524
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,967
but biopsy some prostate
lymphs just to be sure.

525
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,101
But then we'd have to
cut through his stomach,

526
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,340
and since he's clearly got a
bleeding problem, this kind of surgery...

527
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,814
He doesn't clearly
have anything.

528
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,184
How did I get here?

529
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,782
What are you talking about?

530
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,319
I was in the ICU,

531
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:59,520
and then I was coming down
these stairs with you guys.

532
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,224
What happened in between?

533
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,138
I don't remember how I got here.

534
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,079
I'm taking myself off my case.

535
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,182
Your patient is in critical care.
He's had a fever unabated for two...

536
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,988
I think I'm losing my mind.

537
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,360
I'm having blackouts.

538
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,194
You said you
weren't having any...

539
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,324
I lied.

540
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,528
If you are doing this to scare
me, you made your point.

541
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,664
Next time you get shot, I promise
to only treat the bullet wounds.

542
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,469
I'm off the case.

543
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,943
Why did you jump
up when I came in?

544
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,953
I thought you were
going to attack me again.

545
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,954
Again?

546
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,614
Yeah, you were in my face.

547
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,517
You were... No, I wasn't.

548
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,757
You came in here
with Wilson and...

549
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,024
That was a hallucination.

550
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,121
No, you...

551
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,598
Which means this
is a hallucination.

552
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,885
How can I tell what's
real and what's not?

553
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,817
Everything looks the
same, sounds the same,

554
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,821
tastes the same.

555
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,169
Seems like I'd be the last
person you'd want to ask.

556
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,499
Why not?

557
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,968
You're obviously not
here. I'm obviously not here.

558
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,569
Which means this is a creation of my mind,
which means I'm really just asking myself.

559
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,241
If you're talking to yourself, that's
a lot of unnecessary explanation.

560
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,443
Hey, I'm trying
to work this out.

561
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,682
That requires give and
take, even in my own mind.

562
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,316
What was the question?

563
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,518
How can I tell what's real?

564
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,484
Does it matter?

565
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,095
That doesn't sound
like something I'd ask.

566
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,067
All right. Your concern is
that if you act in the real world

567
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,935
based on information that's not real,
the results are impossible to foresee.

568
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,132
With you so far.

569
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,643
But information is incapable
of harm in and of itself.

570
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:29,079
Ideas are neither good nor bad but
merely as useful as what we do with them.

571
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,981
Only actions can cause harm.

572
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,120
That sounds like me.

573
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:39,284
So you do nothing. You
refrain from taking any actions.

574
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,854
You continue to throw out
your ideas as you always would,

575
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:48,424
but if they're based on faulty
assumptions, your team will point that out.

576
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,703
They won't do anything
that could hurt him.

577
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,436
So I trust my team?

578
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:58,876
Test was negative.

579
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,105
No blood in the prostate.

580
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,544
No structural abnormalities.

581
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:05,015
If something doesn't make
sense, what does that mean?

582
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,318
It's not rhetorical.

583
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:12,482
I need your input on everything I ask,
no matter how obvious it might seem.

584
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,651
It means you're wrong.

585
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,695
It means one of your
assumptions is wrong.

586
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,162
Because if something doesn't
make sense, it can't be real.

587
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,426
So what are our assumptions?

588
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,900
We don't have any. We're
just guessing and testing.

589
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,368
We assume the tests are right.

590
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,302
We've already
re-done them. Twice.

591
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,532
Let's go more basic.

592
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,700
What's more basic
than the test results?

593
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,606
The tests themselves.

594
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,712
What does a biopsy consist of?

595
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,872
You take a sample.

596
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,210
Define sample.

597
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:41,245
It's a small representative piece of
whatever you think is the problem.

598
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,584
You go down to the
shore, you fill a cup of water.

599
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,386
It's got no fish in it. Does
that mean no fish in the ocean?

600
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,790
We can do another biopsy.

601
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,555
We could fill
another cup of water.

602
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,939
But we gotta dive in. We got
to see what's actually in there.

603
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,763
We can't operate, he's
got a bleeding problem.

604
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,528
We assume he's got
a bleeding problem.

605
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,297
Yeah, because he bled from
where he wasn't supposed to bleed,

606
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,271
causing parts of
his body to blow up.

607
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:05,140
Assuming that crazy assumption is correct,
if we operate on him, we'll kill him.

608
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,578
What if we could find
a way to do this surgery

609
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,417
without giving him
more than a paper cut?

610
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,447
You want to let a
robot operate on me?

611
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,548
The technology is amazing.

612
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,458
It magnifies everything 10
times. It's 10 times the accuracy.

613
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,860
No way. I want a person.

614
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,140
A person would be controlling...

615
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,632
People suck.

616
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,369
People have turned you from
a guy with a swollen tongue

617
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,463
into a guy with one eye, one
ball, and a stapled-on face.

618
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,976
If you want someone to hold you
while you cry yourself to sleep at night,

619
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,841
choose warm and soft.

620
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,712
You want someone to write you
a poem, pick the sensitive loner.

621
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,860
If all you care about is
that something's done right,

622
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,164
pick the guy with
the metal head.

623
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,517
No way. No way, no way.

624
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,649
You gotta see this thing in action
before you say no way. Come on.

625
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,784
House, what are you doing?

626
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,824
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

627
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,790
Just throwing out ideas.

628
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,097
I think that you should put him in a
wheelchair and take him down to the OR.

629
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,899
But I may be out of my mind.

630
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,006
Relax, Cameron.

631
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,585
I'm not going to cut you.

632
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,485
I just wanna show
what this puppy can do.

633
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,149
It can make
one-millimeter incisions.

634
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,952
You don't know
how small that is?

635
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,052
It's small even in metric.

636
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:34,188
If I do something that doesn't
make sense, even to you,

637
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,329
stop me.

638
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,469
Delicate, no?

639
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,808
House.

640
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,106
Does that hurt?

641
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,589
Seen enough.

642
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,383
No.

643
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,288
That wasn't a question.

644
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,627
You either do this, or you die.

645
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,862
You've wasted your life.

646
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,937
Yeah.

647
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:53,043
If only I'd spent more time dedicating
myself to finding someone worthy to shoot.

648
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,007
If I had killed you,
would it have mattered?

649
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,277
Not to me. Have you got a pen?

650
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,181
You don't care
if you live or die?

651
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,710
I care because I live.
I can't care if I'm dead.

652
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,716
I don't want to hear semantics.

653
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,817
You anti-semantic bastard.

654
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,723
Would anybody care
that the world lost that wit?

655
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,992
Working here.

656
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,466
That's all right. You
don't have to say anything.

657
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,265
Just let me soak into
your subconscious.

658
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,404
You think that the only truth that
matters is the truth that can be measured.

659
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,804
Good intentions don't count.
What's in your heart doesn't count.

660
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,212
Caring doesn't count.

661
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,445
But a man's life can be measured

662
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,921
by how many tears
are shed when he dies.

663
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,051
Just because you
can't measure them,

664
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,397
just because you don't
want to measure them,

665
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,660
doesn't mean it's not real.

666
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,706
That does not make sense.

667
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,542
And even if I'm wrong,
you're still miserable.

668
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,443
Did you really think
that your life's purpose

669
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,978
was to sacrifice yourself
and get nothing in return?

670
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,183
No.

671
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,754
<i>You believe there's
no purpose to anything.</i>

672
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,727
<i>Even the lives you
save, you dismiss.</i>

673
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,403
<i>You turn the one
decent thing in your life</i>

674
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,308
<i>and you taint it,
strip it of all meaning.</i>

675
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,982
<i>You're miserable for nothing.</i>

676
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:46,515
<i>And I don't know
why you'd want to live.</i>

677
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,780
I'm sorry.

678
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,761
I know what's wrong.

679
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,238
House, get out of
here, you're not sterile.

680
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,732
He'll be fine.

681
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,004
Great.

682
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,303
What's he got?

683
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,579
How come you guys have never
tried to yank me off this case?

684
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,347
I'm having
hallucinations, blackouts.

685
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:54,415
But you're always insane,
and you're always right.

686
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,660
I'm almost always
eventually right.

687
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,090
You have no way of
knowing when eventually is.

688
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:05,604
Every time I've had an
epiphany on this one,

689
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,968
you guys were right on board.

690
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,508
No challenges,
nothing to explain.

691
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,179
No offense, but either you guys are
getting smarter or I'm getting dumber.

692
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,374
We've worked with you
long enough to know...

693
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,282
I know the test results even
before you enter the room.

694
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,479
We have identical knowledge.

695
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:23,947
How is that possible?

696
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,046
You're wrong.

697
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,149
If something doesn't make sense,

698
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,490
one of your assumptions
has to be wrong.

699
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,826
Because if it doesn't
make sense, it can't be real.

700
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:37,565
But what if the faulty
assumption is that it's real?

701
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,669
House, you're losing it.

702
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,930
I've lost it.

703
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:47,974
Why did you stop me?

704
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,242
Because I think
you're going to kill him.

705
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,444
No, you don't think
that. You know it.

706
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,645
Because you're in my head.

707
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,653
As long as the delusion makes
sense, my mind lets it go on.

708
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,820
I have to make it not
make sense. I have to

709
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,094
push it past the point
where it can trick my mind.

710
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,626
If this is a nightmare,
you're gonna wake up.

711
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,433
If it's real, you're
killing a man.

712
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,167
It's also possible that
I may already be dead.

713
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,936
And I don't believe
in the afterlife.

714
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,773
House, go back to your room.

715
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,870
If this is a hallucination,
it's a good one.

716
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,437
You're pain-free. You can walk.

717
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:27,212
It's not real. Therefore, it's
meaningless. I want meaning.

718
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,963
Oh, God.

719
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,694
Goodbye.

720
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,496
He was shot. Twice.

721
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,503
Once in the abdomen,
once in the neck.

722
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,232
Hello. It's gonna be okay.

723
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,830
You're gonna be okay.

724
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,341
You don't know nothing.

725
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,642
Tell Cuddy

726
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,972
I want Ketamine.
