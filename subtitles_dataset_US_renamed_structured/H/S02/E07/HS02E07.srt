1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,931
My offer's withdrawn.
You can walk to work.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,734
Got it. You're morally outraged.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,126
Now, can we get
through this part?

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,573
'Cause the next part's awesome.

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,702
How do you rationalize
something like this?

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,938
You broke into Stacy's
therapist's office.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,949
Borrowed a key. And
stole her treatment notes.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,712
Nope. I made copies.

9
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,281
"Mark is," and I quote...

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,415
"withdrawn, passive
aggressive, won't communicate,

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,925
"like he resents me
because I can walk."

12
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,521
I don't wanna hear this.
"Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up."

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,532
Meanwhile, she can't
stop thinking about...

14
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,661
I can't read that, is she
obsessed with a gray horse or me?

15
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,101
It says she thinks
you're an annoying jerk.

16
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,766
It's a pet name.

17
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,905
Here's the kicker.

18
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,309
They're not having sex?

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,382
Doctor cleared
him, but no lift-off.

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,458
She's frustrated, so
she's doc-blocking me.

21
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,359
Paperwork, seminars,
meddling with my patients.

22
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,158
But now you've got
the proof you need,

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,256
just take those personal
psych records to Cuddy,

24
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,063
and that'll show her
Stacy's out of control.

25
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,603
You ignoring me?

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,138
While looking for my newspaper.

27
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,762
Efficient, huh?

28
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,139
Over here.

29
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,512
Dr. Wilson, I want
you to meet my stalker.

30
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,611
Your waiting room sucks.

31
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,549
I am not treating you.

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,745
Because you're a closet case?

33
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,982
We're not together.

34
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,425
He is so self-loathing.

35
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,052
But we gotta go now. So,
maybe see you after work.

36
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,460
No, no, no, no.

37
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,299
Nobody can figure out
what's wrong with me.

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,249
Well, your shirt is gaping at the
collar. That means you've lost weight.

39
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,539
You're flushed, that's fever,
and you're short of breath.

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,274
And finally, there's the KS lesion on
your face. It means you're HIV positive,

41
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,824
and you've progressed
to full-blown AIDS.

42
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,046
So you're sick because your immune
system is shot and someone sneezed on you.

43
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,677
May I be excused now? Brilliant,

44
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,951
but my immune system is fine.

45
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,524
Your concentration-camp
physique begs to differ.

46
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,151
Get your T-cell
count re-checked.

47
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,525
I've already done that.

48
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,461
They test for T-cell lymphoma?

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,759
It was negative.

50
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,064
All of this will be fascinating
to an HIV specialist.

51
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,604
Now let go of my cane before
it becomes your new boyfriend.

52
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,334
Honey, I will marry it if
you will look at my file.

53
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,740
Congress says you can't, so...

54
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,683
I didn't touch him.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,647
He's going into
anaphylactic shock.

56
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,657
Go see Stacy. We
gave him epi. He's fine.

57
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,187
You need a lawyer. Go
see Stacy. You hit a patient.

58
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,893
Four words, two mistakes.

59
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,628
He's not a patient,
and I didn't hit him.

60
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,170
Of course you
didn't. Go see Stacy.

61
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,000
I didn't cause the anaphylaxis.

62
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,936
It's probably one
of his HIV meds.

63
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,033
Abacavir. I'll pass that along,

64
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,273
make sure the ER takes
him off it. Go see Stacy.

65
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,882
You have to treat him. Medically,
this case is a snooze-fest.

66
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,214
AIDS plus infection.

67
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,278
You don't treat him, he
charges you with assault.

68
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,880
Just 'cause he says I hit
him, doesn't make it true.

69
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,155
Watch, I am surrounded
by naked cheerleaders.

70
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,427
See?

71
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,133
Although, I like my chances
of some action this morning.

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,830
I forgot Wednesday was hooker
day. This could have waited.

73
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,106
You make me meet
you at your house.

74
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,665
Your husband is
conveniently absent.

75
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,373
Mark's at physio. I'm stuck
waiting for the exterminator.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,981
I saw a rat last night.

77
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,716
Well, I'm surprised your
feet are touching the floor.

78
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,254
I barely slept.

79
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,085
What was Mark up to?

80
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,226
If memory serves, a quick
climb up Mount Gregory,

81
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,022
and you'd doze
through a seal hunt.

82
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,891
Clubbing, shrieking.

83
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,859
What're you doing?

84
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,598
Sorry, it was just
driving me nuts.

85
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,600
You hate washing dishes.

86
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,596
People change.

87
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,975
I could make sure you'd
sleep like a baby tonight.

88
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,747
Rather take care of it myself.

89
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,687
I was referring to the rat.

90
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,985
Trenton Pest is sending a guy.

91
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,156
What's going on?

92
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,965
It's not what you think.

93
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,060
I know it looks like we're cleaning
dishes, but actually we're having sex.

94
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,297
We're working.

95
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,636
Wow, wish I had become a doctor.

96
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,765
Place would be spotless.

97
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,908
Take 10 minutes, cure
the guy, and stop whining.

98
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,985
I give you Kalvin Ryan,

99
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:23,079
so flamboyant in person,
so boring on paper.

100
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,352
Obviously got an
opportunistic infection,

101
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,553
probably TB or PCP.

102
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,163
Have you read his file?

103
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,667
I started, but I found the
characters two-dimensional.

104
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,130
He went to an HIV
clinic last week.

105
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:40,106
Tested negative for TB,
PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV.

106
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,435
It's not an
infection. HIV clinic.

107
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,444
So few patients, so much money.

108
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,707
Redo the tests. The
results make sense.

109
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,248
Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.

110
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,908
That's strong enough
to fight infection.

111
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,451
Fine, parasite.

112
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,010
Nope. The stool
sample was negative.

113
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,352
Two months ago, he
was down to 30 T-cells.

114
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,434
Then he changed his meds,
his immune system rebounds,

115
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:03,021
his viral load drops, everything's
getting better, but he's getting sicker.

116
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,530
Face it. This might
be an interesting case.

117
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,900
What if his immune
system is too strong?

118
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,712
An auto-immune disease?
With HIV, that's impossible.

119
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,509
His new HIV meds kicked his
system out of a sound sleep.

120
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,282
It wakes up hungry,
cranky, spoiling for a fight.

121
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,751
And when it doesn't
find an active infection,

122
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,192
it starts attacking the harmless
remnants of old infections.

123
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,560
Immune reconstitution syndrome.

124
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,322
His meds made him so much
better, he made himself sick?

125
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,893
Sounds pretty... Boring!

126
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,801
This is so not interesting.

127
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,433
Chest x-ray to find the old
infection and start him on steroids.

128
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,481
If you're wrong, the steroids will tank
his immune system. He'll get worse.

129
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,881
Now that would be interesting.

130
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,384
Where's the Coumadin?

131
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,045
If your patient's
got a blood problem,

132
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,646
then blood thinners
aren't exactly...

133
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,557
It's for Stacy's rat.
Death by anticoagulation.

134
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,558
Trying to win Stacy
back by killing an animal.

135
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,194
Very caveman.

136
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,166
I don't want her back.

137
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,567
I just want her to admit
her feelings for me.

138
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,104
I go to Cuddy,

139
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,040
Cuddy fires her or reassigns
her. Either way, I'm happy.

140
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:27,376
If you want her back,
either tell her or, better yet,

141
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:31,215
shut up and cry yourself
to sleep like everybody else.

142
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,846
Hi, this is, Mark Warner,
1724 Spring Street.

143
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,016
Listen, you don't need to send
that guy down. We caught him.

144
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:42,322
No, you should send the bill to
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital,

145
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,489
attention Dr. James Wilson.

146
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,824
Yeah.

147
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,839
Your lymph nodes
aren't swollen, that's good.

148
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,235
Maybe Dr. Chase should check.

149
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,711
Sorry, mate, hands full.

150
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,942
He's too pretty to be straight.

151
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,777
You ever done any modeling?

152
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,817
Does anyone actually
fall for that line?

153
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,942
Every day.

154
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,317
Why do you think I
became a photographer?

155
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:11,290
I'm guessing you guys didn't
think about dating on career day.

156
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,160
I love my job. Really?

157
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,026
You seem more the "find it
exceptionally satisfying" type.

158
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,568
I'm not sure
there's a difference.

159
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,434
Your mom died of diabetes.
How's your dad's health?

160
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,667
Last I heard, he had cirrhosis.

161
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,403
Love is love.

162
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:34,503
Satisfying is "social
validation, fun can wait."

163
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,747
I have fun.

164
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,217
Yeah, she's got some
scheduled for February.

165
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,151
Last you heard, your father?

166
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,980
He threw me out when I was 16.

167
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,682
It's just as well.

168
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,593
I got tired of getting BB guns for my
birthday when I'd asked for a Barbie.

169
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,857
Dads can be real sweethearts.

170
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,660
Sensitive and cute.

171
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,800
He's cute.

172
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,282
He ran into that
heating vent, right there.

173
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,879
Hopefully, Mark's anger
will go away eventually.

174
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,389
He's not angry, he
just doesn't like you.

175
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,857
Nothing unique there.

176
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,656
Didn't seem real
wild about you, either.

177
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,924
He's fine with me.

178
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,994
He's angry. Said so in group.

179
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,731
Of course he's angry. He's
looking at months of painful physio.

180
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,539
He's mad at you.

181
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,733
There's no way he said that.

182
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,634
No.

183
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,637
But it's true.

184
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,710
He resents you for
being able to walk.

185
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,421
Been there.

186
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,351
I resented you for
a hell of a long time.

187
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,396
Past tense?

188
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,974
Might be the hospital.

189
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,243
What?

190
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,720
Bad time? Where are you?

191
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,255
<i>At your girlfriend's place.</i>

192
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,756
<i>Ignore the moaning
and squeaking.</i>

193
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,156
His lungs are too scarred to
tell which infection triggered

194
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,252
the immune reconstitution.

195
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,228
He a smoker?

196
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,762
<i>Yes, and possibly
more than cigarettes.</i>

197
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,700
His tox screen came back
positive for recreational drugs.

198
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,465
<i>Not surprising, not
medically relevant.</i>

199
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,063
His heart looks
a little enlarged.

200
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,473
<i>That's a typical
side effect of AZT.</i>

201
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,841
<i>What are Kalvin's
most recent infections?</i>

202
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,911
Toxo, CMV,

203
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,242
<i>and PCP.</i>

204
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,345
Well, let's assume
it's one of those.

205
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,513
<i>Give him ganciclovir
for the CMV.</i>

206
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,580
We can hardly hear
you. Where are you?

207
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,681
<i>In a closet.</i>

208
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,728
Your girlfriend's other
boyfriend showed up.

209
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,295
Ganciclovir for the CMV.

210
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:09,965
Sulfadiazine for the
toxo, Bactrim for PCP.

211
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,165
Gotta go. It's killing time.

212
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,995
Your tox screen came
back positive for...

213
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,974
Crystal meth and ecstasy.

214
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,505
Recreational drugs are dangerous to
begin with, but for someone with HIV...

215
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,106
I didn't mistake
them for vitamins.

216
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,313
I'm a PNP boy.

217
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,911
Party and Play.

218
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,450
Drugs and sex.

219
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,624
You don't approve?

220
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,494
Does the sex include condoms?

221
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,760
If he's negative,
sure. If he's positive...

222
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,133
Why put on a raincoat
if you're already wet?

223
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,540
You could get hepatitis,
or another strain of HIV.

224
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,010
Or I could get hit by a bus.

225
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,808
AIDS isn't a death
sentence anymore.

226
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,178
I don't wanna have any regrets.

227
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,119
How long have you been coughing?

228
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,054
About an hour or so.

229
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,988
Try to take a deep breath.

230
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,666
What is it?

231
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,797
I think it's blood.

232
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,379
I recommend
post-exposure prophylaxis.

233
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,018
Your chances of
conversion are slim,

234
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,684
but I'd like to put you on
three anti-viral medications.

235
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,389
Nelfinavir, zidovudine,
and lamivudine.

236
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:22,031
There are side effects,
headache, nausea, vivid dreaming.

237
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,899
You'll be tested for
HIV at six weeks,

238
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,165
three months, six months.

239
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,176
Very interesting.

240
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:38,776
He coughs infected blood in Cameron's
eyes and mouth, that's interesting?

241
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,149
The "coughing" part,
not the "in Cameron" part.

242
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,848
New symptom, blood
vessel ruptured in his lung.

243
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,587
I closed the tear.

244
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,753
Well, it takes immune
reconstitution off the table.

245
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,958
What's it put on the table?

246
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,330
It's okay, she's not here,
you can skip the nice-guy acts.

247
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,770
You know, some human beings are
actually capable of human feelings.

248
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,775
My giving a damn or not is not
gonna change what happened.

249
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,970
Could be Goodpasture's syndrome.

250
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,104
No edema, no bloody urine.

251
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,582
Well, KS on his face could mean KS in
his lungs, with bleeding from the lesions.

252
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,176
I would have seen them when
I repaired the tear in his lung.

253
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,845
Wegener's granulomatosis?

254
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,789
Wegener's would have
responded to steroids.

255
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,758
Maybe you should go
home, take the rest of the day.

256
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,090
I'm fine.

257
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,661
Well, this is good.

258
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,997
He's pretending to care,
you're pretending not to.

259
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,136
I think we should reconsider
drugs. Kalvin uses crystal meth.

260
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,142
Concerned enough about
his health to stalk me,

261
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,336
while indulging in
deadly street drugs.

262
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,438
A study in contradictions.

263
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,315
Interesting, but still
not medically relevant.

264
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,683
It could be, if his
drugs were tainted.

265
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,746
They cook meth with
battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...

266
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,451
Find Kalvin's
pills, test for toxins.

267
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,756
Foreman, you're with me.

268
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,160
I need a consult
on another case.

269
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,465
We have another case?

270
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,563
It's a hip-pocket deal.

271
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,336
Patient presents
with a distinct neck tilt.

272
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,776
Wry neck. Is he an athlete?

273
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,379
He's a regular runner.

274
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,210
Any pain associated
with movement?

275
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,307
None that he's complained of.

276
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,210
Best-case scenario, an
infection in the ear or lungs.

277
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,415
Worst case, brain-stem tumor.

278
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,550
You should do an MRI,
CAT Scan, full work up.

279
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,397
I don't think so. No insurance.

280
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,833
No drugs in here.
I'll take the bathroom.

281
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:44,076
How about a drink after work?
Take your mind off what happened.

282
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,047
Cameron?

283
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,252
I might have HIV, a drink's
not gonna wash it away.

284
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,050
There's like zero chance
of you contracting the virus.

285
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,115
Big difference between
"like zero" and "zero."

286
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,361
What did the infection
control guy tell you?

287
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,497
He was very reassuring.

288
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:08,001
Kept reminding me that the
hospital covers all my medical costs.

289
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,400
Apparently forgot to mention
that if I do test positive,

290
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,463
that they'll pass it on to legal, and
legal will dig up any dirt they can,

291
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,939
trying to prove that

292
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,705
I'm a drug user or tramp,
and that's why I have HIV.

293
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,942
It's not like they're
gonna find anything, right?

294
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,242
Right.

295
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,908
Check this out.

296
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,850
Kalvin's a photographer.
The broken bulbs were props.

297
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,981
The glass is from
1930s fluorescents.

298
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,423
Some of the bulbs
are date-stamped.

299
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,983
Pre-World War Il,
fluorescent bulbs

300
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,500
contained large
amounts of beryllium.

301
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,689
Beryllium dust inflames
the lungs, they get rigid,

302
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,992
patient can't breathe.

303
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,032
My father co-authored a
paper on acute berylliosis.

304
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,160
Phew!

305
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,901
For a moment there, I
thought you were smart.

306
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:52,275
Cameron, get a biopsy of Kalvin's
lung tissue, run a spectrographic analysis.

307
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,574
I can handle it.

308
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,879
No reason to risk exposing the
entire team. Then who would I torment?

309
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,956
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,623
About what happened.

311
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,595
It's best not to talk.

312
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,764
You're gonna feel a sharp pinch.

313
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,030
This actually is gonna
grab a piece of your lung.

314
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,367
What were you guys
looking for at my hotel?

315
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,270
Your drugs.

316
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,678
We thought maybe
you'd used toxic meth.

317
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,176
We'll know if you were exposed
to beryllium in a few hours.

318
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,220
Well, if you're still curious,

319
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,756
it's in my bag over
there on the chair.

320
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,717
You brought drugs
into the hospital?

321
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,593
Glad I wasted my
time at your hotel.

322
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,633
I told you I used, you
didn't ask me for a sample.

323
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,600
You're not pissed about this,

324
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,669
you're mad because I
coughed blood on you.

325
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,795
That was an accident.

326
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,272
Would you stop being nice?

327
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,808
It's useless, and
worse, it's boring.

328
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,372
Get angry!

329
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,345
I had one stupid
night, I end up with HIV.

330
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,406
Do you have any idea
how pissed off I was?

331
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,383
This wasn't your fault.

332
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,395
You broke into my house?

333
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,061
Well, I had to, Mark isn't here.

334
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,292
He has physio. Oh, really?

335
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,029
How's he doing? What
happened with all the cheese?

336
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,233
Well, I had to get rid of it before
Steve McQueen ate any Coumadin.

337
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,968
I named your rat.

338
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,272
Steve's tilting his head.

339
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,414
Any neurologist will tell you

340
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,951
that suggests an infection
or a brain-stem tumor.

341
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,479
Death cures both those things.

342
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,353
We can't kill him.

343
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,451
If it's an infection, it could be
caused by something in your house.

344
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,595
Something that
could affect you guys.

345
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,665
Smell this.

346
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,101
Does it smell like urine?

347
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,398
You missing any asparagus?

348
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,510
Okay, stuff these.

349
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,547
If he doesn't get
better, then it's a tumor.

350
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,276
Then what, chemo?

351
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,017
Steve McQueen without hair?

352
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,052
It's a blessing he died young.

353
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,391
Hello.

354
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,090
Hi, honey.

355
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,537
I'm sorry I missed you,
yeah. I came home.

356
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,805
All right, I'll see
you in a few minutes.

357
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,034
Okay.

358
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,741
Bye, hon.

359
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,524
Chest hurts.

360
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,323
Heart rate's a 100 and climbing,
could be an allergic reaction.

361
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,490
Neck veins are up. Must
be pericardial effusion.

362
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,396
There's no wheezing. The tear
in his lungs must have reopened.

363
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,703
Kalvin? You're bleeding into
the area around your heart.

364
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,808
I can't breathe. The
blood's crushing your heart.

365
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,845
Once we remove
it, you'll be fine.

366
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,074
If I die, please tell my dad...

367
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,615
You're not going to die.

368
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,083
Tell him sorry.

369
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,293
Where's the blood?

370
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,131
It's clear.

371
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,727
Only one other thing
could cause this.

372
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,669
A tumor in his heart.

373
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,148
CT confirmed a
mass in Kalvin's heart,

374
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,273
and several smaller
ones in his lungs.

375
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,615
That's why his heart's
enlarged, not the AZT.

376
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,949
You okay?

377
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:58,023
She's fine, probably getting
bored with the question.

378
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,924
Masses in the heart and lungs,
what kind of cancer are we looking at?

379
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,222
They may not be cancerous.

380
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,229
This is classic
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

381
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,356
HIV-positive patient with
a primary heart mass?

382
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,960
It could be sarcoidosis.
His lung tissue was negative.

383
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,771
Lymphoma's a death
sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.

384
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,297
So is an ear infection, but since
he didn't test positive for that either...

385
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,004
I want to do the
Kveim-Siltzbach test.

386
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:25,109
Do you have any idea how much
paperwork Cuddy's gonna need signed?

387
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,816
Do it.

388
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,055
So...

389
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,456
How's the patient's father?

390
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,724
"Tell my dad I'm sorry"?

391
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,161
Might as well have
waved a red flag at a bull.

392
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,830
He's not coming.

393
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,566
Well, it's not a tragedy.

394
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,004
Dad doesn't wanna see him,
he doesn't wanna see the dad.

395
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,138
You're the only one
who wants them together.

396
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,739
He asked. He
thought he was dying.

397
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,183
Dying people lie, too.

398
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,456
Wish they'd worked
less, they'd been nicer,

399
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,616
they'd opened
orphanages for kittens.

400
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,024
If you really wanna
do something, you do it,

401
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,562
you don't save it
for a sound bite.

402
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,296
What did you say when
you thought you were dying?

403
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,968
On the other hand...

404
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,176
His dad tossed him out.

405
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,105
So what's our guy
wanna apologize for?

406
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,246
Everybody has regrets.

407
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,855
If the growths in your
lungs and heart are sarcoid,

408
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,519
your body will
recognize this material,

409
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,224
and we'll see a
reaction on your arm.

410
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,727
Did you really
wanna see your dad?

411
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,270
You called him?

412
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,334
Thanks.

413
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,011
He would've come,
tried to straighten me out.

414
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,804
How are you holding up?

415
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,181
I'm fine. Convincing.

416
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,886
What did you do with my drugs?

417
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,252
The lab disposes of
them after analysis.

418
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,585
Too bad.

419
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,259
They could've done
you some good.

420
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,758
Not really my thing.

421
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,026
You know, I hope
you don't have it, but...

422
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,000
Getting HIV might have been the
best thing that ever happened to me.

423
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,209
I used to be a good boy.

424
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,711
Never wanted to
piss anybody off.

425
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:38,674
Playing by the rules makes
everybody else happy.

426
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,144
Now I'm happy.

427
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,523
So you just show up
every time he's at physio?

428
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,121
Of course not.

429
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,633
Also when he's at group therapy

430
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,566
or out for dinner with friends.

431
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:00,367
And when she happens to mention
to Mark that you dropped by...

432
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,870
You tell your wife everything?

433
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,205
It's a process.

434
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,210
But Stacy doesn't have any
reason to hide this from Mark.

435
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,277
As far as she knows, Mark's
okay with you being there.

436
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,016
My bet is she mentions me
to Mark as little as possible.

437
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,820
Because she
thinks that he thinks

438
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,588
that she still has
feelings for me.

439
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,856
You know why she thinks that?

440
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,558
Because she still
has feelings for you?

441
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,930
If you're right,
she did tell him

442
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,232
and I don't get through
the door tonight.

443
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,399
If I'm right...

444
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,310
So how long do we stay here?

445
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,678
Until something happens.

446
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,588
He's not gonna come
out with us right here.

447
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,791
We are downwind, and he
seems to have hearing loss.

448
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,724
He's not blind.

449
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:02,300
Steve McQueen does
not run from danger.

450
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,439
Antibiotics, on
the other hand...

451
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,275
He ate around the pill?

452
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,270
Smart.

453
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,245
Admit it, you like him.

454
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,707
He's all right. For a rat.

455
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,516
You wanna know how cool he is?

456
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,982
His urine showed traces of
hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead.

457
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,086
He's a smoker.

458
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,698
Your husband's been lighting up,

459
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,526
which is particularly stupid,
given that it could cause his AIP...

460
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,336
Okay, I blow my smoke into
the vent so Mark doesn't know.

461
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,033
I always knew.

462
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,041
Bluffing.

463
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,081
You started two
weeks after my surgery.

464
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,443
Menthols, then
lights after a month.

465
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,216
Why didn't you say anything?

466
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,281
'Cause it helped me
monitor your misery level.

467
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,154
One trip outside was a good day,

468
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,288
and upwards of
six, you were in hell.

469
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,033
You could have
asked me how I was.

470
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,196
I already knew.

471
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,067
I'm sorry you were miserable.

472
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,647
Sorry I caused you so much pain.

473
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,901
Glad you changed your
mind about that drink.

474
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,532
Come on in.

475
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:54,273
You should get changed, there's
this new place on campus that looks...

476
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,615
Are you high? Uh-huh.

477
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,024
I thought the lab
disposed of the drugs.

478
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,620
Not all of it.

479
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,933
Slow down.

480
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,534
Your pupils are
dilated. You're not...

481
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:24,008
Come on, Chase, don't turn
into a good guy on me now.

482
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,809
You're late.

483
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,068
And hung over.

484
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,905
Or maybe not.

485
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,918
Why do you have a rat?

486
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,648
Jealous?

487
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,122
Get out of my room!

488
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,425
Don't you dare put this on me!

489
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,032
I'm not gonna grovel, Dad!

490
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,795
That's not what I'm
asking for! Like hell it isn't!

491
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,860
You said you didn't call.

492
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,030
Well...

493
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,065
Don't mind me, just
here for the show.

494
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,736
Yeah, well, there's
not gonna be any.

495
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,578
What happened
to the big apology?

496
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,308
Yesterday he was all,
"Daddy, I'm so sowwy."

497
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,644
This is none of your business.

498
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,311
Well, you should've thought
of that before you stalked me.

499
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,378
Now I'm interested. So
what's he got to apologize for?

500
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,732
You're the one
who tossed him out.

501
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,917
Now why would I do that?

502
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,391
I don't know, because it's tough

503
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,825
to brag to your hunting buddies

504
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,572
that your son knows
all the words to <i>The Wiz.</i>

505
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,360
That's a lie. <i>42nd Street?</i>

506
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:55,424
No. Much easier just to
get drunk and beat him.

507
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,732
Explains his hating you,
and also your cirrhosis.

508
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,064
Also, why the more I
talk, the more you sweat.

509
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,769
What it doesn't explain, is
why he's got to apologize to you.

510
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,977
Residual guilt for sharing
your special toy with other boys?

511
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,916
Just leave it alone.

512
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,922
You just wanna leave the bigot with
some peace of mind after you're gone?

513
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:20,391
Look, this has got nothing, and I
mean nothing, to do with him being gay.

514
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,087
Now Kal brought this on himself

515
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,856
with what he did to his mother.

516
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,659
He steal her signature look?

517
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,731
No.

518
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,794
No, he killed her.

519
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,009
Kalvin lied!

520
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,678
Yeah. That
certainly is shocking.

521
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,406
Mom's kidneys were failing, she
needed a transplant, they tested Kalvin,

522
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,044
he was a match, he
was also positive for HIV.

523
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,022
Mom never found a
qualified donor, she dies.

524
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,925
Tragic tale.

525
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:58,227
Undercut slightly by the rapid-fire
delivery and constant movement.

526
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,959
Too much coffee this morning?

527
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,230
He didn't kill her. Our bodies
aren't donor farms for our parents.

528
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,466
It's not 1980. We know
how HIV is transmitted.

529
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,669
If Kalvin got HIV through unprotected
sex, dad has every right to be pissed.

530
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,472
So you always use a condom?

531
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,637
Yeah.

532
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,613
Brothers on the down-low got to.

533
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,741
I'm not ready for any
Foreman Juniors yet.

534
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,547
You? Working
girls are sticklers.

535
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,948
You're not gonna poll Chase?

536
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,686
I'm not an idiot.

537
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,384
Obviously not.

538
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:33,831
Who doesn't sleep with a drugged-out
colleague when they have a chance?

539
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,229
Where's Wilson?

540
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,899
We got the result
of the Kveim test.

541
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,149
But so...

542
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,316
I have cancer?

543
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,885
In all likelihood, yeah.

544
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,959
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

545
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,654
And I am

546
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,656
dying?

547
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,965
We need to biopsy the tumor.

548
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,007
It's near your aorta,

549
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,872
so getting that sample
carries serious risks.

550
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,842
Is my dad still here?

551
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,140
He hasn't been in?

552
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:31,651
We'll inject a dye around your heart
to make the tumor visible on the CT.

553
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:35,794
<i>Then a surgeon inserts a guide
wire, runs it up into your heart,</i>

554
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:40,731
<i>where he takes a small piece of that tumor
so we can look at it under the microscope.</i>

555
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,199
Ativan.

556
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,964
It'll help settle you down.

557
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,698
Why are you so calm?

558
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,832
Not coming off meth helps.

559
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,008
Last night probably
shouldn't happen again.

560
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,207
Do you think I want it to?

561
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,752
When two people have
had sex, unless it sucks,

562
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,344
if they can do it again,
they're gonna do it again.

563
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,118
And that's when
things get complicated.

564
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,121
And it didn't suck.

565
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:17,665
So now you've gotta drum up another
excuse to be around the love of your life.

566
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,770
Could hit another patient.

567
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,363
Yeah, don't like
to repeat myself.

568
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,908
People will say I'm formulaic.

569
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,773
Well, that rules out letting the
rat go so you can catch him again.

570
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:26,937
I can't do that.

571
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,743
Steve needs two weeks' antibiotics
and a smoke-free environment.

572
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,011
Cigarettes aggravated
his infection.

573
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,850
The rat is actually sick? That
thing could infect the entire hospital.

574
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,914
Steve's infection is not
contagious to humans.

575
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,425
I'm an idiot. How do I
miss mycoplasmosis?

576
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:42,722
Was that the kid's father?

577
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,593
Yeah. Remember the Black
Death? It started with rats.

578
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,104
Well, what's he
doing in the hallway?

579
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,509
Is the kid getting
his biopsy already?

580
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,644
He just won't go in the room.

581
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,433
Who knows what else he has,
parasites, bacterial infection?

582
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,372
The kid doesn't have
parasites. Not the kid, the rat.

583
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,603
Was he still sweating?

584
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,872
Rats only sweat
through their tails.

585
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,777
Not the rat, the dad!

586
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,113
Where are they from?

587
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,980
Montana. What's going on?

588
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,749
You were right, it's a parasite.

589
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,154
Cancel the
biopsy, it'll kill him.

590
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,623
Hey, Daddy, come with me.

591
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,692
Yeah, I'm not going in there.

592
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,064
Your son asked to talk to you.

593
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,930
Why is he here?

594
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,568
He wanted to talk to you.

595
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,571
Did you two used
to hunt together?

596
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,741
Foxes? Did you kill foxes?

597
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,285
It's Montana.

598
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,388
Those masses in your
chest are not tumors.

599
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,858
They're parasitic cysts from
a bug called echinococcus.

600
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,792
Touch a dead fox,
they jump aboard,

601
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,693
they can hunker
down for decades.

602
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,789
Growing, spawning,
shopping, putting on plays.

603
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,165
I've been tested for parasites.

604
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,800
Okay, it's cancer. You happy?

605
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,005
The cysts isolate the parasites,

606
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,340
keeping them from showing up in stool
samples. Even in blood tests, cardiac...

607
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,970
All right, you don't
need me for this.

608
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,982
But you've got the
same things in your liver.

609
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,312
I have cirrhosis.

610
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,354
Liver cysts have identical
symptoms, with one addition, fever.

611
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,683
And liver cysts we can test for.

612
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,456
Your diagnosis
could confirm Kalvin's.

613
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,398
So, option A, we
draw some blood...

614
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,228
No, no, no. Look,
you're not touching me.

615
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,996
Well, you see, this is
why I need you here.

616
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:33,765
I want you to tell your son that you
won't take a simple, painless blood test

617
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,466
to save his life.

618
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,151
You

619
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,949
never expressed
a shred of regret

620
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,084
for what happened
to your mother.

621
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,520
Jeez, Dad.

622
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,327
If you'd have worn a damn
rubber, you'd have been fine.

623
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,390
You could have saved her life.

624
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,561
You wouldn't be lying here.

625
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,536
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it!

626
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,438
You're really mad at
him for killing himself,

627
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,305
and for destroying
everything you love.

628
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,868
I don't have time for this.
Are you gonna apologize?

629
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,937
I'm living my life
the way I want.

630
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,291
Are you gonna give
me some blood?

631
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,910
Look, if he doesn't give
a damn, then neither do I.

632
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,647
Okay, option B.

633
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,655
Why did your wife kill
herself? Did she hate you?

634
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,692
She was a diabetic!

635
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,852
You know, you don't know
a thing about my Susan.

636
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:32,625
Either Susan wanted to die,
or she was both fat and stupid.

637
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,390
Used a Twinkie instead of a gun.

638
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,311
And girls with big appetites, well,
they just can't get enough of anything.

639
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,394
Shut up!

640
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,114
Probably nibbled on every
Devil Dog in the county!

641
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,749
Shut up! Just in case I'm
not making myself clear,

642
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,708
I don't mean the
delicious snack.

643
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,539
You son of a bitch!

644
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,873
Yeah? Come on!

645
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,380
Thank you. Means I can do this.

646
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,120
We're gonna need
some epi in here, stat!

647
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,621
Are you out of your mind?

648
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,089
You said you didn't care.

649
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,156
Notice how you can't breathe?

650
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,821
Now, either that's the cane

651
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,576
or, I just ruptured one of those
liver cysts we were chatting about,

652
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,192
and you've gone into
anaphylactic shock.

653
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,964
Exactly the same
way your son did

654
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,437
when he accidentally
tripped against my friend's car.

655
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,997
I'm just so excited
to find out which.

656
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,444
I'm gonna schedule the surgery.

657
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,215
Clamp.

658
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,155
Pressure's holding.

659
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,376
Give me the syringe.

660
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,956
Clamps...

661
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,995
Two successful surgeries, two
lives saved. I'm over my quota.

662
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,064
Can I have next week off?

663
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,171
Two family members assaulted.

664
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,709
It was self-defense.

665
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,042
You baited him.

666
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,310
You're right, I
was asking for it.

667
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,079
The low-cut blouse,
the do-me pumps.

668
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,484
You flooded his gut with
a parasite. He could sue.

669
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,685
Go see Stacy.

670
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,320
Okay.

671
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:45,655
That's it, "okay"?

672
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,861
No name-calling? No squawking,
no rending of garments?

673
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,699
I like this t-shirt.

674
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,534
You lied to me.

675
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,238
If this is about my mom, I...

676
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,908
This is about your
lonely, miserable life.

677
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,781
I'm not miserable.

678
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,683
And as long as there's a gay
bar around, I'm never lonely.

679
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,982
You haven't had a single
visitor except for your dad.

680
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,289
Drugs are great, HIV freed you,

681
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,692
your dad hates
you, you're so happy.

682
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,391
Everything's a lie.

683
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,627
You blame yourself
for your mom's death.

684
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,568
You're not trying to have fun,
you're trying to self-destruct.

685
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,903
You wanna kill yourself,
fine, but stop recruiting!

686
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,746
Heard you hit another patient.

687
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,755
Yeah, sure, why not?

688
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,384
He hit me first.

689
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,256
Cuddy didn't mention
that. Let me see.

690
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,789
I'm the doctor.

691
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,960
My concern is purely legal.

692
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,701
Looks okay. Does it hurt?

693
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,701
A little.

694
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,636
You need some ice.

695
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:13,078
There's no way that
Mark doesn't know.

696
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,749
About the smoking.

697
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,584
He would have said something.

698
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,757
Then he hasn't been
near you in months.

699
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,297
We're fine.

700
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,960
Can't be easy.

701
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,729
Stop squirming.

702
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,973
Why would you lie about this?

703
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,540
I'm not lying.

704
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,020
I don't care if you're sleeping
with him or not, but you're not, so...

705
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,182
I am.

706
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,825
You're lying.

707
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,454
You know when I have sex?
You can smell that on me, too?

708
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,009
The only people who know about
what's going on with me and Mark,

709
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,057
are me and Mark.

710
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,534
Well, I just know you.

711
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,933
And I know you.

712
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,308
You're confident, arrogant,
but you're never certain

713
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,543
unless there's a
reason to be certain.

714
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,915
One other person knew.

715
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,544
I told you I was
seeing Dr. Harper,

716
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,111
you can easily
get into her office.

717
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,816
You read my file.

718
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,995
You read my file.

719
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,635
The dishes, the concern,

720
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,041
the acting like a human being.

721
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,510
You have...

722
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,082
This whole time, you've
been manipulating me.

723
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,313
You knew that I had
an angle the moment

724
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,649
I poured soap
onto a scrub brush.

725
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,358
You could have thrown
me out or ignored me

726
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:05,864
or found another exterminator. You didn't
even tell Mark that I kept coming by.

727
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,094
You let this happen because
you wanna be with me.

728
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,297
I don't anymore.

729
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,303
Get out.

730
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,836
I'm sorry.
