1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,579
<i>Blue Calamari
is still in the lead,</i>

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,071
<i>but Ample Parking
is making strides,</i>

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,298
<i>and is now in fourth, third,</i>

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,365
<i>and holding second place, while
Blue Calamari is at a steady speed.</i>

5
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,444
<i>And down the stretch they come!</i>

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,642
<i>Ample Parking comes from behind.
And it's Ample Parking by a nose.</i>

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,811
<i>This is the last call for the third
race. You may still wager if you hurry.</i>

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,652
<i>Here's your
information on the race...</i>

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,658
Out of the way.
Cripple coming through.

10
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,219
Sixth race at Golden Downs.

11
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:33,131
I'll take the two and the
four. Hey, that's my birthday.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,533
February 4, 1963. Do
you think that's a good bet?

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,366
What's your birthday?

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,565
Take your time.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,871
Don't worry. There's
only 30 seconds to post.

16
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,242
Is there any way I can bet
on the six and the three also?

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,248
You know, for the year? All
four horses. Can I do that?

18
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,053
He wants a $2 exacta box,
two, four, six, three. Give him $24.

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,725
Your turn.

20
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,859
The ninth at Gulfstream
Park. $500 on the three horse,

21
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,399
Seminole Uprising to win.

22
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,366
Might as well burn your money.

23
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,261
I'll burn my winnings.
Bigger flame.

24
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,103
Same race, Termigator to win.

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,600
Sorry, race just closed.

26
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:18,907
Damn it.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,410
She was 14-to-1, too.

28
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,178
Then fatass over there
just saved you money.

29
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,480
No way Seminole Uprising's...

30
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,646
I don't bet on the
horses. I bet on the jocks.

31
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,881
My rider's bulimic,
purges after his weigh-ins.

32
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,558
Leave a two-pound
pile at the starting gate,

33
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,657
shaves valuable time
off that final eighth.

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,062
Nice to have inside information.

35
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,642
<i>By a length.</i>

36
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,077
<i>The Burning Bush and
on the level is Candy,</i>

37
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,297
<i>right up on the
inside is Bowfinger...</i>

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,576
<i>And Termigator pulling
up against the rail.</i>

39
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,671
Is anybody here a doctor?

40
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,719
Trying to cop a feel?

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,517
I took a CPR class at the Y.

42
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,501
That would be useful if she was
having a heart attack instead of a seizure.

43
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,221
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?

44
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,887
If you wanna get
a finger bitten off.

45
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,055
Call an ambulance.

46
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,629
Methodist's three blocks down.

47
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,690
I could drive her.
Just make the call.

48
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,704
What the hell is that?

49
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,142
How should I know?

50
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,173
Tell the paramedics to take
her to Princeton-Plainsboro.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,714
Her doctor's name is House.

52
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,581
<i>And it's Termigator,
winning by two lengths.</i>

53
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,246
Since when does
House hang out at OTB?

54
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,449
The man's an addict.

55
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,220
Right, addicted to
pills, not gambling.

56
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,555
It's the same thing.

57
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,619
Drug abuse, drinking, gambling.

58
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,525
They all fire up the same
pleasure centers in the brain.

59
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,157
An addict is an addict is an...

60
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,792
Gambling doesn't
take away his pain.

61
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,533
It does when I win.

62
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,506
Hot OTB babe has grand mal

63
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,968
and inexplicable bruising.

64
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,670
What up with that?

65
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,907
You were just standing
there, and she started to seize?

66
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,540
Spend as much time
around the real people as I do,

67
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,640
someone gets sick.

68
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,085
Her platelets are
89, she's anemic.

69
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,222
And she has a blood
alcohol level of 0.13.

70
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,952
Hot OTB babe?

71
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,486
Obviously a working girl.
Probably an STD infection.

72
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,258
No fever. No infection.

73
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,094
Alcohol abuse explains it all.

74
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,925
Causes seizures and affects
her blood's ability to clot,

75
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,264
which causes bruising.

76
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,047
Start her on heparin,
she'll be fine by morning.

77
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,231
Except for the fact that the
bruises are not petechial,

78
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,502
which means it's not DIC.

79
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,544
So the bruises were
caused by trauma.

80
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,409
She probably got beat up
by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,814
What's that called when you judge
someone before ever meeting them?

82
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,818
She's a regular at OTB.

83
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,851
Somehow, I don't see her holding
down a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.

84
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,482
I was there. I
have a 9-to-3 job.

85
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,791
It could be SLE, familial
telangiectasias, or even Cushing's.

86
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,125
Good. Start with those.

87
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,290
Which one?

88
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,800
Cushing's. It explains the
seizure and the bruising.

89
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:28,892
Not the anemia.

90
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,267
So she doesn't
eat a lot of meat.

91
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,273
DIC brought on by alcohol
abuse is far more likely.

92
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,675
Do a full workup, H and
P. And lab her up, LP, MRI.

93
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,474
Did you just ever so subtly order
me to get her medical history?

94
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,844
Cuddy put me in charge
last week, so, yeah.

95
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,327
It was a pretend in charge, a
formality to get past the suits in legal.

96
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,561
Right, those licensing-board folk
love to play dress up and pretend.

97
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,331
Hey, no worries. I'll let you
keep your parking space.

98
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,635
You can have it. You'll also
need my handicap placard.

99
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,765
Bend over.

100
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,810
You make a pretty
convincing argument.

101
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,936
Chase killed that woman.
Now Foreman's in charge?

102
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,014
Yeah, we have a
pecking order here.

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,758
If Cameron kills somebody,
Chase takes over.

104
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,444
There's a flow
chart in the lobby.

105
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,180
For the next three weeks, you
answer directly to Dr. Foreman.

106
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,813
And I expect you here
for grand rounds at 9:00.

107
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,254
By the way, I like
sugar in my coffee.

108
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,795
If there's a screw
up, it's your screw up.

109
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,896
You won't have
Dr. House to fall back on.

110
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,835
"Do you wear a seat belt?" Is
that really relevant to a seizure?

111
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:42,967
Skip it.

112
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,569
How about, "Were you
vaccinated for polio?"

113
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,444
I think you gave me the
form intended for FDR.

114
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,416
You really like Teeny
Tiny Mo in the fifth?

115
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,475
I went 4-for-6 yesterday.

116
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,486
You want winners? Cure me first.

117
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,949
"Are you generally
satisfied with your life?"

118
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,991
It does not ask that.

119
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,560
You know, I was gonna ask

120
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:11,002
what a respectable doctor
was doing at an OTB parlor.

121
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,240
Somehow that question
doesn't seem relevant anymore.

122
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,400
What's your excuse?

123
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,636
It turns me on.

124
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,441
Yeah? What else
turns you on? Drugs?

125
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,140
Casual sex? Rough sex?

126
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,677
Casual rough sex?

127
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,117
I'm a doctor. I need to know.

128
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,485
No sex.

129
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,057
Just moved here. Haven't
even found a job yet.

130
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,285
Don't know anybody.

131
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,021
Came here without a job.

132
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,160
That means you didn't move here,
you moved away from somewhere else.

133
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,393
Does that hurt? No.

134
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,301
Are you on any prescription
meds? Hormones? Prednisone?

135
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,606
I already answered that one. I think
it was question number 20-something.

136
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,455
Well, yeah. And I could
reach down and get it.

137
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,399
But that would kind of
spoil the whole cool move.

138
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,348
I'm not on any medications.

139
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,475
Are you a vegetarian?

140
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,109
No. Why?

141
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,145
Because you might have
something called Cushing's syndrome,

142
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,281
which basically means...

143
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,849
My pituitary is
overproducing ACTH,

144
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:11,797
which is causing my adrenal glands to
push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.

145
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,300
What a coincidence.
I'm a doctor, too.

146
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,858
Yeah, I had it last year.

147
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,333
They did brain surgery, removed
an adenoma from my pituitary.

148
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,215
What did you just say?

149
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,985
"You were right, House. Her
pituitary tumor regrew. It is Cushing's.

150
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,617
"Uncanny how you do that."

151
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,594
Actually, it was Cameron's idea.

152
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,425
No, Cameron had three ideas.

153
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,965
I chose one to
encourage, to nurture...

154
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,092
Yeah, you're all
about the nurturing.

155
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you need a hug?

156
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,331
I don't see any regrowth.

157
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,167
You get her medical
records faxed over?

158
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,076
Work smart, not hard.
That's my philosophy, boss.

159
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,046
I'll take that as a no.

160
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,185
Anica, I need you to
stay completely still.

161
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,685
Sorry.

162
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,752
Still don't see anything.

163
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,655
Okay, so it's a microadenoma.

164
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,820
Too small to see.

165
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,385
So small, it's not even there.

166
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,433
Right. It's just a coincidence
that I predicted a rare condition

167
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,843
that she happened
to have a year ago.

168
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,267
Results from her LP back yet?

169
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,930
Didn't do an LP. I
knew what she had.

170
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,065
Go do the LP.

171
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:39,152
Okay, I need you to roll over
on your side, kiss your kneecaps.

172
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,052
Party time.

173
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,720
I thought it only took
one doctor to do this.

174
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,883
I'm observing.

175
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,359
She's here to make
sure I don't paralyze you.

176
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,568
You've done this before, right?

177
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,723
Successfully?

178
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,629
He's kidding. He's
an excellent doctor.

179
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,827
I'm going to numb the
area with some lidocaine,

180
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,029
and then we're off to the races.

181
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,503
See what I did there?

182
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,099
I used horse-racing jargon to make
the patient feel more comfortable.

183
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,637
Okay, here we go.

184
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,407
Felt like bone. Does that hurt?

185
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,211
A little bit. What
are you doing?

186
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,919
Try rounding your
back a bit more.

187
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,955
You're perfect just
the way you are.

188
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,614
Oops, that was all me.

189
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,324
Might want to move
down one vertebra.

190
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,794
This is actually much
harder than I remember.

191
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,557
My chest feels a little tight.

192
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,158
Try taking a deep breath.

193
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,845
Dr. House, maybe I
should take it from here.

194
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,201
Eighth time's the charm.

195
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,772
You trying to piss off Foreman?

196
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,598
Just let...

197
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,367
BP's 240 over 140.

198
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,810
Turn that thing off, will you?

199
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,210
Take the needle out.

200
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,908
Take the needle out! Okay.

201
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,582
It's a hypertensive crisis.
Start her on an IV lopressor drip.

202
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,489
Titrate to systolic less
than 140. She'll be fine.

203
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,960
Cameron. Meet me in my office.

204
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,931
At the risk of sounding
redundant and right, again,

205
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,167
she has Cushing's. Cushing's.

206
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,728
Right, the fact that you mangled
her LP has nothing to do with it.

207
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,831
Actually, it has
everything to do with it.

208
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,742
Cushing's plus stress
equals hypertensive crisis.

209
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,812
Smart move, sending the rookie.

210
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,317
Her initial symptoms could have
been caused by alcohol-induced DIC.

211
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,976
She had a hypertensive crisis

212
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,263
because it's been at least six
hours since she had her last drink.

213
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,346
She's detoxing.

214
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,324
The exact same moment that
I'm futilely trying to give her an LP?

215
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,294
Right. An invisible tumor on
her pituitary is much more likely.

216
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,228
What if the tumor
is somewhere else?

217
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,699
There could be an ACTH-secreting
tumor on her lung or pancreas.

218
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,767
It's awfully rare.

219
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,394
Not as rare as
an invisible tumor.

220
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,099
Why didn't they put you in
charge instead of Foreman?

221
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,972
Oh, yeah, you're the
guy that killed that woman.

222
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,501
Get a pan-man scan
before she dies a cortisol OD.

223
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,682
Fine. Do it.

224
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,764
But when you don't find
anything, put her on a Librium taper

225
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,758
for the withdrawal and get
her a bed in a rehab clinic.

226
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,895
Lungs look clean.

227
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,098
Her lymph nodes
are not enlarged.

228
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,235
Cuddy tapped Foreman
to run the department.

229
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,838
I didn't even get asked.

230
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:21,973
Neither did I.

231
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,048
You were suspended.

232
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,140
I was kidding.

233
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:28,221
It's the irony of women in charge.
They don't like other women in charge.

234
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,748
What? You think
it's something else?

235
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,654
You sabotaged yourself.
You went on a date with House.

236
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,664
You slept with me. Putting
you in charge of this department

237
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,496
is like a sexual harassment
suit waiting to happen.

238
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,002
Yeah, they're really worried

239
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,470
that I'm gonna create a
hostile work environment.

240
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,564
Maybe that's the problem.

241
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,205
Being in charge means
having to say no to House.

242
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,639
Would you hire you for that?

243
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,281
<i>Anderson coming out
strong. What is he thinking?</i>

244
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,686
<i>He watched what
Tom Mants just did.</i>

245
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,755
You ordered MRIs for
the entire maternity ward?

246
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,226
I was in a crazy mood.

247
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,298
Good thing I got a new
boss to back me up.

248
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,458
Although, I think one of
those is actually necessary.

249
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,128
Better comb through
before you cancel them all.

250
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,742
What do you expect me
to do, House? Quit? Cry?

251
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,811
Actually, I expect you
to act like what you are.

252
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,507
My employee. My subordinate.

253
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,112
My bitch.

254
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:32,984
Well, since you asked nicely...

255
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,315
My God.

256
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,585
I can't believe I got more than a year
behind on my discharge summaries.

257
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,957
Got to get caught
up. Oh, no, wait.

258
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,258
I'm not authorized to sign
these anymore. Only you are.

259
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,123
Keep it coming.
I'm not gonna break.

260
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,261
Scan showed a
mass on her pancreas.

261
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,366
Looks malignant.
Probably inoperable.

262
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,167
I'd give her two months.

263
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,751
On the bright side, it
still means I was right.

264
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,356
Where's Dr. House?

265
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,624
Dr. Foreman's
overseeing your case.

266
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,732
He thought it'd be best if I spoke with
you. We found a mass in your pancreas.

267
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,234
It looks like cancer.

268
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,539
So something in my pancreas
caused me to have a seizure?

269
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,311
Probably. But the
bigger point is...

270
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,784
A one-year survival rate for
pancreatic cancer is less than 20%.

271
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,515
So what's the treatment?

272
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:48,491
We need to biopsy the mass
to see what we're dealing with,

273
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,928
and then we can

274
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,465
recommend options from there.

275
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,099
Sounds good.

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,635
I need your consent
to do the biopsy.

277
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,606
Thanks.

278
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,413
Wish me luck.

279
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,752
Good luck.

280
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,021
It was weird. She
barely reacted at all.

281
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,555
I've had people hug me and
people take a swing at me.

282
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,928
This was more like
she didn't even hear me.

283
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,263
Magnify three times.

284
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,834
House assisting.

285
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,199
That is funny.

286
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,944
Too bad Foreman's gonna die.

287
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,661
Good afternoon, I'm Dr. House.
I'm gonna be looking at your...

288
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,661
Perfect.

289
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,625
Excuse me.

290
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,202
Need Dr. Foreman in
exam room one for a consult.

291
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,111
So, when did this start?

292
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,845
Couple weeks ago.

293
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,752
I didn't want to get pregnant. Jake's
not into rubbers, so I got on the jelly.

294
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,255
You think I'm
allergic or something?

295
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,749
You have an infection.

296
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,016
I'm gonna need a sample.

297
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,458
I brought the jar.

298
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,755
No, I meant a sample of your...

299
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,630
Okay. We have a
neurological problem here.

300
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,333
There's something
wrong with my brain?

301
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,773
Oh, yeah.

302
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,812
Cover yourself up.
Got what I need.

303
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,942
What's up?

304
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,110
Smell this.

305
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,023
Smells like vaginosis,
but it's not really my call.

306
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,652
Great. I'll be sure to put a gold
star by your name on the board.

307
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,654
Anica's biopsy for pancreatic
cancer was negative.

308
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,073
Okay, I'm gonna give
you some antibiotics

309
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,984
and you probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

310
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,032
How long?

311
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,238
On an evolutionary basis,
I'd recommend forever.

312
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,575
The mass in the pancreas is
benign. It's probably just scar tissue.

313
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,019
Good news. She's not sick at
all. Other than being an alcoholic.

314
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,719
The labs you sent yesterday put her
ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter.

315
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,125
She's got Cushing's.
Something set it off.

316
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,030
It's gotta be in her brain. Set
her up for a venous sampling.

317
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,293
There is another possibility.

318
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,460
Chase, hold on.

319
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,131
How'd you get him trained
so fast? Electronic collar?

320
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,400
Got treats in your pocket?

321
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,307
She didn't even read the consent
form for the pancreatic biopsy.

322
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,435
Who reads those things?

323
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,777
Maybe she didn't read it because she
knew that there was nothing wrong with her.

324
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,658
There is another
explanation for the Cushing's.

325
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,017
Maybe she injected herself with the
ACTH. Her behavior suggests Munchausen's.

326
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,682
She's had four hospitalizations
in the last four months.

327
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,818
Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly
points to nothing being wrong with you.

328
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,822
She's had zero symptoms
since she got here.

329
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,124
The scarring on her pancreas

330
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,109
could be caused from injecting
herself with the benzene

331
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,396
and setting off the seizures.

332
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,027
She's had brain surgery.

333
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,795
You can fake a stomachache.
You can't fake a brain tumor.

334
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,103
You can fake an invisible one.

335
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,777
We should check her apartment.
Look for medications, syringes...

336
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:27,939
Venous sampling's easier.

337
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,107
And more dangerous.

338
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,672
Not if you get
caught breaking in.

339
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,151
So don't get caught, House.

340
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,123
Why do you think Cuddy
picked Foreman over me?

341
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,267
Have I done something wrong?

342
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,768
Or if there's something I
needed to improve on...

343
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,816
Will it make you shut up

344
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,304
if I told you she
wanted someone black?

345
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,126
How would you describe
my leadership skills?

346
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,597
Nonexistent.
Otherwise excellent.

347
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,431
There's more to being a
leader than being a jerk.

348
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,595
The world will never know.

349
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,406
No. No way. It just snowed.

350
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,105
Yesterday. The
streets are clear.

351
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,415
My car is right there.

352
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:07,181
There's construction on
Elm. Bike will be faster.

353
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,666
There's even books
in the bathroom.

354
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,142
Well, either she's very smart or
she has a severe fiber deficiency.

355
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,253
She's got an appointment with
her ophthalmologist on Tuesday

356
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,849
and an appointment with
her gynecologist on Thursday.

357
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,928
Multiple appointments
with multiple doctors.

358
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,691
Symptom of Munchausen's.

359
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:55,230
Or, just thinking
outside the box here,

360
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,135
she has a vagina
and trouble reading.

361
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,335
There's three pairs of reading
glasses, each with different prescriptions.

362
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,242
Which would be explained by a
tumor pressing on the optic nerve.

363
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,089
Because you're looking
for her to have a tumor.

364
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,843
And you're looking for...

365
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,481
A person with Munchausen's
syndrome drinks battery acid.

366
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,230
But they don't go to an ophthalmologist
to get their pupils dilated.

367
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,520
An ophthalmologist is a
doctor. Attention is attention.

368
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:22,255
How many hospitals have you
contacted? Has one doctor said she's crazy?

369
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,489
It's not Munchausen's.

370
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,121
It's not your call.

371
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,544
If you think she's
got Munchausen's,

372
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,488
then obviously you got
something to show the man.

373
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,171
A syringe in her
apartment. A bottle of ACTH.

374
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Munchausen's patients are
good at covering their tracks.

375
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,115
Right. So, the fact that we found
nothing proves there's something.

376
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,012
Look at the pathology reports
from the surgery she had in Chicago.

377
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,744
They removed 30% of her
pituitary. They found no tumor.

378
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,752
It's possible the
surgeons just missed it.

379
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,997
In that kind of surgery,
you're just cutting and hoping...

380
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,819
Of course, we're both right.

381
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,485
Excellent solution,
everybody's happy.

382
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,118
Come on, step up, Foreman.

383
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,028
If you think I'm right, order
me to stick a needle in her brain.

384
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,259
If you think Cameron's
right, send the patient home.

385
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,927
Either she'll be
fine, or she'll die.

386
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,267
Do the venous sampling.
Get her consent.

387
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,878
Nice move, boss.
Way to cover your ass.

388
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,044
I just agreed with you.

389
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,641
Not because you think I'm right,

390
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,916
you're just taking the
safe route. You're a wuss.

391
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,420
Don't worry, your
secret's safe with me.

392
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,958
Hey, Wilson, guess
what Foreman just did!

393
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,595
Hi.

394
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,607
This is a consent form to
stick a wire into your brain.

395
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,122
It's important for hospitals to
get these signed for procedures

396
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,479
that are completely unnecessary.

397
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,948
Then why are you doing it?

398
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,417
Because you're mentally ill.

399
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,824
You injected yourself with ACTH to induce
Cushing's to get attention from doctors.

400
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,222
And so far, it's worked.

401
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,561
I'd like to see another doctor.

402
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,924
I'm not giving you
what you want?

403
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,522
I don't want a bitch.

404
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,068
Just sign the forms, okay?
And I'll get out of here.

405
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,247
Hopefully for you, whatever you
injected yourself with won't wear off

406
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,265
before you get the fun of a caring and
concerned doctor cutting into your head.

407
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,889
You chose me to make
House miserable, didn't you?

408
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,862
Apparently, he's making you
miserable. That's impressive.

409
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,356
Find someone else.

410
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,455
No.

411
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,559
For the first time in six years,

412
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,662
I'm getting copied on all
experimental tests and procedures.

413
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,833
Clinic hours have been
logged and completed.

414
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,309
You've given me four
months of House's dictations

415
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,437
so I can finally bill
insurance companies.

416
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,641
I only did that stuff to prove
he couldn't make me miserable.

417
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,445
Well, way to go.

418
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,146
Now everybody's getting
what they need, even House.

419
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,555
He gets to play mad scientist,
and this department runs smoothly.

420
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,492
So I'm stuck with this
for the next three weeks.

421
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,687
Maybe longer.

422
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,498
Would you be interested
if this wasn't just pretend?

423
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,633
What did Mommy say? I don't
get any candy in my stocking?

424
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,416
Patient being prepped
for the venous sampling?

425
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,842
Yeah, a mentally ill patient is right
on track for a pointless procedure.

426
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,072
Yeah, we get your objection.

427
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,114
Foreman. Are you sure?

428
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,082
That doesn't make any
sense. Check it again.

429
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,751
We gotta delay the
venous sampling.

430
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,820
Why? Her urine turning orange?

431
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,330
How would you know that?

432
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,131
Because that's
what rifampin does.

433
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,796
She's not on antibiotics.

434
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,570
But if a Munchausen's patient
thinks she's about to get busted,

435
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,271
she sees pills labeled
"Dangerous, might cause seizures,"

436
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,711
she might grab a couple.

437
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,216
And if that label were accidentally
on a bottle of antibiotics,

438
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,548
and if that bottle were
accidentally left in her room...

439
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,619
You set her up?

440
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,678
Might have. It's Munchausen's.

441
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,854
All this, she did to herself.

442
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,739
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

443
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,248
I had a seizure. I'm
sick. I need your help.

444
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,047
Not from this department.

445
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,020
The half-life of
rifampin is three hours.

446
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,989
After that, you'll get your psych
referral and your discharge papers.

447
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,497
You know, just because you
stick your fingers down your throat

448
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,257
doesn't mean the rest
of us are screwed up.

449
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,992
I guess when cooperation
fails, you move on to hostility.

450
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,360
I didn't do this to myself.

451
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,446
100% commitment.
Sign of a good liar.

452
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,713
Also the sign of a sociopath.

453
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,782
What are you doing?

454
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,618
Correcting your last note.

455
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,483
We can't discharge
her if she's sick.

456
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,892
Anybody ever tell you,
you write like a girl?

457
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,021
What?

458
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,190
You got some other
explanation for orange urine?

459
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,265
It's Munchausen's.

460
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,631
Correct, but not complete.

461
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,829
You just don't want to
admit that she skunked you.

462
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:34,931
At the end of <i>The Boy Who Cried
Wolf,</i> the wolf really does come.

463
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,975
Then he eats the sheep,
and the boy, and his parents.

464
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,187
The wolf doesn't
eat the parents.

465
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,235
He does when I tell it.

466
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,009
You're not telling
the story now. I am.

467
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,044
Look, I checked her records.

468
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,349
All her hospitalizations
were for different things.

469
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,185
Brain tumor, fainting
spells, skin rashes, seizures.

470
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,776
She's had every blood
test known to man

471
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,169
and the results are
all over the map.

472
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,822
There's only one
constant, low HCT.

473
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,455
The anemia's real.
There's a million things

474
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,809
she could have taken
to have done that.

475
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,529
True, it could just be her MO.

476
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,799
She self-induces two illnesses.
One always changes, one never does.

477
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,137
Or maybe she has
Munchausen's and aplastic anemia,

478
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,904
which would mean,
without proper treatment,

479
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,535
she'll continue to
get sicker, weaker,

480
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,171
eventually she'll start
bleeding internally and die.

481
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,216
She's not getting
sicker. She will.

482
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,582
If her bone marrow was dying, the
entire blood panel would be affected.

483
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,416
Her white count's normal.
- So far.

484
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,922
We need to do a
bone marrow biopsy.

485
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,013
No. No more tests.

486
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,924
Look, you kick her to the curb
with a Munchausen's diagnosis

487
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,656
you're guaranteeing that no
doctor will ever listen to her again.

488
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,460
We do more tests, we'll
only be feeding her psychosis.

489
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,127
The more attention we give
her, the more she'll want.

490
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,934
What if she doesn't
know we're testing her?

491
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,565
House, you were
wrong. Live with it.

492
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,301
There's probably some blood
left over from previous tests.

493
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,778
Blood tests alone can't
confirm aplastic anemia.

494
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,975
Yes, I know. That's why I want
to do a bone marrow biopsy.

495
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,949
But blood tests could
show a systemic disease.

496
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,453
A virus or a toxin could
be the cause. Fine.

497
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,615
You want to test the extra
blood? Knock yourself out.

498
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,317
But the patient is off-limits.

499
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,589
And if the results are
positive, I get my biopsy?

500
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,066
It's the safe way to go.

501
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:27,817
I need all of these tests and
a PCR done on this sample.

502
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,250
You're gonna need more blood.

503
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,888
Patient's empty.

504
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,721
Then I can't do it.

505
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,220
You can try.

506
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:40,733
I can try to look like Salma Hayek,
that's not gonna make it happen.

507
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:49,338
You may not have Salma's ass,
but she doesn't have your eyes.

508
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,943
Yeah, right.

509
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,515
How soon you need it?

510
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,288
Dr. Wilson, can I talk to you
about something in confidence?

511
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,256
Of course. It's about House.

512
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,815
Oh, then no.

513
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,418
Fine. I won't say anything.

514
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:16,601
Do you think there's any way House
would take me seriously as his boss?

515
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,135
Where is this coming from?
Did Cuddy say something?

516
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,266
We talked. She intimated.

517
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,808
And you want my advice
on how to usurp him?

518
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,680
It's very ancient Rome, you'll
need a toga, of course, a sword.

519
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,743
It's not a coup. I just want to figure
out some way we can work together.

520
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,855
I mean, I keep the team running
from an administrative point of view,

521
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,324
House doesn't have to deal
with the red tape. It's a win-win.

522
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,156
I'm sure he'll see it that way.

523
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,330
Do you have any advice
on how to approach him?

524
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,592
How to deal the guy?

525
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,826
No.

526
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,203
But you won't
tell him we talked?

527
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,304
No.

528
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,107
There is no way this
is going to happen.

529
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,757
Epstein-Barr titers
are through the roof,

530
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,959
the most common viral
cause of aplastic anemia.

531
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,094
So what I'm saying is...

532
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,538
Fetal hemoglobin's also
elevated. Just a wee bit.

533
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:36,614
Could indicate...

534
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,173
You see that in sickle cell.

535
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,378
Not all sickle cell
patients are black.

536
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,581
None of her other blood panels showed
any sign of sickle cell, which means

537
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:48,355
either something's changed drastically
since yesterday, or this isn't her blood.

538
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,020
Of course it is.

539
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,688
Metaphorically.

540
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,391
Look, I couldn't do the tests.

541
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,404
I tried, but there wasn't
enough blood left over.

542
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,038
If you'd just let
me do the biopsy.

543
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,702
No way.

544
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,335
I just got back
from a suspension.

545
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,279
And if it wasn't for me,
you would've been fired.

546
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,510
Why don't you just get
the sample yourself?

547
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,294
Since when have you
cared what your boss said?

548
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,878
I don't care what anybody
says, I care what they do.

549
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,254
Right now Blackpoleon Blackaparte
has got the nurses on red alert.

550
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,316
I can't get into
the patient's room.

551
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,329
So, come on, I'll draw the
enemy fire, you outflank them

552
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,907
get in there, get the
bone marrow sample.

553
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,092
Can't.

554
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,568
Who you more afraid of?

555
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,770
I'm not afraid of Foreman, I agree
with him. All the tests back him up.

556
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,244
All the tests have
not been done.

557
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,316
You do realize that Blackaparte's
reign is only temporary.

558
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:48,411
I also realize that no matter what I
do, you're still gonna treat me like crap.

559
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,823
"Crap" is a relative term.

560
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,625
I never even
made it to the room.

561
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,795
Nurses called the attending
as soon as a trocar was ordered.

562
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,038
You used her real name?

563
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,208
I just processed your
patient's discharge papers.

564
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,574
She's on her way out right now.

565
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,312
Wait up.

566
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,612
It's all right,
she's gonna stay.

567
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,678
Wonderful. Oh, bite me.

568
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,750
I don't need to hear
the riot act again.

569
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,384
How'd you like
another medical test?

570
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,194
What? Sit.

571
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,390
Why?

572
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:36,194
So you don't crack your
skull when you pass out.

573
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,201
Just do it.

574
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,835
You know what colchicine is?

575
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:42,966
No.

576
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,306
Well, don't feel
bad. It's for gout.

577
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:48,245
It's got nothing to do with anything
you've ever pretended to have.

578
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,372
I'm not pretending to...

579
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,814
Shut up.

580
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,381
Colchicine decimates
your white blood cells.

581
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,887
Leaves almost no trace.

582
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,786
It's great for faking
your way into hospitals.

583
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,984
I didn't fake my way... Shut up.

584
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,594
You've been
doing this for years.

585
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,829
Don't worry, it's
probably not your fault.

586
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,358
When you were a kid,
you had a close relative

587
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,199
who had a chronic
disease, probably your sister.

588
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,734
And you saw all the attention she
got while you were left alone, ignored.

589
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,602
And it really, seriously
screwed you up.

590
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,709
I do not have a
relative... Shut up!

591
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,377
I'm trying to give
you what you want.

592
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,853
And save your life.

593
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,020
You have aplastic anemia.

594
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,995
What, are you trying
to scare me now?

595
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,726
It means you're not
just sick in the head.

596
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,836
Problem is, the rest
of you appears well.

597
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,337
So I gotta make you seem as
sick as you're supposed to be

598
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,067
by injecting you with a drug

599
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,666
that simulates the symptoms
that you actually have.

600
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:58,542
All you need to know is, you've
hit the Munchausen's jackpot.

601
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:03,350
I'm gonna give you a cocktail of
insulin for seizure and colchicine

602
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,079
to kill your white count.

603
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,719
This will absolutely confirm
my diagnosis of aplastic anemia.

604
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,628
There is one small catch.

605
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,693
If you've actually done something
to yourself to cause the anemia,

606
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,292
then I'm wrong.

607
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,034
And if I do what I plan to do,

608
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,406
then the treatment will kill
you instead of saving you.

609
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,771
So I need to know.

610
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,808
Have you been taking anything
besides the insulin, the ACTH,

611
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,746
and the pills Cameron
left in your room?

612
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,782
No.

613
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:44,295
Good. Give me your arm.

614
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,965
It was my mom.

615
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,342
She had MS.

616
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,671
She was in and out
of hospitals all the time.

617
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,345
People were always
trying to do things for her.

618
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:11,387
Bring her food, or brush
her hair, or make her happy.

619
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,524
People cared.

620
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,398
She died when I was 16.

621
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,435
Then there was no one.

622
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,265
Boo-hoo.

623
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,776
Where are you going?

624
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,810
I obviously can't be
around when it happens.

625
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,218
Well, what are you gonna
do, you're just gonna...

626
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,313
Relax, you know the drill.

627
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,425
People walk by here
all the time, you'll be fine.

628
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,780
So, barely out the door
and she has another seizure.

629
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,187
She must have somehow
grabbed insulin on the way out.

630
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,434
Once she's stable, we
need to get her out of here

631
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,120
before she does more
damage to herself.

632
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,520
We can't.

633
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,863
Her white count's down.

634
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,658
Sorry, I missed that.

635
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,361
Hearing's been off since
the Ricky Martin concert,

636
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,632
some <i>cholo</i> kicked
me in the head.

637
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,675
White count, hematocrit,
and platelets are all off.

638
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,575
Her bone marrow's shutting down.
She actually has aplastic anemia.

639
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,737
Say what?

640
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,213
All her other labs show
nothing that would...

641
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,309
Labs, shmabs. A good
diagnostician reads between the labs.

642
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,286
You were right.

643
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,324
Hey, we're not here to
play the blame game.

644
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,082
These things happen.

645
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,288
Sometimes doctors send
people out on the street to die

646
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,263
after other doctors
have warned them

647
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,411
that they're sending people
out on the street to die.

648
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,958
There's no way you could know.

649
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,395
I'll go give her the news.

650
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,477
Who are you?

651
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,775
I'm Dr. Foreman. I'm
in charge of your case.

652
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:23,078
You have aplastic anemia,

653
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,823
which means your bone
marrow has shut down.

654
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,621
Your body can't make
new blood anymore.

655
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:30,822
Are you sure?

656
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,457
I went back and checked your
old records. It makes sense.

657
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,065
The aplastic anemia's apparently
been developing for months.

658
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,567
I'm sorry, we should
have caught it earlier.

659
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,802
So

660
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,407
It's not just the latest white count
that's leading you to feel this...

661
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,347
I know this is scary.

662
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,512
But a bone marrow
transplant could cure you.

663
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,056
A marrow transplant
could kill me.

664
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,183
The other option is
weekly blood transfusions,

665
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,486
injections of GCSF.

666
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,864
It's a lifelong regimen.

667
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,695
Yeah, I don't want that.

668
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,324
You sure?

669
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,566
I don't want to be cruel here,

670
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,701
but you've jumped through a lot
of hoops to get this sort of attention.

671
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,670
I just want to be healthy.

672
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,542
It's not so much fun
when you're actually sick.

673
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,847
No.

674
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,761
We'll check the registry.
See if there's a donor match.

675
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,332
Thank you.

676
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,941
We have to kill all the old bone
marrow before we give you the new stuff.

677
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,707
You'll have no immune system.

678
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,924
We'll keep you in a
sterile room for two weeks

679
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,146
to make sure everything's dead,
then we'll give you the donor marrow.

680
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,313
It'll take another couple
weeks until it takes hold.

681
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,981
You won't feel a thing.

682
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,288
If you get uncomfortable for any
reason and need to talk, don't yell.

683
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,794
Walls are four
inches thick, lead.

684
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:14,360
Use the microphone.
Are you ready?

685
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,960
Okay.

686
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,501
Where's Dr. House?

687
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,858
Turn it off!

688
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,294
Now what?

689
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,439
How long has she been in there?

690
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,954
Three minutes. What's going on?

691
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,227
She doesn't have
aplastic anemia.

692
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,493
She has an infection. No.

693
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,562
Her white count would be
through the roof. Hers is on the floor.

694
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,471
Well, body does crazy things.

695
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,134
"Body does crazy things."

696
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,442
That explains everything!

697
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,603
She had no fever.

698
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,876
'Cause her self-inflicted Cushing's
suppressed her immune system.

699
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,910
Stopped her from having
a fever, hid the infection.

700
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,752
<i>Clostridium perfringens</i>
could cause the bruises,

701
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,052
the schistocytes, the anemia.

702
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,559
Explains everything
except the white count.

703
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,521
Augmentin is a lot safer than
destroying her immune system.

704
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,088
Why don't we try that?

705
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,463
You're taking the safe
course? What's going on?

706
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,436
There's lots of explanations
for a low white count.

707
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,804
Name one that fits her case.

708
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,115
Colchicine.

709
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,753
I figure that she'd gotten her
hands on it and self-medicated.

710
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,495
That's brilliant of her.

711
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,595
Take the exact medication that
would confirm your diagnosis.

712
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,003
People do crazy things.

713
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,869
You injected her against her
will just so you could be right?

714
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,340
She consented.
She's mentally ill!

715
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,502
But she smells oh-so-sweet.

716
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,908
She would've gotten sicker when
I said she was gonna get sicker

717
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,679
except Cameron dosed
her with antibiotics.

718
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,743
Just hold this. Is
everything okay?

719
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,412
Pull my finger.

720
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,921
Grapey.

721
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,756
You have a bacterium.
It's on all of us.

722
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,597
But the bruises you gave yourself
with the Cushing's made a lovely home.

723
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:06,063
Bacteria moved in, parked
their cars on the lawn.

724
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,571
There goes the neighborhood.

725
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,268
By neighborhood, I
mean, your internal organs.

726
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,643
So, should we put her
on the Augmentin, boss?

727
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,010
Or do you think she
injected herself with grapes?

728
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,780
I love the smell of
pus in the morning.

729
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,048
Smells like... victory.

730
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:33,197
If you were serious about the
offer, I'm serious about accepting.

731
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,769
I'd like to run the department. And
you said it yourself, things run smooth.

732
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,967
Except for the part where
House went behind your back

733
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,477
and KO'd the patient
with insulin and colchicine.

734
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,876
There was no reason
to suspect an infection.

735
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,513
Even House didn't
think it was an infection.

736
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,559
You would have done
the same thing I did.

737
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,518
And I'd be just as wrong.

738
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,018
What House did was
insane. But he saved her life.

739
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,089
He got lucky.

740
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,989
He got her to admit
she's got a problem.

741
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:04,722
She's agreed to outpatient
treatment. He gets lucky a lot.

742
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,396
Did you ever really
intend to give me this job,

743
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,167
or were you just trying to
stop me from stepping down?

744
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,765
Well, you've got two
more weeks in charge.

745
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,940
Hopefully the next
case will go better.

746
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,353
She should've died.
House is not a hero.

747
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,216
A person who has the
guts to break a bad rule,

748
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,985
they're a hero.

749
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,763
House doesn't break
rules, he ignores them.

750
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:43,735
He's not Rosa Parks,
he's an anarchist.

751
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,900
All he stands for is the right for
everyone to grab whatever they want

752
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,736
whenever they want.

753
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,168
You tell doctors that's okay,

754
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,910
your mortality rate is
gonna go through the roof.

755
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,284
Kind of digging this whole
Foreman-in-charge thing.

756
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,522
Give me those.

757
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,456
Frees me up to watch my soaps,

758
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,025
catch a movie in the
afternoon, have lunch with you.

759
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,128
Yeah, that's a big
change for you.

760
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,260
Now Cuddy's on
Foreman's ass, not mine.

761
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,111
You couldn't live with
Foreman as your boss.

762
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,475
Why not?

763
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,409
People can change, you know.

764
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,957
Your white count is way down.

765
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,510
We're going to need to admit
you, just to run a few more tests.

766
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,660
Whatever you think is best.

767
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:04,078
Last race at Belmont.
Put it all on the five

768
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,343
to win.
