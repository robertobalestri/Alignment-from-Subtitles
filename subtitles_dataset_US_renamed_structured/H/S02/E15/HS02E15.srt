1
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:26,249
<i>Your weight is 113.9 pounds.</i>

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,758
You gonna make me hurt you?

3
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,835
I didn't think so.

4
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,304
Are you all right?
Did I hurt you?

5
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,973
Bob!

6
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,782
Bob! What's wrong? What
happened? Talk to me.

7
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,212
Oh, my God! Okay,
honey, hang on, hang on.

8
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,082
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

9
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,788
Yes, we need an ambulance
at 10600 Xavier, unit 4-B.

10
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,887
My husband can't breathe.

11
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:41,291
Oh, my God, he's turning blue. You
have to send someone now, please!

12
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,461
Hurry!

13
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,240
You blow-dry your hair?

14
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,540
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

15
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,976
You blow-dry your hair?

16
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,376
Excuse me for actually
caring what I look like.

17
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,214
I think the word you're
looking for is "obsessing."

18
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,580
You've been at it
for almost an hour.

19
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,747
If you wanted in, all you
had to do was say so.

20
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,087
I don't want in. I want sleep!

21
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,518
It's about time you got up
anyway. It's almost 9:00.

22
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,431
This isn't gonna work.

23
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,458
What? You staying here.

24
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,536
You're kicking me
out? After one night?

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,771
Why, you think we
should try counseling first?

26
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,771
Why do you want to
sleep on a couch anyway?

27
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:37,375
You got money. At least
until the divorce is finalized.

28
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,019
I'll be out of your hair
tomorrow. What's left of it.

29
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,739
It was three days ago.

30
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,798
My throat got really
dry and then my tongue

31
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,707
felt like it was blowing
up like a balloon.

32
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,973
I assume somebody
checked for food allergies.

33
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,446
The first two doctors both did.

34
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,914
Next one said it
was a panic attack.

35
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,918
The one after that wanted
to take his tonsils out.

36
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,783
The last one had no idea,
just referred us to Dr. House.

37
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,220
It says the attack was preceded

38
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,621
by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

39
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,653
Yeah. What were you doing?

40
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,030
Awesome.

41
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,770
A sex fiend with
a swollen tongue.

42
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,169
Just think of all the places I
can make Foreman search.

43
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,405
He's not a sex fiend. He's
a happily married man.

44
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,968
No such thing.

45
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,312
What are you doing?

46
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,349
Testing a new caffeine
delivery system.

47
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,415
He didn't get his beauty sleep.

48
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,259
Wilson's moved in and apparently
has unusually loud toenails.

49
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,627
If they're into rape fantasies,

50
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,290
S and M is on the menu as well.

51
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,734
Neck trauma could cause vocal cord
paroxysms, which could cause choking.

52
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,739
I didn't see any sign of trauma,
and they were remarkably open.

53
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,206
I asked about STDs

54
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,369
and they admitted participating
in a threesome a few months ago.

55
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,413
A hundred bucks says they're
as miserable as the next couple.

56
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,742
Another guy, or girl?

57
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,285
Girl. His wife's
college roommate.

58
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,246
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

59
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,620
They're looking for something.

60
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,568
If you're happy, you've
got nothing to look for.

61
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,925
His wife arranged it for
an anniversary present.

62
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,657
If you ask me, if two
people really trust each other,

63
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,062
a threesome once
every seven years

64
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,725
might actually help a marriage.

65
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,273
Okay, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

66
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,103
I'll take the bet.

67
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,370
Maybe the first
doctor was right.

68
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,107
Food allergy explains
the anaphylaxis.

69
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,443
Could be neurological.

70
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,246
Progressive bulbar paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

71
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,413
No. ALS would affect his
facial muscles before his throat.

72
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,456
What if the problem's
not in his throat?

73
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,584
That would be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

74
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,252
Says who? The patient.

75
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:05,197
And since most patients can't
tell their ulna from their anus,

76
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,785
I'm guessing this
guy also doesn't know

77
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,598
the difference between
choking and suffocating.

78
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,298
His throat might be fine, his
lungs might be messed up.

79
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,501
Get more blood, a chest CT
and a body plethysmograph.

80
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,887
Unless, of course, you think
we should be asking the patient

81
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,140
where his anus is first.

82
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:25,213
It feels like I have to urinate
and then when I try to go...

83
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,483
Pull up your pants.

84
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,222
It's my prostrate, isn't it?

85
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,191
Nope, not your prostrate.

86
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,427
Herpes.

87
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,990
Herpes?

88
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,224
Herpes. Your turn.

89
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,499
If it makes you feel any better,

90
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,095
half the patients who come into
this place have some sort of crotch rot.

91
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,536
No, it doesn't.

92
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,167
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

93
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,177
Have you had any
sex in those 20 years?

94
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,713
Yes, of course. Then
that's how you got it.

95
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,773
The only person I've
had sex with is my wife.

96
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,946
Bummer.

97
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,119
Take this once a day. Tell
your wife to do the same.

98
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,589
It's not going to cure it,

99
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,618
but it will lessen the
frequency of the outbreaks.

100
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,595
But, there must be some mistake.

101
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,823
You got any kids?

102
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,898
Yeah. Any of them
take guitar lessons?

103
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,792
No. Tennis? Art? Acting?

104
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,100
My daughter does karate, why?

105
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,664
Give this to her sensei.

106
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,266
Oh, wait.

107
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,675
Does your wife play tennis? No.

108
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,207
That's what I figured.
Never hurts to make sure.

109
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,349
For Miyagi.

110
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,722
I'm gonna close the shutter now.

111
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,691
I need you to pant,
kind of like a dog.

112
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,919
That's good. Keep going.

113
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,734
Can I ask you a
personal question?

114
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,465
I guess.

115
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:56,099
The threesome
and the role-playing.

116
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,702
Is that because
things get boring?

117
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,606
No.

118
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:06,243
We just enjoy our fantasies.

119
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,354
Are you married? No.

120
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,688
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

121
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,927
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

122
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,401
They fail because
while they're dating,

123
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,804
people pretend to be the person

124
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,240
they think their partner
wants, and then...

125
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,404
Well, there's only so
long you can keep that up.

126
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,911
Maybe they are that person while
they're dating, but then they change.

127
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,452
People thinking their
partner will change?

128
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,784
That's another
reason marriages fail.

129
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:49,620
People don't change, at least
not in any way that really matters.

130
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,535
I think you've had
enough caffeine.

131
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,837
You were right. It's not
his throat, it's his lungs.

132
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,002
The plethysmograph revealed
decreased lung capacity.

133
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,875
And the CT showed lung scarring.

134
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,710
It's definitely interstitial
pulmonary fibrosis.

135
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,512
What's not definite
is the cause.

136
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,779
There's no arthritis,
no sarcoidosis.

137
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,946
He's not on any
prescription meds.

138
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,353
And he's a wedding photographer.

139
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,949
So I doubt he got exposed to
coal dust or asbestos at work.

140
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,688
Cause could be idiopathic.
Can't be idiopathic.

141
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,822
Idiopathic means without a known
cause. What I meant was that...

142
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,809
What you meant was you
don't know what the cause is.

143
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,735
Just say that and we can
avoid this conversation.

144
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,537
No applause?

145
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,335
What's his current
condition? Stable.

146
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,173
Well, then we can
wait. Wait for what?

147
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,009
For whatever you can't figure
out to cause something else.

148
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,208
You know it's going to.

149
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,444
It's possible the IPF
could just continue to...

150
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,488
There's something wrong
with his skin. Do something.

151
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,072
Okay, stop scratching.
Let me look at it.

152
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,689
I can't. This is
driving me crazy.

153
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,824
Stop scratching, so
we can... Make it stop!

154
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,334
Okay. Make it stop!

155
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,927
Make it stop!

156
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,871
Now we've got
something to discuss.

157
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,181
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy, splotchy red blotchies?

158
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,689
It's obviously not a reaction to
medication. We haven't given him any yet.

159
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,020
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not,

160
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,686
can cause both lung
scarring and the splotches?

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,989
Where are you going?

162
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,362
To complete the second half
of the caffeine delivery system.

163
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,192
Either talk louder,
or get in here.

164
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,739
Same color coming
out as going in.

165
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,289
Do you think that's
a marketing thing?

166
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,839
A lupus could cause
lung scarring and a rash.

167
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,612
Or could still be
a food allergy.

168
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,620
We've already ruled
out allergies. Did we?

169
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,352
Where's Cameron?

170
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,220
We're in the men's room.

171
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,783
We need an allergy
expert in here.

172
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,255
This can wait two minutes.

173
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,630
You don't know that.

174
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,602
Chase thinks that food allergy
should still be on the table.

175
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,214
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

176
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,537
Some homeopathic studies
have found a connection

177
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,487
between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

178
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,068
which could cause
lung inflammation.

179
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,636
Yeah. And some homeopathic
studies have also found

180
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,773
that ground-up
spiders can cure cancer.

181
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,511
Can I go now? No.

182
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,881
Lungs, skin, skin, lungs.

183
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,988
Sklungs?

184
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,491
Lungs, skin,

185
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,559
throat.

186
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,000
Heavy metal toxicity.

187
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,939
It explains the
lungs, the itching,

188
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,874
the swelling in his
tongue and throat.

189
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,274
I thought you didn't believe there
was anything wrong with his throat.

190
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,348
I never said I
didn't believe it.

191
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,055
I just said I had good
reason to doubt it.

192
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,107
And now?

193
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,153
I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

194
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,156
The patient's a little old to
be chewing paint off the walls.

195
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,158
Nor does he drink well
water, eat fish every day,

196
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,785
or do anything else that could
have exposed him to heavy metals.

197
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,853
He and his wife worked a wedding
at Cabo San Lucas last month.

198
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,094
A lot of pottery in Mexico is
contaminated with lead-based paint.

199
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,602
Now aren't you
glad you joined us?

200
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,867
Search their house, screen
his blood and hair for lead.

201
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,033
Test for mercury and
arsenic while you're at it.

202
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,045
And, Chase, find out
what the resort cooks with,

203
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,604
if they repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

204
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,313
But I don't speak Spanish.

205
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,114
Then it'll be challenging.

206
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,326
Good Lord, what is that smell?

207
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,599
Stuffed pepper.

208
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,799
Stuffed with what? Vomit?

209
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,186
I thought you were
going to a hotel.

210
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,949
I found an apartment. I
can move in on Monday.

211
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,924
Is that fast enough
for you? What's today?

212
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,785
Where'd you get all that
stuff? Not from your kitchen.

213
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,429
Don't you ever eat anything besides
canned soup and peanut butter?

214
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,727
Don't you ever eat
anything that doesn't look like

215
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,637
it's been rolled onto your
plate by a dung beetle?

216
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,871
Try it.

217
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,547
It's good, isn't it?

218
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,742
No.

219
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,313
Just better than it looks.

220
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,293
How much beans and rice
do you think you'd have to eat

221
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,852
from a ceramic pot painted
with lead-based paint

222
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,558
to get enough lead into your
system to damage your lungs?

223
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,261
Are we talking a child,
or an adult? Adult.

224
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,667
Then I would say a lot.

225
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,672
You'd have to eat beans
every day for months.

226
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:04,310
Now, why do you have a season
pass to the New Yankee workshop?

227
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,039
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

228
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,309
How much more
suspenseful can you get?

229
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,351
I'm... I was watching something.

230
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,477
No, you were about
to watch something.

231
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,387
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

232
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,155
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick, too?

233
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,856
People can metabolize
toxins at different rates.

234
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,922
We'll test it to be sure.

235
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,402
Have you done any
recent renovations? No.

236
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,835
Have any problem
with bugs or rodents?

237
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,533
Just the occasional ant.

238
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,571
Use bug spray?

239
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,509
No, I hate the smell.

240
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,748
Luckily both of us are pretty
anal about keeping things clean.

241
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,012
Yeah, I can tell.

242
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,489
You think ants are the problem?

243
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,160
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

244
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,262
These aren't pancakes. These
are macadamia nut pancakes.

245
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,273
Wilson made them
and they're amazing.

246
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,138
She says she
doesn't use bug spray.

247
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,643
Like little silver dollar
slices of heaven.

248
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,202
Some ants are
poisonous, maybe...

249
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,214
Forget the 72 virgins.

250
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,307
If I blow myself up in
a crowded restaurant,

251
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,784
I'm going to be asking
for a plate of these babies.

252
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,515
Was the ant big and
red or small and black?

253
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,647
Medium and brown.

254
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,318
Halle Berry brown
or Beyoncé brown?

255
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,293
Is there a difference?

256
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,595
Is there a difference?

257
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:36,062
Army ants could devour, dissolve,
and eat a cow in a matter of hours.

258
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,770
Australian Bull ants,
on the other hand,

259
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,302
nasty little bastards, but more
of a nuisance than a threat.

260
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,933
No surprise there.

261
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,273
Beyoncé.

262
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,512
Well, then that's not it.

263
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,674
How much clay did
he eat at the resort?

264
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,843
It's a five-star,
$400 a night place.

265
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,352
They don't cook
with ceramic pots.

266
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,446
Tox screen? No evidence
of lead, mercury or arsenic.

267
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,522
Run them again.

268
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,560
Call the resort, find some
disgruntled employee to talk to.

269
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,822
Go back to the home...
It's not heavy metals.

270
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,887
The symptoms say it
is. The tests say it's not.

271
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,042
Well, who you going to believe?
The symptoms or the test?

272
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,036
It could also be a food
allergy. Cameron says it's not.

273
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,128
If your test could be
wrong, why can't hers?

274
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,003
His diet hasn't changed
since he was a kid.

275
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,769
His favorite food is cornflakes.

276
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,674
Which, I assume,
he eats with milk,

277
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,974
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

278
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,742
Start treating him
for lead poisoning.

279
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,305
It's the most
likely heavy metal.

280
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,614
And, yeah, you can test him for
allergies for dairy, wheat and legume.

281
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,925
I am not having an affair with
my daughter's karate instructor

282
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,431
and I did not give
my husband herpes.

283
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,525
Find out where House is.

284
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,931
If you're convinced
it's allergies,

285
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,134
why are you giving him
drugs to treat lead poisoning?

286
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,836
We're not convinced
of anything yet.

287
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,055
I think I need something
else, this cream isn't working.

288
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,241
We're doing everything we can.

289
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,348
Sorry. No, no. It's not
my back, it's my feet!

290
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,116
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

291
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,249
Oh, it's on my
socks. It's burning.

292
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,994
I don't see anything.

293
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,896
Please, take my socks off!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

294
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,432
Stop! Stop! What did
you just scratch him with?

295
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,836
If there was an
allergic reaction,

296
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,875
it would be on his
back, not on his feet.

297
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,353
Oh, it's burning,
please make it stop!

298
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,642
We need some gabapentin in here.

299
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,319
Excruciating pain in
the lower extremities.

300
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,388
Not a sign of a food allergy.

301
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,047
Means there's a
neurological problem.

302
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:41,060
More significantly, it's yet another
classic sign of heavy metals.

303
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,358
And I just did yet another
hair and blood test for lead,

304
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,608
and everything else he could
have possibly been exposed to.

305
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,863
They're all negative. It's
gotta be something else.

306
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,369
Lupus could cause... HOUSE: No.

307
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,235
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

308
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,275
So it's not a typical case.

309
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,038
We should get an
ANA. It's not lupus.

310
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,608
The symptoms don't match.

311
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,013
And the tests don't
match heavy metals.

312
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,092
It's happening again.
He's not breathing.

313
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,266
Tongue swelling, airway's
closing. He's not getting any air.

314
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,598
His lungs are clear. We're
gonna have to intubate.

315
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,967
Try to relax, Bob. This is
gonna help you breathe.

316
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,266
Oh, my God!

317
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,205
He's gonna aspirate!
Need suction!

318
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,300
What's happening? Suction.

319
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,369
There's too much vomit. We're
never going to be able to intubate.

320
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,507
We're gonna have to trach
him. He's not breathing!

321
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,767
<i>His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.</i>

322
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,903
It's lupus-induced kidney
failure. If we don't start treatment...

323
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,913
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

324
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,041
So would lupus nephritis, and
it also causes tissue swelling.

325
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,211
He's choking on his
tongue, not his feet.

326
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,720
The corticosteroids we gave
him to control the inflammation

327
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,881
can cause facial swelling.

328
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,152
Still not his throat, but
you're getting closer.

329
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,558
I'm doing an ANA and
a serum compliment.

330
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,359
If you're so sure, why waste time
with tests? Just start treatment.

331
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,990
Oh, no wait. We
can't do that because

332
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,228
we already have and
it's not working! Ergo.

333
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,533
Corticosteroids aren't the only
treatment for lupus nephritis.

334
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,803
We could also try cyclophosphamide
or immunosuppressants.

335
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,209
Only if we confirm the diagnosis
with an ANA serum compliment,

336
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,271
anti-DNA, IV pyelogram
and kidney biopsy.

337
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,785
So, now you suddenly believe
in tests? The symptoms...

338
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,218
The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

339
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,812
Yeah, we all get it.

340
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,451
Unless you've got proof, and
can tell me which heavy metal it is,

341
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,620
I'm starting
treatment for lupus.

342
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,597
Systemic lupus erythematosus

343
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,037
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

344
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,631
Attack normal tissue.

345
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,603
Now, it could be what
caused the lung inflammation,

346
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,055
as well as the
swelling in his throat.

347
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,878
And now what appears to
be damage to his kidneys.

348
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,216
The treatment's
usually steroids.

349
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,912
But he's already
on the steroids.

350
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,817
If the tests confirm
we're on the right track,

351
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,549
there are other
medications we can try.

352
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,284
And if those don't work?

353
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,826
Well, lupus, it's a
chronic condition,

354
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,191
but it's generally controllable.

355
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,526
What do you mean, "generally"?

356
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,431
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

357
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,400
Cardiovascular and renal.

358
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,972
That's the heart
and the kidneys.

359
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,975
Right? Yeah.

360
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,922
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

361
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,599
Enjoying the salad?

362
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,501
There's no lettuce.

363
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,270
I'm aware that
there's no lettuce.

364
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,335
But do you know when I
obtained this knowledge?

365
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,677
Actually, I'm in the middle of
something. When I made it. For myself.

366
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,217
Well, how was I
supposed to know?

367
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,251
Well, I was hoping
this might tip you off.

368
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,756
That's kind of selfish,
don't you think?

369
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,090
I offered to make you
some. You said no.

370
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,062
That was before I
tasted the pancakes.

371
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,621
It's a compliment.
You should be flattered.

372
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,225
Here.

373
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,462
It's Mrs. Lambert's
herpes test results.

374
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,767
Mrs. who?

375
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,569
You've told more
than one patient

376
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,509
his wife is sleeping with his
daughter's karate teacher?

377
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,137
You wanna stir the pot, you
have to clean up the mess.

378
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,738
What would you
do if you got herpes?

379
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,026
She's coming in at 5:00. Don't
make me come looking for you.

380
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,362
Actually, I'd know what you'd
do. But I mean, a normal guy?

381
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,754
And don't be calling in
sick, or saying that your team

382
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,190
needs you for some
kind of emergency consult.

383
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,717
He suspected that maybe his wife
had also been playing pickle games.

384
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,855
He could just keep
it on the down low,

385
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,297
just wait till she got infected.

386
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,605
You'd give your own wife
herpes, just to shift the blame?

387
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,778
He'd give his own mother herpes

388
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,395
if it got him out
of clinic duty.

389
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,871
Course, maybe it was the wife.
Maybe she was the one who...

390
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,911
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

391
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,349
She's waiting outside, why?

392
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,149
Go search her. What, you
mean her medical records?

393
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,055
If I meant that, good
chance I'd have said that.

394
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,318
You think she's poisoning him?

395
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,863
His symptoms should be
getting better the longer he's here.

396
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,398
Instead, they're getting worse.

397
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,163
So, either she's poisoning
him, or it's not heavy metals.

398
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,705
We've done over 10 different
heavy metal tox screens.

399
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,297
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

400
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,933
They don't get
into the air or food.

401
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,620
They only get in you if
someone puts them in you.

402
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,055
And the only way
we're going to find out

403
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,412
what she's sprinkling on his
cornflakes, is to search her.

404
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,315
I am not going to accuse a woman
of trying to murder her own husband

405
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,114
based simply on
some paranoid theory.

406
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,654
It's the only explanation.

407
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,519
We've eliminated
every other possibility.

408
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,615
We have not eliminated
every other possibility!

409
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,302
Has he responded to
the latest lupus treatment?

410
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,437
He's only been
on it a few hours.

411
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,623
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

412
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,064
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis or sarcoidosis.

413
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,999
She's all that's left.

414
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,134
Do it!

415
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,703
Hi.

416
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,212
I'm Dr. House.

417
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,248
Mind if I take a
look in your purse?

418
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,811
Why?

419
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,251
Because I'm going to
need to search it and you

420
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,051
for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

421
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,383
Why would I want
to hurt my husband?

422
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,926
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

423
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,701
Go ahead.

424
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,269
You satisfied?

425
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,313
Absolutely not!

426
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,443
She agreed to let me
search everywhere else,

427
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,730
but this she says no to.
Doesn't that tell you something?

428
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,213
Yes, that she doesn't want some
lunatic doctor searching her vagina

429
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,226
with a flashlight.
Cameron can do that.

430
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,386
I am not going to...

431
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,339
The woman hasn't left the
hospital since they arrived.

432
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,508
Whatever she's using, she's
obviously hiding somewhere.

433
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,763
She's not poisoning him!
It's the only explanation!

434
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,463
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

435
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,577
because you're angry that
you can't find the answer,

436
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,816
and you're taking it out on her.

437
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,502
And you are protecting
a complete stranger

438
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,841
based on some childishly romantic notion
that people are all so happily married

439
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,122
they don't want
to kill each other.

440
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,546
You're calling me
childish? Grow up!

441
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,607
Shut up! Both of you.

442
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,676
And stay away from his wife.

443
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,881
Sorry, I'm not giving you
permission to assault someone.

444
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,268
Let's see.

445
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,778
I'm thinking, Colonel Mustard,

446
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,713
in the music room
with a candlestick.

447
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,980
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

448
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,247
Same thing. No, it isn't.

449
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,251
If we don't find out
what she's using

450
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,604
and start treatment immediately,

451
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,559
he'll be dead in a
week. If you're right.

452
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,655
If Foreman's right, you'd have
basically raped an innocent woman.

453
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,066
My wife fired the maid.

454
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:44,201
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

455
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,273
You did your maid? I
was nice to our maid,

456
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,616
which annoyed
her, God knows why.

457
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,014
Maybe she was doing her.

458
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,679
No one was doing her, all right?

459
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,517
But you still feel responsible?

460
00:25:56,588 --> 00:26:00,423
Even though nothing or no
one was done, it's still your fault.

461
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,020
I offered to keep paying her
salary until she found another job.

462
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,765
But she refused to take any
money without doing any work, so...

463
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,301
You want someone to clean
your apartment? It's on me.

464
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,001
You're supposed to be moving
out, not moving more people in.

465
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,544
She's not moving
in, she's gonna clean.

466
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,722
Maybe I should just move
out, and the two of you could...

467
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,839
Oh, God!

468
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,576
- Oh, God, no!
- Call a code!

469
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,712
Please!

470
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,782
Charging 360. Give him Epi.

471
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,986
Clear!

472
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:36,885
Still no pulse.

473
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,794
Charging! Clear!

474
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,130
I got a pulse.

475
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,933
Pupils are reactive.
You still with us?

476
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,735
He was without oxygen for less
than a minute. It can't be hypoxia.

477
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,435
Could be a stroke.

478
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,141
Bob, can you hear me?

479
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,474
Back up. Bob?

480
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,538
Bob, talk to me.
Bob! Honey, please!

481
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,348
Bob, can you hear me?

482
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,954
He's awake. Can you hear me?

483
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,054
Honey?

484
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,190
Honey.

485
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,763
Yes, she is quite
the little actress.

486
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,981
So, let's say she's
not poisoning him.

487
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,880
There's nothing more to discuss.

488
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,261
We've got lung
and kidney failure,

489
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,914
neurological symptoms
and now, cardiac arrest.

490
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,288
A systemic disease with multi-organ
involvement is the definition of lupus.

491
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,169
The auto-immunosuppressants
aren't helping.

492
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,992
We should start him on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

493
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,896
Yeah, and interferon.

494
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,197
Interferon isn't an
approved treatment for lupus.

495
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,430
You're not still thinking...

496
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,994
Interferon isn't an
approved treatment

497
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,699
for heavy metal
toxicity, either.

498
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:59,370
True. But it's pretty much the only
thing we can do for a viral infection.

499
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,010
We didn't consider it because...
Because it doesn't make sense.

500
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,140
There's no fever.

501
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,844
Because he's got
no immune system.

502
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,580
Thanks to the immunosuppressants

503
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,087
you prescribed
for lupus treatment.

504
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,674
He didn't present
with a fever, either.

505
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,020
Because at that point,

506
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,219
he was a post-viral autoimmune
reaction, which again,

507
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,024
thanks to the immunosuppresants

508
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,688
you prescribed
for lupus treatment.

509
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:22,428
His immune system basically rolled
out the red carpet for the dormant virus,

510
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,993
waking it up and turning it
into a present viral infection.

511
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,732
Give him interferon.

512
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,969
But if it is lupus, interferon
could make it worse,

513
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,443
suppress his bone marrow
even further. Which is more likely?

514
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:36,141
Rapidly progressing, acute onset
lupus in a patient already on steroids,

515
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,775
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

516
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,409
We didn't miss anything.

517
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,184
Well, then I'm wrong.

518
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:45,383
And you shouldn't
give him interferon!

519
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:52,161
Intravenous interferon has been shown to
be effective against some viral infections.

520
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,168
But I thought you said it wasn't
an infection. You said it was lupus.

521
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,500
The increasingly rapid
progression of the symptoms

522
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,539
has caused us to reconsider.

523
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,575
And what if you're
wrong here, too?

524
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,303
What if it's not a virus?

525
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,402
There are risks with interferon,

526
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,937
especially in a patient who's
already immunosupressed.

527
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,546
Look, at this point, your lungs,
kidneys and heart are all failing.

528
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,420
We really don't have any choice.

529
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,089
I cheated.

530
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,854
What?

531
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,764
Ninth grade, Earth Science.

532
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,132
Mr. Foley.

533
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,170
I sat behind you, so I
could cheat off of you.

534
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,578
And I let you cheat,
so you'd sit behind me.

535
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,276
I thought we were going
to grow old together.

536
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,821
In ninth grade?

537
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,088
No, tenth.

538
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,388
What, you had to
make sure I put out first?

539
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,194
No, I knew you'd put
out in the seventh grade.

540
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,843
I love you.

541
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,348
Yeah, I know.

542
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,812
Say you love me.

543
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:56,478
No.

544
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,420
Why not?

545
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,726
Because you're not dying.

546
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,589
Say it anyway.

547
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,697
You gonna make me hurt you?

548
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,378
I love you.

549
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,322
It's not working.

550
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,295
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

551
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,089
Up the dose.

552
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,462
We already have.

553
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,556
Apparently not enough.

554
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,760
I don't think it's a virus.

555
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,271
We've been running titers for everything
we can think of. They're all negative.

556
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,045
Increase the interferon. House.

557
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,809
You got a better
idea other than lupus?

558
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,078
No.

559
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,380
Then up the dose.

560
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,812
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's
appointment was over an hour ago.

561
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,985
Sorry, I was sick. And my team
needed an emergency consult.

562
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,298
Your wife has herpes.

563
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,361
What?

564
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,137
That's impossible,
I don't have any...

565
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,732
You haven't had an outbreak
yet. Don't worry, you will.

566
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,177
You rutty jackass! Me?

567
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,805
I haven't been with
anyone in 20 years.

568
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,392
You're the one with
the blisters on his...

569
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,078
Doesn't mean
that he got it first.

570
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,347
You don't need to have an
outbreak to spread the virus.

571
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,720
Yeah, and you're the one always
talking about wanting more sex.

572
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,814
From you.

573
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,350
And maybe I'd get more if you
weren't getting it somewhere else.

574
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,139
Well, you two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

575
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,961
Don't even think of
dumping this in my lap.

576
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,866
There's gotta be some
way to prove that it's him.

577
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,836
I'm sorry, there is no test.

578
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,998
Either of you two ever
sit on a public toilet?

579
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,034
Well?

580
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,368
Of course.

581
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,706
Herpes can live for short
periods of time outside the body.

582
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,460
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes...

583
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,314
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible

584
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,682
to get infected
by a toilet seat.

585
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,085
But they'll also tell you not
to use the same bath towels

586
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,099
to dry your crotch and
your face during an outbreak.

587
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,182
See the contradiction?

588
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,250
I always use a paper cover.

589
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,353
Always? Yes, of course.

590
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,920
What about you?

591
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,931
No. I never knew.

592
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,467
Oh, please. This is ridiculous.

593
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,902
Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi.

594
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,467
What?

595
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,511
He could believe that you can
get herpes from a toilet seat,

596
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,547
or he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

597
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,106
The toilet seat makes sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

598
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,515
But she'd only
refused to believe

599
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,213
such a well presented
lie if she were innocent.

600
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,882
And since you both can't be
innocent, you rutty jackass!

601
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,186
You!

602
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,856
Thanks a lot. My pleasure.

603
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,694
Honey, wait. Please!

604
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,892
Wow!

605
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,865
Not bad.

606
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,714
She has a family history
of arthritis, doesn't she?

607
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,342
Yeah, she does. What does...

608
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,886
Stop the interferon,

609
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,548
and do another heavy metal
screen, only this time test for gold.

610
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,352
You don't still
think that she...

611
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,086
Don't let her go
to the bathroom.

612
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,390
Why would you care if she...

613
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:24,957
Hello?

614
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,560
Oh!

615
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,106
Hi, I'm Lady.

616
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,136
What did you do to my closet?

617
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,234
I cleaned it.

618
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,007
Dr. Wilson said that
I could go ahead...

619
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,549
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet.

620
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,316
Where's the wood box?

621
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,410
Wood box?

622
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,787
Yes, the wood box. It's made
of wood, and it's box shaped.

623
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,297
It's been in the back of this
closet since the day I moved in.

624
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,794
I didn't see any kind of...

625
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,920
You may not have seen it,

626
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,076
but you've obviously moved
it. The question is where.

627
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,123
Well, I did not move
anything, I just...

628
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,532
It was in this closet.

629
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,093
Then you came, now
it's not in this closet.

630
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,867
Okay. What type of box?

631
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,135
Wood! Wood!

632
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,071
A brown wood box. It's got
a metal handle on the top,

633
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,739
looks like a tackle or tool box.

634
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,375
Ah, you mean the chest.
The one that's under the bed?

635
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,268
Do you need to fix something?

636
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,876
Thanks.

637
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,220
Well, fine, then I'll go
to one on another floor.

638
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,225
Actually, they're not
working there either.

639
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,896
Every bathroom in the
whole hospital is out of order?

640
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,330
Well, the water...

641
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,334
I'm going to the bathroom.

642
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,804
Where is she? Had
to go to the bathroom.

643
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,002
I told you not to let her.

644
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,807
What was I supposed
to do? Tie her up?

645
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,540
Why not? She likes that.

646
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,255
What are you doing?

647
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,691
Your hand is wet.

648
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,160
Sorry, must be nervous.
I've got some bad news.

649
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,431
What?

650
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,534
The damage to your
husband's lungs is permanent.

651
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,842
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

652
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,472
he should regain full
neurological function.

653
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,347
Other than the fact that he's not
going to be running any marathons,

654
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,250
he should be fine.

655
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,054
But that's good news, isn't it?

656
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,757
Not finished.

657
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,121
When I was a kid,

658
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,623
my dad was stationed
at a Marine base in Egypt.

659
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,823
We were in the middle of nowhere

660
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,994
and there was absolutely
nothing for a kid to do,

661
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:52,867
except look for a mummy's tomb.

662
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,738
You didn't want me to go to the
bathroom because you wanted to tell me

663
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:01,245
my husband is going to be fine
and that you used to live in Egypt?

664
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,180
I didn't have a problem with
you going to the bathroom.

665
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,151
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

666
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,986
I never actually found a mummy,

667
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,390
but I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

668
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,929
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride

669
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:22,058
is not only great for toughening
ruby glass, but if it's mixed with gold,

670
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,034
it turns bright purple.

671
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:35,313
Now, either your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold,

672
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:40,911
or you've been sprinkling your husband's
cereal with gold sodium thiomalate.

673
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,781
It's an arthritis remedy. It's
rarely used here in the U.S.,

674
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,122
but it's still popular in
Mexico. Gotta give you props.

675
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,658
Never heard of anyone
using gold before.

676
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,634
It's almost poetic.

677
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,966
That's ridiculous.

678
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,135
Heavy metal tox screen
for gold was off the chart.

679
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,983
Why would I... Because
you were trying to kill him.

680
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,349
I'd love to know the
why behind that why.

681
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,950
But you're not gonna
tell me, are you?

682
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,759
You're wrong.

683
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,697
I love Bob.

684
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,667
I never said you
didn't love him.

685
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,802
How could somebody do that?

686
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,071
Sit by someone's
bedside day and night

687
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,375
helping them, comforting them
and at the same time killing them?

688
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,416
Maybe he was having an affair.

689
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,348
Maybe she was having an affair.

690
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,079
Or maybe she just
gets her kicks out

691
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,848
of slowly sucking
the life out of a guy,

692
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,184
watching him suffer.

693
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,815
He must have done
something to her.

694
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,257
Yeah, he had it coming.

695
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,657
I didn't say he deserved it.

696
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,196
The only thing he did
wrong was marry a sociopath.

697
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:01,199
Or maybe she just got
tired of being married.

698
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,293
Didn't want to admit
to family and friends

699
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,464
that the marriage everyone
thought was perfect, wasn't.

700
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,770
Shouldn't one of us stay with
her? What if she tries to run?

701
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,038
Yeah, Cameron, go back there.

702
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,806
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

703
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,103
We started chelation
therapy with dimercaprol.

704
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,114
Thrilled to hear it.

705
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,147
His kidney function
hasn't improved.

706
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,821
It will.

707
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,521
He's gonna need
a lung transplant.

708
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,354
He's becoming more
attractive by the minute, isn't he?

709
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,790
You're pleased.

710
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,003
You think you've proved that
every marriage is a mistake.

711
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,767
Do I look pleased?

712
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,790
Ignorance is bliss.

713
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,589
<i>You have one new message.</i>

714
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:44,024
<i>Hi, this is Blake Hanson
calling for Dr. Wilson.</i>

715
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,064
<i>I got a better offer
for the apartment.</i>

716
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,621
<i>I know I offered
it to you already,</i>

717
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,963
<i>so if you match the offer
you can still have the place.</i>

718
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,579
<i>Make sure you call me first thing
in the morning and let me know.</i>

719
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,868
<i>Otherwise, well,
you've got my number.</i>

720
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,951
<i>Message deleted.</i>
