1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:02,045
<i>Previously on</i> House.

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,469
You high, popo?

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,482
<i>A cop with a sense of humor.</i>

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,566
You check the cop car.

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,770
Also check his personal
car, work, home.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,810
Foreman, get out!

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,257
Am I the only one
who finds this funny?

8
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,216
You stole my article.
I wouldn't do that.

9
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,218
We're not friends.
We're colleagues.

10
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,813
Son of a bitch!

11
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,116
Now we're both exposed.

12
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,657
In 10 minutes
time... You die, I die.

13
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,987
It's not gonna happen.

14
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,185
Time of death.

15
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,126
12:26 p.m.

16
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,162
I need a bone saw.

17
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,078
I'm sorry. I wish I could.
They said you won't...

18
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,298
I just want a little tiny
slice of this guy's brain.

19
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,782
That's all I need, just enough
to tell me what's killing Foreman.

20
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,641
A thin slice of Joe's brain could
also cause a public health crisis.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,590
It's not a good idea to scream "fire"
every time somebody lights a match.

22
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,309
Don't downplay this, House.

23
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,045
You put both of them
in isolation for a reason.

24
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,520
Joe's death elevates this
situation to a Biosafety Level 3.

25
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,286
Level 3. Did you call Jack
Bauer? I called the CDC.

26
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,136
Well, tell them I'll be
really, really careful.

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,000
We don't have the proper equipment
for you to be really, really careful.

28
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,942
You can do whatever you want to
Foreman, but the CDC will do this autopsy.

29
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,697
Whatever. The point is, we'll be
lucky to get results in three days.

30
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,261
I told them how urgent
this is. And they told you...

31
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,364
"We'll have the
results in three days."

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,533
Oh, that's a shame.

33
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,352
Because Foreman will
never get to know what it was.

34
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,504
He'll be dead in 36 hours.

35
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,271
Maybe this is a toxin. Maybe
it's not contagious at all.

36
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,476
You're killing Foreman
because of a "maybe."

37
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,952
Well, you have 36 hours
to figure out which one it is.

38
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,462
Foreman. Come here, fast.

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,500
What's going on? When
are they doing the autopsy?

40
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,829
You're doing it, now.

41
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,370
You ever studied how they
used to do ice pick lobotomies?

42
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,114
I read about it in med
school. Why would I...

43
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,937
Shove an ice pick into the eye
socket just above the tear duct,

44
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,068
bang it a couple times with
a hammer, get a sample.

45
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,305
What's going on, House?
Foreman, you can't do it!

46
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,077
You'd be in violation of... Can't
do the time if you're not alive.

47
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,811
You! I need you to suit up.

48
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,716
Get that equipment
away from Dr. Foreman.

49
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,688
Take your time, guys.
Just tell them to go slow.

50
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,780
It won't be your fault.

51
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,502
Foreman, we don't even know what
kind of contagion we're dealing with.

52
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,271
Which is why we need to
chop into the guy's head!

53
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,923
It's dangerous. Not
to you, Foreman!

54
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,863
There are other
ways to diagnose you.

55
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,867
Yeah? You have the answer?

56
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,400
Foreman, do it now!

57
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,462
I am warning you! Do not...

58
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,172
What are you doing?

59
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,872
That didn't feel right.

60
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,637
He's blind.

61
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,747
But he thinks he can see.

62
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,182
Same as the cop.

63
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,720
We need something
to bag the sample.

64
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,256
Forget it. You just
biopsied a mattress.

65
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,885
No, no, no. I'm fine. House,
there's the sample. Get it, test it!

66
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,319
You got to test that sample!

67
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,457
Apparently I was optimistic
about the 36 hours.

68
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,367
Intractable, unbearable
pain is up next.

69
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,934
Sure you don't wanna reconsider
that whole autopsy thing?

70
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,608
Physically, his eyes are fine.
The problem's isolated to his brain.

71
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,017
Damage to the occipital lobe
extends from the primary visual cortex...

72
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,079
We should retest him
for bacterial meningitis.

73
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,147
If it was meningitis,
we'd all be sick.

74
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,522
His CSF might show signs...

75
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,460
LP's pointless. We
already did a brain biopsy.

76
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,894
It was negative.

77
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,766
Toxic mold. If it was
toxic mold, I'd be sick.

78
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,272
How do we know you're not
sick? Do I seem happy to you?

79
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,397
Never.

80
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,201
It was funny.

81
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,267
Well, let's assume
it's not blood-borne.

82
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,870
If you start cracking
jokes, we can reassess.

83
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:10,213
In the meantime, stay away from
people and animals that you care about.

84
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,584
Guillain Barré.

85
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,888
Neither of them had
any sort of paralysis.

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,520
Joe could have died before the
paralysis had a chance to present.

87
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,121
What about arbovirus?

88
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,698
Start treatment. For arbovirus?

89
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,234
You think our Jersey beat cop
has been spending a lot of time

90
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,600
exploring deep, dark Africa?

91
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,139
Treatment for everything,
likely or unlikely.

92
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,834
If you can think
of it, treat for it.

93
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,844
Mixing that many meds will
create all sorts of toxic interactions.

94
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,006
We'll box his liver, trash his
kidneys. There's got to be a better way.

95
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,777
Of course there's a better way!

96
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,843
It's that body sitting in the room
with him that Cuddy won't let us touch!

97
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:52,960
Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals,
parasites, it's got to be one of them.

98
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,460
Where are you going?

99
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,020
See if I can find
another brain to biopsy.

100
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,366
They're gonna lock Joe up
downstairs until the CDC gets here.

101
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,938
Foreman, you can't see.

102
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,034
Right.

103
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,976
House wants to start you on
some meds. They're in the air lock.

104
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,037
For what? Leading
candidate is toxic mold.

105
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,907
Is Cameron sick?

106
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,814
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

107
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,717
You're casting your net a little
wider than toxic mold, aren't you?

108
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,723
Guillain Barré is
also on the table.

109
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,488
This is an oval shape.
That's either an "L" or a "7."

110
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:31,521
I'm guessing an "L." Levofloxacin,
because you can't rule out bacteria.

111
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,133
8-0-0. That's the dosage
for acyclovir in case it's viral.

112
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,037
Square. No, more like a rhombus.

113
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,269
That's fluconazole for fungus.
There's about eight others here.

114
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,742
You're treating
me for everything.

115
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,073
You have no idea what I've got.

116
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,046
House thinks this is
the best course of action.

117
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,275
House is desperate.
House is never desperate.

118
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,942
Something we give you will work.

119
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,646
Yeah, we should start
treating all patients this way.

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,780
When they get sick,
they just take everything.

121
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,848
It's better than doing nothing.

122
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,816
Hello?

123
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,518
I'm at the cop's place.

124
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,622
I need to retrace your steps.

125
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,293
You don't think the "treat him for
everything" approach is enough?

126
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,798
Where did you start
your search? The kitchen.

127
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,345
Okay, well, tell me everything
you did, everything you touched.

128
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,700
If you went to the john, I
want to know when and why.

129
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,604
It started with samples
from the mold in his sink.

130
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,589
What next? That's
it. Then I left.

131
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,181
<i>What do we do now?</i>

132
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,249
Wait for Steve
McQueen to get giddy.

133
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,885
Excellent plan.

134
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,848
Hey, Dad, it's Eric.

135
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm not doing too good.

136
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,753
How's Foreman?

137
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,393
You're accessing a
webcam? Cuddy's shower.

138
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,530
Are you a fan of
the Brazilian? I...

139
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,295
Is that your kitchen?

140
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,199
Well, obviously I
couldn't bring him here.

141
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,999
He's been exposed to
whatever Foreman's got.

142
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,473
You infected Steve? Why didn't
you just get a rat from the pet store?

143
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,739
Because I needed one
with a clean medical history.

144
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,307
Who knows what kind of
antibiotics they gave those rats?

145
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,810
So this is your plan, just sit
here and watch your rat all day?

146
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,682
It shouldn't take long.

147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,552
I've got the AC blasting, I
soaked the floor of his cage.

148
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,092
As soon as he gets
sick, I do an autopsy.

149
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,320
As soon as he's dead.

150
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,330
Right after he gets sick, there's a
good chance he'll get hit in the head

151
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,299
with a cane-shaped object.

152
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,198
Normally you just use
your patients as lab rats.

153
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,067
It's a nice change.

154
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,112
First symptom is euphoria.

155
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,205
Well, how do you
know if a rat's euphoric?

156
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,809
He doesn't usually climb on his
water bottle like that, does he?

157
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,183
The seizures only seem to
happen when she's in her car seat.

158
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,026
She starts to rock and grunt.

159
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,656
Is she responsive? No, no.

160
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,633
It's like she's in a zone

161
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,603
and her abdominal
muscles become dystonic.

162
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,440
Big word. Someone's
been on the Interweb.

163
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,807
I looked up a few
articles on epilepsy.

164
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,255
You know, there's actually some
really great youth soccer leagues

165
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,714
that would cater specifically
to her special needs,

166
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,549
and I think it might explain why she's
been having a hard time in preschool.

167
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,987
Well, let's confirm your diagnosis
before you have her held back.

168
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,754
Strobing lights and high-pitched
sounds can provoke a seizure.

169
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,360
You're a goof. Takes
one to know one, loser.

170
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,561
Wait, that means I'm
a loser. Scratch that.

171
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,170
These episodes, she
gets sweaty afterwards?

172
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,504
Soaking wet.

173
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,041
And does she seem
upset by them or just tired?

174
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,274
No. She kind of
thinks it's funny.

175
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:47,112
You mix rocking, grunting, sweating
and dystonia with concerned parents

176
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,747
and you get an amateur
diagnosis of epilepsy.

177
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,848
In actuality, all
your little girl is doing

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,987
is saying "yoo-hoo
to the hoo-hoo."

179
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,590
She's what?
Marching the penguin.

180
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,066
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.

181
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,928
Finding Nemo.

182
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,333
That was funny.

183
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,744
It's called "gratification
disorder." Sort of a misnomer.

184
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,644
If one was unable to gratify
oneself, that would be a disorder.

185
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,648
Are you saying
she's masturbating?

186
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,015
I was trying to be discreet.
There's a child in the room.

187
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,085
This is horrifying.

188
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,883
Epilepsy is horrifying.

189
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,424
Teach your girl about
privacy and she'll be fine.

190
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,460
There you go. Thank you.

191
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,729
One afternoon, and you're
on pace to set the record

192
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,630
for most patients
seen in a month.

193
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,396
You're upset that
I'm doing clinic hours?

194
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,268
Wow, that is so like
rain on your wedding day.

195
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,501
For the past three hours, I have been
on the phone with the CDC while you are...

196
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,872
How's that going, by the way?
They promised to expedite...

197
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,287
Tough to do an autopsy when
they haven't even picked up the body.

198
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,213
It's tough to treat your patient when
you're not even on the same floor.

199
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,340
Go. Clinic is covered.

200
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,793
I go watch the
meds drip into his IV,

201
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,528
you think that'll make
the treatment work faster?

202
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,378
Go to your office,
play with your ball,

203
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:56,489
write on your white
board, insult your team.

204
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,419
Do whatever it is that
you do to figure things out.

205
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,984
Feeling guilty? It's not too
late to change your mind.

206
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,973
Go call the CDC, tell
them you were just joshing.

207
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,523
Keep avoiding Foreman's
case until he dies.

208
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,329
Then I'll drown in guilt.

209
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,304
Feeling any better?

210
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,638
How are you doing?

211
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,265
I'm not the patient.

212
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,071
Is your sed rate elevated?

213
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,746
No. So far, it looks
like I lucked out.

214
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:26,044
Cameron, it looks like you
left the tourniquet on the bed.

215
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,591
You can see again?
The treatment's working.

216
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,085
The question is,
which treatment?

217
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,962
We'll start weaning him off one at
a time. Which one do we start with?

218
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,809
I don't care if you
do it alphabetically.

219
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,073
Just stay on top of his vision.

220
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,613
First sign of regression means
we've taken him off the wrong one.

221
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,200
Latest blood work. Foreman's amylase
and lipase levels are three times normal.

222
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,210
The pancreas is failing.

223
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,303
A toxic side effect of his meds.

224
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,504
Philosophical question:
How do you wanna die?

225
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,607
Old age.

226
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:30,173
Your choice is currently between 4
hours from now and 14 hours from now.

227
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,116
So I'm assuming that
means you want the latter.

228
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,883
The cocktail's working. My
vision's almost completely restored.

229
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,357
The meds are curing what's in your
head, but they're trashing your pancreas.

230
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,190
That's why you're puking and you
can't stand up without screaming.

231
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,855
So lower the dosages.

232
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,593
Less stress on my pancreas,
still battle the infection.

233
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,500
Lower dosages will
still be toxic. I don't care!

234
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,597
I can handle the pain
of the pancreatitis.

235
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,403
I don't think you can handle
life without a pancreas.

236
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,305
If we keep you on these meds,

237
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,909
you'll spend the last four hours
of your life being able to see.

238
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,618
We take you off,
you'll go blind again.

239
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,888
But it'll give us time to figure
out what's eating your brain.

240
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,194
Fine. What do we do next?

241
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,793
Eric?

242
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,103
Dad?

243
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:34,574
Yeah, you two can get caught up
later. Sir, I need you to come with me.

244
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,953
House, what is this?

245
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,718
He's not a "what," he's a "who."
They even have the right to vote now.

246
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,920
Rodney Foreman, Cuddy.
Cuddy, Rodney Foreman.

247
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,497
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
This is Foreman's dad.

248
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,032
Yeah, I got that.

249
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,295
And Dr. Cuddy here is
the Dean of Medicine.

250
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,496
Remember that cool
autopsy I was telling you about,

251
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,562
the one that would
save your son's life?

252
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,583
She's the one who can
give us the green light to do it.

253
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,044
I understand you
don't want them to do it.

254
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,977
Dr. House didn't
seem to know why.

255
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,683
Mr. Foreman, I am doing
everything I can to get the CDC...

256
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,519
Won't be soon enough.
And my decision to follow

257
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,525
public health
safety protocols...

258
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,757
Oh, don't blame the rules. Don't
hang this on policy and protocol.

259
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,698
I'm well aware that it
may cost your son his life,

260
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,050
just as I am well aware
that my decision has

261
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:31,329
a devastating effect
on family and friends,

262
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,930
without having them
paraded in front of me.

263
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,037
Your son has an unknown,

264
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,176
contagious, deadly infection.

265
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,515
If we don't contain it here, even
more people could be at risk.

266
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,177
And I am capable of
empathizing with those people too,

267
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,416
without having them
paraded in front of me.

268
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,865
I understand.

269
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,485
What's wrong with your hand?

270
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,889
It's called a
muscle contracture.

271
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,492
I thought this thing
was in your brain.

272
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,530
It is. It just means
the infection's moved

273
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,726
to the primary motor cortex,
which controls the muscles.

274
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,465
Aren't you glad you
sent me to med school?

275
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,870
Does it hurt? No.

276
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,608
Is it gonna?

277
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,971
The other guy,

278
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,842
he didn't seem
to suffer too much.

279
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,648
He just went in his sleep.

280
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,762
Steve's still acting normal.
No sign of contractures.

281
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,099
They got the cop's body
in a locked, airtight bag.

282
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,336
And a guard on the door.
Those feds are seriously paranoid.

283
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,740
He hasn't gotten up to
pee in hours. He's due.

284
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,008
You haven't sprinkled
Senokot granules on his donut?

285
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,913
His bowels would open
up like the Red Sea.

286
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,417
He wouldn't eat the donut.

287
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,019
Have you seriously
been down here for hours?

288
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,147
No.

289
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,052
I had to pee a couple times.

290
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,991
You've got to stop
blaming Cuddy for this.

291
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,061
Given that it is her fault,
that seems appropriate.

292
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,597
That part is her fault.

293
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,895
The part where somebody
wasted his time in the basement

294
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,698
plotting the overthrow of a
government agency, that one's on you.

295
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,171
Only thing I can do is think. You
can pretty much do that anywhere.

296
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,034
As long as no one's bugging me.

297
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,779
<i>Did you call your brother?</i>

298
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,274
No.

299
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,076
Did you? No.

300
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,779
It's not a big deal.

301
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,724
I sure would have liked
to see Mom, though.

302
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,962
You know she
can't travel anymore.

303
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,902
You tell her?

304
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,604
Why?

305
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,240
Just upset her for a while.

306
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,640
Then she wouldn't
remember for a while.

307
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,477
She should know.

308
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,083
She's lost a lot of who she was.

309
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,360
She can't deal with
something like this.

310
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,901
And you can?

311
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,075
I still know you're
going to a better place.

312
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,715
It's easy for you, isn't it?

313
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:12,023
As long as you believe I'm going
to a better place, dying ain't so bad.

314
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,854
I don't want you to be afraid.

315
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,664
If I'm not afraid of dying, what
the hell should I be afraid of, Dad?

316
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,066
I thought you believed.

317
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,403
I did.

318
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,176
I'm not so sure anymore.

319
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,019
I'm going to pray for you, Son.

320
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,389
I suggest you do the same.

321
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,580
Field of vision is regressing and
he's reached an eight on the pain scale.

322
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,140
The disease pattern is following
the exact course as Joe's.

323
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,049
Only it's moving much
faster in Foreman.

324
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,851
Good. It's an anomaly.
Anomalies tell us things.

325
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,085
Why would this go faster in
Foreman? What's different?

326
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,039
Could be a different
strain of the same disease?

327
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,859
Right! We were wasting all this
time looking for an unknown disease.

328
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,730
We should have be looking for a
different strain of an unknown disease.

329
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,201
Joe's a cop. He's
into physical fitness.

330
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,967
He could have had a more powerful
immune system, stronger metabolism.

331
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,634
Foreman's black. What?

332
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,486
How long have you been
sitting on this information?

333
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,971
Lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis,
hypertension, diabetes, stop me anytime,

334
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,914
they all affect black
people more than whites.

335
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,212
Check everything.

336
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,845
Bacterials, fungals,
toxins, parasites.

337
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,481
Look for anything with a
documented racial disparity.

338
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:28,920
Wait.

339
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,290
The rat's showing symptoms? No.

340
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,930
He's completely healthy.

341
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,363
Maybe that's the difference
between Foreman and the cop.

342
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,169
How you feeling?

343
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,711
Why are you here?

344
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,916
Because you're a friend,
and I should be here.

345
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,917
I'm sorry House used my
dad to try and manipulate you.

346
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,821
You've got integrity.

347
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:04,625
You aren't going to change your mind just
because you're confronted by my father.

348
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,697
Thank you.

349
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,291
Just like I'm not
gonna forgive you,

350
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,336
just because you come by
here and ask how I'm feeling.

351
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,769
You know I've had no choice.

352
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,773
Of course you had a choice!

353
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,570
Regulations are clear.

354
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,135
And the punishment for
violating those regulations,

355
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,044
is it death?

356
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:27,282
Because frankly, I'm okay if
you get a fine, a suspension...

357
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:31,882
Hell, you can spend a couple
years in jail if it saves my life!

358
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,921
You're dying too fast.
Couldn't agree more.

359
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,556
Hey, Cuddy. Having a nice visit?

360
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,392
What's that?

361
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,897
Legionella...
Legionella pneumophilia.

362
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,907
And why are you carrying
a vial of it around with you?

363
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,705
Foreman was perfectly healthy
before he got this infection,

364
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,040
but our cop wasn't.

365
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,546
He had Legionnaire's disease,

366
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,050
and our cop didn't turn into brain
food until we cured the Legionella.

367
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,053
The Legionella slowed
down the disease.

368
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,878
Why would that happen?

369
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,890
No idea. I just
know that it did.

370
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,619
So you want to infect Foreman?

371
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,354
You gonna tattle to the CDC?

372
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,828
The meds can't help
me, but a disease can?

373
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,559
Forget it. Just take the
pain away. Put me under.

374
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,261
If I put you under, I
can't monitor your pain.

375
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,271
If I can't monitor your pain, I won't
know if the Legionella's working.

376
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,637
I'm not consenting
to you giving me...

377
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,008
What was that?

378
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,856
Wish there could have been
a puff of smoke or something.

379
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,781
Would have been
much more dramatic.

380
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,342
Keep your slippers on.

381
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,984
Wouldn't want
you to cut your foot.

382
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,786
You feeling any better?

383
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,426
I can't breathe. I'm dizzy
and I can barely hear anything

384
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,192
over the sounds of
my lungs crackling.

385
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,563
That's the Legionella.

386
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,776
Oh, you figured that
out from the symptoms

387
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,071
or from the vial of stuff
tossed in my room?

388
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,850
I'm trying to be professional here,
and there's no reason to be nasty.

389
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm in pain. So is House.

390
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,868
And he's a delight.

391
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,639
He doesn't try to
kill his colleagues.

392
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,679
You can remove
the thermometer now.

393
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,192
It's down almost a whole
degree. How's the pain?

394
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,819
Great. It's the good kind.

395
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,394
How bad is it compared
to an hour ago?

396
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,162
No worse.

397
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,566
Is the Legionella helping?

398
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,272
Yeah.

399
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,583
Good. But not great.

400
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,115
It didn't fix anything,
it just slowed it down.

401
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,731
The whole point was to give
Steve a little more time to get sick.

402
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,281
What are you gonna
do if he never gets sick?

403
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,890
Brilliant.

404
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:54,361
Cameron, what type of illnesses
affect humans but not rats?

405
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,833
Why are you asking me that?

406
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,381
Because I'm sure that you
spent the first 12 years of your life

407
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,837
dreaming of being a vet.

408
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,464
The rat is not getting sick.

409
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,441
Cameron is not
getting sick. Sorry.

410
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,501
It's okay, it's not your fault.

411
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,891
Presumably, you're still healthy because
whatever it is, it's not blood-borne.

412
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,474
Steve has no excuse. He did
everything that Foreman did.

413
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,781
Some bacterial
infections don't affect rats.

414
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,152
Foreman tested negative for every bacterial
infection that would affect his brain.

415
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:21,182
And what infections could he be
positive for but test negative for?

416
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,396
When we test for infections,
we look for antibodies.

417
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,593
<i>Now, what if the patient is
infected but has no antibodies?</i>

418
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,932
<i>What if the body is not
fighting the infection?</i>

419
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,598
Why would... I asked first.

420
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,884
Let's start with the "what."
We'll deal with the "why" later.

421
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:39,003
If the body doesn't recognize the
infection, our tests come back negative,

422
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,118
and the disease rampages
through the body unstopped.

423
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,843
Exactly like the cop
and exactly like Foreman.

424
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,880
Now, what if the patient was
then exposed to a second infection,

425
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,045
like Legionella?

426
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,851
<i>The body would recognize that
infection, increase the white count,</i>

427
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,414
<i>send in the troops
to start fighting,</i>

428
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,960
<i>and the initial infection would
get caught in the crossfire.</i>

429
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,290
So the question becomes

430
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,332
what type of bacterial infection
affects humans but not rats,

431
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,765
and the human body would
be unlikely to recognize?

432
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,101
The answer is listeria.

433
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,201
I'm starting you
on amp and gent.

434
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,470
So, you're basing this theory
on the tests being negative

435
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,135
and your rat being healthy?

436
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,203
And the fact that
Legionnaire's is helping you.

437
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,647
But the medicine you want to
give me will put an end to that.

438
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,775
Yeah.

439
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,879
And if it's not listeria, all the gent will
do is cure the Legionnaire's disease

440
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,720
and put whatever is killing
me back into overdrive.

441
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,250
Stop asking me questions based
on the premise that I'm wrong.

442
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,794
The antibiotics
are in the airlock.

443
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,907
I think the first biopsy
didn't give us the answer

444
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,772
because you didn't
go deep enough.

445
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,645
I want you to do a
white matter brain biopsy.

446
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,711
Absolutely. Don't blame you.

447
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:54,083
The world is such a complicated place
if you've got higher reasoning skills.

448
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,317
I'm often jealous of small
animals and retarded children.

449
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,157
Take the antibiotics.

450
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,786
There can be minimal
damage if it's done right,

451
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,457
if the surgeons drill
where I tell them to drill.

452
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,524
One slip, you could spend the
rest of your life not being able

453
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,844
to keep your drool
in your mouth.

454
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,564
I'd rather be
disabled than dead.

455
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,936
Sure! I make it look oh-so-sexy.

456
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,966
It's actually not as
glamorous as you might think.

457
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:19,035
The biopsy will tell us
for sure what's wrong.

458
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,113
The antibiotics could
do the same thing!

459
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,443
"Could," not "will."

460
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,573
We try it, we see.

461
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,209
The antibiotics will
bring back the pain!

462
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,555
Pain makes us
make bad decisions.

463
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:43,827
Fear of pain is almost
as big a motivator.

464
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,701
Look, we still have time.

465
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:54,105
I will do that biopsy if I have
to. But not a moment before.

466
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:16,259
Start Foreman on IV
antibiotics. Where's his dad?

467
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,580
Where you're supposed to
be when your son is dying.

468
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:21,164
He's not with him.
He's in the chapel.

469
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,739
Oh, man...

470
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,545
I started your son on a
new course of treatment.

471
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,815
If it works, he'll get better.

472
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,017
If it doesn't, he won't.

473
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,549
While he's not getting better,

474
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,750
he's going to
experience so much pain

475
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,557
that we'll have to put him in
a chemically-induced coma

476
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,758
while we figure
out what to do next.

477
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,529
My son says you're a
manipulative bastard.

478
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:53,470
It's a pet name. I
call him "Dr. Bling."

479
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,806
I assume you're here for a
reason. What do you want from me?

480
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,538
When your son is in a coma,

481
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,583
you're the one who's gonna have to
make the medical decisions for him.

482
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,677
Whatever you decide is fine.

483
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,889
You don't care what I do? I'm
not a doctor. What do I know,

484
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,188
except what Eric tells me?

485
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,959
He says you're the best
doctor he's ever worked with.

486
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,880
I need your help.

487
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,285
There's nothing I can give you
for the pain. I want to be put out.

488
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,117
I can have a nurse in
here in five minutes. No.

489
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,416
Once I'm out, I
might not come back.

490
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,821
I've never done a will.

491
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,663
I'll call a lawyer for you.

492
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,530
I want you to be
my medical proxy.

493
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,072
All the things that piss me
off about you in House's office,

494
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,409
you're too emotional and
too caring, too cautious...

495
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,776
They're all good
things on this floor.

496
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,906
Your dad is... No.

497
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,550
He cares about you. So do you.

498
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,145
I can't do this.

499
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,893
We expect family members to
make decisions about their loved ones

500
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,987
after a 10-minute briefing,
that we're agonizing over

501
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,362
even with years of
medical experience.

502
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,995
That's from my article.

503
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,998
I'm sorry, Allison.

504
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,974
I shouldn't have
stolen your article.

505
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,238
I shouldn't have exposed you.

506
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,679
You were a friend.

507
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,046
I need to know that we're okay.

508
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,514
No.

509
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,423
I'll be your proxy,
but we're not okay.

510
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,600
You're scared you're dying and it's the
only reason you want to set things right.

511
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,034
We're gonna get you
better first and then,

512
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,669
if you still wanna
apologize, I'll be around.

513
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,838
I'll call that lawyer.

514
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,426
Any improvements? No.

515
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,899
As far as we can tell, the only thing the
antibiotics are treating is the Legionella.

516
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,027
I think we need to
consider alternate theories.

517
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,162
Like what?

518
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,569
We do the biopsy. We...

519
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,232
Give the antibiotics more time.

520
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,833
There is no more time. The
pain is almost unbearable already.

521
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,438
So he's almost in unbearable
pain. He's not almost dead!

522
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,775
Which means we have more time.

523
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,826
Mr. Foreman?

524
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,223
We need to put
your son in a coma.

525
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,293
You should be there.

526
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,401
It's a medical procedure, right?

527
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,665
Yeah.

528
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,170
But once we put him
out, if we don't solve this,

529
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,081
he won't wake up.

530
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,384
What should I say?

531
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,854
Should I talk to him
like it's going to be okay?

532
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,429
Or should I be saying goodbye?

533
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,901
I need to know what
people say when...

534
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,561
Just tell him you love him.

535
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,689
Hey, Son. Hey, Dad.

536
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,192
It's going to be okay.

537
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,771
You don't know that.

538
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,970
I know.

539
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:27,944
You don't.

540
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,384
I don't wanna miss you.

541
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,353
I love you too, Dad.

542
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,502
Hey,

543
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,868
it's gonna be okay.

544
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,014
Can we do this
now? Yeah, of course.

545
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,031
I accept your apology.

546
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,624
Why weren't you with Foreman?

547
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,893
I hang out in the basement, you rag
on me. I stay in my office, you rag on me.

548
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,726
Honky just can't buy a break.

549
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,060
Do the biopsy.

550
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:58,070
Based on the cop's progression, I
figure he's got about another four hours...

551
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,399
You figure?

552
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,311
You're playing Russian roulette,
but the gun's pointed at him.

553
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,208
No. Cutting open his
head is what's dangerous.

554
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:08,111
Oh, it's dangerous. Well,
what would people think?

555
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,423
The reason you
don't see patients

556
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,492
is because if you know them,
you'll give a crap about them.

557
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,212
I know you. If you give a crap,

558
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,151
you stop making
outrageous calls.

559
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,298
If this was any other patient,
you'd have damned the risk

560
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,915
and cut their head
open a long time ago.

561
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,289
He's out. The EEG
shows he's still in pain.

562
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,137
The antibiotics have had
more than enough time.

563
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,322
We're doing the brain biopsy.

564
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,662
Not unless you people can't come up with
something clever in the next three hours.

565
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,428
Now. We're doing it now.

566
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,533
Well, who died and
made you boss? Foreman.

567
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,215
It's legal. He's
out of his mind.

568
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,275
Yesterday he was giggling
about a hole in a guy's head.

569
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,754
Then hire a lawyer and challenge it.
In the meantime, Cameron's in charge.

570
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,757
Why would he sign that?

571
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,520
It's nothing personal,
Mr. Foreman.

572
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,758
My son doesn't trust me. How
exactly is that not personal?

573
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,293
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,768
You're sorry? You're
talking about this man's son!

575
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,147
You're denying him
the right to be a part...

576
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,639
Oh, shut up, House.

577
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,300
If you want to do the
biopsy, do the biopsy.

578
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,590
If House tries to interfere, let
me know and I will take care of it.

579
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,012
Yeah, you're a hero.

580
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:20,485
If it wasn't for you, we'd be cutting into
a dead guy's head instead of Foreman's.

581
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,416
Sorry.

582
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,621
Thanks.

583
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,626
That was great! It was
rude and unnecessary.

584
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,721
Yeah. Go away.

585
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,426
Give me time. We're out of time.

586
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,867
An hour. What does
"out of time" mean?

587
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,905
His O2 sats are at 94 right now.

588
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,817
As long as they're above 90, danger
of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.

589
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,106
So what? There's
no point in waiting.

590
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,989
You were right. We should
be cutting into a corpse's head.

591
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,245
Yeah, we should be, except the
CDC's got the cop's body under...

592
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,046
There's got to be other bodies.

593
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,212
You think this thing
has killed other people?

594
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,379
No.

595
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,551
That apartment was a dump.

596
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:03,186
Just because Steve McQueen didn't get
sick doesn't mean some other vermin didn't.

597
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,923
You give me an
hour, I go back there,

598
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,524
I find a dead animal, I cut its
head open instead of Foreman's.

599
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,366
Foreman's already
on 100% oxygen.

600
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,272
Once his O2 sats hit
90, I can't wait any longer.

601
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,677
Where's your suit?

602
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,676
Either you'll find the answer or I'll
find the answer. It doesn't matter.

603
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:33,221
Prep the drill. We've got to be
ready to go if we get the signal.

604
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:11,888
Ninety-two.

605
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,625
I found a blind bird.

606
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,929
Great. How fast can
you get it in here?

607
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,265
I'll know in about 30 seconds.

608
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,030
You better have the bird.
The surgical team's in place.

609
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,456
I screwed up. How can
you not capture a blind bird?

610
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,893
That's not what I meant. I screwed
up the first time through this place.

611
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,726
Foreman told you everywhere he
went. <i>It's not "where," it's "when."</i>

612
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,824
He came here early afternoon.

613
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,337
Me and Steve came through two
hours too late. You were six hours early.

614
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,531
It's the water. The irrigation
system only pumps at...

615
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,370
House! I tested the
water! The water's clean.

616
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,203
House. We tested
the wrong water.

617
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:38,265
He stole cable, he stole
fertilizer and he stole water.

618
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,438
It's riddled with
Naegleria. I know.

619
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,811
You already did the biopsy.

620
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,775
I thought I had no choice.

621
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,898
How's my son?

622
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,367
He has primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis.

623
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,401
It's a parasite that
goes through the nose

624
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,740
and migrates into the brain,
where it feeds on brain cells.

625
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:17,104
The Legionella attacked the parasite.
That's why the disease slowed down.

626
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:18,848
Is it treatable?

627
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,211
We started him
on an antiparasitic

628
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,846
and the amoebas will
clear out of his system.

629
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,624
And he'll be okay?

630
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,729
Then we'll wean
him out of the coma...

631
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,388
Will he be okay?

632
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,801
There'll be no lasting
damage from the parasite.

633
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,331
But the surgery?

634
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,841
We don't know.

635
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,686
Up and at 'em.

636
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,083
How you feeling?

637
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,553
Can you talk?

638
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,964
I don't feel anything.

639
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,365
Are you numb?

640
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:49,305
No, I mean,

641
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,467
I don't feel any pain.

642
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,639
Keep your head
still. Follow my finger.

643
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,219
I'm okay. Your breath stinks,

644
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,349
and you're peeing into a
bag. What are our names?

645
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,329
You did the biopsy?

646
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,197
Thank you. Names?

647
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,496
Cameron,

648
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:20,767
my dad

649
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,265
and the manipulative bastard.

650
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,639
You remembered.

651
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,007
How you doing, Dad?

652
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,103
Great.

653
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,583
Relieved. Great.

654
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,309
What did I have?

655
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,257
Naegleria. Biopsy
showed the amoeba,

656
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,451
the CDC autopsy
eventually found the amoeba,

657
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:44,360
and House found it in
the water on the cop's roof.

658
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,658
Wiggle your left
toes. Wait. What?

659
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,431
You went back and she did the
biopsy? Your left toes, Foreman.

660
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:54,904
I just did.

661
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,533
No, you didn't.

662
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,310
He can't move his toes.

663
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,145
He can move them.
Raise your right arm.

664
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,614
What?
