1
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,605
Good morning.

2
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,850
Hey, Alfredo.

3
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,122
You done already? No.
Not yet. I finish tomorrow.

4
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,358
Mexico playing
Argentina on TV? No, no.

5
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,500
My asthma is very bad today.

6
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,469
Six years, Alfredo.
You can't lie to me.

7
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,417
I'm throwing a dinner...
First thing tomorrow...

8
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,872
Party's tonight.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,035
A little rain and I'm gonna have to
put buckets on the dining room table.

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,080
No clouds, no rain.
I'll tell you what.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,446
You take off, but if it pours
into my guests' wineglasses...

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,984
Okay. Okay, <i>se√±ora.</i>
I'll do it. Thank you.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,364
Spinal cord seems intact.

14
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,770
Take a deep breath.

15
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,571
It hurts. Try.

16
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,142
Breath sounds bilateral. I don't
think he has a pneumothorax.

17
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,337
Just asthma. That and
probably a broken rib.

18
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,879
Tell me when it hurts the most.

19
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,179
Your two little fingers
are darker than the others.

20
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,688
They feel funny. <i>Como</i> needles.

21
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,987
How long have they been
like that? Never noticed before.

22
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,249
Is bad?

23
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,827
Judging by how it looks,
he could lose his hand.

24
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,299
How does falling off your
roof do that to a guy's fingers?

25
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,666
He could have tweaked
a vertebra in his neck.

26
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,568
Could impinge the ulnar...

27
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,607
Sorry, trouble concentrating.

28
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,274
That tank top really
absorbs moisture.

29
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,214
Could impinge the ulnar
nerve, cut the blood flow.

30
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,547
Or it could be disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy.

31
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,984
DIC?

32
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,113
Guy falls off a roof, the
first thought is always,

33
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,228
"It's a clotting problem."

34
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,758
Trauma can activate
the clotting enzymes.

35
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,894
Guy could lose more than
his hand. Thank you very much.

36
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,006
This guy's been working
for me for a long time, and I...

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,556
Do I get bonus points
if I act like I care?

38
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:25,228
Cervical MRI. Work up for DIC.
And start him on a heparin drip.

39
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,796
Who? You wanna know his name?

40
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,433
I'm sure it's in the file.
Or you could ask her.

41
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,411
She's his oldest, bestest friend.
They were in Cub Scouts together.

42
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,209
I'll get started on
the blood tests.

43
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,843
You haven't been a real doctor in 10 years.
You'll make a mess all over the sheets.

44
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,750
I'll do it. You
have clinic duty.

45
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,483
I still know how to handle
a patient. Get me blood.

46
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,819
Lots of blood.

47
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,326
They're better.
They've showered.

48
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,773
You don't need to see him.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,741
One-handed handymen
aren't in big demand.

50
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,582
Talking. That's how
lawsuits are lost.

51
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,177
I know you, Lisa.

52
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,222
You go in, you offer to pay
his medical bills, his wages,

53
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,088
you'll say something
stupid like, "I'm sorry."

54
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,251
You think I'm an idiot.

55
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,090
I think you're not a
lawyer. Don't go in there.

56
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,031
Trust me, House's
people can handle this.

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,227
Yeah.

58
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,538
This might sting a little bit.

59
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,368
The medicine will thin the
blood and help it to circulate.

60
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,377
Those are pretty
nasty scars there.

61
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,769
I work construction.

62
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,316
How long will I
be in the hospital?

63
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,753
Depends how long it takes
us to figure out what's going on.

64
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,688
I need to work. I'll get fired.

65
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,419
I'm sure Dr. Cuddy
won't fire you.

66
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,189
I'm a janitor at fast food
six nights. I need to work.

67
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,629
My mother doesn't make
enough. I can work. I'm old enough.

68
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,393
You're old enough
when you finish college.

69
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,490
Why? You never went...

70
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,411
I never had a big brother
to tell me to shut up!

71
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,735
I promise we'll let you out of
here as soon as we're able to.

72
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,868
Look, I... I am fine. Okay? I
feel better. I go home now.

73
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,970
No. If this is a clotting
problem, it could be very serious.

74
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,708
All right? Look, you
can't make me stay.

75
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,046
Wait... You can't make me stay.

76
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,808
Turn your hand over.

77
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,215
I need to see your hand.

78
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,694
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

79
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,526
We've got a third
finger turning dark.

80
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,897
His PTT is prolonged and
the fibrin split products are off.

81
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,732
He's not clotting properly. It
looks like a mild case of DIC.

82
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,431
Well, obviously not that mild.

83
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,065
This keeps up, his hand is
literally gonna be dead meat.

84
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,270
His hand is connected to his
arm, and his arm is connected to...

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,855
I'm not sure, but I
bet it's important.

86
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,144
All this from
falling off my roof!

87
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,650
Yeah. If only he'd
fallen on his head.

88
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,677
Then he wouldn't have
any of these symptoms.

89
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,122
We need something
stronger than heparin.

90
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,650
Human Activated Protein C.

91
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,060
Looks like Cuddy, same cleavage.

92
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,692
Protein C is indicated
only for severe sepsis.

93
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,326
How many of his limbs have to
be at stake for it to be severe?

94
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,803
But this stuff is
crazy dangerous.

95
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,639
It can cause internal bleeding.

96
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,370
If he bleeds, he could stroke,
he could die. He could get better.

97
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,435
You know, if I try
to scheme like this,

98
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,743
you get that nasty wrinkly
face and screech like a hyena.

99
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,511
It's very sexy, I admit.

100
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,318
Do it.

101
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,427
Protein C is borderline
irresponsible,

102
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,553
except that the safe
stuff isn't doing squat.

103
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,895
It's exactly the type of thing
you would do. Obviously.

104
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,936
It's exactly the type of
thing he'd do. I know.

105
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,063
I think he's trying
to protect me.

106
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,539
Now, that's not the
type of thing he would do.

107
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,802
I overruled him.

108
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,778
He's the best diagnostician in
this hospital, and I overrule him.

109
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,406
You care about this kid.

110
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,713
Your judgment should
be worth more than his.

111
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,346
He also pointed out that I
haven't been a real doctor in years.

112
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,624
Now that sounds like him.

113
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,454
You were just
jerking Cuddy around?

114
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,120
She seriously thought
I wanted to stop her.

115
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,789
One thing Cuddy is
not is clueless. No.

116
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,891
First casualty of this
case is her sense of humor.

117
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,495
That's weird. There's nothing
funnier than almost killing a guy.

118
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm just having trouble
getting up those steps.

119
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,878
When did you start
noticing? Oh, a week ago.

120
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,778
Your blood
pressure's a little high.

121
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,748
I've got something new
that should help you out.

122
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,251
It combines a nitrate
with a blood pressure pill.

123
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,481
It's targeted to
African-Americans.

124
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,845
Targeted?

125
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,055
Yeah. Well, see, we tend to
have nitric oxide deficiencies.

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,237
And the studies show this
drug counteracts that problem.

127
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,356
It's the first drug to... What
kind of studies you talking about?

128
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,161
What kind of studies are there?

129
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,066
They get some patients.
They give them some drugs.

130
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,967
I've had white people
lying to me for 60 years.

131
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,376
You think this is a tan? You
think they tell you everything?

132
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,877
The trouble with us black folk,

133
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,506
we can't tell the difference
anymore between racism

134
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,710
and everybody
gets screwed. Yeah?

135
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,888
Well, how about them cheap meningitis
drugs they're pawning off in Africa?

136
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,153
Gonna tell me that ain't
racism? That's just greed.

137
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,857
You really wanna screw whitey?

138
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:20,025
Be one of the few black men who live
long enough to collect social security.

139
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,666
Take the medicine.

140
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,282
Nurse.

141
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,083
Nurse! Help! Nurse! Help!

142
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,051
Nurse! What's up?

143
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,992
I can't move my arm! I can't move
my arm! Take it easy. Take it easy.

144
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,426
The Protein C side effects we
were worried about, they happened.

145
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,367
Where was the bleed? His brain.

146
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,029
It's causing right
side paralysis.

147
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,074
I've stopped the treatment
and called a neurosurgeon.

148
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,980
I can move it now.

149
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,184
It's okay now, yes? Can I go
home soon? The surgery went well.

150
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,346
But all we did was fix the problem
created by the medicine we gave you.

151
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,059
She says you... You look young.

152
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,725
Are you sure... There's five
of us working on the case.

153
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,789
The others are older.

154
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,359
Why doesn't Dr. Cuddy come to...

155
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,339
That doesn't sound too good.

156
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,046
His fingers are even darker.

157
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,989
His temperature's
102 and spiking.

158
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,256
And the x-ray now
shows lung infiltrates.

159
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,611
Well, the good news
is he won't be bitching

160
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,530
about losing his hand
if he can't breathe.

161
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:36,036
The trauma from the fall could have
caused acute respiratory distress syndrome.

162
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,968
Right. I forgot. Your roof.

163
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,768
It would cause lung
infiltrates and maybe fever

164
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,832
and conceivably
the cyanotic fingers.

165
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,175
The only question
is why. Why what?

166
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,147
Why her weird psychopathology

167
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,707
requires a diagnosis informed
entirely by personal guilt.

168
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,684
Let's assume we've
been wrong up until now.

169
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,552
Let's assume,
just for one second,

170
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,491
that the earth doesn't
revolve around Cuddy's roof.

171
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,558
What if he was sick before
he had his run-in with gravity?

172
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,928
He just didn't notice anything.

173
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,934
Well, pneumonia can cause DIC
which can cause cyanotic fingers.

174
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,061
Pneumonia doesn't
hit that fast. Sure.

175
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,504
Only pavement hits that
fast. It's not pneumonia.

176
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,070
He might have missed
a finger turning dark.

177
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,586
He's not gonna miss
breathing problems.

178
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,408
What else? It's pneumonia.

179
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,640
He wanted to go home.
I thought he was lying.

180
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,845
I told him I had a dinner
party. I made him go up there.

181
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,852
Well, why didn't you just
take out a gun and shoot him?

182
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,551
I thought it was just asthma.

183
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,923
You might've mentioned
this earlier, Doctor.

184
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,485
Maybe we could have sent
some blood cultures to the lab

185
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,226
instead of wasting a day
indulging your self-loathing.

186
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,566
If it's just garden-variety bacterial
pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.

187
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,164
So give him garden-variety Levaquin,
and a garden-variety echocardiogram.

188
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,484
And go check out
the kid's house.

189
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,786
The blood work will show us
which type of pneumonia it is...

190
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,440
If he's huffing nail polish or
pulling the wings off his pet parrot,

191
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,982
this way'll be faster.

192
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,213
And I bet Julio's just dying to
find out what's wrong with him.

193
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,516
Go with her. It's Alfredo.

194
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,288
And I can handle
getting a key and...

195
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:08,294
Rico and I no longer trust you
deciding what's important and what's not.

196
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,499
You ever think about writing
a book on office politics?

197
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,005
Trust me,

198
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,339
it would be a lot worse if I told her
that you had to break into her house.

199
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,542
What? Wait, wait,
wait... Cuddy's house?

200
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,276
See? It is shocking.

201
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,803
The guy's been working there
every day for the last three weeks.

202
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,930
You think it's impossible he
could've picked something up?

203
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,152
I'm not breaking into my
boss's house. I'm your boss.

204
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,022
She's scarier than you are.

205
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,826
She's a woman.
Relax. I'm coming with.

206
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,432
House is having lunch
with his juniors now?

207
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,236
No. Not a chance. Then where
do you think they're going?

208
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,243
I have no idea.

209
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,255
Then why don't you think
they're going to lunch?

210
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,357
Because it's not like House.
That was your point, right?

211
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,691
He had that smug
look on his face.

212
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,159
When he's that
pleased about something

213
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,703
he's gotta tell somebody, and
the only somebody he knows is you.

214
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,554
He's breaking into
Cuddy's home. What?

215
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,082
Why?

216
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,393
Medical reasons?

217
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,288
Why is he so
curious about Cuddy?

218
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,941
Why are you so curious
about his curiosity?

219
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,209
Why are you so
curious about me...

220
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,828
Because you dumped
him and you're married

221
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,235
and they are neither
of those things.

222
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,872
I'm just curious.

223
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,769
Nothing wrong with that.
No. Nothing wrong with that.

224
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,118
What do you think? Red thongs?

225
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,216
I think red thongs.

226
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,390
Okay, 20 bucks says I can get
through this door in 20 seconds.

227
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,155
You're on. Count me in.

228
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,944
No furniture polish, no paint thinner,
nor anything else worth sniffing.

229
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,679
Nothing in here, either,
except a few cockroaches.

230
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,488
Nice. Someone
should fix Alfredo's roof.

231
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,096
So, why haven't you fired House?

232
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,364
It's just, you guys are always
screaming at each other,

233
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,165
and I figure you hate
him, so... I don't hate him.

234
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,473
Why not?

235
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,545
He's a great doctor,

236
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,547
but any other hospital administrator
would have fired him years ago.

237
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,980
Four of them did.

238
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,611
The question is,
why did I hire him?

239
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,684
So, how'd you
know about her key?

240
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,055
You been doing a little
handyman work for Cuddy yourself?

241
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,994
Someone as obsessive and insecure
as Cuddy probably has three extra keys

242
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,621
hidden away within
10 feet of the door.

243
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,895
And you consider
obsession a negative quality.

244
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,365
Insecticide is organic.
Soap is hypoallergenic.

245
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,173
I got the bedroom.

246
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,914
This is where it all happens.

247
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,756
You both went to Michigan. Did
you know him while you were there?

248
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,623
I was still an undergrad,
but, yeah, I knew him.

249
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,389
He was already a legend.

250
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,194
So you just knew him as a
legend? My God, you're subtle.

251
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,860
Anything on your mind?

252
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,064
More cockroaches? Worse.

253
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,504
Beautiful.

254
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,217
There's no way you just
deduced where that key was.

255
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,912
Does this count as red?

256
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,784
You gave yourself 20
seconds and put money on it.

257
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:58,950
Oh, my God.

258
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,521
She's got pictures
of you in here.

259
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,931
Just you. It's like some
kind of weird shrine.

260
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,591
You're kidding. Yeah.

261
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,003
She uses super tampons.
What does that mean?

262
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,071
You two are just too nasty to
each other not to have been nasty.

263
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,217
I can be a jerk to people
I haven't slept with.

264
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,582
I am that good.

265
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,021
There's nothing here.

266
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,785
You ready to go, or you got
some more stuff you wanna sniff?

267
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,520
Whoa! Check this out.

268
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:39,624
It's fuzzy. It's
black. It's alive.

269
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,444
Patient's lung function's declining
rapidly. Levaquin's not working.

270
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,613
He obviously doesn't have
garden-variety pneumonia.

271
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,282
I'm glad you learned to take
his impending death in stride.

272
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,349
Guess what he does have. Rats.

273
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,022
Scars on his hand. Rat bites.

274
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,997
But he says they're
from construction work

275
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,034
so he won't have to
admit he's got rats at home.

276
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,170
Catholics are right. Pride will
kill you. He has streptobacillus.

277
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,330
Rat-bite fever.

278
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,874
Boogie oogie oogie. Fits
the symptoms perfectly.

279
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,705
That's certainly
one possibility.

280
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,042
But what about the aspergillus
fungus we found under the sink?

281
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,550
What sink? You ought to
clean your bathroom better.

282
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,448
You broke into my house?

283
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,754
No. No. You're
wrong. I had a key.

284
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,290
You had no right to
invade my privacy.

285
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,383
There was no medical
reason for that whatsoever,

286
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,451
and there was certainly
no moral reason for it.

287
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,394
Oh, damn.

288
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,326
You're right.

289
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,531
The focal consolidation makes
fungal pneumonia far more likely.

290
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,002
You're right I'm right.

291
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,734
On the bright side, it has the advantage
of keeping you totally responsible.

292
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,708
The treatment for
aspergillus is amphotericin.

293
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:00,042
That's hugely dangerous.
Yeah? Your point being?

294
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,724
Going the dangerous and aggressive
route didn't work the last time.

295
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,207
It's bound to work this time.
Start him on the amphoterrible.

296
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,200
Dr. Cuddy?

297
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,774
I'm Manny, Alfredo's brother.

298
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,143
How's he doing?

299
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,448
He's worried about money.
I wanna work for you.

300
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,213
How old are you, Manny?

301
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,484
Fifteen. Twelve?

302
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:48,150
I can paint. I mow lawns. I
rake leaves. I can start today.

303
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,389
Alfredo wants you
to finish school.

304
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,260
Like you care.

305
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,210
Manny, I've known
your brother...

306
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,466
He falls off your roof, and
you don't come see him once?

307
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Bitch.

308
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,846
With a patient.

309
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,485
Not according to the log.

310
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,885
It's 3:15. Is it a commercial?

311
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,023
How's Cuddy doing?

312
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,788
She's not acting like Cuddy.
It's a pleasure. You know her.

313
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,096
She has trouble with these
situations, feels personally responsible.

314
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,261
The technical
term is narcissism.

315
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,481
You can't believe that
everything is your fault

316
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,031
unless you also believe
you're all-powerful.

317
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,939
Wow, does she sound messed up.

318
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,274
I don't believe I
can fix everything.

319
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,204
And I don't lie awake at
night, tormented by that fact.

320
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,079
No. You lie awake
tormented by how...

321
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,176
I thought we were
talking about Cuddy here.

322
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,379
She cares.

323
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,513
She enjoys feeling guilty.

324
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,424
Lisa cares. It's why she drives you
nuts. 'Cause it's not just a puzzle to her.

325
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,733
The patients are actually real,

326
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,559
their feelings
actually relevant.

327
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,327
And I'm telling her she
can't even talk to him.

328
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,064
My God, it's contagious.
You're feeling guilty, too.

329
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,163
I'm just saying, take it easy
on her. You owe her that.

330
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,231
<i>From the moment I
saw you at the El...</i>

331
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,740
Commercial's over.
So glad we talked.

332
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,744
Snap, crackle, pop.

333
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,379
You got some Rice
Krispies in there?

334
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,710
That bad, huh?

335
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,483
You were here yesterday.

336
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:28,260
I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman
prescribed medicine, not a miracle.

337
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,671
Got to give this
stuff more than a day.

338
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,062
I didn't fill that
Oreo's prescription.

339
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,396
On the theory that you didn't
trust him because he's black.

340
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:40,338
Well, I'm gonna prescribe the same
medicine and see if you fill it this time.

341
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,841
I'm not buying into
no racist drug, okay?

342
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,602
It's racist because it helps black
people more than white people?

343
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,117
On behalf of my peeps, let me just
say thanks for dying on principle for us.

344
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,812
Look, my heart's
red. Your heart's red.

345
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,185
And it don't make no sense
to give us different drugs.

346
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,451
You know, I have
found a difference.

347
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,191
Admittedly, it's
a limited sample,

348
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,024
but based on my experience
of the last 90 seconds,

349
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,496
all black people are morons.

350
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,591
Sorry, African-Americans.
I'll see another doctor.

351
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,601
Fine. Fine.

352
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,977
I'll give you the same
medicine we give Republicans.

353
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,441
I think the medicine is working.

354
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,785
They're lighter, right?

355
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,653
They don't look lighter to
me, Alfredo. How's the tingling?

356
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,421
Does not bother me.
Tell her the other thing.

357
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,555
He hasn't peed since yesterday.

358
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,160
Since last night? Afternoon.

359
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,898
It's not a problem.
I don't drink much.

360
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,271
I think we'll give you a little
rest from the meds here.

361
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,383
She says, "That's the medicine
that's supposed to cure me."

362
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,009
Just making a little
adjustment. Excuse me.

363
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,246
He's not making any urine.

364
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,225
I think we just destroyed the
kid's kidney with the amphotericin.

365
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,761
I think he's dying.

366
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,322
Dying?

367
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,421
Cheese it, the cops.

368
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,573
I guess she understands
a little English.

369
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,423
His kidneys are shutting down

370
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,474
due to the direct toxicity to
the proximal tubule epithelium.

371
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,987
Proof that my brilliant idea of
giving him amphotericin is killing him.

372
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,886
That wasn't a
complete waste of time.

373
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,687
His reaction shows that you
don't need to clean under your sink.

374
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,953
It wasn't aspergillus.

375
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,427
And blood cultures show he
was negative for rat-bite fever.

376
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,021
There's still plenty of
other cool pneumonias.

377
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,364
Tested negative for Moraxella,
Nocardia, cryptococcus.

378
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,166
He has a low titer for
chlamydia antibodies. Maybe...

379
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,935
No, no. His chest x-ray's all
wrong for chlamydial pneumonia.

380
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,047
But the titer points to...

381
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,509
He had an STD last year.
That explains the titer.

382
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,514
He has low sodium. Maybe it's
Legionella. No. His antigen is negative.

383
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,682
Well, that all sucks.

384
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,912
Maybe we were
right to begin with.

385
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,658
His problems are all caused by
DIC precipitated by falling off my roof.

386
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,160
DIC wouldn't cause
a fever this high.

387
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,492
See? My lap dog agrees with me.

388
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,587
How high?

389
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:21,224
Two hours ago it was
103 with acetaminophen.

390
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,428
What about on St. Alban's Day?

391
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,496
Only temperature I'm interested in
right now is his temperature right now.

392
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:34,905
Open up.

393
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,679
Okay. Let me clarify.
Open up and keep it open.

394
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,457
Yeah. Okay.

395
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,629
Under your tongue.

396
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,933
You're using your left hand.

397
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:01,002
Right one hurt?
No, I feel better.

398
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,217
What, it really doesn't hurt,

399
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,451
or you just figure
if you say no,

400
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,786
you'll get out of
the hospital sooner?

401
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,972
It doesn't hurt. I feel good.

402
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,679
You don't smell too hot.

403
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,160
Your hand is starting to rot.

404
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,321
Why are we here?

405
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,174
We are talking about
cutting off a kid's hand.

406
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,791
Yes, we're talking
about cutting it off,

407
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,767
not subdividing it
and putting in condos.

408
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,101
It's not a legal issue. Are
you being intentionally dense?

409
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,501
I think it's premature.

410
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,065
I've heard enough. What?

411
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,077
She says one word
and you take her side.

412
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,784
You should at least wait until she
actually gives a medical reason.

413
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,578
Otherwise I might take
it personally. Shut up.

414
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,250
If I were to somehow find out
that you two were in disagreement

415
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,084
over the proper
medical course of action,

416
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,283
it could make it awkward
for my client in court.

417
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:56,227
My client being the two of you.
So, guys, I'm a little busy here.

418
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,356
Why don't we pick this
conversation up in half an hour?

419
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,498
Okay?

420
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,092
All of his symptoms are
caused by his underlying problem

421
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,500
and the medicine we gave him.

422
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,594
What underlying problem?

423
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,515
You have no idea what
the underlying problem is.

424
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,008
You're the diagnostician.
Fine. It's all my fault.

425
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,219
Does that make you feel better?

426
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,973
His hand still has
an arterial pulse.

427
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,879
His hand is a cesspool.
And the crap is spreading.

428
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,383
You are being pretty aggressive
about destroying a man's livelihood.

429
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,147
I don't give a damn
about his livelihood.

430
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,520
He loses that hand, he
loses his job, all of his jobs.

431
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,219
He's not like us...
Can't work as a cripple?

432
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,927
He loses his home.

433
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,161
His kid brother drops out.
An American dream destroyed.

434
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,566
Very sad, very emotional,

435
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,332
not one medical fact in
the whole pathetic tale.

436
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,816
You have lost
perspective, Cuddy.

437
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,536
You've stopped looking
at this as a doctor.

438
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,511
You're acting like someone who
shoved somebody off their roof.

439
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,844
You wanna make things right?
Too bad, nothing's ever right.

440
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,183
I am happy to report
that we're now so in sync

441
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,484
we're actually wearing
each other's underwear.

442
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,853
Chop-chop time.

443
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,954
- Is this true?
- No. I'm lying.

444
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,521
It's stupid to do it with
her in the room, I guess.

445
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,587
This is a big
decision. We made it.

446
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,642
We should convene a
meeting of the ethics committee.

447
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,759
No!

448
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,506
Look, she is making a medical decision
based on never wanting to feel regret.

449
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,201
You're making a legal decision
based on wanting me to be wrong.

450
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,786
Greg, you have a
history of aggressive...

451
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,335
You wanted
superficial agreement.

452
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,346
You wanted everybody's
asses covered. You got it.

453
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,247
Now can I do the surgery?
Pretty, pretty please.

454
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:29,654
Lisa,

455
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,518
are you sure you're
okay with this?

456
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,762
I should be the
one to tell the family.

457
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,438
Your hand is dying.

458
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,042
The bacteria are eating it.

459
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,905
When they run out of food
there, they go somewhere else.

460
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,448
If you cut off my
hand, I'll be cured?

461
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,185
Unfortunately, no.

462
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,490
We still have to find the disease
that's making you sick to begin with.

463
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:09,526
But you won't die of
gangrene while we're looking.

464
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,502
I quit school when
I am 12 to get a job,

465
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,801
to help my family.

466
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,710
I know I never get a good job,

467
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,780
never save money or
own my own house like you.

468
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,044
But, Manny, he's smart.

469
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,587
He's the best in his class.

470
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,793
Well, maybe Manny doesn't have
to quit school. Maybe you can...

471
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,809
Are you sure I need to do this?

472
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,546
Yes.

473
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,450
Okay.

474
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,586
Okay.

475
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,485
I gave one of my clinic
patients a follow-up call.

476
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,646
Your name came up.

477
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,724
I'm guessing an old black guy

478
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,523
who thinks the CIA invented rap music to
make your people want to kill each other.

479
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,121
He said you gave him
the white folks' stuff.

480
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,997
This is exactly why black
people don't live as long...

481
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,629
This isn't about race,
unless annoying is a race.

482
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,264
Is he not getting
better? He's fine so far.

483
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,402
I'm calling him back in. I'm
getting him on the right stuff.

484
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,913
Relax, Foreman, he already is.

485
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,284
I told him it was the white
stuff. I gave him the black stuff.

486
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,018
He was right.

487
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,584
You did exactly
what white people do.

488
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,960
You figure we don't need to
know the truth or can't understand it,

489
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,623
so you just lie to us.

490
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,928
Just a white lie.
Good one, massa.

491
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,370
Right, and I'm a racist.

492
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,765
Too bad that idiot will never know
for the rest of his long, long life.

493
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:22,410
Every slave master thought they
were doing the black man a favor.

494
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:27,090
Negro can't take care of
himself, so we'll put him to work.

495
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,760
We'll give him
four walls, a bed.

496
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,328
We'll civilize the heathen.

497
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,867
I'll tell you what.
Stop doing us favors.

498
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,267
If you're right, and we
end up back in the jungle

499
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,500
with lousy blood
pressure medicine,

500
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,936
it won't be on your head.

501
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,262
You okay?

502
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,202
You wondering if you
made the right call?

503
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,005
I've wanted to be a doctor
from the time I was 12.

504
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,749
I wanted to be a lawyer
from the time I was six

505
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,973
until my second
week of law school.

506
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,571
Sorry. Your story.

507
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,011
I graduated medical school at 25,
pissed off that I was second in my class.

508
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:08,487
Chief of medicine at 32, second
youngest ever, first woman...

509
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,584
Sad story.

510
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,823
If I had been
Alfredo's doctor...

511
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,365
You are his doctor.

512
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,628
I insisted on giving him Protein
C. We had to cut his skull open.

513
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,571
I insisted on amphotericin,
killed his kidneys.

514
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,335
I missed the
pneumonia completely.

515
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,543
I would have searched
his home and ignored mine.

516
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,607
I would have watched him
die trying to save his hand.

517
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,954
If I didn't have House
looking over my shoulder...

518
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,424
Are you saying you're not
as good a doctor as House is?

519
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,188
I'm saying House is right.

520
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,889
I was so anxious to get ahead.

521
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,732
I haven't been
a doctor in years.

522
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,867
His little finger is dusky.

523
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,163
Yeah, that's why
we're doing this.

524
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,972
No. I mean the other hand, the
one we haven't chopped off yet.

525
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,130
<i>His O2 sats are down to 88.</i>

526
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,937
His lungs are giving
out. He needs a ventilator.

527
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,906
And dialysis.

528
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:36,244
You're getting distracted by
the multisystem organ failure.

529
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,915
Pinkies are supposed
to be pink, right?

530
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,181
I mean, they're not
called "gray-ies".

531
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,119
But the organ failure
is gonna kill him.

532
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,781
But the pinky is weirder.

533
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,853
What does it tell us?

534
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,136
The same thing the right
hand told us before we cut it off.

535
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,925
- It's the same symptom.
- But at a different time.

536
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,460
His blood work
indicates mild DIC.

537
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,194
What if it's mild in the way that
when you get out of the ocean,

538
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,740
the water clinging to your
body makes the sea level drop?

539
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,926
It's technically true, but
it's completely irrelevant.

540
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,342
A lack of DIC would
explain everything

541
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,210
if there were also a lack
of anything to explain.

542
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,486
Endocarditis. His
heart's infected.

543
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,549
Little bacteria cauliflowers,
clinging to his valves.

544
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:22,458
Except sometimes they can't hold on.
They go swimming in his bloodstream.

545
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,224
Thursday, one breaks
off, goes to his right hand,

546
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,788
black fingers, gangrene.

547
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,130
Friday's child heads
for the kidneys.

548
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,404
And we all know what
Saturdays are all about.

549
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,200
Party with the left hand.

550
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,973
Also explains the fever.

551
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,033
It's perfect except
for the little fact

552
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,669
that we already
tested for endocarditis,

553
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
and he was negative.

554
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,508
Which means he
either is negative or...

555
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,417
What infection can cause pneumonia
and culture-negative endocarditis?

556
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,020
Prize value goes
down with every clue.

557
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,459
You're thinking psittacosis?

558
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,360
Alfredo doesn't
have any pet parrots.

559
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,764
Quit your squawking.
Give him doxycycline.

560
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,234
No! That'll just make his
clotting problem worse.

561
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,704
I liked you better when you were
coming up with wacky drugs for us to try.

562
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,300
We give him the doxy now, damn
it, maybe we can save his pinky.

563
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,354
He can teach his brother
to count all the way to five.

564
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:16,348
If you're wrong, he'll end
up with no hands and no feet.

565
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,282
Technically, if I'm wrong, he'll
end up dead, but I take your point.

566
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,911
What's his night job? He
cleans up at some fast food joint.

567
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,764
What, you think he got
it from a chicken nugget?

568
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,691
Since when do fast food joints
allow 12-year-olds to mop floors?

569
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,025
Alfredo is 20. Really?
Looks younger.

570
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,591
Where were you
going to work tonight?

571
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,967
What job do you do
on Saturday nights?

572
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,167
What are you doing? Wake him up.

573
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,869
We just cut off his hand.

574
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,913
Yeah. We need to talk
about it. It's not happening.

575
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,151
Honest, I've got no
idea what I just said.

576
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,417
Why didn't you say
you spoke Spanish?

577
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,391
Well, because she'd
wanna talk to me.

578
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,387
Or something like that.

579
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,695
She says he doesn't
work Saturday nights.

580
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,100
Give me the talking juice.

581
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,347
The fact it doesn't fit your
theory doesn't make it a lie.

582
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,415
When she was out of the room,

583
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:18,376
the kid brother insisted he was
gonna cover for Alfredo at work tonight.

584
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,743
Saturday nights he goes dancing.

585
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,015
Either it's a lie or he's
dancing with birds.

586
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,950
Give her the talking juice.

587
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,705
She doesn't know what
you're talking about.

588
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,371
Odds are it's gonna
be close to his house.

589
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,796
It's probably an abandoned
warehouse or factory.

590
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,129
Take the Scooby
gang and spread out.

591
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,634
What the hell are
we looking for?

592
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,466
Find somebody
who looks like crap.

593
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,631
Tell him you want
to place a bet.

594
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,487
It's Cuddy.

595
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,189
I already put him on
the psittacosis meds.

596
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,691
As soon as you left.

597
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,634
You're welcome.

598
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,234
What do you think the record
for one-handed juggling is?

599
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,906
You can yo-yo one-handed.

600
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:01,939
Good point.

601
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,150
I always wash my hands.

602
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:17,254
If a bird is infected, you can get
psittacosis just from breathing his dust.

603
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,724
But then, why do I get
sick and nobody else?

604
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,825
Your asthma made you vulnerable.

605
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,830
You're gonna be
all right now. Yes.

606
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,719
For saving my life.

607
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,625
He thanked me.

608
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,633
He should have.
We cut off his hand.

609
00:38:58,636 --> 00:38:59,934
If we'd figured
it out earlier...

610
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,870
If you'd figured it out
later, he'd be dead.

611
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,068
I never figured it out at all.

612
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,635
Hello. What do you want, House?

613
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:12,544
If you're wallowing in self-loathing,
I've got something that might help.

614
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,085
We're getting sued.

615
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,589
You saved his life. He
admitted that. We'll settle.

616
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,892
He's got a stub where his hand
used to be. We have insurance.

617
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,621
Case seems pretty solid to me.

618
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,360
The new American
dream. Happy ending.

619
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,332
Kid's gonna be just fine.

620
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,498
Cuddy,

621
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,736
your guilt.

622
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,713
It's perverse and it
makes you a crappy doctor.

623
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,583
It also makes you
okay at what you do.

624
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,116
You figure a perverted sense
of guilt makes me a good boss.

625
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,593
Now, would the world be a better
place if people never felt guilty?

626
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,619
Makes sex better.

627
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,225
You should have seen her in
the last months of our relationship.

628
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,428
A lot of guilt. A
lot of screaming.

629
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,104
I know this wasn't just
because it was your roof.

630
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,537
Cuddy,

631
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,980
you see the world as it is, and
you see the world as it could be.

632
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,116
And what you don't see is
what everybody else sees,

633
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,624
the giant gaping
chasm in between.

634
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,160
House, I'm not naive.

635
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:32,391
I realize... If you did, you
never would have hired me.

636
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,593
You're not happy unless
things are just right,

637
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,299
which means two things.

638
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,838
That you're a good boss,
and you'll never be happy.

639
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,546
By the way, why does
everybody think you and I had sex?

640
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,618
You think there could
be something to it?

641
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,494
Cuddy feels guilty about not
diagnosing psittacosis any earlier?

642
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,433
I think so.

643
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,676
There's no way she could have.

644
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,503
No.

645
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,106
No way she could have.

646
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,555
It's raining.
