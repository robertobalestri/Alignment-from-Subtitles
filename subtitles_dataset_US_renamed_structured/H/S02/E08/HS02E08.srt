1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:03,962
Welcome to the
world of illusion!

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,632
What is real and what is magic?

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,642
This is what you will wonder

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,305
as I perform feats
that will astound you!

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,106
As you see, there is
nothing up my sleeve.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,911
And this hat, it's just
an ordinary old hat.

7
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:21,353
Watch, as I wave three
times above the hat,

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,822
and whisper the
magic words. And now...

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,630
Mom, it's not
working! It's ripped!

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,393
It's okay, baby,
it's just a little tear.

11
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,265
Hurry up, Mom! What
are you so worried about?

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,362
Sally's gonna make
fun of us. Sally Ayerson?

13
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:43,000
She said her mom bought her dress at
Bloomingdale's and you had to make ours.

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,942
We're gonna look stupid.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,644
Do you girls remember that music
we were listening to yesterday?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,207
That lady who sang
about respect? Reetha?

17
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,753
Aretha, that's right.

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,998
Do you think she had lots of
money growing up in Detroit?

19
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,957
What's Detroit? It's a city.

20
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,586
The point is, is that she's
one of the best singers ever.

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,555
If Sally's mean to you again,

22
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,963
I'm just gonna have to key
her daddy's new convertible.

23
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,433
Great. And thank you!

24
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,333
Do you know what that means?

25
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,037
Good.

26
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,888
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

27
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,790
<i>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

28
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:37,456
<i>Little-bitty, pretty one
Come on and talk to me</i>

29
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:42,968
<i>Lovey-dovey, dovey one
Come on sit down on my knee</i>

30
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,141
<i>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

31
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,288
Hey. Hey.

32
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,791
You speak to Chase and House
yet? The disciplinary hearing.

33
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,579
The McGinley case,
that's not for two weeks.

34
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,627
Tomorrow.

35
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,606
Scheduling disaster,
you don't wanna hear it.

36
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,375
You gotta get the boys'
okay to move the hearing up,

37
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,459
and you gotta do that
whole legal advice thing.

38
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,026
Can you ask someone
else? I'm asking you.

39
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,500
Let me work with Chase. House
should have separate counsel.

40
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,439
Stop looking for
whatever you're looking for.

41
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,603
For the last month,
House has been crowing

42
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,546
that you can't work with him
because you're just swooning in love.

43
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,675
There is nothing approaching love
in what I feel about him right now.

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,278
Well, if you can't work with
him, it amounts to the same thing.

45
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,980
We had a fight. It's awkward.
Why not use another lawyer?

46
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,085
Because 40% of our lawsuits
last year were about House.

47
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,892
If you can't work with
him, you can't work here.

48
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,332
She's overreacting.

49
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,331
You snuck into her shrink's
office and read her private file.

50
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,429
When Nixon did that,
he got impeached.

51
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,465
So you're saying I'm not allowed to
have oral sex with an intern, either?

52
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,238
Yes! And yes.

53
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:36,272
That file got me on the floor of her
attic with her pouring out her soul.

54
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,841
The only thing I did
wrong was get caught.

55
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,955
Where's Chase?

56
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,549
He's too busy to service
you until after work.

57
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,151
I got a couple minutes, though.

58
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,025
Feel free to say something like,

59
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,259
"What'll we do with
the time left over?"

60
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,897
Or you could just
stew, that works as well.

61
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,732
She stews before
she gets violent.

62
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,582
This one says you're okay with moving
the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow.

63
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,508
This one says I've advised
you of your legal rights.

64
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,037
Any legal rights I should
know about? Nope.

65
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,006
Great.

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,813
And you thought this
was gonna be awkward.

67
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,920
You shouldn't sign it.

68
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,932
Postponing is almost
always the smart thing to do.

69
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,391
Tempers cool, memories fade.

70
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,552
They rule on me,
it's done, right?

71
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,096
Yeah, but... Then
let's get it over with.

72
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,792
Have you ever done a
peer review before? No.

73
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,123
Good.

74
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,963
Peer's a misnomer.
These are your bosses.

75
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,904
This could cost you some
money, some privileges

76
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,306
or it could cost
you your career.

77
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,407
All I can tell them
is what happened.

78
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,222
There is an objective
reality to what happened,

79
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,442
and that committee
is never gonna know it.

80
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,609
All they're gonna know is
what they picture happened,

81
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,983
which depends a little on what
you tell them and a whole lot

82
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,413
on how you tell them.

83
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,758
May 11.

84
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,356
The patient presented to
the clinic. What's her name?

85
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,556
It's in the file.
Do you know it?

86
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,925
Then use it.

87
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,331
Kayla presented to the clinic with
multiple joint and stomach pain.

88
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,369
<i>Dr. Foreman was called
in for a neurological consult.</i>

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,965
What's the point of this, man?

90
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,409
Checking your sister's
cerebral coordination.

91
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,004
The thing is in her
leg and her stomach.

92
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,346
Wait in the clinic for six hours
so she can play patty cake?

93
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,186
You could have gone
to the ER last night.

94
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,046
You gonna come over
and baby-sit her kids?

95
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,785
Okay. Patient comes from
a family of jerks, I get it.

96
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,794
Can you stick to the medicine?

97
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,854
Something wrong?

98
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,398
<i>There was some
uveitis.</i> STACY: <i>Meaning?</i>

99
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,492
Her iris, the colored part
of her eye, was inflamed.

100
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,266
Meaning? Worst case, blindness.

101
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,832
But there was an upside.

102
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,300
It was weird enough
to get House interested.

103
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,369
Young woman, joint pain,
gonorrhea's a possibility.

104
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,105
It's polyarticular.
Maybe rheumatoid.

105
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,117
That's typically small
joints, this hit her knee.

106
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,050
Takayasu's arteritis.

107
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,685
Get a sed rate and serologies.

108
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,583
"Childproof."

109
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,922
How many kids are
hopped up on Vicodin?

110
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,056
Give me. Right. Like
I'd ever get it back.

111
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,665
Chase?

112
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,300
<i>Don't care about the Vicodin.</i>

113
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,168
Might not just be her arteries,
could be all her blood vessels.

114
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,004
Vasculitis, with stomach
pains, so Behcet's.

115
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,635
No, she'd have oral
sores. Or genital.

116
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,674
Go find them.

117
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,649
I thought she was Foreman's
patient. Why did you do the exam?

118
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,887
She'd have oral sores.
- Or genital.

119
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,617
Go find them.

120
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,660
Whoa, whoa, Foreman.

121
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,166
Chase can handle the pelvic.

122
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,300
Any pain?

123
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,430
Is it bad?

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,566
This would go a lot
easier if you talked to me.

125
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,535
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,880
I, um...

127
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,614
I just really hate hospitals.

128
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,279
When I was 12, I
had my tonsils out.

129
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,380
Got to skip school, lots of ice
cream, made me wanna be a doctor.

130
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,790
My mom died when I was eight,

131
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,691
so I spent months
at Princeton General.

132
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,061
She died of DTs, your mom?

133
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,706
Bottles stashed around the house?
Mood swings? That whole deal?

134
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,832
You've been there?

135
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,067
My mom.

136
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,378
Dad left, Mom
crawled inside a bottle.

137
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,638
Made for a great
year 12 of high school.

138
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,513
You okay with your dad now?

139
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,651
No.

140
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,484
Does your dad have
anything to do with this story?

141
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,057
No, it's just...

142
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,527
Okay, I get it, the
two of you bonded,

143
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,203
which is probably why
you haven't been sued.

144
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,059
Patients never sue
doctors they like.

145
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,462
But keep it brief, okay?
The panel doesn't like to think

146
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,434
they're being manipulated
when they're being manipulated.

147
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,129
She had some ulceration.

148
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,898
Confirming Behcet's.

149
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:56,534
I gave her some prednisone, an antacid,
and I ran a pathergy test on her arm.

150
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,601
Takes 24 hours to confirm.

151
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,510
Told her any doctor
could check it out.

152
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,674
You didn't make an
appointment. Nope.

153
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,217
She just showed up.

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,985
Dr. Chase? Hi.

155
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,116
All right, let's take a look.

156
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,128
Okay, those little
pustules mean it's positive.

157
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,930
Talk to Nurse Preven, get an appointment
with Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

158
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,938
Behcet's is very treatable,
you're gonna be fine.

159
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,133
Okay. Thanks.

160
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,335
And you were just chatting
on the phone with someone

161
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,844
and she happened
to run into you.

162
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,004
That's what happened.

163
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,310
No appointment,
no real examination?

164
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,044
Just gave her the test results.

165
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,313
So, lower standard of care,

166
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,098
you really couldn't be expected to
notice there was anything else wrong.

167
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,318
We didn't even go
into an exam room.

168
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:53,463
As your lawyer, I can't stop you
from lying, I can't even be in the room.

169
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,697
But I would be remiss if I
didn't prep you to lie better.

170
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,703
You wrote her a prescription, which
means there was an examination.

171
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,300
What really happened?

172
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,512
I was on the phone.

173
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,411
Dr. Chase? Hi.

174
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,178
Hi.

175
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,847
Kayla. I'm here for
the test. My arm.

176
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,049
Oh, yeah.

177
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,858
Okay.

178
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,985
It's positive.

179
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,124
Talk to Nurse Preven, get an appointment
with Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

180
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,168
I took that medicine you gave
me, but my stomach still hurts.

181
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,937
Behcet's could be
stronger than we thought,

182
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,843
or it could be reflux
from the prednisone.

183
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,776
Here's a stronger antacid.

184
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,916
Doctor? Yes?

185
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,454
Nothing.

186
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,391
<i>You didn't ask her anything
about the stomach pain?</i>

187
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,692
I made one little mistake.

188
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,699
As little mistakes
go, that was a biggie.

189
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,330
She's only advising
Chase? Not you?

190
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,477
Well, what's the committee gonna do
to me? I never even met this patient.

191
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,239
Your disdain for
human interaction

192
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,838
doesn't exculpate
you, it inculpates you.

193
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,193
You signed the charts, you're
responsible for everything Chase does.

194
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,617
Which is why this
doesn't matter.

195
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,381
She protects Chase,
she protects me.

196
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,254
Unless her advice to Chase is
to make a deal and give you up.

197
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,594
"I'm so sorry, if only
Dr. House had paid attention.

198
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,525
"He never even met
her, he never does."

199
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,098
Chase loves me.
And isn't Turkish.

200
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,900
Cameron loves you,
Chase loves his job.

201
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,302
You really think Stacy
hates me that much?

202
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,536
I think right now she hates
you more than enough.

203
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,873
You think emotion only
affects doctors' judgments?

204
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,148
Everything stemmed
from that one interaction.

205
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,378
They're gonna slam you on it.

206
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,651
Were you distracted? Your problem.
Overworked? That's their problem.

207
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,055
Forgetful, yours, lazy...

208
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,902
I just figured the stomach
pain was the Behcet's.

209
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,337
Any doctor would
have thought the same.

210
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,661
Then why did you call her
an hour after she left the clinic?

211
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,563
Nurse Preven said you asked
her to have Kayla come back in.

212
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,571
The way she hesitated, I thought she
might have had a doorknob question.

213
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,734
Patient comes in,

214
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,742
says he's got a sniffly nose, you
examine him for 10 minutes, right?

215
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,471
Then you're leaving,
hand on the doorknob,

216
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,845
and he says, "Oh, yeah, and
my penis has turned green."

217
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,426
Embarrassing question, the only
important one, patient saves it for last.

218
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,909
So you knew she was about to
ask the most important question

219
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,381
and you left.

220
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,323
No, I didn't. I
figured it out later.

221
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,621
What changed?

222
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,788
Nothing. Bad answer.

223
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,764
I wasn't thinking clearly
at first. Worse answer.

224
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,593
So what was her
doorknob question?

225
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,270
I figured it might
be blood in her stool,

226
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,936
which could indicate
a bleeding ulcer.

227
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,173
Talk to me.

228
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,419
Thirty-five year old female,
vomiting massive amounts of blood,

229
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,471
LOC at work, BP 80 over 20,
heart rate 140. You push fluids?

230
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,226
Three liters in the field, and we're
bolusing another one right now.

231
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,684
It's gotta be a
bleeding ulcer, Doc.

232
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,017
Her coworkers said she's been
eating ibuprofens like candy.

233
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,986
I thought she had Behcet's!

234
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,318
One, two, three.

235
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,904
I'm in the stomach.

236
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,673
There's too much
blood, I can't see.

237
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,907
Did she burst an artery? No.

238
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,450
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

239
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,540
Cauterizing.

240
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,178
I can't see, use some
more saline. Hold on.

241
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,287
Okay.

242
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,119
Looks good. Bleeding
ulcer. We got it.

243
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,024
She was fine two hours ago.

244
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,652
Systolic BP 70.

245
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,097
Where's the ulcer? It's
brown, I cauterized it.

246
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,633
There must be something else.

247
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,724
There.

248
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,965
A second ulcer? Not
anymore. It perforated.

249
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,165
Get her to an OR!

250
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,206
The surgeons were able
to suture the perforation.

251
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,938
But the contents
of the patient's,

252
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,215
Kayla's, stomach had
spilled into her body.

253
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,883
She got septic.

254
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,250
Then the infection lowers
her blood pressure...

255
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,118
Fifty over palp at one point.

256
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,419
It damaged her
liver and kidneys.

257
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,885
Listen, I know this looks bad.

258
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,987
I obviously got the
diagnosis wrong,

259
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,929
but I did everything
by the book.

260
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,524
I couldn't have known
what was gonna happen.

261
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,199
If I skip my coffee, I get
cranky. Do you want anything?

262
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,979
Why did Chase screw up?

263
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,951
He forgot to ask a question,
does there need to be a reason?

264
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,418
It might help him.

265
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,684
As far as I'm concerned, he
made a little mistake. It happens.

266
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,054
How far are you concerned?

267
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,786
You think I'm biased?

268
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,896
You're colleagues. You
worked together for over a year.

269
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,227
And everyone says
you slept together.

270
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,959
Who says?

271
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,513
The correct answer is, "We're
not involved and I'm not biased."

272
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,596
We're not involved, and I
don't know why he messed up.

273
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,742
House has worked with
him longer than I have.

274
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,539
You should talk to House.

275
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,372
Yeah.

276
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,640
Why did Chase screw up?

277
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,283
Because he doesn't
give a crap about patients.

278
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,129
Well, he always gets
positive patient reviews.

279
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,588
Yeah. He smiles
all 84 of his teeth,

280
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,124
tells them his tonsil story...

281
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,751
It's a nice story. He
still has his tonsils!

282
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,947
As soon as he's out of the room, which
is as soon as he can be out of the room,

283
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,794
he starts in on
the trash talking.

284
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,357
He thinks not giving a
crap makes him like House.

285
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,528
Like it's something
to aspire to.

286
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,162
Am I gonna have to testify?

287
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,674
I won't be encouraging
them to call you.

288
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,108
What did House say?

289
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,984
Two months like this.

290
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,087
Let me guess, no insurance.

291
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,918
You've just heard about the
free clinic. It's a good move.

292
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:54,484
You don't wanna skimp on the
essentials like wristwatches, MP3 players.

293
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,620
I need to talk to you.

294
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,930
From the doorway?
It's confidential.

295
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,728
Cool. I love gossip.

296
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,062
You hear that crackling sound?

297
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,832
Like crumpling up paper?

298
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,899
Keep listening, let
me know if it changes.

299
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,110
Two questions.

300
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,679
Why did Chase screw
up, and how bad was it?

301
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,783
Wow. Talk about efficient,
I only need one answer.

302
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,192
Chase didn't screw
up. He said he did.

303
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,163
Well, I'm not a lawyer, but that
seems like a sucky legal strategy.

304
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,943
They're gonna wanna know what you
think a reasonable doctor would have done

305
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,967
in Chase's position.

306
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,580
If I thought he was a reasonable
doctor, I wouldn't have hired him.

307
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,334
God, you two are a
couple of geniuses.

308
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,535
Deny everything, completely fool
the lawyer who's trying to help you.

309
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,841
Too bad the review committee
members are actually doctors.

310
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,745
Stacy.

311
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,779
I'm in the stomach.

312
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,879
There's too much
blood, I can't see.

313
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,981
Did she burst an artery? No.

314
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,993
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

315
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,127
Okay. Cauterizing.

316
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,497
Looks good. Bleeding
ulcer. We got it.

317
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,201
She was fine two hours ago.

318
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,999
If by "fine," you mean
she had fountains of blood

319
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,041
spurting out of every orifice,
then yeah, I believe you.

320
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,508
I'm guessing those
are celebratory bells.

321
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,944
Systolic BP 70.

322
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,171
Show me the ulcer.

323
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,510
It's brown, I cauterized it.

324
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,881
Sweep back. Show
me the whole stomach.

325
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,010
Stop.

326
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,987
A second ulcer? Not
anymore. It perforated.

327
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,091
Get her to an OR!

328
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,161
Let's go.

329
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,432
She was not "fine"
two hours ago.

330
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,428
Did she mention stomach pain?
Yeah, so I gave her a stronger...

331
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,303
You didn't do an exam. She
just came in for a follow-up.

332
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,898
The results of
the pathergy test...

333
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,566
Did you listen to her stomach?

334
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,643
Check her vitals?

335
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,146
Maybe if she'd said something
about taking ibuprofen,

336
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,148
mentioned the rectal
bleeding... Yeah!

337
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,480
Why didn't she go to
med school like you did?

338
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,350
Diarrhea, blood in the stool,
these are routine questions!

339
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,718
That doctors skip all the time!

340
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,267
It was a minor mistake, I couldn't
have known this was gonna happen...

341
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,487
Mistakes are as serious
as the results they cause!

342
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,530
This woman could die because you
were too lazy to ask one simple question!

343
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,497
No, she might die because I had

344
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,533
the bad luck to spill
your damn Vicodin pills!

345
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,468
I responded with a
number of trenchant remarks

346
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,530
which made Chase cry, none
of which I'm gonna testify about.

347
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,007
Unless you convince
Chase to roll on me.

348
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,938
Excuse me. Testify about what?

349
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,550
Chuck.

350
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,131
I'm gonna break from the
parable of the wicked doctor

351
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,521
and tell a little story about
a patient, let's call him Buck.

352
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,923
Who has low O2 sats
and crackling lung sounds.

353
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,087
Like I have.

354
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,394
Buck has idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

355
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,760
His lung tissue's
turning to rock.

356
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,229
There's no known
cause, no treatment.

357
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,567
He is slowly suffocating.

358
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,003
You're talking about me?

359
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,633
Lung transplant's
about $500,000,

360
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,337
but this poor sucker's
got no insurance.

361
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,711
If he tried to sign up now, he'd
be excluded, preexisting condition.

362
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,909
But let me confirm
with my lawyer.

363
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,046
She confirms.

364
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:11,124
If only Buck hadn't been diagnosed
with fibrosis before he got insurance.

365
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,759
So, back to the exam.

366
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,936
That's how you tell
this guy he's dying?

367
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,202
Oh, relax. He's got a cold.

368
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,174
And soon, health insurance.

369
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,708
Such a hero, always
righting wrongs.

370
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,644
Who cares who you
have to manipulate?

371
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:37,877
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,647
I didn't realize you
and Buck were so close.

373
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,284
It's a point of
principle. Right.

374
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,070
It's got nothing to do
with what I did to you.

375
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,995
There's nothing
for us to talk about.

376
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,553
That's why you're following me.

377
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,566
I read some notes. If
Chase screwed up...

378
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,865
I was wrong! I'm
terribly, terribly sorry.

379
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,334
If Chase screwed up so
badly, why didn't you fire him?

380
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,805
He has great hair.

381
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,335
What are you hiding? I'm gay.

382
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:08,513
Oh, that's not what you meant.
It does explain a lot, though.

383
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,845
No girlfriend,
always with Wilson.

384
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,214
Obsession with sneakers.

385
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,351
Diarrhea, blood in the stool.

386
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,333
Two simple questions you could
have asked her six months ago

387
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,552
and averted this whole thing.

388
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,821
You didn't ask either, why?

389
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,794
Judging from your
question and your demeanor,

390
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,497
I assume you were
visiting with House.

391
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,933
We've been over
this. I don't know.

392
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,280
Good doctors don't
make mistakes like that.

393
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,205
Good doctors never
forget to ask questions?

394
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,551
Then you've got your answer,
apparently, I'm not a good doctor.

395
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,443
FYI, self-pity generally is not a
good strategy in these hearings.

396
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,640
What happened
after the operation?

397
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,110
The kidney damage isn't so bad.

398
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,015
The liver damage
is more worrisome.

399
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,884
There's no dialysis for livers.

400
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,954
I know.

401
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,321
But if she loses a liver, she
can get a transplant, right?

402
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,223
We can put her on a list.

403
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,424
I could do it.

404
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,473
I could give her
part of my liver.

405
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,466
Surgeons won't operate
unless the donor's

406
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,568
had a long time to
weigh the decision.

407
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,762
There's black markets.

408
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,064
For organs?

409
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,163
That's just...

410
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,901
Oh, my stomach!

411
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,170
The pain constant? Yeah!

412
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,439
Sharp or dull? I don't know!

413
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,107
It's ferric. It's a little cold.

414
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,118
She's got ascites.
No. It's a clot.

415
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,585
Nurse! Call the OR.

416
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,952
We gotta prep her
for an embolectomy.

417
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,983
Run CBC, PT, and a liver panel.

418
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,624
Sepsis had lowered her BP so
much, she got clots in her liver.

419
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,222
They blocked the hepatic
artery, cut off the blood flow.

420
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,631
Her liver was shocked.

421
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,534
And Cuddy listed her?
With all the other problems?

422
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,600
Forget it! We can't give a
liver to a woman this sick.

423
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,075
Do you listen to
what you're saying?

424
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,070
There is no point in giving a new liver
to somebody who also has vasculitis.

425
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,275
Treatable. And kidney damage.

426
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,046
It's healing. You know
what's really killing her?

427
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,021
Chase forgot to ask a standard
question about stomach pain.

428
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,557
So he missed the
diagnosis, so she perforated,

429
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,889
so she got sepsis,
so her BP tanked,

430
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,291
so she got blood clots,
so she lost her liver.

431
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,196
Livers are important, Cuddy. You
can't live without them, hence the name.

432
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,393
Here's the big issue.

433
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,268
Chase is a hospital employee,
and Kayla is a sympathetic mother

434
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,502
of those two jury-friendly
moppets, Caleb and Cody.

435
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,868
Dory and Nikki.

436
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,004
Your point, beyond just trying
to make Chase wet himself,

437
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,743
seems to be that the
hospital faces liability here.

438
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,976
Well, thanks for
clearing that up.

439
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,850
I still need a medical
reason to list her.

440
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,820
That is the medical reason.

441
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,351
If the family wins this hospital in
a lawsuit, they'll turn it into condos.

442
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,795
And people will die waiting
outside a condo for medical care.

443
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,265
Start praying for a 12-car
pileup on the turnpike,

444
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,366
'cause we're not exactly
swimming in livers over here.

445
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,778
When you're testifying, skip the
details on how House convinced Cuddy.

446
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,197
I don't think the people who got
bumped down the transplant list

447
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,221
need to know why.

448
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,289
It didn't matter anyway.

449
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,692
She next on the list? Yes.

450
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,025
But she's AB
negative, very rare.

451
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,125
How long can
she go on like this?

452
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,198
Probably another day or two.

453
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,100
I'm donating my liver.
Sam, we talked about this.

454
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,210
I'm a perfect match, six
out of six HLA proteins.

455
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,943
How'd you get
checked out so fast?

456
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,480
I know a guy in medical
testing, and I paid him to rush it.

457
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,517
Sam bribed someone to
rush his tests? Wouldn't you?

458
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,495
Someone's going to get
the blame for what happened,

459
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,920
so the more we spread it
around, we might as well...

460
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:40,153
You said no surgeon would do a live
donor transplant on such short notice.

461
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,388
House took care of that, too.

462
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,432
Your patient's hardly clotting.

463
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,329
Sub-Q vitamin K and
fresh frozen plasma pre-op.

464
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,496
Pretty risky.

465
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,150
Well, that's why I came to the best
transplant surgeon in the hospital.

466
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,802
She's dead without you.

467
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,674
Get her in this afternoon.

468
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,642
Thank you very
much. My pleasure.

469
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,581
And this was right before you
ran the marathon, I suppose?

470
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,623
Was it the part where he warmly
clasped my hands in thanks,

471
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,689
was that too much?

472
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,781
What did you do to him?

473
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,589
The hospital lawyer asks me
if I did something unethical?

474
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,096
If I did, the last person I'd
tell is the hospital lawyer,

475
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,689
especially since she's gone
all Old Testament on me.

476
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,166
You'll tell me.

477
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,735
Oh. Okay then.

478
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,569
One caveat, I've moved past
threesomes, I'm now into foursomes.

479
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,473
If someone backs out, then,
you've still got a threesome.

480
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,069
And if two people back
out, you're still having sex.

481
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,590
You'd be amazed,
even if three people...

482
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,549
Anything you say
is attorney-client.

483
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,812
So you can get advice about
the bad, bad thing you did,

484
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,855
knowing I'll be tortured
because I can't tell a soul.

485
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,252
Actually, it is kind of cool.

486
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,094
Are you completely
out of your mind?

487
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,828
She's dying on her own,

488
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,628
why would I volunteer
to be her executioner?

489
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,531
And I'd just be inviting a lawsuit
from the brother no matter what.

490
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,032
5 grand.

491
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:05,504
And that's just ante money. After
the surgery, you get another 15.

492
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,046
Though I warn you,
that includes the tip.

493
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,007
I make 600 grand a year.

494
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:15,543
You think I'm gonna risk tanking
my percentages for $20,000?

495
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,250
It's tax-free.

496
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,821
For the record,

497
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,890
I hope the Department
takes you and Chase

498
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,953
and drop-kicks both your
asses out the back door.

499
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,130
Great!

500
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,425
That means I don't have to
bother welshing on the 15 grand

501
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,163
I would have owed you.

502
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,738
If you don't do the surgery,
I'm gonna tell your wife

503
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,641
that you've been sleeping
with a series of nurses.

504
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,736
Currently Nurse
Cutler in Radiology.

505
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,110
Now, what's 600
grand divided by two?

506
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,218
Last Christmas party,

507
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,255
Nurse Cutler handed you
one of those little hot dogs.

508
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,413
And you didn't thank her.

509
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,957
Well, that only happens
when you're very, very intimate.

510
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,130
That, and the fact that you've
been practically dancing around

511
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,725
with your zipper open, and a
used condom stuck on your shoe.

512
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,133
Your wife is apparently the
only one who doesn't know.

513
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,569
There's no way you'll tell her.

514
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,070
Of course I won't.

515
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,698
I'm much too cowardly.

516
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,137
No, I'll just send an
anonymous letter.

517
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,306
Now, I've got an OR
booked for 4:00 this afternoon.

518
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,407
Are you free?

519
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,720
Oh, and "for the record,"

520
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,084
you are the worst transplant
surgeon in this hospital.

521
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,255
But unfortunately, you're the only
one who's currently cheating on his wife.

522
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,437
You bribed him and
then you blackmailed him?

523
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,499
She'd have been dead in two days if I
hadn't made Ayersman do the surgery.

524
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,854
Leave the blackmail out of
the story you tell the committee.

525
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,006
I tried to leave it out
of the story I told you.

526
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,606
And then there was that
incident in the parking lot.

527
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,981
Don't do that! Hey,
what, are you nuts?

528
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,044
No, please, I didn't do it!

529
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,715
I didn't do anything!
Please! No!

530
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,783
Apparently, someone sent
an anonymous letter to his wife.

531
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,762
You blackmailed Ayersman, he performed
the surgery, and you ratted him out anyway?

532
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,923
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

533
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,864
You just can't control
yourself, can you?

534
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,061
No matter how stupid,
how self-destructive...

535
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,037
To make this conversation
easier, can we discard the fiction

536
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,439
that we're talking about anything
other than what I did to you?

537
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,273
You're not mad because I broke
into your psychiatrist's office.

538
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,624
Yeah, I was thrilled about that.

539
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,923
Okay, it was a
lousy thing to do.

540
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,947
But if what I had found

541
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,427
was that everything was all
kittens and moonbeams in Markville,

542
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:27,784
you'd be over
it. No, I wouldn't!

543
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,412
You're mad at me for
letting you know what I did.

544
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,981
Because you liked
where things were going.

545
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,622
And for that, I
actually am sorry.

546
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,392
It was stupid.

547
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,810
Let me tell you a
story about a patient.

548
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,438
A patient we'll call Fusan.

549
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,746
<i>Because Sam had
rushed his tests,</i>

550
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,811
<i>we were able to get them
into surgery that afternoon.</i>

551
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,017
<i>Dr. Ayersman performed
the live-donor transplant.</i>

552
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,788
<i>He resected the right
lobe, hepatic vein,</i>

553
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,124
<i>and hepatic artery
of Sam's liver,</i>

554
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,189
<i>and transplanted it into Kayla.</i>

555
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,098
<i>The operation was a success.</i>

556
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,566
<i>Kayla and Sam continued
to receive routine care.</i>

557
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,707
Two months later,

558
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,900
she came by for an exam.

559
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,568
July 24, be precise.

560
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,038
You did the exam?

561
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,557
Honestly, I just
wanted... "Honestly"?

562
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,049
So you've been
lying up until now?

563
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,347
Let's make a deal. I won't
use the word "honestly,"

564
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,080
and you'll quit stopping
by to see House

565
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,916
so you don't take it
out on me afterwards.

566
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,287
How about that?

567
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,193
I wanted to be as far away
from Kayla as possible.

568
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,361
And House was
rubbing my nose in it.

569
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,898
How are the girls?

570
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,523
They're great.

571
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:53,196
Dory had her first crush,
which was cute. Oh, yeah?

572
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,373
And then her first
sort of breakup,

573
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,238
which was not so cute.

574
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,079
You're hot. 99.3.

575
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,340
Have you been coughing? No.

576
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,443
Pain in urinating? No.

577
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,290
99's not that high, is it?

578
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,519
Immunosuppressants block fevers,

579
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,027
you shouldn't have one at all.

580
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,599
I'm sending a nurse in
here to draw cultures.

581
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,697
And I'm ordering a chest x-ray.

582
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,799
I wasn't making
any more mistakes.

583
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,066
Another phrase to avoid
in front of the committee.

584
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,199
She spiked a
fever an hour later.

585
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,836
Her AST and ALT are
up. She's rejecting the liver.

586
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,709
No, it's just an infection.

587
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,681
One of her cultures
is growing out strep.

588
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,216
Just one? Probably
a contaminant.

589
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,048
She's dehydrated, her
hematocrit's way up. It's strep.

590
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,485
Her transaminases are up, too.

591
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,648
That's just stress from
the strep. Jeez, Chase.

592
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,022
You and this strep.
Get a room already.

593
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,027
She's not rejecting the liver.

594
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,295
It's just an infection,
she'll be fine.

595
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,942
Worst case, we
could re-list her.

596
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,400
You House?

597
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:56,968
Well, that depends.

598
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,767
Are you gonna hit Dr. House?

599
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,432
You haven't even seen my sister,
and you're being cute with me?

600
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,909
Sam, we're talking
about her right now.

601
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,238
Her fever might... Could
be hep B, hep C, right?

602
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,806
This is treatable. You give
her interferon, she's okay, right?

603
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,612
You know a lot about hepatitis.

604
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,847
He just donated his liver.

605
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,188
You're flushed. You sick?

606
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,228
I'm tired. You're hiding
the fact that you're sick.

607
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,039
Now, why would you do
that? Hey, what are you...

608
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,622
Now, either you
specifically asked

609
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,361
for a tattoo of a heart that's
been left out in the sun too long,

610
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,562
or that is a really
bad home job.

611
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:35,165
It's a very common way of
getting hep C. Which you have.

612
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,209
And you've had it a long time.

613
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,253
It was gonna keep
me from giving my liver.

614
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,409
You paid off that lab tech
to say you were clean?

615
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,829
It hasn't been active in years,
she was gonna die if I didn't.

616
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,321
You paid someone off?

617
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,945
That is totally unethical!

618
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,686
Get an MRI for him
and his sister, right now.

619
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,589
She got hep from me, didn't she?

620
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,292
No! No, no, no, no. God, no.

621
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,692
I think she got cancer from you.

622
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,637
House was right?

623
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,803
The brother had an
undiagnosed hepatoma

624
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,870
that was transplanted
with his liver.

625
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,675
It grew a lot faster in Kayla
because she was immunosuppressed.

626
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,682
How could House have known?

627
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,651
Hepatitis can
cause liver cancer.

628
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,316
Plus, her hematocrit, red
blood cell count, was high.

629
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,451
Usually means dehydration.

630
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,497
Rare cases, cancer.

631
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,032
It probably saved Sam's life.

632
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,332
<i>We were able to operate on him
early enough, before it metastasized.</i>

633
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,099
O2 sats 94.

634
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,604
Kayla had already
started rejecting the liver.

635
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,806
And you couldn't re-list her because
of the cancer. Nothing we could do.

636
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,613
This is good.

637
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,184
The brother lying about his
hep, it's an intervening act.

638
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,686
The proximate cause of
her cancer, not your mistake.

639
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,849
She would have died six months
ago if he hadn't given up his liver.

640
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,517
Maybe. Can't prove it.

641
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,192
You need to come with me.

642
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,856
Just been served with papers.

643
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,591
Actually, paper. One page.

644
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,328
"Defendants
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital

645
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,999
"and Dr. Robert
Chase. Blah, blah, blah.

646
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,043
"Medical malpractice,
negligence. Blah, blah."

647
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,387
You're surprised they're suing?

648
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,279
You think people love Chase so
much they're gonna just forgo...

649
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,715
Punitive damages in
the amount of $10 million.

650
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,583
Punitives? That means they're
alleging gross negligence.

651
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,485
Their lawyer's
obviously out of his mind.

652
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,649
Larry Ruseckas, he's not crazy.

653
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,919
Oh, no. I've been sued by him.

654
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,929
You have been hiding
things and lying to me all day.

655
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,759
I haven't lied about anything.

656
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,426
Except for the parts that I
admitted I was lying about.

657
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,403
And I'm not the one
being sued. I feel funny.

658
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,100
Well, what haven't you told us?

659
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,019
Before she checked out,
Sam found her a second liver.

660
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,852
She had cancer, how
could she... Black market.

661
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,684
There's a doctor in Mexico City
who was gonna do the surgery.

662
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,695
She's leaving from JFK at 5:00.

663
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,890
To meet some Mexican
guy in the back of a van

664
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,542
with a pig's liver and a
hacksaw? This is nuts!

665
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,091
You wanna rat me out to House?

666
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,569
He'll say if there's a chance
in a billion then go for it.

667
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,162
This is not what she wants.

668
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,831
She's being manipulated

669
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:25,105
by a morally guilty brother
and a legally guiltier doctor.

670
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,736
You think she wants to die?

671
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,437
She's dying either way.

672
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:30,981
Chase!

673
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,816
How many people you know walking
around with a black market organ

674
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,320
from a Third World surgeon, huh?

675
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,550
This isn't gonna
be your salvation.

676
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,250
It's just one more
thing they'll pin on you.

677
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,495
Go in there, be the good guy.

678
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,933
We need to talk.

679
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,401
No, there's no time.

680
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,632
Two minutes.

681
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,433
Kayla.

682
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,842
I made a mistake.

683
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,340
I wasn't as blunt as I should
have been about your odds.

684
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,512
I probably didn't want
to face them myself.

685
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,481
Dr. Chase, please don't do this.

686
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:11,387
The stress of the travel, the
operation and even then the cancer...

687
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:14,288
Kayla, we're going! My dad died.

688
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,454
Lung cancer.

689
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,622
I saw him a couple of
months before it happened.

690
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:19,858
We never talked about it.

691
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,923
I'm sorry your father
died, but it has nothing...

692
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,128
He never even
told me he was sick.

693
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,469
I wish he had.

694
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,799
It would...

695
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,670
You're gonna die. Alone.

696
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,612
Thousands of miles
from your children.

697
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,614
You don't wanna do that to them.

698
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,592
Kayla...

699
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:49,727
I'm sorry, Sam.

700
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,265
Kayla, you can't give up.

701
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,835
If you do this,

702
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,573
if you go home,

703
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,201
I killed you.

704
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,675
No.

705
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,381
You gave me three months.

706
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:19,288
You gave Dory and Nikki
three more months with me.

707
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,795
And when they found my cancer,

708
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,130
they found yours.

709
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,033
And I got to save
my baby brother.

710
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,381
<i>A week later,
Kayla died at home.</i>

711
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,980
<i>Sam was furious.</i>

712
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,990
Gotta be why the big lawsuit.

713
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,698
- Are you buying this?
- Of course not!

714
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,059
There was no illegal
transplant, there's no causation.

715
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,824
He was ready to kill me.

716
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,858
Maybe he's lying to his lawyers.

717
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,627
Or you're lying to us.

718
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,999
Last Thursday he saw you for
post-op care. If you hate your doctor,

719
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,870
you find another doctor
before you find a lawyer.

720
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,442
This guy didn't sue Cameron or
Foreman, he didn't even sue House!

721
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,876
There's something personal here,

722
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,074
something you don't want us
to know before your hearing.

723
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:21,277
The guy didn't hate you before
that meeting, he hated you after.

724
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,220
So, how's everything else?

725
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,155
The girls? Oh, you know.

726
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,059
A lot of crying,
some nightmares.

727
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,227
We'll be okay, though.

728
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,793
Good.

729
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:40,064
Girls are not gonna be happy
about leaving town, though.

730
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,800
They love that house,

731
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,474
the yard, their friends.

732
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,875
You're moving? Yeah.

733
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,744
Ever since the operation,
I've been on disability,

734
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,012
and the mortgage...

735
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,484
So, we're moving out of
state, somewhere cheaper.

736
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,783
Anyways, thanks.

737
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,453
I killed your sister.

738
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,997
I misdiagnosed her ulcer.

739
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,796
It killed her.

740
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,131
Shut up, man.

741
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,940
She liked you, just...

742
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,806
I was hung over when
she came back to see me.

743
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,937
I'd been up half the night
drinking, had a headache,

744
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,744
and I just wanted to
get the hell out of there.

745
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,689
I couldn't care less what your sister
was saying about her stomach pain.

746
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,207
May I speak to my
future former employee?

747
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,735
Great story.

748
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,677
You think I'm lying?

749
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,111
That's exactly what I told him.

750
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,646
I'm sure it is.

751
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,717
But you lied to him.
You want him to sue you.

752
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,514
I killed his sister.

753
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,588
I ordered black coffee
this morning and got cream.

754
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,218
Everybody screws up. They
didn't put poison in your coffee.

755
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,921
I've seen you hung over.

756
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,190
You weren't the day you
blew his sister's diagnosis.

757
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,324
What does it matter why? Is she
less dead if I have a good excuse?

758
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,529
If I thought you'd screwed up because
you were drunk, I would have fired you.

759
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,664
You knew? You were
depressed and distracted.

760
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:26,237
I assumed you'd gotten a
phone call from your stepmom.

761
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,978
This is Robert.

762
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,189
What did he die of?

763
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,526
That's impossible.

764
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,965
I saw him two months ago. If he
had lung cancer, he would have...

765
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,309
Dr. Chase?

766
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,094
Good news is, both your
parents are dead now.

767
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,466
So no reason to screw up this
bad again. How'd you know?

768
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,937
There's this interconnected
network of computers,

769
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,736
or "Interweb," where you can...

770
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,604
How did you know to look?

771
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,872
When he visited, he told me
he only had two months left.

772
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,817
When you screwed
up, I did the math.

773
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,580
Why didn't you tell
me he was dying?

774
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,415
He asked me not to.

775
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,551
So you just hung me
out there to be blindsided?

776
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,656
Yeah, Chase, it
was all my fault.

777
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,626
Look, you've got a choice.
You can either tell the truth,

778
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,933
the hospital settles, the
family gets some money.

779
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,405
They get to keep their house.

780
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,309
Or you can keep up this lie.

781
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,373
The family gets
punitive damages,

782
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,005
they buy a jet, and they
move to Park Avenue,

783
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,910
and you have to
find another career.

784
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,783
You're not gonna say anything?

785
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,718
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

786
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:24,026
Legally, it's better for me
if you go down in flames.

787
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,507
Is Chase telling the
committee about his dad?

788
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,385
I don't know.

789
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:53,123
I thought you were gonna
get him to sell me out.

790
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,924
I wouldn't do that. Why not?

791
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,991
You're my client, too.

792
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,830
Yeah.

793
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,999
And that's not gonna change
unless you leave this job,

794
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,797
or I do.

795
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,669
So how do you deal with a
coworker that you have feelings for?

796
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,540
Positive or negative.

797
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,039
I don't wanna end up like Chase.

798
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:21,913
I don't wanna get emotionally
caught up and kill you.

799
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:30,920
It's not all negative.

800
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,308
Maybe you were right, maybe...

801
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,038
Maybe that is the problem.

802
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,355
So what do we do?

803
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,230
I don't know.

804
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,300
Dr. House?

805
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:26,347
After considering the testimonial
and documentary evidence,

806
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,354
this ad-hoc committee in the matter of
Kayla McGinley has reached a decision.

807
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,684
Dr. Chase,

808
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,216
your error resulted
in a patient's death.

809
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,022
You also lied, both to your
superiors and the patient's brother.

810
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:43,530
But, taking into account the
mitigating factor of your father's death,

811
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,127
we've decided not to
revoke your privileges.

812
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:50,932
You'll receive one week's suspension,
and a letter in your permanent file.

813
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,234
Now, as for Dr. House.

814
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,871
There is no evidence
of a failure to supervise

815
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,314
that would lead to
disciplinary action.

816
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:03,552
And yet, there is enough in the record
to be very troubled by your conduct,

817
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:08,559
including certain allegations of blackmail
from members of the transplant team,

818
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:12,119
and by your general refusal
to meet with your patients.

819
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,896
It should be noted that
your patient's cancer

820
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:17,800
was diagnosed as a result of
a direct physical examination...

821
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,964
Not of the patient. I met
the brother, never met her.

822
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,940
Do you want me to
go to a family reunion

823
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,975
every time I take on a patient?

824
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,074
The committee has determined
that for no less than one month,

825
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:31,310
Dr. House will have his practice
supervised by another doctor,

826
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,851
to be designated by Dr. Cuddy.

827
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,114
This proceeding is adjourned.

828
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,895
Did you know this was coming?

829
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,665
They contacted me
about an hour ago.

830
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,571
What's happening to Chase?

831
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,276
Now you're fired!

832
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,877
No. He's not.

833
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,071
Dr. House,

834
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,481
meet your new boss.

835
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,625
Guess I'm his best friend now.
