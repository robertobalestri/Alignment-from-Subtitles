1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,269
Two spades.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,138
Three hearts.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,498
It's all yours.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,772
I'm void.

5
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,506
And that's five.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,778
And that's six. Not bad.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,851
On a slam contract, you normally
wanna play your winners early.

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:21,921
Sorry, Daddy.

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,185
You're learning.
You're doing fine.

10
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,194
Connie Gilman's a good
player. And a widow.

11
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:31,096
I should take her out
because she can play bridge.

12
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,293
You're a true romantic.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,662
You should ask somebody out.

14
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,466
You think Cecile's
not dating yet?

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,598
Cecile was dating
before she left.

16
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,697
Oh, shut up, Marv.

17
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,744
Nope. I have a partner
and she's doing great.

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,711
Amy should be out having fun.

19
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,716
I'm having fun. MAN: Yeah.

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,147
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

21
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,323
One no-trump.

22
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,501
I'm just a little nauseous.
I think I ate too much.

23
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,567
Can we take a break?
Of course. Excuse us.

24
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,436
What did you eat?

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,637
Nothing weird.

26
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,737
Have you been drinking?
No, Dad, you know...

27
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,714
Because I don't mind if you...

28
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,710
Dad?

29
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,646
Dad?

30
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,390
<i>Dad? What are you doing?</i>

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,488
You're scaring
me! It hurts! Let go!

32
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,695
What are you doing?

33
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,762
Henry!

34
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,397
Henry, let go of her!

35
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,268
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me, but...

36
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,446
What?

37
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,640
Are you okay?

38
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,308
What's the matter?

39
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,694
You had what's called
an absence seizure.

40
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,888
Anything like that
happen to you before?

41
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,091
No, nothing.

42
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,531
He's been really healthy.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,592
He jogs, he eats
right, he... Yeah.

44
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,264
Well, I did have a
headache last Sunday.

45
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,366
And for the past two years
I've been getting acid reflux a lot,

46
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,970
and I thought that
antacids were all I needed.

47
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,571
Should I have come in sooner?

48
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,479
For acid reflux and a headache?

49
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,783
Well, I... You know, I hear the
coffee downstairs is really good.

50
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,793
Could you get me a cup, honey?

51
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,898
Would you mind
closing the blinds?

52
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,867
His right testicle was
almost twice as big as his left.

53
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,965
Cool.

54
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,840
It's probably testicular cancer.

55
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,104
No. That's impossible.

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,341
The symptoms all indicate...

57
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,508
The shoes aren't right.

58
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,684
Here's how testicular
cancer would manifest itself.

59
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,919
First, the patient would get the
exact symptoms that he's got.

60
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,857
Then Foreman would examine him.

61
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,830
Then he'd suspect testicular cancer on
account of the symptoms being so perfect.

62
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,696
Then he'd stick a needle in
it, then he'd call a surgeon.

63
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,704
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

64
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,237
And, since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

65
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,539
the disease obviously did
not progress in that fashion.

66
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,444
LP showed some white
cells. But his MRI's clean.

67
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,881
Sure. If you call a
microabcess in his brain "clean."

68
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,643
What, you don't trust me?

69
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,155
Are you're talking about
the left temporal lobe?

70
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,748
Neat, you can see
through my hand.

71
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,848
It's just a shadow.

72
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,018
Or it's an infection.

73
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,891
When guys have
brain-crotch problems

74
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,864
it's usually the result of using one
too much and the other too little.

75
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,992
Blood and urine were negative for
syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

76
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,003
So treat him
for all three, stat.

77
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,636
Negative means
he doesn't have it.

78
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,641
No, negative means he
probably doesn't have it,

79
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,233
which means he
probably has cancer.

80
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,254
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

81
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,873
We're wearing the wrong
shoes for testicular cancer.

82
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,577
They're perfect for lymphoma.
Except Chase's, they're just goofy.

83
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,082
Lymphoma could cause infiltrates

84
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,952
in his reproductive
organs and his brain.

85
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,423
If it's this advanced, he's
dead no matter what we do.

86
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,950
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

87
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,036
Who's the lucky woman?

88
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,129
My wife.

89
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,067
No, I don't wanna know
who gets the chocolates,

90
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,839
I wanna know who you're
having the affair with.

91
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,538
He fell on his head
as a child. Tragic.

92
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,947
Norwegian chocolate.

93
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,112
Frankly, you buy that
stuff, the terrorists win.

94
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,356
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

95
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,154
Healthy human
beings express feelings,

96
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,161
such as affection,
by giving gifts.

97
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,094
Gifts express guilt.

98
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,428
The more expensive the
expression, the deeper the guilt.

99
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,899
That's a $12 box.

100
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,835
Either you haven't slept with
her yet or she wasn't that good.

101
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,804
It's not all about sex, House.

102
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,773
Really? When did that change?

103
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,537
I wanna get Depo-Provera.

104
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,245
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

105
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,787
the risk of you getting
pregnant is pretty limited.

106
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,790
Yeah, but it would calm me down,
right? If I get a high enough dose.

107
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:01,591
You mean "calm" as in a peaceful
lake on a cool summer evening?

108
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,325
Or in the lesser-used meaning of
nothing can ever bother you again

109
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,230
because life has
absolutely no meaning.

110
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,464
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

111
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,032
Yeah.

112
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,208
Okay, I'm gonna
get up to leave now.

113
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,339
I'm gonna walk to that
door, turn the handle,

114
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,578
and then you're suddenly gonna
decide that you have to tell me the truth.

115
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,052
I'm gonna have to turn
around, come all the way back.

116
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,956
You see, the thing is, my leg hurts. Can
we cut the walking out of the equation?

117
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,926
I love cows.

118
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,401
Any particular variety?

119
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,272
Guernseys? Holsteins?

120
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,704
Which are the black
and white ones?

121
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,603
Oh, God.

122
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,304
I pass a farm on
my way to school.

123
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:56,374
And they're so beautiful, they're
so majestic, I dream about them.

124
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:02,153
Leather shoes, hamburgers. How
could anybody do that to a cow?

125
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,124
Make love, not
belts. That's beautiful.

126
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,352
I haven't actually...

127
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,450
Relax.

128
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,792
This is something we
doctors deal with all the time.

129
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,300
I'm gonna write you the name of a
drug. You don't need a prescription.

130
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,028
And it looks just
like Depo-Provera.

131
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,212
But does it do the same thing?

132
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,670
Oh, God, no.

133
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,868
That stuff has all sorts of nasty
side effects. It's real medicine.

134
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,978
No, this is all you need. Your frat
buddies will be completely fooled.

135
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,075
You can tell them how
appalled the doctor was.

136
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,674
Lots of laughs.

137
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,920
We think you may have a
sexually transmitted disease.

138
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,456
No. It's not possible.

139
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,425
Sir, maybe we should
speak in private?

140
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,960
Have you tested him for this?

141
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,120
The tests were negative.

142
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,098
Well, then it's not that.
So, what else could it be?

143
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,160
Nothing good.

144
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,204
If you've been having
sex you have to tell me.

145
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,969
I have not had sex
since my divorce!

146
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,439
I didn't ask him to take the medicine.
I asked you to give him the medicine.

147
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,950
He hasn't had sex in
over a year. He's lying.

148
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,543
He knows what's at stake.

149
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,282
We should start treating
him for lymphoma right away.

150
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,533
Maybe if we hit
him hard and fast.

151
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,991
Wilson!

152
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,157
How long can you go without sex?

153
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,957
How long can you go
without annoying people?

154
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,055
No, seriously. A week, a month?

155
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,394
I'm not having an affair!

156
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,866
I didn't say you were.

157
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,733
Not in this conversation.
We're talking about a patient.

158
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,796
People have impulse
control. We don't need sex.

159
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,034
Well, not like air.

160
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,543
But as a biological
imperative, sure we do.

161
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,273
There's two things we get
stupid for: money and sex.

162
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,941
And since money rarely
enters the bloodstream...

163
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,508
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

164
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,419
I told him we could talk privately,
he didn't care if she was there.

165
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,356
It's almost noon. The
little girl would go to lunch.

166
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:48,361
As soon as she's out the door, you're
gonna get paged. Then you page me.

167
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,626
Lunch is early, huh?

168
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,500
Hi.

169
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,567
I'm Dr. House.

170
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,039
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

171
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,577
I'm sorry. I couldn't
tell my daughter. Right.

172
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,484
Because she's, what, 22?

173
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,113
I slept with her mom.

174
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,892
She probably knows
that's happened already.

175
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,260
Roll over.

176
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,833
My wife had an
affair. I forgave her.

177
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,731
She had another affair
and I forgave her again.

178
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,669
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

179
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,971
So smart.

180
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,944
You must be very
proud. Roll over.

181
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,709
I assume you've been in love.

182
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,947
Is that the one that makes
your pants feel funny?

183
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,283
I'm starting you on a
cocktail of STD meds.

184
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,447
Amy is just getting over it.

185
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,054
She barely spoke to
her mom for months

186
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,685
and if she thought that
it was happening again,

187
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,787
that that's why I got sick...

188
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,495
We just happened to be

189
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:06,370
at the same Italian
cheese-tasting thing.

190
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,332
Cheese is the devil's plaything.

191
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,744
It was just the one night.

192
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,280
You're obviously
completely over her.

193
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,375
Amy thinks love leads
you to make stupid choices.

194
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,845
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

195
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,582
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

196
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,817
If you're not prepared
to look stupid,

197
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,952
then nothing great is
ever gonna happen, right?

198
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,292
On the other hand,

199
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,823
I guess your testicles aren't
going to explode, either.

200
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,798
Dad.

201
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,403
Is everything okay?

202
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,572
I have a sexually
transmitted disease.

203
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,312
How is that possible?

204
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,843
He met a woman in church.

205
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,016
Does she play bridge?

206
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,355
Does she...

207
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,498
Crash cart! Oh, God!

208
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,539
Is this another
seizure? Shut up!

209
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,405
Coming in!

210
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,569
Oh, God!

211
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:18,668
Here you go.

212
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,873
Forty milligrams furosemide.

213
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,806
Knock him out.

214
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,245
It's in.

215
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,951
How would an STD do this?

216
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,662
It wouldn't.

217
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,966
It was flash pulmonary edema.

218
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,971
We took a liter of fluid off but
the problem wasn't with his lungs.

219
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
It's his heart.

220
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,633
There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

221
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,805
It's not an STD. Lymphoma
wouldn't erupt that suddenly.

222
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,007
So what is it then?

223
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,518
A disease that attacks his
brain, heart and testicles.

224
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,777
I think Byron wrote about that.

225
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,185
Could be psittacosis.

226
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,349
Chlamydia cultures
would've come back positive.

227
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,325
Strep viridians
can hit the heart.

228
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,884
Wouldn't mess with
the reproductive system.

229
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,727
Maybe things aren't
so nicely connected.

230
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,633
He's 65.

231
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,104
We could be looking at multiple systems
just starting to break down independently.

232
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,005
Way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

233
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,738
He's had acid reflux for
years, it can't be relevant.

234
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:28,680
Seems there are other ways to kill
people besides having sex with them.

235
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,219
You don't need this so much.

236
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,790
Problem is not your
lungs, it's your heart.

237
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:53,404
That Italian cheese thing at
the church, what sort of cheese?

238
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,771
Why do you need to know?

239
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,833
I'm having a fondue party.

240
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,441
Was it sheep cheese?

241
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,309
Might have been, why?

242
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,144
Was it soft? Yeah.

243
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,980
Taste like crap? Yeah, bitter.

244
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,417
Taste like this?

245
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,148
Yeah, but how did you...

246
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,489
That was regular
low-fat American.

247
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,721
I added some
bacteria for flavor.

248
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,195
You fed him bacteria?

249
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,731
It's pretty much on everything.

250
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,132
Especially the unpasteurized
sheep cheese they make in the Alps.

251
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,170
That stuff will give
you brucellosis.

252
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,833
Key to a long life: exotic
women and boring cheese.

253
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,399
I'm gonna start you on
rifampin and doxycycline.

254
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,104
Doesn't make any sense.

255
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,080
I mean, nobody else
at the church got sick.

256
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,643
99.9% of Christians have
so much acid in their stomach,

257
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:44,419
they become churning cauldrons of death for
all those nasty little brucellosis bugs.

258
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,483
But you were taking
antacids for your acid reflux.

259
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,927
So that turns
your digestive tract

260
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,899
into a pleasant scenic river
for all those bacterial tourists.

261
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,406
You sure you're right?

262
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,375
Absolutely. Your
socks don't match.

263
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,421
Which means you got up
and got dressed in the dark,

264
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,989
which means you don't
wanna wake your wife,

265
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,058
which means you don't wanna
talk to her, which means...

266
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,550
I was referring to your patient.

267
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,743
Oh, that.

268
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,344
No. Come on, I'm
basing it on cheese.

269
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,013
How long before you
get the tests back?

270
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,489
Well, we'll know before that.

271
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,618
If I'm wrong, he'll just keep
getting worse and slowly die.

272
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,731
And if I'm right, either we caught
it in time and he gets better,

273
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,290
or we didn't, and he goes into
cardiac arrest at any moment.

274
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,735
Paddles!

275
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,644
Charging. Two-Fifty. Clear!

276
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,250
Charging! Three hundred! Clear!

277
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,650
Charging! Three-sixty! Clear!

278
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,155
Epinephrine.

279
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,494
You gonna tell her?

280
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,403
That you suspect an affair?

281
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,738
Sure. Well, she already
hates you, why not?

282
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,938
Because you think getting it off
your chest will let you sleep better.

283
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,039
It won't. You'll end up
sleeping on my lumpy couch.

284
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,174
There's nothing to tell.

285
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,049
Why are you playing
foosball here at 8:00 at night?

286
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,364
You always wanna
simplify everything.

287
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,052
Boil it down to nice, easy
equations. Nice, easy answers.

288
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,923
Go home and have
sex with your wife.

289
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,933
His heart is back in sinus rhythm.
There's a lot of damage, though.

290
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,472
It was brucellosis,
but we got to it too late.

291
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,579
The vegetation broke off
in his main coronary artery

292
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,939
and caused an infarction.

293
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,071
His heart muscle's half dead.
He'll be lucky to last a week.

294
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,308
Other than that, how's he doing?

295
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,414
Seriously.

296
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:58,117
His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils,
how's all that other stuff doing?

297
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:02,684
His brain is clear now and
so is the genito-urinary tract

298
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,061
and his kidney function is good.

299
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,932
So, all he needs is a
heart and he's out of here.

300
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,830
He's a prime
candidate for transplant.

301
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,770
Doesn't smoke,
drinks moderately.

302
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,939
His tox screen was negative
for illegal drugs and legal ones.

303
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,157
Surveillance blood
cultures show absolutely

304
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,348
no sign of any lingering
brucella bacteria.

305
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,387
He's 66 years old.

306
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,046
He told me he was 65.

307
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,522
Liar. I'm out of here.

308
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:35,858
There is an inverse correlation
between patient age and success rates.

309
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,191
He's in excellent health.

310
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,961
This was his first hospitalization
since breaking his leg at 23.

311
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,661
Or 22, I'm not sure anymore.

312
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,830
If this patient were to
survive the operation,

313
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,597
he'd get another, what,

314
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,132
five, 10, maybe 20
years if he's very lucky?

315
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,874
So you're saying that old people
aren't as worth saving as young people?

316
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,644
He's saying that hearts
are a scarce resource.

317
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,346
We obviously have to choose criteria...
- No, I get it.

318
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,116
Women live longer, so they
should get preference, right?

319
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,624
And African-Americans,
they die a lot younger,

320
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,920
so to hell with them.

321
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,656
What, you think you're gonna
win me over by calling me a racist?

322
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,891
If the test is who gets
to use it the longest,

323
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,092
you can either be a
racist or a hypocrite.

324
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,466
Your patient had
a life, a family.

325
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,063
We've got
18-year-old kids who...

326
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,131
How old are you, Doctor?

327
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,109
When do we get to
toss you on an ice floe?

328
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,972
And thank you, Dr. House.

329
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,777
Unless anybody else
has any further questions,

330
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,375
we will now go
into private session.

331
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,084
Oh, I'm on pins and needles.
I wonder how you'll decide.

332
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,795
The Nets just won their third
game in a row, beat the Lakers.

333
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,502
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,429
They voted no.

335
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,535
So,

336
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,770
when

337
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,971
will I die?

338
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,084
You might have a week.

339
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,019
I wrote a letter to
the Board of Directors

340
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,419
appealing the transplant
committee's decision.

341
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:46,084
I'm alleging bias against you
clouded their medical judgment.

342
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,182
I need you to sign.

343
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,659
They made the right call.

344
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,439
You don't believe that.
You told the committee...

345
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,830
I was advocating for my patient.

346
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,006
Then why are you...

347
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,133
Advocating for my patient.

348
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,402
I've got that clinic duty.

349
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,006
I need you to get me the files on
everybody who dies here today.

350
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,573
You really think this thing
will change their decision?

351
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,744
Nope.

352
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,290
I think I broke my ankle.

353
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,422
I was kicked. By a hoof.

354
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm so in love. She
was so beautiful.

355
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,197
Which one? One of the
black and white ones,

356
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,969
I'm not sure what type...
Not which type, which one?

357
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,510
I want a name.

358
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,374
Why would it have
a name? Not "it."

359
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,879
"She." Or "he."

360
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,741
I wanna know her
dreams, her hopes.

361
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,909
It's a cow.

362
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,383
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

363
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,083
People who actually have
this condition rationalize it.

364
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,561
They dismiss it, they don't
elevate it to the level of poetry.

365
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,858
Plus there's a wooden
splinter in there.

366
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,196
So, either you hit
yourself with a two-by-four,

367
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,895
or Elsie has a peg leg.

368
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,962
I'm off duty at 6:00.

369
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,939
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

370
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,202
I'm sick!

371
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:12,404
And you're a doctor, you
have a duty to help me.

372
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,212
Technically, I don't
have to treat anybody

373
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,308
before running
a series of painful

374
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,751
and often humiliating tests.

375
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,220
Whatever you need.

376
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,691
90-year-old woman
died of pneumonia.

377
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,527
Unless she has a
bionic heart, what's next?

378
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,693
Baby died in the ICU...

379
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:39,569
Babies are useless. They got hearts
the size of ping-pong balls. Next.

380
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,407
A 40-year-old male.

381
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,907
Yes? Heart attack.

382
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,410
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

383
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,316
There's no other deaths. There's
one woman who was in a car accident.

384
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,613
Bad one, I hope.

385
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,917
The organ procurement
people have been notified.

386
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,047
Give me her file.

387
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,558
It's in the ER, they're
still working on her.

388
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,152
Age? About 40.

389
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,889
Young, damn.

390
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,124
Young is good.

391
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,132
Smoker? Don't know.

392
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,267
Find out. She's still alive.

393
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,313
Even if we get on the
list, we can't go near her...

394
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,464
Overweight?

395
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,534
She's on the hefty side.

396
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,631
Excellent.

397
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,108
Our odds just went up.

398
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,008
What odds? What is this?

399
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,515
60% of potential donor
hearts get tossed in the trash

400
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,413
because there's
something wrong with them.

401
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,179
With fat people,
it's closer to 80.

402
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,948
But if her heart's
no good, then...

403
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,422
Big fat, sloppy heart
beats no heart at all.

404
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,537
Are you Mr. Neuberger? Yes.

405
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,806
I'm Dr. House.

406
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,690
I need to ask you a few
questions about your wife.

407
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,807
Is she gonna be okay?

408
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm afraid I don't know that.

409
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,576
Could you tell me
about her accident?

410
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,146
They think she fell asleep, went
off the road. That's all they told me.

411
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,124
Any problems with
her health up until now?

412
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,216
Why?

413
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,529
Please, it's important.

414
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,142
She had a fever today,
but otherwise she was...

415
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,897
How high? About 101.

416
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,269
She hasn't missed a
day of teaching in years.

417
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:24,134
And I should've
made her stay home.

418
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,774
Any other symptoms?

419
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,244
A stomachache. Who
cares? She was in a car crash!

420
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,340
Mr. Neuberger? Yeah?

421
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,544
My name's Ellen Stambler.

422
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,058
I'm the organ procurement
coordinator for southern New Jersey.

423
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,216
I just want to assure you that we'll
treat her organs with care and dignity.

424
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,559
Her organs?

425
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,431
Laura died?

426
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,467
I'm sorry, I thought...

427
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,897
She was just pronounced dead.

428
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,170
I thought he was telling you.

429
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,938
I didn't know.

430
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,379
You should never
make assumptions.

431
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,975
What did you want from me?

432
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,549
I'm sorry for your loss.

433
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,055
But I need your wife's heart.

434
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,728
The organ procurement
coordinator just left the hospital.

435
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,241
Means we got lucky. Either
that or she's getting lunch.

436
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,369
Dead woman's last
name have a "U" or a "W"?

437
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,777
You're hacking into a
confidential patient file?

438
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,577
Is that a problem for you?

439
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,447
It's a "U". N-E-U.

440
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,810
Berger.

441
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,256
Three minutes ago, her organs
were officially declared "not viable."

442
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,556
Time to go dumpster diving.

443
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,731
Hey!

444
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,708
She's got Hepatitis C. Her
ALT's are three times normal.

445
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,644
With Henry's immune system
down, an infected heart will kill him.

446
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,374
Fortunately, she
didn't have Hep C.

447
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,574
She tested positive.

448
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,014
Her history says otherwise.

449
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,428
Her husband told me she was
running a fever with stomach pains,

450
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,444
not symptomatic of Hep C.

451
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,144
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

452
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,213
Hey, what are you doing?

453
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,225
Again, sorry.

454
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,724
But we need to talk.

455
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,431
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

456
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,400
His wife signed an
organ donor card.

457
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,563
Which became invalid when
her organs were turned down.

458
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,266
I can use them! I
just need some time.

459
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,304
Committee says they
won't take her heart.

460
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,709
Another committee says
a guy can't have a heart.

461
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,406
It's a marriage made in heaven.

462
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,280
I could find a surgical
team that can do this,

463
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,068
classify it as experimental. It's
not gonna screw with their numbers.

464
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,396
This is what she wanted. She
wanted her organs to help other...

465
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,548
She never wanted to be
kept alive on a ventilator!

466
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,591
She's not, she's dead!

467
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:30,493
She's not in pain, she's not suffering,
it's just her meat we're dealing with here.

468
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,463
This is my wife. Not anymore.

469
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,561
She deserves some
respect, some dignity.

470
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,299
I respect the living. Right!

471
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,001
That is why you made me
think that you were her doctor,

472
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,874
made me believe that
maybe there was some hope.

473
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,537
I never said that I was her
doctor. Fine! You didn't lie,

474
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,225
but you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

475
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,844
I'm taking her off
the machines. Now.

476
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,188
Nicely played.

477
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,314
It's not over.

478
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,064
Excuse me. Are
you Mr. Neuberger?

479
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,091
Yeah, why?

480
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,567
I'm Amy Arrington.

481
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,403
I wanted to thank you.

482
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,580
This girl's father will die by next
weekend unless he gets your wife's heart.

483
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,313
House, don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

484
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,220
No. It's hugely manipulative.

485
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,154
You're an ass.

486
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:35,422
Hey, listen! You take
your wife off life support

487
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:38,191
and I'll have forgotten
about this in two weeks.

488
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,561
Gail here, on the other hand...

489
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,655
Amy.

490
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,030
Whatever.

491
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:47,531
You're mad at me. Fine, I get
that. Take it out on me, not on her.

492
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,351
Fine. Your dad
can have her heart.

493
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:35,076
Fever, stomach pain,
raised liver enzymes.

494
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,486
She's sick.

495
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,683
Worse than that, she's dead.

496
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,886
My point is, even if it's
not Hep C, it's something.

497
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,104
They turned her down as a donor

498
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,791
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

499
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,594
Whatever made
her sick will kill him!

500
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,635
Yeah. So what is it?

501
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,397
The enzymes indicate...

502
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,201
You want us to do a differential
diagnosis on a dead person?

503
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,400
We're going to cure her.

504
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,908
We're going to cure death?

505
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,309
Doubt it.

506
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,207
Just wanna get the infection out of her
heart before we get the heart out of her.

507
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,979
The fever indicates
an infection.

508
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,146
She probably has Hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

509
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,985
Let's assume, just for fun,

510
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,924
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

511
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,460
Fever and belly pain.

512
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,838
Could be a gall
bladder infection.

513
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,455
Like that.

514
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,158
Do an MRI, stat.

515
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,208
You really don't
need to be here.

516
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,402
I assume House
is a great doctor.

517
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,572
Why would you assume that?

518
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,982
Because, when you're that big a
jerk, you're either great or unemployed.

519
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,716
No sign of gall
bladder infection.

520
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,816
But there was a
cyst. Perfectly round.

521
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,521
Hep C wouldn't cause... The
question was never "Is it Hep C?"

522
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,622
The question was, "Given
that it's not Hep C, what is it?"

523
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,690
Adenoma? Not solid enough.

524
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,394
Cavernous hemangioma?

525
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,494
Not vascular enough.

526
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,738
What if she was sloppy about
washing her hands after pooping?

527
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,104
Amoeba infection?

528
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,113
If the amebiasis started in her
liver, then spread to her blood,

529
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,173
that would explain all her
symptoms, except for the crushed skull.

530
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,927
But I'm assuming
that's from the car crash.

531
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,817
I'll start her on paromomycin
and chloroquine.

532
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,184
Ten grams each.

533
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,020
That's 20 times the normal dose.

534
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,722
Right, so we'll destroy her
retinas and damage her hearing.

535
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,730
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

536
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:29,029
Couple hours on the
meds, she'll be feeling great.

537
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,835
I got your labs.

538
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,438
Do you eat guinea pigs? No.

539
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,270
How about hamsters
or mice? Humans?

540
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,144
What are you talking about?

541
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,708
Is something wrong with me?

542
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,276
Absolutely nothing.

543
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,117
Your blood work is perfect.

544
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,920
You have lots of vitamins,
minerals, all kinds of proteins,

545
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,820
including a little something I
like to call bovine serum albumin

546
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,992
which you get from eating
the animals mentioned.

547
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,966
Or cow.

548
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,969
You don't really worship cows.

549
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,002
So I have to wonder, what
could be more humiliating

550
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:15,343
than someone calling your girlfriend
a cow and not being metaphorical?

551
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,494
Nice. That's my mom.

552
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,668
Either that's a very old
photograph or it's your stepmom.

553
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,730
She goes around the
house in a bikini. Or less.

554
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,605
I can't stop thinking about her.

555
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,110
My dad's in Europe.
I'll be watching TV,

556
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,239
she'll give me a massage.
I can't walk for an hour.

557
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,647
Still. Cows?

558
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:52,810
She's my mother!

559
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:53,943
Step.

560
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,656
Please? I just need the
medicine for three months

561
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,353
until I graduate and I
move out of the house.

562
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:04,924
Please.

563
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,368
You're not gonna have
any fun at graduation.

564
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,537
Keep up the good work.

565
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,472
Your shirt is ironed.

566
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,238
That means you haven't
told your wife anything.

567
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,047
Let's say you're right.

568
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,978
You're saying I'm right?

569
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,747
No, "let" is saying.

570
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,019
Does it occur to you that maybe
there's some deeper guidance

571
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,717
than "keep your mouth shut"?

572
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:36,819
That maybe a friend might
value concern over glibness?

573
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,386
That maybe...

574
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,500
Maybe I'm going
through something

575
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,765
that I need to have an
actual conversation about?

576
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,444
Does it occur to you that if
you need that kind of a friend,

577
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,142
you may have made
some deeper errors?

578
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:09,589
Her heartbeat's irregular.
Looks like global hypokinesis.

579
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,092
Stop the meds.

580
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,632
You're giving up?

581
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,504
Either we're wrong and
her heart is unusable,

582
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:27,774
or we're right, but the treatment we have
to give her will make her heart unusable.

583
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,910
I'm sorry. You can
pull the plug now.

584
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,150
Find me another body.

585
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,279
That fat guy on Ortho
service didn't look so hot.

586
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,378
No!

587
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,351
She's not ready.

588
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,594
You were ready this morning.

589
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,153
She's not done!

590
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,725
She's got to save that guy.

591
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,642
Alternate theories?

592
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,944
Amebiasis was our best hope.

593
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,227
The fact that her heart
rate went back to normal

594
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,962
when we stopped the
meds pretty much confirms...

595
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,318
What's our second-best hope?

596
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,551
House, put down the
wand, there's no obstruction.

597
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,250
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

598
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,455
She's a fridge
with the power out.

599
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:21,330
If we start poking around
inside, the vegetable goes bad.

600
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,461
No offense.

601
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,198
I don't see that we
have a lot of choice.

602
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:27,849
The only way we're
gonna find that infection...

603
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,016
What if it's not an infection?

604
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,668
Toxins can cause
similar symptoms,

605
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,938
especially if whatever
it is did liver damage.

606
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,946
Her toxin screen was clean.

607
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,450
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

608
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,419
Run the screen again for
whatever you can think of.

609
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,648
You, keep the
other patient alive.

610
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,315
You check out the school.

611
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,350
And I seem to need to hire another
doctor to go search her home.

612
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,726
Come on.

613
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:59,102
If she was taking any
medications, I'd know about it.

614
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,935
Does your wife dye her hair?

615
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,233
No.

616
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,412
Her mom never went
gray, she didn't either.

617
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,705
Guess this must be yours, then.

618
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,544
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

619
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,610
Any drugs she gave up
when she married you?

620
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,124
How are you feeling, sir?

621
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,892
Mr. Arrington?

622
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,602
Mr. Arrington?

623
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,299
What's going on?

624
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,533
His heart's not pumping
enough blood to his brain.

625
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,978
We're gonna have to give it
some help. Get the balloon ready.

626
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,149
Do you use this drawer?

627
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,748
No, that's for her vitamins.

628
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,291
And sleeping pills.

629
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,223
She never took sleeping pills.

630
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,588
Okay.

631
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,389
You on a diet?

632
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,461
No.

633
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,368
I guess you never really
know someone, do you?

634
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,240
Quite the insight.

635
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,077
She lied to you
about her hair color

636
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,312
and didn't want you to
know she thought she was fat.

637
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,651
Unless you never lied to
her about anything that huge,

638
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,521
I think you can
probably let those slide.

639
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,685
Diet pills could
have messed her up.

640
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,197
Raised the liver enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

641
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,732
Not the fever.

642
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,697
Maybe something
else set off the fever.

643
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:37,827
Like what?

644
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,633
Before I show you these, they
were in a locked drawer in her desk.

645
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,084
The vice principal said that
Laura must have confiscated them.

646
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:44,185
They've had some problems...

647
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,974
Neither interesting nor helpful.

648
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,111
This, at least, is interesting.

649
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,942
No, it's not.

650
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,920
Sex with teenagers isn't
interesting? Where did you grow up?

651
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,321
It isn't helpful. Teenage
boys aren't toxins.

652
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,292
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

653
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,286
Then we have nothing to go on.

654
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,958
I said it's not a cyst. I
didn't say it was nothing.

655
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,262
What if it's a scar?

656
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,064
FitzHugh-Curtis syndrome?

657
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,233
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

658
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,102
You got anything better?

659
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,075
Test her. And start
her on ceftriaxone.

660
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,118
What are you testing for now?

661
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,819
Just some more infections.

662
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:53,272
She's positive for gonorrhea.

663
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,915
I think that's the first time those
words have been uttered in joy.

664
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,007
The meds are started.

665
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,630
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

666
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,247
I'll go tell the families.

667
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,654
He's in a coma.

668
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,090
Start him on dobutamine.

669
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,387
Already did.

670
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,828
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain, too.

671
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:17,030
House, she's still got a significant
amount of gonorrhea in her system.

672
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,936
Hopefully tomorrow
it'll be in his system.

673
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,369
I need two O.R.'s and
the transplant team.

674
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,443
Get ready.

675
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,882
What is it? Excuse me.

676
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,814
Insert IV.

677
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
Sides up.

678
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,253
What's going on? Is he
getting a heart? Yeah.

679
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,126
Come on, come on.

680
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:56,070
I assume this means you found
out what was wrong with Laura.

681
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,809
She had amebiasis.

682
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,578
We just found a different
way to get rid of it.

683
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,387
Thank you.

684
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,151
That was kind of you.

685
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,561
I didn't want him
going postal on us.

686
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:24,001
As soon as his wife's heart's in our
hands you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

687
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,534
He's got to be tested.

688
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,438
Preferably before he
gets any sympathy sex.

689
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,136
Paddles.

690
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,005
Fifty joules.

691
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,318
Charging.

692
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,958
Charging.

693
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,161
Let's take him off bypass.

694
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,501
Okay.

695
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,602
Switch...

696
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,591
Mr. Neuberger, there's
something I need to tell you.

697
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,262
For the last year

698
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,298
or so,

699
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,000
Laura was kind
of distant with me.

700
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,699
I don't know why.

701
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,310
I thought maybe she
was having an affair.

702
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,472
But, not Laura.

703
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,150
And I'm not excusing myself, but
when I was traveling during Christmas

704
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,549
I had a...

705
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,411
I had a one-night stand.

706
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,182
I got gonorrhea.

707
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,359
Are you sure... Yeah.

708
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,265
I should've said
something to you.

709
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,067
But I didn't wanna
believe that I gave it to her.

710
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:41,698
That's what made her sick and that
was why she got into the accident.

711
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,620
Cecile?

712
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:08,756
Am I dead?

713
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,563
Hopefully not for a long time.

714
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,866
Why are you here?

715
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,463
Amy called me.

716
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,068
If you do Mom again,
you gotta wear a condom.

717
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,603
You're gonna have gonorrhea
in your system for a while.

718
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,917
Could I stay with
you for a few days?

719
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,622
You idiot. You told her.

720
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,254
She told me.

721
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,464
Things have been
crappy at home lately.

722
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,299
I figured I wasn't spending
enough time with her.

723
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,804
I figured...

724
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,476
Turns out you're right.

725
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,610
It's always about sex.

726
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,376
She's been having an affair.

727
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,692
Want a beer?
