1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,712
Hannah, you okay?

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,214
Still can't sleep? I'm fine.

3
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,116
Can I do anything to help you?

4
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,592
Just go back to sleep. I'm
going to go get a glass of wine.

5
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,739
I can keep you company.
You have work in the morning.

6
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,561
Are you sure you
don't want me to?

7
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,930
I'll be right back. Just sleep.

8
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,340
Hannah?

9
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,842
Hannah?

10
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,562
What did you do?

11
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,533
I just wanted to sleep.

12
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,226
I'm calling an ambulance.

13
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:38,048
You've seen one patient
in the last two hours.

14
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,920
Complicated case.

15
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,986
I'm a night owl.

16
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,930
Wilson's an early bird.
We're different species.

17
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,557
Move him into his own cage.

18
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,228
Who'll clean the
droppings from mine?

19
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,397
Twenty-five-year-old
female with sleep issues.

20
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,505
I'm guessing she's...

21
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,012
What's the medical term?

22
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,239
Upset!

23
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,339
These 25-year-old females,
they're usually completely rational.

24
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,317
They're rocks, really.

25
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,666
My theory seems to
be supported by the fact

26
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,656
that she swallowed a
bottle of sleeping pills.

27
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,352
Get her a shrink. I
need some shut-eye.

28
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:17,391
She's a little bit more than
upset. She hasn't slept in 10 days.

29
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,864
She's lying.

30
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,561
Without REM sleep, your
neurons start regenerating.

31
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:25,037
Your brain shuts
down lobe by lobe.

32
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,234
She'd be insane after
five days, dead by 10.

33
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,506
Give me a little credit. I
know what gets you off.

34
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,838
She took the pills to
sleep, not to kill herself.

35
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,111
Clever alibi. They didn't work.

36
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,848
She stayed awake, even though
she downed the whole bottle.

37
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,788
And the longest anyone's ever
survived without sleep is 11 days.

38
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,496
Which gives you about 22 hours.

39
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,700
You stole my article.
I wouldn't do that.

40
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,297
I wrote up the case where we
induced hypothermic cardiac arrest

41
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,568
in the terminal cancer girl.

42
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,371
I wrote my own. I
didn't steal yours.

43
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,436
You knew I was writing
one. You gave me notes!

44
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,547
Got a case.

45
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,777
It can wait. You two finish.

46
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,947
Five bucks says
someone loses an eye.

47
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,957
Fine, you're only
putting off the inevitable.

48
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,189
Twenty-five-year-old female
hasn't slept for 10 days.

49
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,163
I assume the ER tried
giving her some sedatives.

50
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,290
We should up the dosage.

51
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,130
Sedation isn't the same as
sleep. Thanks for your insight.

52
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,841
For someone who hasn't slept in
10 days, sedation is a great start.

53
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,965
Sleep is an active process. Reboots
the system, restores the brain.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,752
Sedatives don't... The
brain is being stressed.

55
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,800
We need to relieve that.

56
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,369
You've had my article on your
desk for the last four months.

57
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,971
I'm a very slow reader.

58
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,074
No fever, no white
count, means no infection.

59
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,449
Schizophrenia?

60
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,681
No delusions. You read his.

61
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,423
Signed it. Didn't read it.

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,824
Aside from the sleeping
pills, tox screen was clean.

63
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,625
No cocaine,
methamphetamines or diet pills.

64
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,631
The only medication
she's had recently

65
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,032
are steroids for poison ivy and
ibuprofen for a knee she hurt skiing.

66
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,037
Nothing that would
cause sleep disturbances.

67
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,336
When did you get his
article? About three weeks ago.

68
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,811
Let's go back to the
beginning. How far back?

69
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,141
Genesis.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,014
God said, "Let there be light."

71
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,109
Sleep is initially controlled
by external light cues.

72
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,656
And if her brain can't
interpret those cues...

73
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,486
Optic nerve disease.

74
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,721
I'm sensing another article.

75
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,862
I'll go run the tests.

76
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,666
I'm injecting a dye which will
allow us to take a look at your retina

77
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,533
and your optic nerve.

78
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,331
Everything's kind of blurry.
Normal, because of the dye.

79
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,605
It's going to be that
way the next few hours.

80
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,275
Need a hand? No.

81
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,444
Are we never going
to work together again?

82
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,014
I just don't see the need to make
you feel better by forgiving you.

83
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,788
I wasn't asking for forgiveness.
I was asking if you needed help.

84
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,573
It's unprofessional to be talking
about this in front of the patient.

85
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,066
Maybe that doesn't
matter to you, but...

86
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,829
It doesn't matter.
She's not listening.

87
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,561
She's asleep.

88
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,834
Normal stage-one brain waves.

89
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,172
Maybe she's better?

90
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,604
Still blurry.

91
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,674
You fell asleep. No, I didn't.

92
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,457
Negative for optic nerve
disease. But she sleeps.

93
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,322
For, like, 10 seconds,
maximum one minute.

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,992
We also checked the
ocular pressure. It's normal.

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,055
And she doesn't know she sleeps.

96
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,499
The brain is often
unaware of stage one sleep.

97
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,198
The CT showed no tumors,
no clots, no seizure disorder.

98
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:49,300
So she sleeps. She
just can't stay asleep.

99
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,040
You going somewhere with this?

100
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,343
You know what keeps
me awake at night?

101
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,280
Monsters in the closet.

102
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,511
There's no monster in
the closet. We looked.

103
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,714
Well, it's certainly not
showing up on the scans.

104
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,416
Where's Cameron?

105
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,327
She felt I could deliver
the news on my own.

106
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,022
Oh, this is going
to work out great.

107
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,297
Come on.

108
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,805
If you two guys can't play nice
together, I'm taking away your toys.

109
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,707
I don't care
whose fault this is.

110
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,941
If you hadn't... I especially
don't care if it was my fault.

111
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,506
Whatever this woman has,
it's not showing up on our tests.

112
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,452
Which means she's sick, just
not sick enough for us to see it.

113
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,116
You want us to make her sicker?
- Yes.

114
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,021
I want to stress her body.
Specifically her brain.

115
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,528
Keep her awake.

116
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,054
Depriving her of even the few minutes
of sleep she does have, it's torture.

117
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,896
So is cutting
people with knives,

118
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,579
but you can totally get away with
that if you have a doctor coat on.

119
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,630
Those few seconds of sleep are
maybe the only reason she's still alive.

120
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,285
The more symptoms we can force
out of her, the more tests we can do.

121
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,920
The more tests we do the
more information we get,

122
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,504
the quicker we make a diagnosis.

123
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,311
See how much more fun it
is when you guys get along?

124
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,818
You two take the
first four hours.

125
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,420
Hannah?

126
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,258
Hannah!

127
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,692
You fell asleep.

128
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,702
No, I didn't.

129
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,302
Your brain doesn't remember.
It was just a few seconds.

130
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,670
Is this really necessary?

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,871
The sooner we find out what's wrong,
the sooner she can get a real night's rest.

132
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,139
Hannah?

133
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,344
Hannah? Hannah.

134
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,678
Ow.

135
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,216
- What did you do that for?
- You fell asleep again.

136
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,019
- No, I didn't.
- We're sorry.

137
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,821
We have to do this.

138
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,321
We don't have to be cruel.

139
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,127
You know what happens
when you're nice? Nothing.

140
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,929
That's how you define
nice? Not stealing?

141
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,230
Doctors!

142
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,031
Did she fall asleep again?

143
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,182
We've got rectal
bleeding. What, all of you?

144
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,123
So the monster is peeking
out from under the bed.

145
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,591
Which either means
she has a clotting disorder

146
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,361
or she has a tumor in her colon.

147
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,335
I'll do a colonoscopy.

148
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,337
Who's keeping her awake now?

149
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,949
I figured once we found another
symptom, it really didn't matter.

150
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,532
Yeah, he's got all the ideas.

151
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,042
Who is with her?

152
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,909
Her partner's donating
blood, so she's with a nurse.

153
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,040
Probably singing her
lullabies. I want her awake.

154
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,278
You have to sedate a
patient to do a colonoscopy.

155
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,616
Why? Just because of the pain?

156
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,156
If you find a tumor in her
colon, you can knock her out.

157
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,489
If you don't, she stays awake.

158
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,395
Oh! God, it hurts.

159
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,028
Can't you hurry? Trust me,
you don't want me to hurry.

160
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,004
God, you're killing me!

161
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,040
Hold my hand.

162
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,908
Keep breathing, nice and steady.

163
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,071
How am I supposed
to work with him?

164
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,284
Maybe we shouldn't be
talking about this right now?

165
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,253
Think I'm overreacting?

166
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,087
I need you to relax your anus.

167
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,394
We're not here. We're skiing.

168
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,390
It's Thanksgiving at Vail.

169
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,435
You want me to think about nearly
killing myself on a snowboard?

170
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,733
Come on, you never fell.

171
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,967
You were awesome.

172
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,210
Is that what you told him? I'm
hysterical and I need to relax my anus?

173
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,512
I told him... How many
cases do we work up in a year?

174
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,021
They're all weird. He could
have written up any one of them.

175
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,647
She's bleeding.

176
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,518
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

177
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:00,821
Hold on.

178
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,599
We packed her nose
to control the bleed

179
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,764
and started transfusing
two units of whole blood.

180
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,435
The pathology from the rectal bleed
showed traces of nasal epithelium.

181
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,501
So the butt bleed's
just a nose bleed.

182
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,138
That much blood is
not a "just a" anything.

183
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,981
When two people fight this
much, you know what it means.

184
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,747
It's gotta be a massive
sinus hemorrhage

185
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,819
that was draining down
her throat and out the back.

186
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,584
The question
isn't what, it's why.

187
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,955
Oh, get a room.

188
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,551
Rat poison mixed with
some sort of neurogenic toxin

189
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,071
could cause bleeding
and sleep disturbances.

190
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,073
Do you have a specific type
of neurogenic toxin in mind,

191
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,509
or should we just start running
a thousand different tox screens?

192
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,764
Just pretend I'm not
here, I'll be reading.

193
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,565
It could also be some
type of coagulopathy.

194
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,918
Or it could be us. Do you
have any idea what it feels like

195
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,772
to have a six-foot-long hose
shoved into your large intestine?

196
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,370
No, but I now have a much greater
respect for whichever basketball player

197
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,244
you dated in college.

198
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,879
We've basically been torturing
this girl for the last eight hours.

199
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,080
We've been poking her
foot, not punching her face.

200
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,914
Extreme stress can
cause high blood pressure,

201
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,551
which can cause bleeding.
Wouldn't keep her awake for 10 days.

202
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,494
What if the poison
ivy wasn't poison ivy?

203
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,229
She got the rash

204
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,823
that was diagnosed as poison ivy

205
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,131
around the same time
the insomnia started.

206
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,001
Rash plus nose bleed
plus sleep disturbance

207
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,405
equals Wegener's granulomatosis.

208
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,238
Start corticosteroid treatment.

209
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,404
The poison ivy treatment was
steroids. Much lower dosage.

210
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,778
Get her back on the
juice and triple the dose.

211
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,842
Get a cANCA and an upper airway
biopsy to confirm the Wegener's.

212
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,793
She has menstrual problems.

213
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,769
They're really bad. The
pain keeps her in bed all day,

214
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,965
plus she's super depressed.

215
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,837
She said, "Super depressed"?

216
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,643
She heard that birth control
pills can make her feel better.

217
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,883
She wants birth control
pills for her PMS. I guess.

218
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,751
Judging by the redness
around your mom's nostrils

219
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,490
and the tissue she's got
conveniently stashed in her wristband,

220
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,557
I'd say her problem is more
likely a URI than a PMS.

221
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,571
A URI? Upper respiratory
infection. A cold.

222
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,763
I don't think so.

223
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,036
I also think she's got
a problem with a SAC.

224
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,236
SAC?

225
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,406
Thanks for playing.
Stupid American Child.

226
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,473
If you want the pill,
all you have to do

227
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,419
is to walk into any health clinic
in Jersey, alone, and ask for it.

228
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,288
What exactly was your plan?

229
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,383
You're going to exchange
the birth control pills

230
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,360
for some over-the-counter
decongestants

231
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,829
and hope that your mom's
cold lasts another six years?

232
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:51,921
No.

233
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,663
Is that for a cold? No,
that's for your ovaries.

234
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,870
I assume you
haven't had a stroke.

235
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,636
Have you ever had
a blood clot? No.

236
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,136
Super.

237
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,710
In three months when you need
a refill, take a bus to a free clinic.

238
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,308
Don't wait around hoping
for Mom to get another sniffle.

239
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,015
Not the sharpest chopstick
in the drawer, is she?

240
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,001
Was this just one
of your experiments?

241
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,928
You just wanted to see how I'd react
to being screwed over by Foreman?

242
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,296
Nice idea, but no. This was
just good old-fashioned laziness.

243
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,364
I gotta hand it to
Foreman, though.

244
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,201
He knew that you're a
suck-up and I don't give a crap.

245
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,264
He successfully
exploited us both.

246
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:39,369
Right, we're both victims. A
simple heads up. That's all I needed.

247
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,123
Maybe between your
incredibly witty remarks

248
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,174
about anal sex and Cuddy's
breasts, you could have tipped me off.

249
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,481
Yeah, but then I'd have
Foreman pissed at me.

250
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,316
And as annoying as you could be,

251
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,552
at least I know you're not
gonna pop a cap in my ass.

252
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,990
Witty, huh?

253
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,493
You, on the other hand,

254
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,192
continue to be flabbergasted

255
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,600
every time someone actually
acts like a human being.

256
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,131
Foreman did what he did because
it worked out best that way for him.

257
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,765
That's what everyone does.

258
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,276
That is not the
definition of being human.

259
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,870
It's the definition
of being an ass.

260
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,717
This will numb you up.

261
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,382
And this will keep your
tongue out of the way.

262
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,688
Don't worry. You shouldn't feel
anything except for a slight pulling.

263
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,595
So do you think
I was out of line?

264
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,261
That article would have sat on
House's desk for the next six years.

265
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,133
I could've told her.

266
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,507
You could have
written it for her, too.

267
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,371
She knows House
as well as any of us.

268
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,986
She should've known
she was waiting for him

269
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,639
to do something he
was never gonna do.

270
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,344
Chase?

271
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,412
Hannah? You still with us?

272
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,287
What's wrong with her
eyes? It looks like REM.

273
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,053
What's that? Rapid
Eye Movements.

274
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,670
It's what your eyes do
when you're sleeping.

275
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,686
But she's awake. Hannah!

276
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,466
Hannah, can you hear me?

277
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,026
Yeah, of course.

278
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,103
Was she sitting up or
lying down? Sitting up.

279
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,265
Then it wasn't REM.

280
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,434
Chase says her eyes
were moving the exact way...

281
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,709
You start her on the steroids?

282
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,017
Not yet. We were still doing...
Then she wasn't sleeping.

283
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,845
How do you know? Because
we haven't done anything yet.

284
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,795
She may be able to sleep with her
eyes open, but unless you also discover

285
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,253
she's got two extra
teats and hooves for feet,

286
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,699
there's no way she'd be able to
maintain enough muscle tensity

287
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,589
during REM sleep to sit upright.

288
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,958
It's a movement disorder,
which rules out Wegener's.

289
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,130
Where's Foreman?

290
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,063
Keeping her awake. Good.

291
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,625
Rabies could cause muscle spasms,
malaise, anxiety and wakefulness.

292
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,138
Pretty unlikely she'd forget
being bitten by a crazed animal.

293
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,850
She could've been exposed
through an open wound.

294
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,672
Does she have a dog?
For less than a week.

295
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,854
She had an allergic reaction,
so they had to give it away.

296
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:52,902
Allergies.

297
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,346
Animal allergies seems
unlikely, but it's possible that...

298
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,212
When? When what?

299
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,215
When did she get rid of
the dog? About a month ago.

300
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,154
Her girlfriend gave it
to her for her birthday.

301
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,555
Well, then, it's not allergies.

302
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,094
She's just leaving
her girlfriend.

303
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,424
You spoke to the dog?

304
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,364
If her birthday was a month ago,

305
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,766
she would have still been
on steroids for the poison ivy.

306
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,547
Those meds would have
suppressed any reaction

307
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,771
she might have had to the dog,

308
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,003
which means she lied about being
allergic. A dog's a commitment.

309
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,338
You pretend to be allergic

310
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,988
because you don't
want to tell your girlfriend

311
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,012
that you're not planning
on being around that long.

312
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,539
So, I think we can move on
to options other than allergies.

313
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,380
We should still
do a scratch test.

314
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,942
If she's allergic
to one thing...

315
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,886
She is not allergic.

316
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:39,050
Okay. Well, we could
either base our diagnosis

317
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,605
on your admittedly keen
understanding of lesbian relationships,

318
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,926
or we could do a scratch test.

319
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,962
Do a scratch test.

320
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,480
Are you still feeling a
lot of blood in your throat?

321
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,410
No, it's actually
getting a little better.

322
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,470
Good, maybe things are just
starting to improve on their own.

323
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,140
Just a few more.

324
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,446
Want some water to wash
out your mouth? No, I'm okay.

325
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,182
Come on, that can't taste
good. I'm gonna get you a soda.

326
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,019
It's okay, isn't it?

327
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,990
You and Max seem to have
a really nice relationship.

328
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,261
Yeah. She's very supportive.

329
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,103
When Max got you the dog,

330
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,200
did you lie about having
an allergic reaction?

331
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,670
No.

332
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,876
Why? If you have
preexisting conditions,

333
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,977
it's important we know, but if
you don't, it's just as important.

334
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,488
If I'm wasting my
time doing this...

335
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,185
You're not going
to tell her, are you?

336
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,061
It's none of my business.

337
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,122
She's a good person, and we've
just been together so long, I...

338
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,530
I'm tired of her.

339
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,103
It sounds terrible, doesn't it?

340
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,209
I guess it happens sometimes.

341
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,045
My back hurts.

342
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,849
Hannah, can you turn over?

343
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,793
What's wrong? I'm not sure.

344
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,633
Oh, my God.

345
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,504
She has massive
internal bleeding.

346
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,938
Did she have access to aspirin?

347
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,318
She'd have to
take a hell of a lot.

348
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,369
Why not? Considering
her current mental state.

349
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,807
What about her mental state?

350
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,843
You were right about
her wanting to break up.

351
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,182
That just means I was right.
Doesn't mean she's suicidal.

352
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,598
A bottle of pills is what landed
her here in the first place.

353
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,024
Sleeping pills. God knows
why she'd want them.

354
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,354
What else could cause sleep
disorder and internal bleeding?

355
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,141
Drugs or alcohol could
mess with the sleeping

356
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,157
and compromise the liver.

357
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,498
What are you doing here?
Who's keeping her awake?

358
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,131
Doesn't matter. Liver function
tests are through the sky.

359
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,698
Liver's not
compromised. It's dead.

360
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,476
She doesn't need a diagnosis.
She needs a new liver.

361
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,457
Well, she's not
getting a new liver

362
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,259
unless we can figure
out what's wrong with her.

363
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,582
Test for cirrhosis, 12 hours.
Test for hepatitis, eight.

364
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,172
Her liver's not gonna
last another six.

365
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,712
So your advice
is we just give up?

366
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,850
My advice is that we narrow our
focus to conditions that we can diagnose,

367
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,555
treat and cure in
less than six hours.

368
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,931
And there's
nothing on that list.

369
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,360
The girlfriend
donated blood, right?

370
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,699
Yeah, so?

371
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,537
It means they're the same type.

372
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:46,204
You can't ask the person she's
about to dump to donate half her liver.

373
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,406
It does seem tacky, doesn't it?

374
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,748
I'm Dr. House.

375
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,553
I'm in charge of your case.

376
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,622
What's going on?

377
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,689
How come no one is
keeping her awake anymore?

378
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,997
You're in acute liver failure.

379
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,395
We can continue the
transfusions and the lactulose,

380
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,498
but it's only a stopgap.

381
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,368
There's really nothing we
can do to stop the toxins

382
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,073
from building up in
your bloodstream,

383
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,680
which means
that, in a few hours,

384
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,609
you will lapse into a coma

385
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,286
and you won't wake up.

386
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,361
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,297
That's it? You're giving up?

388
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:45,031
You're not going to try to figure
out what's doing this to her?

389
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,732
Well, even with
the right diagnosis,

390
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,184
any treatment's gonna take
longer than the time she has left.

391
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,269
If it's her liver, can't
she get a transplant?

392
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,113
Wouldn't work
without a diagnosis.

393
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,413
Whatever killed the first liver
would do the same to the second.

394
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,749
But it would give you more time

395
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,585
to make the diagnosis
to get her better.

396
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,856
Well, it might give
us an extra day or two,

397
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,497
but no procurement agency is
gonna let a liver go to a patient

398
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,431
with an undiagnosed,
preexisting...

399
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,731
Hannah and I have
the same blood type.

400
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,071
Couldn't I be the donor?

401
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,073
Well, it is medically possible
for us to take a part of your...

402
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,744
Please, I don't
care about the risks.

403
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,193
You're very lucky to have
such a devoted partner.

404
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,206
I just bought us 36 hours.

405
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,246
Differential diagnosis.
Which monster eats your liver,

406
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,185
screws up your sleep
and causes bleeding?

407
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,799
Does Max know Hannah
plans to leave her?

408
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,655
Didn't come up, so I guess no.

409
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,990
If she knew, there's no way
she'd go through with this.

410
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,824
And if you didn't have
a pathological need

411
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,094
to create a close, personal relationship
with every dying person you meet,

412
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,244
we would be blissfully
ignorant of any ethical dilemmas

413
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,737
and might actually be able to
concentrate on the differential.

414
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,066
The scratch test was negative.

415
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,267
It's rare, but any of the hepatitis
viruses could cause sleep disturbances

416
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,333
and liver failure. No,
PCRs were normal.

417
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,244
We have an ethical
dilemma. No, we don't.

418
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,704
Continue.

419
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,149
What about splenic cancer
or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?

420
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,379
She's the right age.

421
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,921
It could explain the bleeding,
maybe the liver failure.

422
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,686
We're withholding information
relevant to her decision to risk her life.

423
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,093
How is that not an ethical
dilemma? It's not medical information.

424
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,097
Who cares? The AMA.

425
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,396
Wilson's disease could explain
the liver and neurological symptoms.

426
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,026
It also causes
bleeding disorders.

427
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,798
No Kayser-Fleischer
rings in her eyes.

428
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,363
Rings don't have to be there if
there's neurological symptoms.

429
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,035
This is immoral. Look,
let's say you're right!

430
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,240
We tell, she changes her mind,
our patient dies. How is that moral?

431
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:09,973
What else?

432
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,211
Poisoned mushrooms
can cause liver failure,

433
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,082
sleep disturbances
and internal bleeding.

434
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,486
She's not shrooming.
She's a sports nut.

435
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,581
Right, skiers never party.

436
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,126
She's doing this out of
love, and Max doesn't know...

437
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,391
It's only moral to save a
person if they love you?

438
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,193
That's kind of a selfish
way of looking at life.

439
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,134
I like Wilson's disease,
like cancer, love mushrooms.

440
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,398
Yeah, but we don't have
the time to test for any of it.

441
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,908
Before she can get the transplant,
we need to do about 80 procedures.

442
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,444
So, do those tests and
my tests at the same time.

443
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,604
Use the PET to look
for cancer and Wilson's.

444
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,272
While you endoscope
her bile ducts,

445
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,868
scrape her stomach
for mushroom spores.

446
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,544
One of you CT her liver,

447
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:49,713
while the other two check
protein CA 125 d CA 19.5.

448
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,758
Oh, yeah, anyone says
anything to Max, they're fired.

449
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,253
We have to.

450
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,730
We have to not, because
she's not our patient.

451
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,859
She's getting surgery.
She's someone's patient.

452
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,298
I think that's it.
Great, thank you.

453
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,933
I need a little help.

454
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,377
Inexplicable rash on a patient's
scrotum you need me to look at?

455
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,611
Twenty-seven-year-old
female wants to donate

456
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,576
half her liver to
her dying girlfriend.

457
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,208
That's very generous.

458
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,982
This the sleepless girl?
What's she got? Liver failure.

459
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:27,124
Sort of figured that out when
you said she needed a new liver.

460
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:32,721
You don't have a diagnosis?
The transplant buys me time.

461
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,398
Let's just skip the part
where I say this is insane.

462
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,834
It was her idea. If she wants
to be an idiot, it's her call.

463
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,269
You don't need me.

464
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,534
Have one of your team
walk her through the process.

465
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,941
The donor and the donee sort
of have opposing interests, right?

466
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,945
We can't really
advise them both.

467
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,846
You're concerned
about the ethics of this?

468
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,347
What's going on?

469
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,148
What do you know?
Nothing medically relevant.

470
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,189
But you know something,
and it is relevant.

471
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,148
If I can't tell her, I can't
really tell you, can I?

472
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,524
I mean, if you're advising her.

473
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,420
I assume this information
is in the medical file.

474
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,127
In my patient's confidential
file. This hospital's file.

475
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,471
You can either satisfy your
curiosity, or you can remain ignorant,

476
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,808
do nothing ethically wrong, and
my patient doesn't die in three hours.

477
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,981
These tests and the counseling

478
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:34,123
normally happen over
weeks, sometimes months.

479
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,259
It's okay.

480
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,126
Well, the most important
part we're skipping is time.

481
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,691
Time for you to
change your mind.

482
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,101
I don't wanna change my mind.

483
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,661
Not now, but,

484
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,505
with time and perspective,
maybe we learn things...

485
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,738
If we had the time, we'd
take the time, but we don't.

486
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,042
So can you get this over with?

487
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,986
Either I sign off on this,
or it doesn't happen.

488
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,320
So I need you to listen to me,

489
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,252
because there's a chance
that you will die on that table.

490
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,799
I just want me and Hannah
to be able to lie in bed together

491
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,331
as old ladies,

492
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,167
compare scars.

493
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,852
I need you to lie on your
side and hold your knees.

494
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,553
I'm going to check for
vascular abnormalities

495
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,155
that might prevent us
from doing the transplant.

496
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,530
At the same time, I'm also
checking for mushroom spores

497
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,069
to see if that's the underlying...
I don't do mushrooms.

498
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,130
If you lie about your love life,
maybe you lie about drugs. Open.

499
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,841
Aren't you at all concerned about
what Max is going through right now?

500
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,745
They're shoving a
tube up her rectum,

501
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,215
then they're going to swab
her stomach just like I'm doing.

502
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,583
It's going to hurt
just like this hurts.

503
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:11,818
Which is nothing at all like the
risk she's taking on the table.

504
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,420
And you don't love her, do you?

505
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,226
I'm not leaving her
because I don't...

506
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,632
I'm not talking about the
leaving. I'm talking about this.

507
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,433
If you care for her at all,
you won't let her do this blind.

508
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,268
You'd really tell? Yeah.

509
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,978
You'd die?

510
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,351
I take it you've seen that.

511
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:54,395
Seen it, digested it, watched it
blow up my entire department.

512
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,395
Did you read Cameron's
version? I didn't read either.

513
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,960
It was good.

514
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,734
Better than Foreman's? Maybe.

515
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,433
He was more analytical about
the diagnostic procedures.

516
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,842
She concentrated more on the
ethical dilemmas of informed consent.

517
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,543
How any patient can really be
informed without a medical degree.

518
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,483
Same old party lines.

519
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,878
Foreman should have told her.

520
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,219
Oh, shoulda, woulda, coulda.

521
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,290
If you allow this sort of
thing in your department,

522
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,021
you're basically
saying it's okay.

523
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,393
No, I'm saying that I
don't care what they do

524
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:28,332
as long as my life isn't interrupted by
pointless conversations like this one.

525
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,801
They won't trust each other,
and they won't trust you.

526
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,394
They shouldn't.

527
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,199
Deception like this is
just one step removed

528
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,039
from actively
sabotaging one another.

529
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,911
Then what would you do?

530
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,312
I could be the kindest,
gentlest boss in the world,

531
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,443
and Foreman would still have done
what he did, because that's who he is.

532
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,818
We can only hope that
Cameron has learned something.

533
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,225
Right, because you're
all about the teaching.

534
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,587
Our children are the future.

535
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,727
Hey.

536
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,535
Cuddy cleared Max for
surgery. She's okay to go.

537
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,938
How's our patient?
She's also cleared.

538
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,909
I don't care about the prep. I
care about the diagnostic tests.

539
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,622
Looks negative for Wilson's
disease. We'll know for sure in an hour.

540
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,024
Blood proteins are
normal. It's not...

541
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,348
Where's Cameron? Taking
a sample of the bile duct.

542
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,220
Surgeries are supposed
to start in about 15 minutes.

543
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,647
She had a chance
to get one last...

544
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,249
Hannah and Max will
be in the same room.

545
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,068
You wanted us to do as
much as we can before...

546
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,687
They're both awake with Cameron.

547
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,229
Maybe we should give these two a
minute together before the surgery.

548
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,932
You ready, honey?

549
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,243
Max. It's okay, I'm right here.

550
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,142
I need you to know
something. I know.

551
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,642
I love you, too.

552
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,146
I don't know how to say this.

553
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,451
Good Lord!

554
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,854
You can tell me anything.

555
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,120
She hasn't slept in 11 days!

556
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,862
You people trying
to torture her?

557
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,098
Ding, ding, let's go.

558
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,309
I told you... I didn't
say a word to Max.

559
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,971
This is exactly why you
got screwed with Foreman.

560
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,173
You're looking for people
to do the right thing.

561
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,011
She hasn't slept. Her
judgment is compromised

562
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,880
due to inactivity in
her prefrontal cortex.

563
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:29,820
Oh, she could have the best prefrontal
cortex in the history of mankind,

564
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,584
but given the choice
of life versus death,

565
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,751
those bad, bad people
are going to choose life.

566
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,790
Then why'd you sedate her?

567
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:37,989
If she wasn't going to tell,

568
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:42,524
if she was never going to do the right
thing, why bother knocking her out?

569
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,899
This isn't about them.

570
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,870
If she talks, if she
does the decent thing,

571
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,339
then you don't get to solve your
puzzle, your game's over, you lose.

572
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,344
Yeah, I wanna save
her. I'm morally bankrupt.

573
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,603
How's it going? They're
about to remove Hannah's liver.

574
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,843
All right, I'm good to go.

575
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,836
You can start
removing Max's liver.

576
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,447
You wanna let me in on what the
big secret is between these two?

577
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,611
You read Foreman's article?

578
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,722
It was good.

579
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,588
He basically stole it from me.

580
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,085
So?

581
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,226
You're on his side?

582
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,699
Sides? No, this
isn't dodge ball.

583
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,595
What am I supposed to
do, just sit back and take it?

584
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,469
No, write another article.

585
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,304
Kick ass until you're sitting
behind some big, expensive desk,

586
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,106
and someone from Johns
Hopkins calls and says,

587
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,047
"We're thinking about hiring Eric
Foreman as our head of Neurology."

588
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,550
And you can say
whatever you want.

589
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,520
Lovely. Revenge as
motive for success.

590
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,821
Well, it doesn't have to be the
motive, but it sure tastes good.

591
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:19,126
She's in VF. I've got no
pulse. She's arresting.

592
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,769
I am so relieved
you two are here.

593
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,548
'Cause without you looking out,
they'd be playing foosball down there.

594
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,870
Max's heart stopped.

595
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,932
Your patient is
on the other side.

596
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,410
Now get yourself upstairs
and figure out what Hannah has,

597
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,175
or Max has risked
her life for nothing.

598
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,780
Charging.

599
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,915
Clear.

600
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,393
We're okay.

601
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,097
Max's cardiac arrest was caused
by hypoxia from hypoventilation.

602
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,734
They restarted her heart,

603
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,572
and the right lobe of her liver was
successfully transplanted into Hannah.

604
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,544
Now, where were we

605
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,445
before we were so rudely
interrupted by the liver transplant?

606
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,915
Dopa decarboxylase
was processed normally,

607
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,023
and the ceruloplasmin and
copper levels were normal.

608
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,178
So, no Wilson's disease.

609
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,314
Gastric content was negative for
spores, so no mushroom toxicity.

610
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,723
And initial tests were
negative for cancer.

611
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,632
Which cancer were you
looking for? Any of them.

612
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,220
We ran blood tests for
ovarian, lung and lymphomas.

613
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,390
Not gonna tell you much.

614
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,899
Her blood was taken after she
was given immunosuppressants.

615
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,799
They fight rejection.

616
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,397
They also mess up our
ability to get any clear readings.

617
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,867
Great battles
kick up a lot of dirt,

618
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,079
obscure the battlefield so
generals can't see what's going on.

619
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,713
So, what are your
orders, General House?

620
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,349
Sound the retreat.

621
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,918
How you feeling?

622
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,654
Is Max okay?

623
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,926
She's still unconscious,
but her vitals look good.

624
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,660
We need to stop all the
immunosuppressant drugs

625
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,295
which are protecting
your new liver.

626
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,532
But if you stop
the drugs, I'll die.

627
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,874
You're dead anyway if we don't
figure out what caused all this.

628
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,740
By removing any
outside influences,

629
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,342
it'll help us see what's really
going on with your body.

630
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,478
So you did all this to
buy me a couple of days,

631
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,887
and now you're taking one back?

632
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,462
Will it hurt?

633
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,263
As your body goes into
acute organ rejection,

634
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,996
your liver will begin to swell,
and that'll put pressure on...

635
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,203
Yeah, it'll hurt.

636
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,604
But we can knock you out.

637
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,875
No, if Max wakes up,
I want to talk to her.

638
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,553
She's been taking the decongestants,
but she's not getting better.

639
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,251
She also says...

640
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,253
What?

641
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,959
Her boobs are bigger.

642
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,340
How could you get them mixed up?

643
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,602
They come in a little wheel.

644
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,610
They don't look anything
like decongestants.

645
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,942
Oh, God. The cashier put
them both in the same bag.

646
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,004
I thought I gave
her the right ones.

647
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,123
No, you gave her
the wrong pills.

648
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,760
You speak Mandarin?

649
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,223
I can count to 10, ask to
go to the bathroom and...

650
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,129
I'm not pregnant. We
haven't even done it yet!

651
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:55,880
Okay, I'm going to leave you two alone
now. I'm sure you got a lot to talk about.

652
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,556
Fever is 106. She's
in full rejection mode.

653
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,524
Is that supposed to surprise me?

654
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,618
Her white count is normal.

655
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,597
Normal is not normal.

656
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:13,962
She's been on steroids.

657
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,558
The transplant team gave her a
cocktail of immunosuppressants.

658
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,569
She hasn't slept in over a week.

659
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,081
Her white count
should be in the tank.

660
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,916
Looks like the problem
is some sort of infection.

661
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,375
Probably caused the
hypotension, shocked the liver.

662
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,638
We should start
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

663
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,180
Yeah, you might want to
add some chicken soup.

664
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,081
It'd be just as useless,
but it's got chicken.

665
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,729
We need to know exactly what
kind of infection we're dealing with.

666
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,019
What infection causes sleep
disturbance, bleeding, a movement disorder,

667
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,581
organ failure and an
abnormally normal white count.

668
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,456
What about tularemia?
Chest was clear.

669
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,207
Tularemia doesn't cause
movement disorders.

670
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,753
It would if she
developed meningitis.

671
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,322
There was no
ulcerations on the skin.

672
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,664
With the bleeding, it looks
more like leptospirosis.

673
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,102
Without conjunctivitis
and elevated creatinine?

674
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,640
What about typhoid or
some kind of relapsing fever?

675
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,335
Makes sense, if we
were in the Sudan.

676
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,120
Are you sure she hasn't
been out of the country?

677
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,114
She hasn't even been out of the
state in at least a year. Neither has Max.

678
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,705
Maybe she lied.

679
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:07,182
You talk to her friends,
neighbors? You don't know?

680
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,996
Come on, if you don't stay
up-to-date on my notes,

681
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,580
where's your next
article gonna come from?

682
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,090
Talked to the dog?

683
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,821
We're not as up on foreign
languages as you are.

684
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,990
Has the dog been traveling?
It came from a breeder.

685
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,624
Where? I don't know.

686
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,000
Place called Blue
Barrel Kennels.

687
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,936
They only had the
thing for, like, two days.

688
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,339
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus.

689
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,306
You see many cacti in Jersey?

690
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,179
Wanna see a magic trick?

691
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,456
Oh, no. Where'd it
go? Where'd it go?

692
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,264
Is it here?

693
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,068
No. What about here?

694
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,672
There it is.

695
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,904
Oh, that doesn't look
anything like a nose.

696
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,278
That wasn't there this morning.

697
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,290
Get that to the lab
and call the CDC.

698
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,727
Tell them what? That we
have a patient with the plague.

699
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:34,034
The black plague?

700
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,266
Looks that way.

701
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,242
Plague's carried by
rodents, not dogs.

702
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,869
Where there's
dogs, there's fleas.

703
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,413
If they hail from the Southwest,

704
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,645
then those fleas can't tell the difference
between prairie dogs and puppy dogs.

705
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,814
A small percentage of plague
cases present with sleep disturbance.

706
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,521
Imagine an idyllic
river of bacteria.

707
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,523
Okay, it's not idyllic for her,
but it serves my purposes.

708
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,088
The steroids and
immunosuppressants

709
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,532
acted like a big honking
dam across the river.

710
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,625
Physics 101.

711
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,695
Put a dam up in front of a
raging river, the river rises.

712
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,537
By stopping the immunosuppressants,
we blew up the dam,

713
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,737
and a 100-foot wall of bacteria
flooded her lymph nodes.

714
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,803
We better find out
where that dog is now.

715
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,111
After you restart the
immunosuppressants,

716
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,775
and fill her up to the eyeballs

717
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,582
with streptomycin sulfate,
gentamicin and tetracycline.

718
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,384
Use a garden hose
if we've got one.

719
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,983
Get yourselves some
prophylactic treatments as well.

720
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,058
I've got the plague?

721
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,158
Don't worry. It's treatable.

722
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,567
Being a bitch, though,

723
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,264
nothing we can do about that.

724
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,570
You weren't in your room.

725
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,548
The surgeon said
I'd heal faster if I walk.

726
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,047
I got this far, needed a rest.

727
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,751
What you did was crazy,
but it was pretty amazing, too.

728
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,314
Yeah. I'm a hero.

729
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,786
She's been planning to leave me.

730
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,095
Really?

731
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,000
She told a friend.
The friend let it slip.

732
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,105
You knew, and you gave
up half your liver anyway?

733
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,882
She can't leave me now.

734
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,785
You really want her to stay out of guilt?
That's not gonna make either of you happy.

735
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,656
You don't know that.

736
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,493
I love her.

737
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,990
I just want her to stay.

738
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,343
I don't own House's cases.

739
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,881
You had just as much
right as I did to write it up.

740
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:09,951
You should have told me, but I
should have handled it better, too.

741
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,724
If we want this not to get
in the way of our friendship,

742
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,397
I think we both have to
apologize and put it behind us.

743
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,471
I like you, really.

744
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,472
We have a good
time working together.

745
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,580
But 10 years from now,

746
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:34,047
we're not gonna be hanging
out and having dinners.

747
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,519
Maybe we'll exchange
Christmas cards, say hi,

748
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,523
give a hug if we're at
the same conference.

749
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,422
We're not friends.

750
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,122
We're colleagues.

751
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,600
And I don't have
anything to apologize for.
