1
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,594
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.

2
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,130
Come on, honey, you're
gonna throw him off.

3
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,530
It's okay, I'm almost done.

4
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,236
A little more
light on your hips.

5
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,328
God.

6
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,931
Why couldn't you have come
up with this before I had two kids?

7
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,944
You look amazing.

8
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:50,682
Okay, I think... Yeah, I'm
done. Want to come take a look?

9
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,619
I can't.

10
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,256
You first.

11
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,660
No, we'll look together.

12
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,629
I don't understand. I thought...

13
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,901
What the hell is that?

14
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,169
Honey, it's okay.

15
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,268
This is not what we
discussed, or what I paid for.

16
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,984
I don't understand. I think this
is one of the best I've ever done.

17
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,071
I want my money back.

18
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,743
I'm sorry, but this is not some
department store photo studio.

19
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,547
And this is not my wife.

20
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,780
Yes, it is.

21
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:31,086
You asked me to paint her exactly
as she looks. That's exactly what I did.

22
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,928
Honey! Stop it!

23
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,895
What's going on? Brandon.

24
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:40,560
That check better be in my
mailbox by Friday, or I'll be back.

25
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,367
Come on.

26
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:44,971
What happened?

27
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,165
I don't know.

28
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,765
They saw the painting,
and they just freaked out.

29
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,078
Brandon, what is this?

30
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,740
What do you mean?
It's her portrait.

31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,880
What's wrong with it?

32
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,661
Why is this in here?

33
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,356
First column, last entry.

34
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,561
Today is going to be a good day.

35
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,530
This him?

36
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,973
No. Yes.

37
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,205
She means, are you
the private investigator

38
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,873
whose bills I've tried to slip
through as medical expenses?

39
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,781
Oh. Hi. I'm Lucas Douglas, PI.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,684
This hospital is not putting a
private investigator on retainer,

41
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,153
nor is it going to pay any more

42
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,190
phony repairs on
vending machines,

43
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,782
cryostats, or elevators.

44
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,521
Information saves lives.
Saving lives saves money.

45
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,063
No, saving lives costs money,

46
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,225
which is why I'm trying to
make sure there's still some left.

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,893
You want your own personal PI,

48
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,563
you're gonna have
to pay for him yourself.

49
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,402
Sorry. No, I understand.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,741
Hey, I like the
shoes, by the way.

51
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,335
Oh.

52
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,445
Thank you.

53
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,913
You don't like her
shoes, you like her legs.

54
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,977
It sounds less creepy
if you say shoes.

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,046
Less creepy, more gay.

56
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,648
That's my firm's motto.

57
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,184
What is a cryostat?

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,721
No idea. Whoever fixed
ours is about to get stiffed.

59
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,375
There's no distorted perspective
in any of his other recent works.

60
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,313
Not much talent either.

61
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,180
It's like the symptom
just came on.

62
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,914
Acute onset visual agnosia
points to a stroke or brain tumor.

63
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,819
MRI revealed no
stroke or brain tumor.

64
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,323
We should do
another with contrast.

65
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,035
If he's like the other
struggling artists I've known,

66
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,083
he's also into drugs.

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,595
We should... What
are you looking at?

68
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,221
Apparently a moron.

69
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,028
One, ER routinely
tests for drugs.

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,112
If it was positive, we
wouldn't be looking at this file.

71
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:33,267
Two, who pays 12%
interest on a car loan?

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,741
How did you... Did you
run a credit check on me?

73
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,437
No, that would be illegal.

74
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,606
Interestingly enough, paying
someone to run it for me, though...

75
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,910
What? It's part of my job.

76
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,511
Your job is to
diagnose patients.

77
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,748
Which I do with a team.

78
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,519
How am I supposed to know
how best to utilize that team

79
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,924
if I don't know
everything about them?

80
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,964
Say that Van Gogh turns
out to have neurosyphilis,

81
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,465
and our last vial of
penicillin is in a storeroom

82
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,935
at the end of a 20-mile hallway
with a two-foot-high ceiling.

83
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,281
You've discovered that one
of us has been hiding the ability

84
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,240
to stretch or shrink themselves?

85
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,800
No, I would never out
someone's superpowers.

86
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,536
This, on the other hand...

87
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,308
You crawled 20 miles?

88
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,717
My name's in the <i>Guinness Book.</i>

89
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,051
I'll bet that really
impresses the babes.

90
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,818
I didn't do it to get the babes.

91
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,416
No, that would cheapen the
purity of your achievement.

92
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,429
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a
patient with a probable brain tumor.

93
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,159
Who needs an MRI with
contrast. We've established that.

94
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,825
What do you got on Taub?

95
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,199
I got nothing on Taub.

96
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,346
Could also be environmental.

97
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,635
We should check his studio
for toxins, mold, fungus...

98
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,983
Taub's wife, on
the other hand...

99
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,066
House.

100
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,871
That's enough.

101
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,272
Dad's right. This is
no time for gossip.

102
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,544
Patient desperately
needs our help.

103
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,177
Check his head and his house.

104
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,154
Can't Lucas... No.

105
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,656
He's very busy.

106
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,670
If there is a tumor,
this test will show us...

107
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,094
Is that stuff dangerous?

108
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,063
This is just the
contrast material.

109
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,825
There is a small risk of
an anaphylactic reaction.

110
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,267
I could stop breathing?

111
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,738
Don't worry. We're prepared
to deal with whatever happens.

112
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,401
You know, I did some drawings
this morning and they seem fine.

113
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,353
So, maybe it was just a
reaction to something I ate.

114
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,222
How many people you
know have reactions like that

115
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,623
to something they
ate for breakfast?

116
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,767
But if I'm getting better...

117
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,015
You'll continue to get better.

118
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,779
If you're not, we
need to know why not,

119
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,047
so we can start
treatment immediately.

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,816
Baby, let them do the test.

121
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,697
Can lead poisoning
cause visual agnosia?

122
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,865
Not without lead showing
up in the blood work.

123
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,638
Nothing in the medicine cabinet
except some harmless toiletries.

124
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,475
No signs of mold or
fungus anywhere, either.

125
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,515
You think House really
got something on your wife?

126
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,915
No, not that I care if he did.

127
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,378
Wait, your wife's doing
the doorman in your bed,

128
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,014
and they're sweating all over
the sheets that you paid for and...

129
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,935
My wife's not doing the
doorman. How do you know?

130
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,394
We don't have a doorman.

131
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,260
And I just do, okay? Drop it.

132
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,665
In college, my friends and I came
up with an Inverse-Square Law.

133
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,033
Sounds like a real fun group.

134
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,471
The girls who you think are the
most inhibited, straight arrows?

135
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,906
They're the ones
you hook up with.

136
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,705
Are you saying my wife's a slut?

137
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm saying if my wife was
a slut, I'd want to know.

138
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,718
His place was clean.

139
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,253
So is his head.

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,552
Even with contrast,
no masses, no lesions.

141
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,593
A neurological symptom with
no apparent neurological cause.

142
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,219
Time course means we
can rule out cancer and MS.

143
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,196
That just leaves
toxins or drugs.

144
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,893
You called Thirteen a moron
for thinking it was drugs.

145
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,163
Yeah, when she said
it, she had other options.

146
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,228
And I really just wanted a segue
into her stupid loan and your...

147
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,103
A cavernous angioma
in the brain could leak.

148
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,472
Once the blood gets reabsorbed,

149
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,986
pressure goes down,
symptom goes away.

150
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,309
He'll never consent to
petrosal vein sampling.

151
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,541
Really?

152
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,914
He was nervous about
an injection of contrast.

153
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,153
Is his girlfriend hot?

154
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,184
I'm not talking fever, here.

155
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,088
I mean, is she all
curvy and perky?

156
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,593
Very. And if he dies, it's
good news for all of us, but...

157
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,529
That explains why
all his paintings suck.

158
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,156
And what's wrong with him.

159
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,723
Where are you going?

160
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,445
To tell him he may have
a massive brain tumor.

161
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,562
He doesn't.

162
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,572
I know. I'm not a
moron. It's drugs.

163
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,773
You seem to have a
massive brain tumor.

164
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,974
Who are you?

165
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,040
He's Dr. House. He's
pleased to meet you.

166
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,018
We've found no trace
on any of your imaging,

167
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,917
so we need to cut
your head open.

168
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,185
It's risky, but it's the
only way to save your life.

169
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,316
No.

170
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,123
Wrong answer.

171
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,233
I'm not allowed to say no?

172
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,490
You're not allowed
to not be terrified.

173
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,476
There's only two good reasons
not to be terrified in a hospital.

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,961
You're delusional, but then you're
not afraid of contrast material either,

175
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,940
or you know you're fine. Since
we haven't told you you're fine,

176
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,875
you obviously have
information that we don't have.

177
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,943
What drugs are you on?

178
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,051
His drug tests were clean.

179
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,604
Drug tests only test for
drugs they've made tests for.

180
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,240
What are you talking about?

181
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,516
Hottie thinks that
he's a great artist,

182
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,453
selling art to the
rich and tasteful.

183
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,049
She's stupid enough to
be fooled by the canvasses,

184
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,594
but bank accounts don't
lie. He needed money.

185
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,706
There are not many jobs you
can do that don't require time,

186
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,959
training and intelligence.

187
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,466
And I know you're not a
news anchor or supermodel

188
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:31,733
because those jobs seldom
cause agnosia. He's a guinea pig.

189
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,240
Companies pay him to
test their untested drugs.

190
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,846
Did Hottie go for
a pee or coffee?

191
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,318
'Cause either way, I don't think we
should waste any time on denials.

192
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,315
The clinical trials were
supposed to be safe.

193
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,191
The drugs are about to
be approved by the FDA.

194
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,923
"Drugs"? How many
trials are you on?

195
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,493
Three.

196
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,228
Admirable. Not many idiots
have that much ambition.

197
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,015
You've been symptom-free
since your admission,

198
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,565
so whatever you took has
probably cleared your system now.

199
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,132
You'll be fine.

200
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,520
Keep him overnight
just to make sure,

201
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,104
and get the names of
all the trials he's been in.

202
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,547
You gonna tell Heather?

203
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,744
Couldn't, even if I
cared enough to want to.

204
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,367
Not bad. You almost
made it the whole day.

205
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,665
What did you find out?

206
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,968
The point is to see
how everyone reacts.

207
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,598
You may go get
the rest of the gang.

208
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,165
Cut the crap, House.

209
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,611
Your wife has a
separate bank account

210
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,876
in her name only.

211
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,113
She's been making weekly cash
deposits for about a year now.

212
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,280
No withdrawals yet.

213
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,386
That's it? A bank account?

214
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,052
A secret bank account.

215
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,028
What makes you
think it's a secret?

216
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:07,158
Because if it wasn't you
would call it "the" bank account.

217
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,398
Damn, always forget to use
the right article when lying.

218
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,565
It's not secret.
We're refurnishing.

219
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,050
We set the budget,
set up an account.

220
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,119
I just couldn't make it to the
bank the day we opened it.

221
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,841
You're spending almost
$100,000 on furniture?

222
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,609
Yes.

223
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,333
- What happened?
- I don't know.

224
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,653
He was fine, then all of a
sudden he started seizing.

225
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,214
He said you told
him he was better.

226
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,488
What's happening?
What's wrong with him?

227
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,964
She is hot.

228
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,768
Obviously, the drugs
weren't out of his system.

229
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,103
None of these drugs, nor
the drugs they're derived from,

230
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,119
are known for causing
seizures. By themselves, no.

231
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,840
But three unproven,
untested drugs?

232
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,313
It's like <i>The Mod Squad,</i>
no one can stop them.

233
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,792
It's ridiculous that
they let people take

234
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,546
potentially dangerous
drugs for money.

235
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,246
Just to short circuit
that discussion,

236
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,755
people should not be testing
drugs because they're desperate.

237
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,883
But people won't test drugs
unless they're desperate.

238
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,894
We need drugs to save
children and puppies,

239
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,104
ergo we need desperate people,

240
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,927
ergo welfare
kills sick children.

241
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
First drug...

242
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,561
Why don't we
call it Bisexidrene?

243
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,597
Clinical trials involve
experimental drugs.

244
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,732
Means they don't have
comforting, catchy names yet,

245
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,403
just random,
unmemorable trial numbers.

246
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,706
Go ahead.

247
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,043
Bisexidrene is designed
as an anticoagulant.

248
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,107
Phase one indicated some
risk of nausea, ED and insomnia.

249
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,184
Second drug...

250
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,652
Cuckoldisol.

251
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,180
She is having an affair? Worse.

252
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,694
Sex can be dismissed as hormonal
or emotional, can be easily regretted.

253
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,695
Money is always a
calculated decision.

254
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,321
My wife has her own bank account

255
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,922
that House doesn't
think I know about.

256
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,797
Shocking. Discuss.

257
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,564
Drug B is an autoimmune
treatment, almost no side effects.

258
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,448
But even if it's doing what
it's supposed to be doing,

259
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,067
it doesn't mix well with
anticoagulants or anticonvulsants.

260
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,318
Which is the third drug?

261
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,176
World's-sorest-knees-isil.

262
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,456
Cuddy used to have
that title, by the way.

263
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,711
There's a million ways
these drugs could interact,

264
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,326
if they're doing what
they're supposed to.

265
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,470
If they're not, two million.

266
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,763
And it'd be interesting to
know which of those interactions

267
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,914
was causing the problem.

268
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,266
Unfortunately, we don't have to.

269
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,533
We just have to
stop the interacting.

270
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,389
If we don't know
which... We stop them all.

271
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,257
Put him on dialysis,
clear out his system.

272
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,853
Rapid detox risks arrhythmia,

273
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,274
another seizure,
hepatic failure...

274
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,530
Difference is we know what
those risks are. Put him on dialysis.

275
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,632
Dialysis. You use that
for kidney failure, right?

276
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,334
Don't worry, your
kidneys are fine.

277
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,718
He's not worried
about his kidneys.

278
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,506
He's worried about
how he's going to explain

279
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,739
the dialysis to his girlfriend.

280
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,145
I just don't want her to worry.

281
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,910
You mean you don't
want her to leave you.

282
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,782
What's wrong with
that? I love her.

283
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,964
It's not like I've lied to her
about anything important.

284
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,183
I am an artist.

285
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,782
I've sold plenty of
paintings in the past,

286
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,952
I just hit a bit of a
dry spell lately, so...

287
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,791
So tell her that.

288
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,353
He can't.

289
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,457
He wants her to be happy, too.

290
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,161
He's telling her what
she wants to hear.

291
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,699
You didn't know.

292
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,799
No.

293
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,545
What are you gonna do?

294
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,690
She's not sleeping around,
she's not gambling it away,

295
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,994
she hasn't even spent any of it,

296
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,347
so I don't see a
reason to do anything.

297
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,695
You don't think
a conversation...

298
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,017
How many people do you know

299
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,615
in completely happy
and fulfilled relationships?

300
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,522
None. I am.

301
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,051
Most people cling to some storybook
notion of what a relationship is.

302
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,859
You can't have an
imperfect thought.

303
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,611
You can't have a
private zone. You can't...

304
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,864
Steal money and hide it
away in a secret account?

305
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:33,236
She makes me happy. I
make her happy. It works.

306
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,706
Because we don't do storybook,

307
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,800
and I don't plan to
poke into her business.

308
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,250
You were right
about the dialysis.

309
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,863
He made it through the night
without any more seizures

310
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,911
or visual symptoms.

311
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,616
And I'm gonna be just as right

312
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,488
after breakfast up in my office.

313
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,221
The only difference is I'm gonna
be right in front of other people.

314
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,559
Which means you're not
here to talk about the medicine.

315
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,241
You can screw with
me all you want at work,

316
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,927
but stay out of
my personal life.

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,060
What did she say?

318
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,313
Did you just hear what I said?

319
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,337
I heard the part about

320
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,949
"You can screw with
me at work all you want."

321
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,339
You want my
advice? Of course not.

322
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,707
Good, because I have no
idea what you should do.

323
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,177
I only know what
you're going to do.

324
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,856
You're gonna... I said I
didn't want your advice.

325
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,178
I said this is not advice.

326
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,444
You are going to forgive
her for opening that account,

327
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,094
and you're gonna confess
everything you've done

328
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,878
and then you're gonna
beg her to forgive you.

329
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,513
What purpose could
that possibly serve?

330
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,424
None, which is why I'm not
saying you should, but you will.

331
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,438
<i>What's your end game?</i>

332
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,624
Where are you?

333
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,725
I'm at the track.

334
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,171
That's like six miles away.
How cool are these things?

335
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,798
I feel like an idiot.

336
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,009
I'm not giving you
any more of my stuff.

337
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,380
Do you have those
night vision goggles?

338
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,680
<i>No.</i>

339
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:53,879
You're lying.

340
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,649
You like making him miserable.

341
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,190
You like driving
people away from you.

342
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,691
He deserved to know the truth.

343
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,387
There was no truth
until you dug it up.

344
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,296
<i>You do know that stuff exists
even when you can't see it, right?</i>

345
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,855
It was a truth that
mattered to him

346
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,299
and a truth that
mattered to her,

347
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,858
why did it matter to you?

348
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,429
First of all, stop saying "a"
truth. There is only one truth.

349
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,168
That may be true for you.

350
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,344
Miserable people
save more lives.

351
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,923
If your life has meaning, your
job doesn't have to have meaning.

352
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,440
Screw-ups are more palatable if
you have someone's arms to go cry in.

353
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,486
That makes sense.

354
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,418
Usually, I have more
of a fight on that one.

355
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,650
So why are you
making Taub miserable?

356
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,723
I just said...

357
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,783
<i>He left his last job
to save his marriage.</i>

358
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,092
If his marriage falls apart, you
think he'll be working harder for you?

359
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,291
Or you think he won't
be working for you at all?

360
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,614
His head and neck
are completely swollen.

361
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,073
I need a Trach kit.
His throat's closing.

362
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,605
Can't find any landmarks.

363
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,704
Just start cutting.

364
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,781
An exploratory trach?

365
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,147
We don't have a choice.

366
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,915
I got it. Here.

367
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,163
<i>His face is so swollen it's
squeezed his tear ducts shut.</i>

368
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,826
<i>We've been lubricating
his eyes by hand.</i>

369
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,598
We've started
him on steroids, IV,

370
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,968
and cream to
reduce the swelling,

371
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,115
but it's having limited effect.

372
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,303
Negative for thrombosis and
Chagas. Could be infection.

373
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,469
Cultures still negative.

374
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,139
Could be his immune system's
on hyperdrive, cytokine storm.

375
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,682
Why would you pay for a
three-year gym membership

376
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,547
and only go twice?

377
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,155
Sorry. You guys
still diagnosing?

378
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,333
I thought we finished hours ago.

379
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,317
You remember, when we
decided it was the unproven,

380
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,854
unapproved cocktail of drugs he's
been downing like... Like a cocktail.

381
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,957
He just completed
a total dialysis.

382
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,467
If it was the drugs,
he'd be better.

383
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,934
Or he'd be worse.

384
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,502
I take it none of you
saw <i>Trainspotting.</i>

385
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,373
You think swelling is a
symptom of withdrawal?

386
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,968
You think it's a coincidence that
three new symptoms cropped up

387
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,254
as soon as we took
him off the drugs?

388
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,355
It's possible some
of the symptoms...

389
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,813
Either the drugs are the answer

390
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,406
or the drugs are a coincidence.

391
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,394
If it's one, we have to find
a better way to detox him.

392
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,217
If it's two, we have to know which
symptoms are withdrawal related

393
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,983
before we can
formulate a diagnosis.

394
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,582
Which means we have to
find a better way to detox him.

395
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,388
So how do we do it?

396
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,660
Hair of the drug that bit him.

397
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,822
That's ridiculous.

398
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,274
If it is the drugs, they're dangerous,
and they've already caused...

399
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,009
That's why we're gonna
put him back on the drugs,

400
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,399
then wean him off again.

401
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,595
Just much slower.

402
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,668
Why are you looking at him?

403
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,076
Try it out.

404
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,674
You heard the boss. Go!

405
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,016
Taub... I didn't talk to her.

406
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,619
Why are you...

407
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,957
Excuse me.

408
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,554
Uh, sorry.

409
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,963
He does look like
me, doesn't he?

410
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,201
You gave him your hat?

411
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,319
I needed you out of here so
I could go through your desk.

412
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,436
Of course.

413
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,309
Nice blouse. I really
like that color on you.

414
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,325
Tell House that if he wants
to know what I'm doing,

415
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,408
all he has to do...

416
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,921
It's not House. It's me.
I was... I don't know.

417
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,889
I was thinking maybe we could
get together for a drink or something.

418
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,358
I wasn't sure exactly what
you like to do, so I thought...

419
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,954
You'd spy on me? No, no,
not spying. More like research.

420
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,241
I think it's a good idea to
get to know a little bit more

421
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,131
about a woman
before you ask her out.

422
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,500
Show you care about more
than just what she looks like.

423
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,739
As romantic as you
make that sound,

424
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,672
pretty sure that
what you're doing

425
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,735
is not so much caring as creepy.

426
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:40,812
That's not fair.

427
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,348
You were scrounging
through my desk.

428
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,626
What the hell am I going to
find out? You went to Michigan.

429
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,778
You like your sandwiches
a little light on mayo.

430
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,343
You stay in touch
with your mother.

431
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,621
You rented <i>The English Patient</i>

432
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,523
and you gave money
to Amnesty International.

433
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,169
There's not one thing
I can find out in here

434
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,322
that you wouldn't tell a co-worker
while riding in an elevator.

435
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,395
I'm not a creep. I just thought
you seemed interesting.

436
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,538
I'll go now.

437
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, these...

438
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:18,347
I'll give you embarrassing
info on House.

439
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,510
In exchange for...

440
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,814
No. No need for a date.

441
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,822
You'd be employing me, so
I'd have all the time in the world

442
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,188
to ask you all about
you and it would fall

443
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,624
under the category
of socializing,

444
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,991
instead of creepy stalking.

445
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,661
And I'd be paying
you? I know it's weird.

446
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,859
But if you pay me while I
check you out, it's all cool.

447
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,944
And you'd get value. You'd
get leverage against him.

448
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,197
Help you keep him in line.

449
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,947
You think I need help
keeping House in line?

450
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,132
No.

451
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,470
Nope. I'm sorry.

452
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,411
This hospital can't afford...

453
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,209
Oh, whatever you can afford.

454
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,920
How did you know I liked roses?

455
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,888
I was in your house last night.

456
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,255
No, I'm kidding.

457
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,921
Who the hell doesn't like roses?

458
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,034
I forgot to tell you,

459
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,136
the Parker Quartet is going
to play at the library fundraiser.

460
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,742
That's it? It was your idea.

461
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,185
They'll be great.

462
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,849
Mmm-hmm.

463
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,589
You okay?

464
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,233
I couldn't find
the letter opener.

465
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,762
I went through some of the
drawers in your desk, looking for it.

466
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,834
There were a bunch of statements
in there from Jefferson Mutual.

467
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,451
I was so close.

468
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,719
To what?

469
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,660
You've got $83,000 socked
away in a secret account.

470
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,219
Not anymore.

471
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,700
I wanted to keep it a surprise,

472
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,198
but I bought you the car.

473
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,137
Uh...

474
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,771
The one that I...

475
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:35,684
I knew you would never buy
it yourself, so I've been saving.

476
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,756
And it's gonna be
delivered on Friday.

477
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,498
You are amazing.

478
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,423
Lucky you.

479
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,835
We've gradually
reduced your dosage.

480
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,275
You're actually drug-free now.

481
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,007
I feel great. Thanks to you.

482
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,208
All part of the job.

483
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,717
Your blood pressure is
normal. Can you sit up?

484
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,115
Hey!

485
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,257
What are you...

486
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,225
What happened to his face?

487
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,030
Question is, what
happened to his hormones?

488
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,435
We're gonna need
an ice pack in here.

489
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,087
<i>We can rule out the clinical
trial drugs at this point.</i>

490
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,046
His system has been
completely cleaned twice.

491
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,224
So unless the drugs found a
hiding place under the stairs...

492
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,683
Drugs could have set off a
dormant neurological condition.

493
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,654
Good point. Coming clean
causes a lot of damage.

494
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,690
Alienation, divorce...

495
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,292
My wife's buying me a car.

496
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,696
I was talking about the
patient. You were wrong.

497
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,732
The divorce was metaphorical.

498
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,858
What about Klüver-Bucy Syndrome?

499
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,766
Bilateral lesions in
the temporal lobes.

500
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,304
Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality
are the key symptoms.

501
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,896
Good thing he's
got that girlfriend.

502
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,965
If it's Klüver-Bucy, his
brain will melt down,

503
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,374
he'll try to swallow
his own hands

504
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,554
and she can take care of him
for the rest of his talentless life.

505
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,739
You owe me an apology.

506
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,679
Any rationalization
you had for meddling

507
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,580
in my private life disappeared

508
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,743
when she had good reason...

509
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:13,877
You're right.

510
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,357
Fact is, nothing I said applies.

511
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,017
You had no reason
to forgive her,

512
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,722
therefore no reason to seek
forgiveness, no reason to be an idiot.

513
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,897
Klüver-Bucy wouldn't explain
the seizure or the cytokine storm.

514
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,267
Withdrawal complications.

515
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,829
Then again, she is
handing you a giant gift

516
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,238
that you don't
think you deserve.

517
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,402
The fact that the MRI showed no lesions
on the temporal lobe tends to rule out

518
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,988
your "lesions on the
temporal lobe" theory.

519
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,607
The damage can be a circulatory
issue, rather than structural.

520
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,741
We wouldn't see that on the MRI.

521
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,817
Foreman's right.

522
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,595
Go call your wife, tell her
you're not coming home,

523
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,418
say you have to give a
patient a cranial MR angiogram,

524
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,958
then say good night and hang up.

525
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:19,808
Odd that a man who can't run
would own so many pairs of sneakers.

526
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,047
You mind hanging this
up when you're done?

527
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,454
I have to find something
embarrassing about you.

528
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,325
No, you don't. I
ordered us Indian.

529
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,991
Not too embarrassing.
Just something credible.

530
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,934
Well, if you hand her that, she's
not gonna need you anymore.

531
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,214
If I don't hand her anything,
she'll think I'm incompetent.

532
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:42,333
I don't care if she thinks
you're incompetent.

533
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,240
This isn't gonna work.

534
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,073
It's worked so far.

535
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,511
I'm not good at lying.

536
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,638
I know.

537
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,582
That's why your cover
is that you want to do her.

538
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,518
I like her. I don't
want to do her.

539
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,680
Then what's the
point of liking her?

540
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,623
I meant I don't just
want to do her. I like her.

541
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,251
What do you think you're
gonna find out about her?

542
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:06,659
Something personal,
something embarrassing.

543
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,134
I spend half my life
negotiating with that woman.

544
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,036
Anything I can use to
scare her into saying yes.

545
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,904
Okay.

546
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,541
"Okay"?

547
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,210
You're okay with being paid
twice to facilitate blackmail?

548
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,948
I'm okay. I don't believe
you. But I'm okay.

549
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,518
You're doing this for the
same reason I'm doing this.

550
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,390
We'll see who gets there first.

551
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,666
Here it is. Circle of Willis,
the vessels are narrow.

552
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,061
Narrow for you, normal for him.

553
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,449
If there were problems
with the vessels,

554
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,907
he would have had
symptoms long ago.

555
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,205
Not if something else changed.

556
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,505
Like? TAUB: His heart.

557
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,589
He could have recently gotten
an intermittent arrhythmia.

558
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,481
I know "heart" and "head"
start with the same three letters,

559
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,882
but you've got to read
all the way to the end.

560
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,614
The experimental drugs
cause an arrhythmia

561
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,315
which causes low blood pressure.

562
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,050
Combine that with
those narrow vessels,

563
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,683
the brain doesn't
get enough blood.

564
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,556
That causes all of his symptoms.

565
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,438
If we can trigger the
arrhythmia and identify it,

566
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,795
we might be able to
stop it from killing him.

567
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,064
Been home? No.

568
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,240
Good. Do an EP study.
Find the arrhythmia.

569
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,105
We're gonna insert three
electrical catheters into your heart.

570
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,647
Tell Dr. Hadley I'm sorry.

571
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:31,411
She understands, and
you should tell her yourself.

572
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,923
Maybe I should
tell Heather about it.

573
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,351
You're gonna be fine.

574
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,789
She's so supportive, she's
so great. All I do is lie to her.

575
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,951
What happens if you tell her?

576
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,052
I don't know.

577
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,619
You love her, right?

578
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,136
More than anything,
and she loves me.

579
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,565
If you open your mouth,
one of two things happens,

580
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,626
she either forgives
you or she leaves you.

581
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,900
At best, you wind up exactly
where you are right now.

582
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,806
It's noble to want to
confess. Really, it is.

583
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,401
But if the result's
just damage and pain,

584
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,572
that's not noble, it's selfish.

585
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,284
Stimulate right atrium.

586
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,547
Normal conduction.

587
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,919
How long you plan on
keeping me from going home?

588
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,151
Until you're convinced
I'm a different person,

589
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,319
one who won't do
anything stupid?

590
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:20,026
Guilt fades quickly. By
Wednesday, you'll be fine.

591
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,802
Right ventricle. And why
do you want it to fade?

592
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,895
Why do you suddenly
care about my marriage?

593
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,065
Because if it ain't broke...

594
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,768
You obviously think it is broke.

595
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,241
And you obviously
think it ain't.

596
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,040
Your marriage is
like a broken toaster.

597
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,223
Bread keeps popping out,
and you keep calling it toast,

598
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,725
which is weird because you've
put your bread in a lot of toasters,

599
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,295
and apparently you don't see any
difference. It's kind of fascinating.

600
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,919
He's going into V Tach.

601
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:42,987
What's wrong?

602
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,115
Good news, test is working.

603
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,802
Your heart's freaking out, but
it's cool that you're still conscious.

604
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,192
Try to overdrive.

605
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,257
Didn't work.

606
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,539
This might burn a little
bit. Charging to 60. Clear.

607
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,100
Ow!

608
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,838
Going again. Charging to 120.

609
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,606
Have you been dyeing your hair?

610
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,716
No. House. Clear.

611
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,011
Right.

612
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,546
Your hair's growing in red.

613
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,722
His heart rate is stabilized.

614
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,023
Does your theory include
any genetic mutations

615
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,326
that could cause his
hair to change color?

616
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,333
Then either he's
lying about dyeing

617
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,999
or just dying.

618
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,807
Red hair means
it's not Klüver-Bucy.

619
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,277
Melanin affects hair color.
What affects melanin?

620
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,337
Hormones. Hormone
panels were all normal.

621
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,643
Age.

622
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,377
He's turning
prematurely crimson?

623
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,570
A genetic disorder.

624
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,588
Waardenburg Syndrome causes
arrhythmias and can change hair color.

625
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,317
And make you deaf. Next.

626
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,792
I found a long QT interval. I
think it's Romano-Ward Syndrome.

627
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,419
Explains the irregular
heart rhythms.

628
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,827
But not the ginger nut.

629
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,375
If he's got Romano's, he's
got at least five gene mutations.

630
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,877
It's not a big leap to think he has
others that would give him the hair.

631
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,837
It also gives him the likelihood
of sudden and unexpected death.

632
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,841
Beta blockers don't work.
His heart can't handle an ICD.

633
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,308
Pete Best.

634
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,348
Good God, has none of
you ever read a history book?

635
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,614
The original Beatles drummer.

636
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,918
A bunch of nerves controls
the tempo of the heart.

637
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,501
They're all playing in time, except
one dude who can't keep the beat,

638
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,892
wrecks the whole
thing, so we hire Ringo.

639
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,690
Pete Best was actually
a great drummer.

640
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,596
But I assume you mean the patient
needs a cardiac sympathectomy?

641
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,909
I probably should
have just said that, huh?

642
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,267
You start cutting nerves, you risk
his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating...

643
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,671
So he saves a fortune on
karaoke machines and deodorant.

644
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,766
You think he's stable
enough for surgery?

645
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,409
If he was, he wouldn't need it.

646
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,745
Wow.

647
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,924
Wow. Yeah.

648
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,654
Do you have any
brothers and sisters?

649
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,127
One sister.

650
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,639
He told me he was
on the lacrosse team.

651
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,687
In high school.

652
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:09,257
In college he just cheered
the lacrosse team on to victory.

653
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,734
Wow. Yeah.

654
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,605
How was your
relationship with your dad?

655
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,867
Fine. You have
three more questions.

656
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,218
How was your
relationship with your mom?

657
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,301
Fine.

658
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,710
When did you
lose your virginity?

659
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,443
Not something I discuss
with co-workers in an elevator.

660
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,514
And...

661
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,682
And...

662
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,025
You know, don't you?

663
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,964
Bit of a wasted third question

664
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,125
'cause the answer
is "Know what?"

665
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,793
Okay, bear with me here,

666
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,360
because some people
sometimes consider

667
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,736
my thought
processes complicated.

668
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:51,106
I'm into you 'cause
you're hot and smart,

669
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,372
in that order, but
both are needed.

670
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,073
Photos can be retouched,

671
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:58,982
and House is an evil genius,
which makes this photo suspicious.

672
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,678
And yet you're not suspicious.

673
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,764
Which means either you're not
smart enough to be suspicious,

674
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:06,486
in which case, I am
less interested in you.

675
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,153
Or you're not suspicious
because you know

676
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,992
this is actually a
doctored photo of House.

677
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,227
In which case, I am
more interested in you.

678
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,428
But I'm wasting my
time because you know

679
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,027
this is a game we
are playing on you

680
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,903
and I am busted and I'm screwed.

681
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,438
I know the photo's a fake.

682
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,905
I know this is a game.

683
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,911
Sorry.

684
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,351
Too bad.

685
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,116
Goodbye.

686
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:50,158
So you knew that I wasn't gonna
give you anything worthwhile?

687
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,000
And you were never gonna
give me anything worthwhile?

688
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,804
Then why did you bother
coming out with me?

689
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,435
I wanted to screw with House.

690
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,216
By wasting my time?
That doesn't make sense.

691
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:10,155
No. There must
be another reason.

692
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,348
Hmm.

693
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,518
Is it okay if I sit
back down here?

694
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,242
<i>Your heartbeat's out of control.</i>

695
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,725
We need to surgically sever the
connection between your heart and brain.

696
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:28,069
We believe it's necessary, but
you need to know the ramifications.

697
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,005
You'll never be
able to feel angina.

698
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,306
You may not know if
you have a heart attack,

699
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,369
may not be able
to get help in time.

700
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,779
Where are my regular doctors?

701
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,975
Regular doctors?

702
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,881
Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley.

703
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,079
Why aren't they telling me this?

704
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,952
Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley,
and this is Dr. Taub.

705
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:49,861
What are you talking about? I've
never seen you before in my life.

706
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,700
We can't do the surgery.

707
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,547
We're back to where we
started, visual agnosia.

708
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,315
We need to re-examine
neurological disorders,

709
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,184
something slowly progressing.
This isn't progressing.

710
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,370
It's there, then
it's not, then it is.

711
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,537
It's a new symptom,
intermittence.

712
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,142
It's irrelevant.

713
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,047
Since when is a new
symptom irrelevant?

714
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,915
Since it points towards
the same disease.

715
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,613
Intermittence can fit
with Romano-Ward.

716
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,280
We still need to do
a sympathectomy.

717
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,221
Maybe we missed
something, toxins.

718
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,692
When? When you
checked every bottle,

719
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,000
every can, every tube of paint,

720
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,529
or when you detoxed him twice?

721
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,497
Maybe there was a
batch of toxic paint

722
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,158
that he used up
a few months ago.

723
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,111
Then he would have been
sick months ago, not now.

724
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,763
He's lost weight
since he got here.

725
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,614
That's a symptom of
trying to cram hospital food

726
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,116
down a throat he can
barely get air down.

727
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,199
It's not a symptom,

728
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:40,075
but what if the toxins were
stored in his fat cells a year ago,

729
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,705
and now they're being
released into his bloodstream?

730
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,543
So where are you gonna get
this old paint, the city dump?

731
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,680
On his old paintings. We
know he hasn't sold one in ages,

732
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,987
but there weren't many in his
studio. He's hid them somewhere.

733
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,222
If you're wrong,
he could drop dead

734
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,321
from Romano-Ward at any moment.

735
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,421
You okay with that?

736
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,490
Just give me a few hours.

737
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,830
You got one.

738
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,934
I need to talk to him alone.

739
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,038
It's about your
work. Your paintings.

740
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,573
I need to look at all the
ones you've sold recently.

741
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,421
Honey, can you give us a minute?

742
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,323
To talk about your paintings?

743
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,264
Brandon, please. Tell
me what's going on.

744
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:46,205
I've only sold two paintings in
the last three years, since we met.

745
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,277
One was to my cousin.

746
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,215
I've been making money
enrolling in drug trials.

747
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,843
Two, three at a time.

748
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,125
Why did you lie to me?

749
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,527
I want to be...

750
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,496
The way you look at me,
the way it makes me feel...

751
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:16,337
I want to be what you
see when you look at me.

752
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,877
You think I'm that shallow?

753
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:28,717
When I look at you, I see you.

754
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:43,961
So,

755
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,007
where are the
ones you didn't sell?

756
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,128
It's not the paint,
it's the drugs.

757
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,358
He's not on the drugs

758
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,509
I know it doesn't make sense,

759
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,773
but I'm looking at his
paintings for the last six months.

760
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,795
They're normal April,
June and August,

761
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,035
but they're distorted
May, July, September.

762
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,407
Every other month, he
was having visual agnosia

763
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,641
because every other month, he
was on all three drugs simultaneously.

764
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,547
The statin was one
month on, one month off.

765
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,394
I don't know why the symptoms
keep coming and going,

766
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,477
but it is the drugs.

767
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,584
They're hiding under the stairs.

768
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,318
In the fat? That
doesn't make sense.

769
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,631
<i>These drugs aren't fat soluble.</i>

770
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,787
I said stairs, not closet.

771
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,695
What was the last drug he was
on before the drugs he was on

772
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:53,891
<i>when the symptoms started?</i>

773
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,297
I'm not sure, I think...

774
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,459
Antacid.

775
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,070
How do you know? <i>It makes sense.</i>

776
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,769
Also, I'm looking at the file.

777
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:07,939
Yes.

778
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,914
It's Dr. House.

779
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,116
Wake him up. We're done.

780
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,350
No, no, he says he needs
surgery, but not this one.

781
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,686
Did he give any specifics?

782
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,693
Abdominal surgery
to remove a bezoar.

783
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:28,223
It's like a hairball, but it's
made up of undigested food.

784
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,234
You can get it if your
stomach acid's low,

785
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,669
which Brandon's was because
of an experimental antacid.

786
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,003
<i>The fruit and vegetable
fibers and skins</i>

787
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,270
<i>get stuck together
and form a ball.</i>

788
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,108
<i>It gets sticky, ferments, grows.</i>

789
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,739
<i>It starts sucking up some
of the pills he'd taken.</i>

790
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,944
<i>Some are never heard from
again, but some get released.</i>

791
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,247
<i>For the last week, it's
basically been giving him</i>

792
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,789
<i>massive doses
of all three at once.</i>

793
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,953
That is why I won't
let Cameron buy a cat.

794
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,499
He should be fine.

795
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,029
Are you glad he
told you the truth?

796
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,904
Yes. Of course.

797
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,170
But were you happier
before you knew?

798
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,218
About 10 more feet.

799
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,770
I do know what it looks like, so
maybe this whole blindfold thing...

800
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:33,253
Shh. My gift, my rules. Bump!

801
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,300
All right, if you
don't like the color,

802
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,544
apparently we can exchange it,

803
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,128
but I'm hoping... You ready?

804
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,437
Ta-da!

805
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,811
Do you like it?

806
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,645
Baby, are you okay?

807
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,265
We need to talk.

808
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,418
She didn't buy it.

809
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,516
Damn.

810
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,424
So, you didn't get anything?

811
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,729
Nothing. We
probably overstepped.

812
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,634
You're really not
the cheerleader type.

813
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,299
On the other hand, I figured
she probably wouldn't figure me

814
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,712
as the "Photoshopping
a photo and planting

815
00:41:51,736 --> 00:41:54,210
it in an obscure college
paper" type either.

816
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,213
Yeah. About that,

817
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,012
I took a little trip
to your alma mater.

818
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,385
You took a little
trip 150 miles?

819
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,656
Online, by phone. I
meant I did research.

820
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,929
That's a real photo, isn't it?

821
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,534
Wow, that is humiliating.

822
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,868
There was a girl.

823
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,311
Even more so.

824
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,941
That's too bad. You wanted
her to see you in a different light,

825
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,851
and not only didn't she see it,

826
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
but she didn't even
believe it was possible.

827
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,521
You know, people hate people
who have theories about people.

828
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,100
You want me to back off?

829
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,107
Would you?

830
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,642
I barely know you.
