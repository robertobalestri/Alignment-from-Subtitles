1
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,781
Am I going to have
to give a speech?

2
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,558
You're the publisher,
can't you do it?

3
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,346
I can warm them up,

4
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,080
but you're gonna have to get
over this fear of public speaking

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,452
before the book tour.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,487
Everybody! Can I have
your attention? Thank you.

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,755
Tim has a few words to say.

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,321
There you go, Tim.
They're warmed up.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,563
Well.

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,162
What do you say
at a time like this?

11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,400
Seriously, what do you say?

12
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,308
You could thank
people for coming.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,969
Thank you, Nick.

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,445
Actually, I'm always
thanking Nick.

15
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,575
A man famous not only
for his ruthless editor's pen,

16
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,985
but his patient handholding
of crazy authors.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,578
You'd think that
after three novels,

18
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,125
I'd start to develop a
little confidence, but...

19
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,525
For a book like this, we are
happy to supply the confidence.

20
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,028
Bestseller.

21
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,294
Well, that's not
going to happen.

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,366
What?

23
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,426
Come on. Short stories
don't make money.

24
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,472
Short stories weren't
making money back in 1908.

25
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,178
You'd have to be
mathematically illiterate

26
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,484
to think they'd do
as well as a novel.

27
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:18,946
Okay, Nick, let's step away from the
champagne before somebody gets hurt.

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,812
You slaved over this
book right next to me.

29
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,375
Why would Northrop even
publish it if it's only going to tank?

30
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,478
Have you failed to notice
you're our star author?

31
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,990
Obviously, Elaine
wouldn't want to offend you.

32
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,287
Honey...

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,160
I'm sorry, I don't... I
don't know why I said that.

34
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,292
He's joking.

35
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,837
Nick knows as well as anyone
what you have done is art.

36
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,839
So is folding paper
into animal shapes,

37
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,650
but you don't expect
to make a living off it.

38
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,851
What the hell is wrong with you?

39
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,987
You really think someone who
goes through 10 assistants a year

40
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,310
and doesn't return her
own children's phone calls

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,820
would give a damn about the
state of the American short story?

42
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,612
Please, be quiet.

43
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,749
I think something's wrong.

44
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,453
That title was a mistake, too.

45
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,655
People are going to
compare you to Salinger.

46
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,030
And boy, are you going to
come up short in that one.

47
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,097
Honey?

48
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,901
Call 911. Help! We need help!

49
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,338
Cameron brought
this up from the ER.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,672
Doesn't look like a
friendship bracelet.

51
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,546
It's Phineas Gage.

52
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,417
The most famous case
study in medical history.

53
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,519
You're telling me this
patient got a railroad spike

54
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,865
drilled through
his frontal lobe?

55
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,882
No, no trauma, but he does
have frontal lobe disinhibition.

56
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,119
Just like Gage.

57
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,990
Gage was a different
person after the spike.

58
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,462
Argumentative, impulsive.

59
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,431
Whereas our guy became a
different person after chardonnay.

60
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,263
He was sober when
they brought him in.

61
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,701
There's also the
nosebleed, the collapse.

62
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,295
MRI show anything? Nothing.

63
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,601
Good. What fun would that be?

64
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,643
So the tumor's not in
the cool neighborhood.

65
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,143
It's cool neighborhood adjacent.

66
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,906
A well-placed tumor
in the nasal cavity,

67
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,659
eroding into the brain
could do the damage.

68
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,083
Go stick a scope up Phineas'
nose and see what you find.

69
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,053
Daddy, I'm always going to win if
you keep telling me what your cards are.

70
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:51,587
Then suppose I tell
you... While I tickle you!

71
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,157
Mr. Greenwald, I'm Dr. Taub
and this is Dr. Kutner.

72
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,964
We're here for another
test. Sorry about that.

73
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,936
You don't look sorry.

74
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,240
Um. No offense.

75
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,334
Although you do
look kind of cheerful.

76
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,422
It's a little creepy. Should I want a
doctor who's excited about how sick I am?

77
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,745
I'm not... We're going
to put this up your nose,

78
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,477
scan for any problems.

79
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,782
I can assure you that we are
completely unexcited about that.

80
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,583
Excuse me, sweetie.

81
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,983
She has an auditory
processing disability.

82
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,617
Marika Balika. You
have to get off the bed.

83
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,963
This might be
slightly uncomfortable.

84
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,931
Honey, do you
mind if I step out?

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,279
I have to make sure the final arrangements
are in place for the breast cancer walk.

86
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,464
Yeah. You do that.

87
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll pretend to be macho while a guy
stuffs three feet of plastic up my nose.

88
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,270
It's too bad it's not your nose.

89
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,337
Lots more room to maneuver.

90
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,508
I guess the walk
can wait 10 minutes.

91
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,586
Or in a sensible
world, even longer.

92
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,520
Just how does tying up traffic
for six hours stop breast cancer?

93
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,284
You know how it
works, people donate.

94
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,953
Why not spend six hours building
houses for Habitat for Humanity?

95
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,496
Or is it wrong to help two
groups of people at once?

96
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,259
I'll bet there are those who
have breast cancer and no home.

97
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,994
It's my job, Nick.

98
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,694
You walked yourself last year.

99
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,793
To be supportive.

100
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,466
Because I knew you wouldn't
have sex with me if I didn't.

101
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,534
I'm going to make my call.

102
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,441
Make this go away.

103
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,278
God, that honker
really is huge, isn't it?

104
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,350
Wednesday night.

105
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,153
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie
versus the Incinerator.

106
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,694
I can't.

107
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,227
Let me rephrase.
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie...

108
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,697
I understand Monster Truck code.

109
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,859
Do you understand "can't"?

110
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,630
Not when it follows
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie.

111
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,469
Is the world coming to
an end Tuesday night?

112
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,099
Otherwise,
Wednesday... All right.

113
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,043
It's not "can't,"
it's "don't want to."

114
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,840
The fact is, I just don't
like monster trucks.

115
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,376
Yes, you do.

116
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,475
No, I don't.

117
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,077
You've always
liked monster trucks.

118
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,645
No, you've always liked them.

119
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,089
I've tolerated them.

120
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,184
Seriously, I can only watch so
many hyped-up dune buggies

121
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,026
crush so many motor homes without
feeling the urge to go see <i>La Boh√®me.</i>

122
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,997
And I hate opera, too.

123
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,567
What are you hiding?

124
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,366
I'm not hiding it, I'm
saying it loud and proud.

125
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,065
Death to monster trucks.

126
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,733
No nasal cancer.

127
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,300
And no marriage either,

128
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,622
if our patient keeps saying
everything that comes into his head

129
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,672
without regard for
the consequences.

130
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,910
You always led me to
believe you were one of a kind.

131
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,283
Luckily, jerkiness is a
temporary condition for this guy.

132
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,753
No, it's not.

133
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,518
We may be able to fix his
impulse to say his thoughts out loud,

134
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,684
but he's always gonna be
the guy who thinks them.

135
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,490
But he's also gonna be the
guy who doesn't say them.

136
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,122
If he spent his whole life
constructing a nice-guy persona,

137
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,259
isn't that as much who he
really is as anything else?

138
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,099
You would argue
that. You're all persona.

139
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,265
I agree with Wilson.
This guy's a Harry Potter.

140
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,653
The sorting hat was going to put
Harry in Slytherin, based on his nature.

141
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,839
He refused, so he
ended up in Gryffindor.

142
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,279
Through choice.

143
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,545
There's damage somewhere
in his brain. Go find it.

144
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,080
Are you sure you understand?

145
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,680
No, I'm lying. Except, I can't.

146
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,523
You ask me questions.

147
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,189
While I talk, you look at my brain
activity to see where it's screwed up,

148
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,503
then you're gonna cut the
screwed up part out to test it.

149
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,500
It's depressing, but
it's not rocket science.

150
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,865
I think he understands.

151
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,201
I don't mean to be abrasive.

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,797
Especially since you're such
a pleasure to imagine naked.

153
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,603
Again, sorry. It's okay.

154
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,837
Thank you for understanding.

155
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,641
I'd do you, though.

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,025
Really, my apologies.
This stuff just comes out.

157
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,075
It's okay. House paged?

158
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:35,213
Whoa. I would do her in a minute
with fudge and a cherry on top.

159
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,524
Would someone please
explain to this woman?

160
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,769
There's only so
many apologies I can...

161
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,591
He has frontal
lobe disinhibition.

162
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,062
I've already embarrassed
myself with one doctor.

163
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,257
Whom I am at this moment

164
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:49,428
imagining with you in a king-sized
bed with a mirror on the ceiling.

165
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,563
I am so, so sorry.

166
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,369
But if I couldn't have
both of you together,

167
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,637
you would definitely
be my first choice.

168
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,710
Where's House?

169
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,575
It's like trying not to
think of an elephant.

170
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,413
Not that you're an elephant. Your
breasts, in fact, are all <i>Homo sapiens.</i>

171
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,746
House isn't here.

172
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,446
He wouldn't have paged me

173
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,182
if he couldn't watch
and enjoy the...

174
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,322
Your tush is like the
pistons in a Ferrari.

175
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,535
You're welcome.

176
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,134
That was for my benefit?

177
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,077
You're 40 years
old... Thirty eight.

178
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,256
And the administrator
of a hospital.

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,373
Dean of medicine.

180
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,417
People don't get
personal with you.

181
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,318
Except for me, and you dismiss
me as a jerk who's jerking you around.

182
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,979
But that guy can
only tell the truth.

183
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,956
And he prefers your body to
that of a smoking young hottie.

184
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:49,019
So that was your way of
saying I look good today?

185
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,824
You didn't get the
slightest kick out of that?

186
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,694
Don't be ridiculous, House.

187
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:03,337
I hope you know your
pistons are second to none.

188
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,705
I'm okay. I'm not jealous
of Cuddy's pistons.

189
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,441
Starting baseline activation.

190
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,711
You sure? You looked upset.

191
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,876
What he was saying
was obnoxious.

192
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,386
You've never been
called attractive?

193
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,856
He didn't call me attractive,
he cast me in his mental porno.

194
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,068
That's what "attractive" means.

195
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,720
It means "I'm attracted
to you sexually."

196
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:25,162
"Attracted" can also mean, "I'm attracted
to the whole package, to who you are."

197
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,564
Slight elevation
at transaxial 60.

198
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,828
It could.

199
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,422
It never does. It's what women
choose to hear, not what men say.

200
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,270
Actually, it's exactly what men
say, if they have any brains.

201
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,618
All right, we have
enough for a baseline.

202
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,579
What can we ask him that's indiscreet,
but that he won't hate us for knowing?

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,576
Nick, do you vote the
same way as your wife?

204
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,912
<i>God, no.</i>

205
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,780
Good. He's spiking at 30.

206
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,083
<i>She believes I voted for
Hillary Clinton in the primary,</i>

207
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,417
<i>and Obama in the general.</i>

208
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,720
<i>You're thinking I'm
secretly Republican, right?</i>

209
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,850
<i>Wrong.</i>

210
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,589
I secretly don't vote ever.

211
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,593
<i>Wait, you're 46 and
you've never voted?</i>

212
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,103
Your voice is no longer attractive
to me with that note of disapproval.

213
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,831
<i>Although I'm
sure that will pass.</i>

214
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,997
Look at that.

215
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,065
There's a spot on the cingulate
gyrus that's not lighting up.

216
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,735
<i>One vote makes a difference?</i>

217
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,788
<i>Not mathematically...</i> Okay,
Nick, we've got what we need.

218
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,247
We can't biopsy that, it's
too close to the brain stem.

219
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,648
Could be neurosarcoidosis.
At least it's treatable.

220
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,195
So we give him
steroids and if we're right,

221
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,747
we should start seeing his
symptoms improve within half a day.

222
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,019
What are you looking at?

223
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:32,395
I find your strong attachment to a
working democracy to be extremely sexy.

224
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,229
You smooth talker.

225
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,895
Do you think my nose is too big?

226
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,840
Relax. He also implied my
bedside manner was a little off.

227
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,002
You don't agree
with that, right?

228
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,136
No.

229
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,842
No one's ever mentioned
your nose before?

230
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,281
You're a plastic surgeon.

231
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,375
They tell me it suits
my face. It does.

232
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,944
Maybe. Maybe that's
just the social contract.

233
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,216
You tell me I look great,

234
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,281
I tell you you're
a people person.

235
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,021
How can you know the truth?
You could ask for the truth.

236
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,273
What do you think of my
nose? Please tell me the truth.

237
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,289
It's fine, it's a nose.

238
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,065
Just proving a point.

239
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,274
Anyone sitting here?

240
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,605
Just my persona.

241
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:25,076
You know, it's amazing the
way people cling on to insults.

242
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,814
Or what they think are insults.

243
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,913
So that wasn't an insult?

244
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,823
I'm not suggesting
that like our patient,

245
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,054
you're hiding a
dark, sarcastic core

246
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,620
beneath a candy shell
of compulsive niceness.

247
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,199
I'm not always nice.
I'm not nice to you.

248
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,759
Because you know nice
bores me. Hence, still nice.

249
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,306
No, I'm suggesting
that you have no core.

250
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,809
You're what whoever
you're with needs you to be.

251
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,936
Okay, I guess that
could be insulting.

252
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,413
But the interesting
question is why.

253
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,848
Why do you think the world
will end in chaos and destruction

254
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,510
if you're not there to save it?

255
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,748
Because when my parents put
me in the rocket, and sent me here,

256
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,792
they said, "James, you will grow
to manhood under a yellow sun."

257
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,384
And why did you lie
about monster trucks?

258
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,520
I didn't.

259
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,588
I checked your appointment book.

260
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,808
You've got tomorrow
night marked off,

261
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,801
but you didn't put down
what you were doing.

262
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,278
So you thought someone
might look at the book...

263
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:20,103
I'm playing racquetball
tomorrow night with Taub.

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,098
Why would you hide that?

265
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,110
Because the world
revolves around you.

266
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,475
I devote time to anyone else,

267
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,105
you'd end up stalking
me and harassing them.

268
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,207
You say that as
though it wouldn't be fun.

269
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,376
And maybe I didn't want
to rub your nose in the fact

270
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,650
that we'd be doing something
you can no longer do.

271
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,452
Because I'm nice.

272
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,693
I thought you said the
steroids were gonna help him!

273
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,494
Is it his heart?

274
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,129
EKG says heart's fine.

275
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,832
It's gotta be the kidneys.

276
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,806
We need to get him on dialysis.

277
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,436
Oh, God.

278
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,375
He's on dialysis
and he's stable.

279
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,145
We know it's not
systemic sclerosis.

280
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,550
Hey.

281
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,020
Cyrano de Berkowitz.

282
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,351
Let it go.

283
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,926
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia could
explain brain and kidney problems.

284
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,589
CBC showed normal
white blood cells.

285
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,363
So how long have you been
playing racquetball with Wilson?

286
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,232
Four or five times.

287
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,702
Could be diabetes.

288
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,899
Or a congenital
metabolic disorder.

289
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,067
Congenital disorders generally
don't wait till you're 46 to manifest.

290
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,635
So he's a late bloomer. His
daughter has a neurological condition.

291
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:37,241
First of all, Wilson played
tennis on his college team,

292
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,876
and you are a Jew.

293
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,183
You're not athletic.

294
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,199
Run to the end of the
hall and back, I'll time you.

295
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,091
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest
left-handed pitcher of all time.

296
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:51,995
Sandy Koufax is all you Jews
go on about, Sandy Koufax.

297
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,296
And the Holocaust. It gets old.

298
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,700
There are dozens of congenital
conditions that fit our parameters.

299
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,739
We can't spend time
gene-testing for all of them

300
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,750
especially when we're
only guessing it's congenital.

301
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,539
Is a Z-shot offensive
or defensive?

302
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,771
It's both.

303
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,111
You suspected that
was a trick question.

304
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,013
But I could have said neither.

305
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,143
Diabetes makes more sense.

306
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,081
We can narrow the testing
down to 40 likely candidates.

307
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,486
Test for peripheral
nerve damage.

308
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,613
He's got brain damage,

309
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,002
he's likely to have peripheral nerve
damage no matter what the cause.

310
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,393
Yes, that's why we
should not test him for it.

311
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,192
Test the daughter.

312
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,862
Kutner runs the nerve test.

313
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,957
Taub, you may be
right about the diabetes.

314
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,562
Take supper away from our patient
and run a glucose tolerance test.

315
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,732
Oh, and the nurses have
been working so hard,

316
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,537
you can do the
blood draws yourself.

317
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,976
They have to be done
every couple of hours.

318
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,138
You're punishing me

319
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,358
because you're jealous that I'm
spending time with your best friend.

320
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,044
That would be petty.

321
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,747
I'm punishing you because now you've
joined my best friend in lying to me.

322
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,881
Let me know when you're
ready to confess everything.

323
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,959
These can become
either hot or cold.

324
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,833
As soon as it starts to feel
uncomfortable, I want you to tell me.

325
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,782
But you don't think there's
something wrong with me.

326
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,298
No, baby. They're
testing you to help Daddy.

327
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,310
Yes. What you're
doing is very important.

328
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,471
It's like the better you do,

329
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,640
the better we know your dad is.

330
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,483
It's okay.

331
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,718
I'll start with heat.

332
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,363
I know it's not his fault.

333
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,195
I know what he says
is involuntary, but...

334
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,160
It doesn't help.

335
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,167
Inside he's still the same man.

336
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,173
Yeah, that's the problem.

337
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,368
Apparently he's been
thinking this stuff all along.

338
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,904
Whoever that same man is, it's not
the person I thought I was married to.

339
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,444
You okay?

340
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,744
She should be feeling
something by now.

341
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,880
What does that
mean? Is she sick too?

342
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,925
Marika?

343
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,221
Honey?

344
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,768
You're burned, why didn't
you tell me it started to hurt?

345
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,196
I wanted to help Daddy.

346
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,860
You said the better I do,
the better Daddy has to be.

347
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,369
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,866
I'm starving.

349
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,136
It's the only way
we can do the test.

350
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,411
Good thing it's you
and not Dr. Hadley.

351
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,073
Could you keep her away from me?

352
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,707
I have a rich imaginative life.

353
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,944
I'd rather not share it.

354
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,918
We all have thoughts.

355
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,478
I know we all have
sexual thoughts.

356
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,148
We have ignoble thoughts.

357
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,716
I just don't want those
to be who I am to people.

358
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,056
Especially not to my wife.

359
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,427
I understand, I don't think it would be
fair to define me by my passing thoughts.

360
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,194
My real choices are my actions.

361
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,067
And I've never done anything
to hurt her, I've never cheated.

362
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,704
You're kidding me,
you've cheated?

363
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,070
What?

364
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,233
No.

365
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,343
Why would you say that?

366
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,743
Because you look guilty as hell.

367
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,839
Are you serious?

368
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:56,972
Of course you're serious.

369
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,847
Yes, everyone knows.

370
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,513
God, they must
think you're a creep.

371
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,753
They might not know,
they might be idiots.

372
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,292
I just say these things.

373
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,661
Why'd you page me here?

374
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,538
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition.

375
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,205
He seems to be dead.

376
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,302
Why'd you page me here?

377
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,577
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition

378
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,312
while hitting this
against the wall.

379
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,877
This is the only
place we can do both.

380
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,150
I finished the last blood draw.

381
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,524
I expect the people who work
for me to rise to a challenge.

382
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,392
Unless they don't
expect to work for me.

383
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,580
Last blood draw was at 6:00 a.m.

384
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:08,177
His sugar levels never
rose above 120 all night.

385
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,619
So the glucose was normal.

386
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,925
It means you were
wrong about diabetes.

387
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,692
I still think it's the
endocrine system,

388
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,324
maybe I just got
the wrong gland.

389
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,997
You were going for thyroid
instead of pancreas? It makes sense.

390
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,440
Fine! I'm not playing
racquetball with Wilson!

391
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,025
I was never playing
racquetball with Wilson!

392
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,349
I have never played
racquetball with Wilson.

393
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,689
I thought it would be helpful if a
department head owed me a favor,

394
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,726
but it's not worth this.

395
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,556
Not bad. You put on a good show.

396
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,066
You studied up, Wilson
actually booked a court.

397
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,398
If you were really
a racquetball player,

398
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,462
you'd know that you're
holding a squash racquet.

399
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,900
Tell Kutner to do a
thyroid reuptake scan,

400
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,741
then go grab a nap in
one of the on-call rooms.

401
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,273
We're taking you to do
a thyroid reuptake scan.

402
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,623
We think your... I'm not going
anywhere until you explain

403
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,746
why my daughter has
a bandage on her hand.

404
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,721
You just said you
wanted to run some test.

405
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,759
If I'd known it would involve
pain, I'd have said, "Hell no."

406
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,986
It's a mild burn.

407
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,427
Since Marika has a
neurological disability, like you,

408
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,658
we needed to make
sure. She has no disability.

409
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,496
Nick, you know about her
problem with auditory processing.

410
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,365
Auditory processing?

411
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,531
That's code, for "I can't stand
thinking my daughter's not perfect."

412
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,598
The therapist said
Marika's test scores...

413
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,541
Were indeterminate.

414
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,103
She doesn't have a
disability. She daydreams.

415
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,743
She gets below average marks in
school because she's below average.

416
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,515
Every parent thinks their
child is above average.

417
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,701
Nick! Do they have any idea

418
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,189
what the word average means?

419
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,883
Somebody has to be under it.

420
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,324
Nick, shut up!

421
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,194
Honey.

422
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,798
I'm not saying you're stupid.

423
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,431
Your mother's not the
sharpest crayon in the box,

424
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,237
and she does great.

425
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:16,514
See, this is why I told your
mother to keep you at home.

426
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,413
Didn't want you here.

427
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,648
Marika.

428
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,053
Marika, wait.

429
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,147
Get her...

430
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,385
You're burning up.

431
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,989
Your lungs are full of
fluid, we need to get it out.

432
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,861
I need 200 milligrams
of furosemide

433
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,798
and two milligrams
of morphine, stat.

434
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,768
His temperature
is 103. Infection.

435
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,650
The steroids must have
forced it into the open.

436
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,218
What kind of infection?
It could be anything.

437
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,438
Staph aureus,
tuberculosis, strongyloides.

438
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,139
Go back to Phineas
and get a history.

439
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,924
We got a history. He hasn't
been out of the country.

440
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,211
Get a detailed history.

441
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,410
No one at home is sick,
no one at work is sick,

442
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,078
there's no sign of
ticks or mosquitoes.

443
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,781
Get a more detailed history.

444
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,086
Ask him again. And again,
until he remembers something.

445
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,752
Not you. Kutner can do it.

446
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,794
You're going to be busy
with something else.

447
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm here to invite you to lunch.

448
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,969
Why?

449
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:22,046
I've been made. House sent
me back to you as a double agent.

450
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,615
Anything wrong?

451
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,156
Eyes are a little red.

452
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,350
There's a shocker.

453
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,223
I haven't had a good night's
sleep since this thing started.

454
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,922
You should get
some rest yourself.

455
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,260
That's a good idea.

456
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,665
This is going to take some
time, it will be pretty exhaustive.

457
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,795
Are you afraid of what you
might say while I'm here?

458
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,929
Yes.

459
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,407
Are you telling me there's something
worse than what I've already heard?

460
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,809
No, I don't know
what I'm going to say.

461
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,143
I don't know how I'm
going to hurt you next.

462
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:59,174
I think we should be around each
other as little as possible right now.

463
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,886
This is pathetic.

464
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,186
I know.

465
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,652
Tell Marika I love
her very much.

466
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,292
She understands that.

467
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,856
I don't think she does.

468
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,630
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

469
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,500
Yeah.

470
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,956
Guy leads a boring life.

471
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,321
They stay home a lot.

472
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,361
No travel, no exotic pets.
No nearby standing water.

473
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,897
You sound pleased about
something. Can we get to that part?

474
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,195
His wife rescues dogs.

475
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,100
Among others, a big Rottweiler,
who's taken over the house.

476
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,363
Our patient hates it.

477
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,463
Was the wife there
to hear this? No.

478
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,700
Too bad. Keep going.

479
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,470
The dog marks its territory
all over the living room.

480
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,635
I asked what the odds were

481
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,510
that he would've put down food
or drink where the dog could reach.

482
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,300
He said he put a glass
of juice on the floor

483
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,709
while he was
fixing the television.

484
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,049
The dog was fixing
the television? Yes.

485
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,178
Patient's eyes red?

486
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,246
Yeah. I'm thinking Weil's.

487
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,554
Bacterial. You lucked out.

488
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:17,927
Start him on doxycycline. If he
improves, we'll know we were right.

489
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,865
I told Wilson you sent
me to get information.

490
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,528
And now you're telling me.

491
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,437
What does that make
you, a quadruple agent?

492
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,803
He let me print out his e-mails.

493
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,104
Wow. Excellent.

494
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,202
Information he wants us to have.

495
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,723
Did he let you print
out his deleted e-mails?

496
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,771
No.

497
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,010
Go back there... As
long as I was sitting there,

498
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,451
thought I'd print them anyway.
Top one's the one you're looking for.

499
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,884
"I confirm Wednesday
at 7:00 p.m."

500
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,793
It's outgoing to
JGonzalez@NYMercy.net.

501
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,993
There's a Joan Gonzalez
in oncology. It's a consult.

502
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,625
Secret consult at 7:00 p.m.?

503
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,838
Oh, Joan is perky.

504
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,875
You're wrong, there was
a patient file attached.

505
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:03,975
Where?

506
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,306
It was password protected.

507
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,401
No.

508
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,176
Wilson doesn't password
protect his patient files.

509
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,993
I'm the only one he'd
expect ever to look there,

510
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,146
and he knows there's only
one patient I'd want to check on.

511
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,723
You think Wilson's sick?

512
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,759
If Wilson had cancer,

513
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,171
there'd be no reason for him to
drive three hours to Manhattan.

514
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,473
He knows he could pull strings
here to get the best treatment.

515
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,591
Six articles by Gonzalez.

516
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,034
"Managing suicidal
thoughts in oncology patients."

517
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,868
"Suicidal ideation in
children with leukemia."

518
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,430
I don't want to ask this,

519
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,239
but have you ever had reason
to think he might be depressed?

520
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,112
No. Get out of here.

521
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,292
Your fever's down and
your lungs are clearing.

522
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,355
How long before this
brain thing goes away?

523
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,660
Infection's gone.

524
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,192
The damage the infection
did, you'll have to live with.

525
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,197
You telling me
you can't fix this?

526
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,638
There's got to be a way...

527
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,506
We'd need to remove the damaged
area in your cingulate gyrus,

528
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,671
but it's too close to the
brain stem to risk surgery.

529
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,408
You can't risk it?

530
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,572
But I could shop around,

531
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,016
and maybe some better
doctors at a better hospital...

532
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,680
The brain stem controls the
body's involuntary systems.

533
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,350
The slightest
mistake could kill you.

534
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,151
Even if you survive,

535
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,537
you may never be able to breathe
on your own again, you may never...

536
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,086
I get it.

537
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,358
I know this seems like a
lot to deal with right now,

538
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:37,733
but people have adapted to living
with all kinds of neurological deficits.

539
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,204
Hey, at least we can promise
you it won't get any worse.

540
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,435
Get the hell out of my room.

541
00:25:55,287 --> 00:26:00,055
Your assistant said that you were
out of the hospital taking a walk.

542
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,923
Is there an emergency?

543
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,257
I don't know, is there?

544
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:07,856
You never take a walk unless you
got something you need to think about.

545
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,927
Maybe you just don't have a good
statistical sampling of my walks.

546
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:16,407
The other thing you do when you
need to think is you come to my office.

547
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:21,539
Apparently, this is something you can only
discuss with Gonzalez at New York Mercy.

548
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,646
Taub. Another graduate of the
House School of Being a Dick.

549
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,814
Private dick.

550
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,054
Look, I'd love to stay for the full
inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.

551
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,730
Of course you need hot
coffee, it's 45 degrees outside

552
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:46,329
and you left your
coat upstairs. Why?

553
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,374
You're going to tell me
why I forgot my coat?

554
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,377
Once you get outside, the
cold would have reminded you.

555
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,504
Could have gone
back, but you didn't.

556
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,913
You chose to be uncomfortable.

557
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,919
Now why would
someone choose that?

558
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,047
Because they hate themselves?

559
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,468
Has it ever occurred to you that
when I don't share something,

560
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,518
it might not be
meant as a challenge?

561
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,459
It might just mean
that I'd like there to be

562
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:14,625
one molecule of my life that goes
unexamined by Gregory House.

563
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,276
Nick Greenwald. I hear
you're the guy in charge.

564
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,717
I'm the patient with
the disinhibition.

565
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,257
If you're here to say thanks,
you're welcome. Now go away.

566
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,384
I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.

567
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,553
Oh.

568
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,153
All the more reason to go away.

569
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,858
They're talking about
sending me home.

570
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:51,070
To what? A life where I'll continually
drive away anyone who might,

571
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,196
for a second, care about me?

572
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,103
Those are the breaks.

573
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,170
You could operate.

574
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,306
You could die.

575
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,685
So I'm either better or
dead? I'm okay with that.

576
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,696
I've always been kind
of an impatient guy.

577
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,326
But I've worked hard
to keep my mouth shut.

578
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,998
I've made my wife happy.
I've made my little girl happy.

579
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,003
I want that back.

580
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,602
Otherwise, it's no life.

581
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,316
I want you to remove
a small problem.

582
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,124
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

583
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,631
Your boss is. You could assist,

584
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,895
I'm sure you'd like to
add to your resume.

585
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,012
It's too near the brain stem.
Nobody's going to touch it.

586
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,234
Your boss would.
He's an egomaniac.

587
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,935
I know 'cause I keep
seeing him at the club.

588
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,476
He just needs a little push.

589
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:08,810
I'm sure by now you've
kissed his ass sufficiently.

590
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,186
Would you like me to phrase
it as "you're politically gifted"?

591
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,881
I could do that.

592
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,589
You want me to help you?

593
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,327
Tell me why.

594
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,086
Why what?

595
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,256
Why you care?

596
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,831
The puzzle's solved,
the guy's alive.

597
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,564
And the odds of coming out of this surgery
with that same status aren't that great.

598
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:35,574
My patient has a
quality of life issue.

599
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:39,237
He says awful things.
Hardly a medical condition.

600
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,940
When he leaves here,
he's going to lose his family.

601
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,247
He's going to alienate
the people he works with.

602
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,755
And if he ever finds a friend
who's willing to put up with his crap,

603
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,346
he'll be lucky.

604
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,692
Until he drives them away, too.

605
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,934
I'll see what I can do.

606
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,359
You've apparently got this
whole coat thing backwards.

607
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,264
I may have overreacted.

608
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,364
You definitely overreacted.

609
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,302
I knew you'd meet me halfway.

610
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,464
But it made me think.

611
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,374
You only snap on one
subject, losing people.

612
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,279
So I went back to the intel.

613
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,645
It's true there's only one doctor
named Gonzalez at New York Mercy,

614
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:55,051
but there's a Javier Gonzalez
who's a nurse in the psych ward.

615
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,079
Now who could you
lose who'd end up there?

616
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,457
Maybe the reason I don't always
open up to you is because it's redundant.

617
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,154
Daniel Wilson.

618
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,562
Once you've got a name,

619
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,658
it's amazing how much stuff
you can learn on the phone.

620
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,194
I mean, if you're a
doctor and you lie freely.

621
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:17,436
They found your brother sleeping in the
lobby of an office building in Manhattan.

622
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,087
He got aggressive when
they asked him to leave,

623
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,671
and the cops took him
to the Mercy psych ward.

624
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,614
There've been new anti-psychotics
developed since he ran away.

625
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:28,017
He's been on them for a
couple of days. And by tonight,

626
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,078
he should be in
shape to talk to me.

627
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,590
But you're not
sure if he wants to.

628
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,589
I'll be in New York in a few
hours, I guess I'll find out.

629
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,724
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

630
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,289
House, you and I,

631
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,637
we don't have the
normal social contract.

632
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,696
I don't expect you to
tell me the lies that...

633
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,368
I'm fully capable
of lying to you.

634
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,842
I've lied plenty of times.

635
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,243
I mean collaborative lies.

636
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:58,875
Giving someone a hand who maybe
needs to deceive themselves, just a little.

637
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,663
For two days, I've
been thinking about

638
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,451
how Danny's going to
react when he sees me.

639
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,288
If I said that to
anybody else, they'd say,

640
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,521
"Don't worry, it'll
all be all right."

641
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,629
You wouldn't.

642
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,791
Because it might
all go horribly wrong.

643
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,865
Yeah.

644
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,863
Yeah, it might.

645
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:26,542
In which case, you might
want some company.

646
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,510
Your heart's beating.
First hurdle passed.

647
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,819
Now we need to know if
you can breathe for yourself.

648
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,189
Oh, thank God.

649
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,566
Now, do you know who you are?

650
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,268
Nick Greenwald, former S.O.B.

651
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,306
Thank you.

652
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:01,703
Now I can go back to my
beautiful life with my beautiful wife.

653
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,106
Maybe she'll stop whining
and cut me some slack

654
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,413
now that I've risked my life.

655
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,498
It doesn't make sense.
We removed the problem.

656
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,185
We removed the damage. Maybe
we were wrong about the problem.

657
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,284
I need to believe we
can get through this.

658
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,725
Temperature's 94.5.

659
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,424
Do you really think I'm stupid?

660
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:23,593
Honey, you're not stupid,
you're just... Please don't do this.

661
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:24,779
Could be the
effect of the surgery.

662
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,567
Do you at least
respect me, Nick?

663
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,282
What do you think of
what I do for a living?

664
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,572
I think people who
publicize important things

665
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,738
are people who can't do
important things themselves.

666
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,805
Honey, stop. Don't.

667
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,213
Do you regret marrying me?

668
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,376
94.2.

669
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,646
Sometimes.

670
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,550
Everybody wonders.
Get me a heating blanket.

671
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,953
Do you even love me?

672
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,115
Yes.

673
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:46,883
I don't know why.

674
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,017
Aud...

675
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,452
Wait. Let me...

676
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,757
V-tach! Get me the paddles.

677
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,333
Clear.

678
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,867
Echo says his heart
is structurally fine,

679
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,424
but his temperature
is still dropping.

680
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,913
He's headed for hypothermia.

681
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,108
I can't reach House. It
just goes to voicemail.

682
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,460
Means we were
wrong about infection.

683
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,077
His temperature's
just going up and down

684
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,630
because something's
playing with his thermostat.

685
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,384
Which means the brain
damage is spreading.

686
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,117
What causes brain
damage and nosebleed,

687
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,870
and involves the lungs,
heart, and kidneys?

688
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,656
Cancer. We could text him.

689
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,820
It's not cancer.

690
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,263
Normal PSA, normal blood
smear, colonoscopy normal.

691
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,994
Do a full body scan.

692
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,330
House hates full body scans.

693
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,301
House isn't here.
House is right.

694
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,430
Everybody's got three or
four meaningless anomalies

695
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,499
that'll come up on a scan. Chasing
each one will take time we don't have.

696
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,737
Feel free to send him an IM.

697
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,088
You told me you saw your
brother once, after he disappeared.

698
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,026
Thirteen years ago.

699
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,224
I used to go to Princeton
whenever I could.

700
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,926
I must have hit every
homeless shelter in town.

701
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,379
Then one day, I'm just sitting
at this deli having a sandwich,

702
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,771
I look out the window
and there he is.

703
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,604
He was gone by
the time I got outside.

704
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,942
That's why you were so eager, when
I told you there was a job in Princeton.

705
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,481
I thought it was just my charm.

706
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,448
That's the team,
shouldn't you answer?

707
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,818
They've already texted me to
say they're doing something stupid.

708
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,657
Small abdominal aneurysm.

709
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,987
Irrelevant. What else you got?

710
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,721
A cyst in the pleura
around the lungs.

711
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,990
Also irrelevant. Couldn't
cause any of the symptoms.

712
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,463
There's a density in the liver,

713
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,295
could be a vascular
malformation.

714
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,112
If he's got multiple AVMs, screwed
up blood flow would explain everything.

715
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,071
We can only spot
them with angiography.

716
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,816
We'll have to do targeted scans with
contrast, and then embolize each one.

717
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,172
Can we do that
before he freezes?

718
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,767
We'll find out.

719
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,541
The spell-correct on Kutner's
phone has got a hair-trigger.

720
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,381
Either that, or the
patient has a "cyclone"

721
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,921
in the "floral" of his lungs.

722
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:36,250
You took a walk in 45-degree
weather and you left your coat behind.

723
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,488
Go ahead.

724
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,557
I think you were
punishing yourself.

725
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,646
I think you wanted to feel what
it would be like to be homeless

726
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,502
in a New Jersey winter.

727
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,007
That tells me guilt.

728
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,270
That tells me
something happened.

729
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,478
The schizophrenia started
when he was a teenager.

730
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,884
When he was in college,

731
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,421
he was on meds,

732
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,754
but he'd still think a professor was
out to get him because he got a B,

733
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,003
or he would fight with his roommates
because he never showered.

734
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,188
Where were you?

735
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,354
Med school.

736
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:17,529
He called me every
day, talked for hours.

737
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,604
I didn't have hours.

738
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:20,900
Interesting.

739
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,834
Later for that. Go on.

740
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,469
I was tired of being the guy
that everybody counted on.

741
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,673
So one night Danny called...

742
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,443
One night Danny called,
crying, upset about something.

743
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,853
I had to study for an
exam. So I hung up.

744
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,338
Took my things, I went to the library where
I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.

745
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,193
I wonder how that turned out.

746
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,508
My mother called
me the next day,

747
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,763
Danny had run away
and left his meds behind.

748
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:55,273
Which I knew meant that he would
never be able to choose to come back,

749
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,935
because he'd be so
detached from reality.

750
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,579
So you made your one effort
to live a normal, selfish life,

751
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,981
and the universe immediately
smacked you down.

752
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,612
And because we're wired to find
meaning in semi-random events,

753
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,714
you decided never to
be that careless again.

754
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,084
You don't think
that's a little facile?

755
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:20,155
Actually, I don't. I think
you did it consciously.

756
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,793
You developed your
people pleasing talents

757
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:27,134
the way an Olympic
athlete develops his muscles.

758
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,140
Talk about an overreaction
to a single event.

759
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,176
It was a pretty big event.

760
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,509
Hanging up the phone? That's
what you're blaming all this on.

761
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,777
That's the behavior you've
been trying to correct.

762
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,945
As though nothing else went
wrong in your brother's life.

763
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,615
Of course he
overreacted, too, but...

764
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,093
His glucose was normal.

765
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,292
We're not talking about my
brother anymore, are we?

766
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:01,530
It's House. AVMs don't
explain his glucose.

767
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,905
Since this is a significant
moment in my life and all, I'll...

768
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,136
Yeah.

769
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,411
I think I'll just go in and...

770
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,504
Explain that.

771
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,809
Right.

772
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,380
We'd given him steroids. His
glucose should have been elevated.

773
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,751
That wannabe cyst you
found in the whole body scan,

774
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,616
<i>without the glucose,
it's an irrelevant cyst,</i>

775
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,126
with the glucose,
it's a relevant fibroma.

776
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,094
He has Doege-Potter Syndrome.

777
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,063
His fibroma is secreting
human growth hormone

778
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,725
which acts like insulin,
lowering his glucose.

779
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,360
That doesn't explain the
organ failure, the brain damage.

780
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,838
This whole thing
is an overreaction.

781
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:38,274
That one small
fibroma, it's benign,

782
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,608
but his body's acting
like it's an invader.

783
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,807
<i>His antibodies went to war
against it and got carried away,</i>

784
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,909
attacked his other systems.
Take out the fibroma,

785
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,954
he'll be a happy
hypocrite again in no time.

786
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,055
Maybe I should call a cab.

787
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,031
Your wife's probably just late.

788
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,260
Yeah.

789
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,606
I'm sorry about,

790
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,708
you know, things I said.

791
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,677
I have a conspicuous nose.

792
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,479
It suits your face.

793
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,885
I'm sorry I'm late.

794
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,889
Traffic.

795
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,227
I have some good news.

796
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,238
I was going to tell you,
and then you got sick,

797
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,740
it didn't seem
like the best time.

798
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,069
I've been offered
a better position.

799
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,842
I'd be coordinating cancer
awareness walks in three cities.

800
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,441
That's great. Congratulations.

801
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,646
I know you've
worked hard for this.

802
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,086
Thank you.

803
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,819
Is Marika okay?

804
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,821
I'm sure she's moved on.

805
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,736
Kids are so resilient.

806
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,821
You okay?

807
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,357
I'll be seeing Danny
again next week.

808
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,388
I'd like you to meet him.

809
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,627
Sure.

810
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,396
Sounds interesting.

811
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,333
Go on.

812
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,341
I thought seeing him again
would change everything.

813
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:53,606
It'd be wonderful
or terrible. Instead...

814
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,048
We're just strangers.
It's kind of anticlimactic.

815
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,449
Which is better than terrible.

816
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,255
Go on.

817
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,521
Does it bother you that
we have no social contract?

818
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,960
My whole life is
one big compromise.

819
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,367
I tiptoe around everyone
like they're made of china.

820
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,928
I spend all my time analyzing.

821
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,565
"What will the effect
be if I say this?"

822
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,270
And then there's you.
You're a reality junkie.

823
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,278
If I offered you
a comforting lie,

824
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,439
you'd smack me
over the head with it.

825
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:31,346
Let's not change that.

826
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,444
Okay.

827
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,781
No. See, this...

828
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:40,515
If you were implementing a
social contract, you'd say that,

829
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,926
but only because it
makes me feel better.

830
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:49,892
It's kind of fun watching
you torture yourself.

831
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,861
Do you think things will
work out with my brother?

832
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,029
No.

833
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,838
But when it does go
wrong, it won't be your fault.

834
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,169
Thanks, House.

835
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,547
You do actually
like monster trucks?

836
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,015
Absolutely.
