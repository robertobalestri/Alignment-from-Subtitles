1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:07,003
The risotto isn't bad, but it's not
what Chef Zane did back at Fortunato.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,235
He replaced the rosemary
with saffron, for one thing.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,904
And what is this stock?
Did he get it out of a can?

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,273
My fish isn't bad.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:19,252
But it's not great either, I'm sure.
I warned you against the snapper.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,423
Do you think it'll calm down?

7
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,123
God. I hope so.

8
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,358
That guy is a bit of a
blowhard, though, isn't he?

9
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,664
The food's not spicy at
all, you can barely taste it.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,706
Mine's pretty spicy. Try it.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,935
I don't taste anything.

12
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,412
Have you been
throwing rolls at me?

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,017
It wasn't me.

14
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,518
Really, he didn't.

15
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,181
I'm so sorry someone would
choose to behave that way. Really, I...

16
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,326
I'm so sorry. Really,
really, really sorry.

17
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,694
No, no, no, no. I swear, I...

18
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,896
It's not me.

19
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,994
A bloody tear could just mean
subconjunctival hemorrhage.

20
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,296
He sneezed too hard from a
cold, which caused his lack of taste.

21
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,166
House isn't going to care.

22
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,002
Does "black tie optional" really mean black
tie, 'cause I don't want to rent if...

23
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,627
There's been a glitch
with the wedding.

24
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,577
And House will be interested.

25
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,644
A "glitch"?

26
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,374
Patient had his
corpus callosum cut

27
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,524
to correct a seizure issue.

28
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,548
A "glitch"?

29
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,136
The seizures stopped
after the surgery.

30
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,312
But he's having trouble
adjusting to a split brain.

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,355
A "glitch"?

32
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:12,017
This is Dr. Taub. Tell
him about shopping.

33
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,790
I go into a grocery store,
everything seems normal.

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,594
I get to the checkout, and there's
all these extra items in my cart.

35
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,363
Stuff I didn't put
there. Stuff I hate.

36
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,370
My left hand hates me.

37
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,676
Yeah. I think
House'll be interested.

38
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,014
Just warning you.
I'm in a good mood

39
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,023
and largely pain-free, so I've
got no idea how things are...

40
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,218
Alien hand syndrome.

41
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,057
Set off by a stroke, or is
there a pony in the backyard?

42
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,224
Split brain. Right hemisphere
controls the left, and...

43
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,997
It's making life miserable.
Non-logical thinkers often do.

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,665
The current issue isn't the split
brain. The surgery corrected...

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,983
You're dissing the
right hemisphere?

46
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,986
Most people who have this operation
don't even notice they're missing anything.

47
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,377
The left brain has language,
arithmetic, rationality,

48
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
and right brain is a mute loser.

49
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,977
The right brain is more aesthetically
oriented, has greater facial recognition.

50
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,628
I couldn't have been a
plastic surgeon without it.

51
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,712
Yes, and where
would junior high be

52
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,699
without our ability to
judge people on aesthetics?

53
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,735
Right brain's also more
aware of the present moment,

54
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,352
our place in the universe.

55
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,694
It's a universal daisy chain of peace
and love that throws buns at people.

56
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,667
His present symptoms could
mean autoimmune disease,

57
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,829
a nasolacrimal tumor,
an infection or just a cold.

58
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:35,569
Good morning, sunshine. We got
a brand new toy, you want to play?

59
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,075
We need to talk.

60
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,604
Great. I love euphemisms.

61
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,741
By "euphemism," I mean when you
say something but mean something else.

62
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,217
Begin eliminating.
Search the home.

63
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,861
Isn't that locking the barn door
after the horse has put his face

64
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,194
between your breasts
for an hour and a half?

65
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,725
I'm your boss.
You're an employee.

66
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,638
I'm not normally into
role-playing, but if you want to...

67
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,937
People who get close to
you get hurt. That's a fact.

68
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,741
You're also a valued doctor in
this hospital. That's another fact.

69
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,478
From now on, we're going
to focus on the second fact.

70
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,320
So, this isn't you freaking
out over last night?

71
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:26,189
This isn't an emotional decision.
I'm just giving you the rules.

72
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,125
You can either
accept them or leave.

73
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,215
I slept with Cuddy.

74
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,880
After she helped me
detox from Vicodin.

75
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,891
I've been clean for
almost 24 hours now.

76
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,427
Okay. Thought I'd mention it.

77
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,827
Wow.

78
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,625
Wow.

79
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,469
One for each.

80
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,096
That's what she said. Ah!

81
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,401
How's the pain?

82
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,964
She's probably
got some bruising.

83
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,671
Yeah, I get it, you're a
stud. This is serious, House.

84
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,905
I feel better than I
did four hours ago.

85
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,862
Four hours from now,
I'll feel better than this.

86
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,114
The other "wow." You
were sober? She was sober?

87
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,816
Clean and sober and hot.

88
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:34,317
Wow. This is fantastic. How
are you gonna screw it up?

89
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,623
Several good options.

90
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,774
Unfortunately, I don't think
she's gonna give me the pleasure.

91
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,857
She left before I woke up

92
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,834
and five minutes ago, she told
me that I'm just an employee.

93
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,631
Ha. Yes.

94
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:49,005
Well, either she's actually
in love with you and scared,

95
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,511
or she realized last night
was a gigantic mistake.

96
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,808
You were needy and
vulnerable, she was maternal.

97
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,259
You think she
jumped me out of pity?

98
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:02,223
No, I'm saying whatever is
going on, you need to talk to her.

99
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,813
Absolutely.

100
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,525
Does our patient
freak you out a little?

101
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,687
No.

102
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,965
If he's two people, then we're all
two people and we just don't know it.

103
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,799
And what does that
say about identity?

104
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,968
It says we're making it up as
we go along, which I find freeing.

105
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,640
Wow, I haven't been in a bathroom
this size since my dorm in med school.

106
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,581
Is that fungus?

107
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,242
It's from the steam buildup.

108
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,686
What do you think of this "glitch"
with Chase and Cameron's wedding?

109
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,853
It's always a sad thing when
sperm comes between people.

110
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,393
I hear the sperm
is very good today.

111
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,264
I mean, the salmon.

112
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,101
Go away. No other tables.

113
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,242
You'd let your wife keep
another man's offspring on ice

114
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,376
next to the frozen
peas, just in case?

115
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,920
That's what this is about.

116
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,718
She's not ready to commit to
me. She's planning for failure.

117
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,693
Did you know that male fruit flies
have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid

118
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,923
that inhibit the
sperm of other males?

119
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,270
Wilson says we need to talk.

120
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,969
We talked. I agree.

121
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,114
This has clearly gone
past the talking stage.

122
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,048
What?

123
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,493
Hey. Great, did you find my MP3?

124
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:53,090
Not yet. But I got your shaving
stuff, toothpaste, deodorant,

125
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:57,228
some magazines, and this
cactus from your window.

126
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,967
You didn't have to do that. Really,
the hospital supplies all that stuff.

127
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,169
I'm still trying too hard, huh? Trying
to get your other half to like me.

128
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,840
No, no, no. Don't say that, okay?
I like you, which means that...

129
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,205
We shouldn't read into that.

130
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,777
Anti-fungal meds.

131
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,647
Ordinarily we'd
put them in your IV,

132
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,784
but since your right brain
doesn't seem too fond of IVs...

133
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,540
You should be feeling
better in a few days.

134
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,858
I have to get back to work.

135
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,161
Rick says your shift will be
waiting for you when you get back.

136
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,496
Thanks.

137
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,673
Oh, my God. I'm
sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

138
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,135
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,020
I have to go. I have to get
back to work. No, no, no...

140
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,775
Babe, wait. Hold on.
No, no. It wasn't me...

141
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,474
I can't walk.

142
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,734
Well, obviously it
wasn't the fungus.

143
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,952
And it's not a coordination issue.
Dehydration can cause loss of balance.

144
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,119
We haven't had him on IV.

145
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,028
No. Good skin
turgor, not orthostatic.

146
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,622
Could be our tax
dollars at work,

147
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,897
constantly building new
roadways and bridges.

148
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,028
Meningioma. Slow-growing.

149
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,006
It could extend along the
sub-osteal layer of the cranial cavity,

150
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,167
and be hidden by the bone.

151
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,404
The cancer cells are actually
re-growing a connection

152
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,173
between the left and
right hemispheres.

153
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,846
If you're right, the two halves have
begun sending messages again,

154
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,248
but it's too early in the
process for him to pick up on it.

155
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,513
But we can test for it.

156
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,987
Proof.

157
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,362
You didn't talk to her, did you?

158
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,060
If I'd talked, she'd
have lied, I'd have lied,

159
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,829
and though two
negatives make a positive,

160
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,736
I thought thermal-imaging
photos seemed simpler.

161
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,172
Note how many more heated areas
appear after less than a minute with me.

162
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,178
So it's either love,
or possibly rage.

163
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,543
Don't talk to her.

164
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,172
I have no plans to talk to her.

165
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,114
Manipulation is in
your genetic code.

166
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,994
You think I'm making a
mistake, you move in to correct.

167
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,042
You are making a mistake.

168
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,451
She lied to me.

169
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,899
Either last night or today. I
need to find out which and why.

170
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,586
And clearly, thermal
imaging is the way.

171
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,888
This isn't a case. You're
not looking for a diagnosis.

172
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:06,922
If this matters at all to you, please,
for once in your life, be an adult.

173
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,597
<i>Keep your eyes
focused on the plus sign.</i>

174
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,233
<i>Any image that appears on your far
right will only be seen by your left brain,</i>

175
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,474
<i>and any image on your far left
will only be seen by your right brain.</i>

176
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
Okay.

177
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,310
<i>Just start by saying the words.</i>

178
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:30,885
Book, giraffe,
willow, fortunate.

179
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,793
<i>You're not saying the word.</i>

180
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,423
I didn't see a word.

181
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,103
<i>Could you draw a picture of
what you think the word might be?</i>

182
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,573
Look, I didn't see...

183
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,342
Candle.

184
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,583
This is so cool.

185
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,482
Yeah, that's not freaky at all.

186
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,079
No communication.

187
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,089
So far.

188
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,598
<i>Scott, why are you standing?</i>

189
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,784
I'm a little chilly. I thought I'd get a
sweater or something from my room.

190
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,808
Is that okay?

191
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,138
<i>Just a few more minutes.</i>

192
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,940
And that, ladies and
gentlemen, is the left hemisphere.

193
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,815
The side that's obsessed
with finding answers,

194
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,964
the one that needs things to
make sense, the interpreter.

195
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,958
That's where we tell the story of
who we are and why we do things.

196
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,788
That's also the
side that was wrong.

197
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,055
The right brain's advantage
is that it isn't logical,

198
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,130
it doesn't choose
which details to look at.

199
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:49,033
It makes connections you could never see.
You owe your insight to the "mute loser."

200
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,831
I'll send it tickets
to a Phillies game.

201
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,806
Confabulation means no
communication. Means your theory's wrong.

202
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,171
But he is cold.

203
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,181
Why are you scratching?

204
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,418
It itches.

205
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,084
Ammonia breath.

206
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,368
Your liver is failing.

207
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:30,401
I know for them to approve this price,
they'll need statistical documentation...

208
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,411
What? Why are you looking at me?

209
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,777
When you first walked in,
I was under the impression

210
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:38,010
you wanted to say
something else.

211
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,114
Nope. About House and me.

212
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,886
There's nothing to talk about.

213
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,092
I want permission
to do a liver biopsy.

214
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,133
We're looking for sarcoidosis.

215
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,428
Fine.

216
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,166
What do you mean, "Fine"?

217
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,516
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

218
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,564
Do you mean that because
a liver biopsy is not a test

219
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,372
that by any stretch of the
imagination could be considered risky,

220
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,709
so asking my permission is
essentially wasting my time,

221
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,749
and you're wondering what
my reaction to that will be?

222
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:10,875
Yes.

223
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,061
Are you trying to make me angry?

224
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,109
Yes.

225
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,484
Do your biopsy. And
also, do your clinic hours.

226
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,920
I'm blowing off my clinic hours.

227
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,252
Really?

228
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,088
Let's see how that goes.

229
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,055
Still not angry.
Try again later.

230
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,575
Sorry. I know I'm a little ripe.

231
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,672
Just a sweaty guy. Recently?

232
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,011
Always.

233
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,615
With a crazy left hand. Sometimes
I fantasize about cutting it off.

234
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,127
Just a fantasy. It's the
hand that's crazy, not me.

235
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,457
What?

236
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,730
If it doesn't like an ultrasound wand,
how's it gonna react to a needle?

237
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,405
Can you get music
into this room?

238
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,209
I think you're using your relationship
with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs.

239
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,370
You should be in more
pain so soon into detoxing,

240
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,005
but your body's full of
romantic endorphins,

241
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,645
and on top of that, you create
this distraction of looking for proof.

242
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,212
You think I should stop
and let the pain flood back?

243
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,052
Cuddy is not a
Vicodin substitute.

244
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,148
Quite the opposite.

245
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,218
You have to wait
for her to be ready.

246
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,230
Great advice. You pretend
that I'm going to do that.

247
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,527
You've made two major
changes in your life,

248
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,535
not a time anyone's
judgment is at its best.

249
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,232
Didn't you used to argue that my
judgment would be better off drugs?

250
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,036
Admit it. You're curious
why I want to make her angry.

251
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,340
I'm sure it's convoluted,
wrong and stupid.

252
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,006
You're dying to know what
I found on her coffee cup.

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,174
No, because... Oxytocin.

254
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,618
Oxytocin, the chemical
involved in emotional bonding.

255
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,720
Her lips say "no," her hormones
say "Oh, my God, yes, more."

256
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,266
No. For you to know
her levels were elevated,

257
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,911
you'd need a baseline
to compare them with.

258
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,236
I paid the guy in the gym to retrieve
one of her water bottles from the trash.

259
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,775
Love inspires us to greatness.

260
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,208
So I need to make
her lose her temper,

261
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,689
which breaks her delusion, which
demonstrates to me, and to her,

262
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,773
that there is something
underneath this facade.

263
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,906
And then what happens?

264
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,145
She admits everything
and falls into your arms?

265
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:30,053
That's outcome one.
Outcome two is she kills me.

266
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,455
I think it's 50-50 right now.

267
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,156
Great.

268
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,627
I thought you'd say that.

269
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,927
You're committing yourself
to something. To someone.

270
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,437
I mean, it's childish in a
way, but ultimately great.

271
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,298
Assuming... Are you absolutely
sure you want this to succeed?

272
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,308
Why is an old guy
standing in my doorway?

273
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,176
Eugene Schwartz.

274
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,776
Eugene Schwartz.

275
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,649
Dr. Cuddy asked me to
come up here from the clinic.

276
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,019
She says you're seeing
patients in your office.

277
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,490
It's still free,
though, isn't it?

278
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,618
She sent him. That's
gotta mean something.

279
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,959
I'll go get my decoder ring.

280
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,034
I squawk. Like a parrot.

281
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,865
No, that's not it. It
started a few months ago.

282
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,969
I was doing some woodworking in
my garage. I was trying to make a chair.

283
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,509
Was it the chair?

284
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,880
Anyway, all of a
sudden, from nowhere,

285
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,113
this strange noise comes
bursting out of my mouth.

286
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,153
Tough to fake that.

287
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,661
Nice pants.

288
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:48,860
My wife Mona thinks I'm busting
her chops. It's ruining my marriage.

289
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,027
Where are we going?

290
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,470
So your left hand would rather play
air guitar than give me a hard time?

291
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,807
It'd rather play air guitar
than tie shoes, eat dinner...

292
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,143
Your right hand's playing, too.

293
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,045
I don't want to discourage it.

294
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,756
Splinter hemorrhages
under his fingernails.

295
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,224
What's that...

296
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,088
BP and O2 sat are dropping.

297
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,826
We need a bag of
B-negative in here!

298
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,859
So much for sarcoidosis.

299
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,100
Points to a clotting issue. Clots
would explain all his symptoms.

300
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,902
Why aren't we in the office?

301
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,967
I'm tired of clinic duty.

302
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,275
There's only one thing that
could cause squawking, right?

303
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,439
Yeah.

304
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,225
We gave him heparin
and did an echo of his heart

305
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,527
to see if it was
throwing clots, but...

306
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,712
More air guitar?

307
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,878
The heart's fine.

308
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,253
We wanted to test for Factor
V Leiden, Protein C, Protein S,

309
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,782
but the hand got tired of cooperating.
We finally knocked him out.

310
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,538
And all those tests
came up negative anyway,

311
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,157
or you'd have opened by
telling me your brilliant diagnosis.

312
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,732
He apologized for being sweaty,

313
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,428
said it had always been an
issue. But what if it's a symptom?

314
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,439
There are cancers that cause night
sweats and can lead to clots. Lymphoma.

315
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,441
Or pancreatic cancer.

316
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,340
Go scan his pancreas.

317
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,343
And try Led Zeppelin.

318
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:15,143
We've always remembered what this hospital
did for Leo when his appendix burst.

319
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,587
Still, a check this size...

320
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,419
Sorry to interrupt,
here's my poo.

321
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,523
Dr. House said to bring it over and
leave it with you as soon as I could.

322
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,601
I don't know if you people
have an official term for it.

323
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,660
Stool sample. Ah, yes.

324
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,204
Thank you. I'll take care of it.

325
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:36,537
It's hard to rush these things.
Even if you've eaten a lot of broccoli.

326
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,846
Where are you going?

327
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,476
Annie called. She's
not coming back.

328
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,695
This is not the best time...

329
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,120
Look, you said the heparin
would keep new clots from forming.

330
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,214
Maybe. But something's
obviously causing the clots.

331
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,401
If you have pancreatic cancer...

332
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,625
We're not trying to scare you,

333
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,958
but even in its early
stages, the fatality rate...

334
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,028
You walk out of here...

335
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,291
Stop!

336
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,032
Look, I'd ask you to
put yourself in my place,

337
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,628
but nobody can put
themselves in my place.

338
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,473
Did she find somebody new? Was
I not being attentive enough? No.

339
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,308
She's just tired of
being insulted by a limb.

340
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:21,043
She said that my feelings toward her
were mixed. Well, my feelings aren't mixed.

341
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,217
You're not going anywhere.

342
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,554
Unless you want to go naked.

343
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,155
Your right brain
knows you need to stay.

344
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,389
My right brain's an ass.

345
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,194
Got a minute?

346
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,172
There's something
wrong with this cup.

347
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,582
I need someone to bounce ideas
off of. Someone to be my whiteboard.

348
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,169
That's how you
taught me to work.

349
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,680
I have three choices.

350
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,946
First, I can accept it's over, pretend
we don't work in the same hospital,

351
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,112
have selective visual impairment
when we pass each other in the hall.

352
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,951
Second, I can accept
it's over and leave.

353
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,253
Or you could try
making him angry.

354
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,020
Standard choice number three.

355
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,528
Third, I can talk to him.

356
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,397
But it's not like I have any
new facts I can present,

357
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,698
and Chase has this romantic view
of love that reality can't compete with.

358
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,339
I know how you could succeed.

359
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,429
How?

360
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,201
Just say the magic words, "I
will destroy my husband's sperm."

361
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,048
You mean, succeed without
doing that? Probably not.

362
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,247
I have doubts. Normal doubts.

363
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,681
It's not wrong to prepare for bad things to
happen, even if you don't expect them to.

364
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,991
I don't expect my condo to burn
down, but I have fire insurance.

365
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:41,334
Patient's girlfriend left him,
now he wants to leave us.

366
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:50,132
If your condo rules don't let you
buy insurance, do you go homeless?

367
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,273
His room is this way.

368
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,144
What? You think I can fix this?

369
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,160
We need to offer this guy
something he can only get

370
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,847
if he stays in the hospital.
Relationship counseling.

371
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:01,997
I don't know if
his girlfriend is...

372
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,512
I mean his two hemispheres.

373
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,956
That's the breakfast of relationships,
the most important one of the day.

374
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,291
We need your special skills.

375
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,158
Is the guy out there?

376
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,498
The guy that's gonna
make my right brain work?

377
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,731
Oh, for...

378
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,809
What do you think
your right brain wants?

379
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,812
<i>How should I know? It's crazy,
it does things I would never do.</i>

380
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:31,010
Duct of Wirsung slightly enlarged,
but within normal parameters.

381
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,114
Say something.

382
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,417
<i>It's mute. It can't
communicate with you.</i>

383
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,481
<i>Maybe you should try
communicating with it.</i>

384
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,458
"Talk to her." The
well isn't deep, is it?

385
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,498
You're the dominant half,
you make all the decisions.

386
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:51,026
The right side has no control
over anything. It must be frustrating.

387
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,071
No masses in body
or tail segments.

388
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,471
<i>I can't communicate
with it, that's the whole...</i>

389
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,306
When you decide to go and
get groceries, what do you do?

390
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,655
<i>What do you mean? I put on
my jacket and I go to the store.</i>

391
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,147
Your right brain has no idea

392
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,226
why you're suddenly getting
up and putting on your jacket.

393
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,244
It just gets dragged along.
Next time, try saying it out loud.

394
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,050
<i>Just say to the empty air,</i>

395
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:14,217
<i>"Hey, I think I'll go to the store
because we're out of peanut butter"?</i>

396
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,904
<i>How much did they teach
you about people like me</i>

397
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,590
<i>when you were learning
to be a therapist?</i>

398
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,426
I'm an oncologist.

399
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,229
Your right brain likes what he's
saying. Hasn't moved the entire scan.

400
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:29,036
Hasn't gotten us anything, though.
Scan's clean. It's not pancreatic cancer.

401
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,704
Clotting could be a problem
well before a solid tumor forms.

402
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,007
It could still be pancreatic.

403
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,049
Yes, but if you want a diagnosis
backed by actual evidence,

404
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,914
we should probably
look at other cancers.

405
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,010
House. I just squawked!

406
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,418
What? <i>Eugene Schwartz.</i>

407
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,081
Your patient from
yesterday. I just squawked!

408
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,922
I was buying some flowers for Mona. It
happened when I was paying the clerk.

409
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,860
I assume Dr. Cuddy
gave you this number.

410
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,765
Yes. She told me to call you
any time I squawked, day or night.

411
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,392
I'm sorry, but I'm
about to lose you,

412
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,700
because I'm about to drive into a
tunnel in a canyon on an airplane

413
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,570
while hanging up the phone.

414
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,085
I might be getting some more
phone calls, so let's make it fast.

415
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,109
Lymphoma.

416
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,372
That's right, pancreatic.

417
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,539
I know it's pancreatic. I
know there's evidence.

418
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,083
I know we've
seen it. I just can't...

419
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,982
Right brain/left brain issues?

420
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,250
If the cancer's too small
to find, let's make it easier.

421
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,814
Let's open him up and paint it.

422
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,554
There's a new procedure using
scorpion toxin and infrared paint.

423
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,240
The paint only works on the cancer
cells, makes them easier to spot.

424
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,392
Just agitating the
pancreas can cause clotting,

425
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,765
and you want to do it to a
guy whose problem is clotting?

426
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,770
If I'm right about
pancreatic cancer,

427
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,069
the only chance he's got is finding
and removing those cancer cells now.

428
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,269
His brain MRI showed narrowing in the
blood vessels leading up from the neck.

429
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,575
If we do shake something
loose, we could kill him.

430
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,841
Or one of him.

431
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:46,510
A clot in his brain could kill one
of them without affecting the other.

432
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,515
He might actually
be okay with that.

433
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,838
How long is it going to take?

434
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,764
Assuming he doesn't
crash, a few minutes.

435
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,339
Hey, you and
Cameron... I'm sorry.

436
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,782
I'll be right back.

437
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,552
I don't want to be homeless.

438
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,631
Okay. You can stay in the
condo. I'll find some other...

439
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,291
That's not what I mean.

440
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,996
I want to marry you. I got
the forms to destroy the sperm.

441
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,539
You sure?

442
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,370
Yeah.

443
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,981
I want to hug you, but
then I'd have to re-scrub.

444
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,243
I know.

445
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,879
BP is dropping.

446
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,479
Go.

447
00:25:56,822 --> 00:26:00,224
No sign of cancer.
BP is 90 over 60.

448
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,632
You never answered my question.

449
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:14,701
Relax. Our friendship
is not doomed.

450
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,073
Thank God. But my question
was, do you really want Cuddy,

451
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,669
or is this just
another challenge?

452
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,908
You're worried that
once I'm in a relationship,

453
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,039
you and me will be over.

454
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,676
Hey, I'm actually for
this. I think this is great.

455
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:32,555
But if you're serious, and you don't
treat it seriously, then you will get hurt.

456
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,789
And if you don't accept that,
then accept that she will get hurt.

457
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,412
I was told it was your birthday.

458
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,460
I understand.

459
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,096
So, so sorry.

460
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,239
I know.

461
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,086
Clearly, there was a mix-up.

462
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,442
Have a nice day.

463
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:57,909
Does she look angry?

464
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,384
If you're standing there
when she looks up here...

465
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,787
Oh, no.

466
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,221
Systolic's 80.

467
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,940
Gotta finish this suture
before I can get out.

468
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,023
Give him a dopamine drip.

469
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,226
<i>We weren't looking
up at the right time.</i>

470
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,132
Get to your point.
We're a little busy here.

471
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:20,070
<i>The clots aren't from cancer.
They're coming from his heart.</i>

472
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,664
We echoed the heart. No clots.

473
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,572
<i>Not while we were looking.
Didn't I open with that?</i>

474
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,271
<i>The clots were caused
by an arrhythmia.</i>

475
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,345
No arrhythmia.

476
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,278
<i>Not while we were looking.</i>

477
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,941
<i>Intermittent arrhythmia.</i>

478
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,611
<i>This guy pulls our equipment
off at the slightest provocation.</i>

479
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,830
<i>We'd have to be watching at
the exact moment it happened,</i>

480
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,766
<i>which I'm guessing, given the way
you two are scrambling around like idiots,</i>

481
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,281
<i>is right now.</i>

482
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,627
<i>Yes, I'm saying do a
transesophageal echo.</i>

483
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,924
We have to get his BP stable.

484
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,466
<i>Absolutely. Right
after the echo.</i>

485
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,264
Systolic's 70.

486
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,868
<i>The heart looked
healthy at the last echo.</i>

487
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,464
<i>And an arrhythmia wouldn't
cause clots in a healthy ventricle,</i>

488
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,875
<i>so start with the
left atrial appendage.</i>

489
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:04,982
Wow.

490
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,645
<i>Yep, I did it again.</i>

491
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:11,486
<i>Now get this poor guy's BP under
control and seal off the appendage.</i>

492
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:14,618
<i>And then all we have to do is
find out what damaged his heart</i>

493
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,060
<i>before it goes after
something he really needs.</i>

494
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,870
So what damages a healthy 20-year-old
heart enough to make it send out clots

495
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,700
like it's bombing Dresden?

496
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:27,805
Rhabdo.

497
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,273
Would've fried his kidneys, too.

498
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,341
What about Graves'?

499
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,344
Thyroid function
tests were normal.

500
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,472
Cushing's. Cortisol overproduction
could interfere with heart rhythm.

501
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,279
Run a dexamethasone
suppression test.

502
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,026
Annie.

503
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,795
You hit me.

504
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,329
I know. I'm so sorry.
But it wasn't me.

505
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,367
I know you would never have done that
if you were in control of yourself, but...

506
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,346
But you came back.

507
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,473
To talk with your doctors.

508
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,711
I've been going over
and over what happened.

509
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,515
And I had this
thought, out of nowhere.

510
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,250
Ever since I've known Scott,
I've seen his left hand throw things,

511
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,725
but always sort of
playfully, thinking it's fun.

512
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:26,162
But when he threw
this, it was angry.

513
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,692
And that's when his hand slapped
me, too, when I brought it to him.

514
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,964
Could it mean something?

515
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,403
Deodorant shouldn't...

516
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,497
How often do you use it?

517
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,575
A few times a day. It's
special, heavy-duty stuff.

518
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,043
I have to send away for it.

519
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,707
Sprayed around a bathroom
the size of a shoebox.

520
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,875
I'll check the ingredients
from the manufacturer.

521
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,011
I'll check for any references
associated with health issues.

522
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,624
Somebody's grateful.

523
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,563
We'll just leave the
three of you alone.

524
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,973
Why is there no
lipstick on this cup?

525
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,480
Cuddy was wearing lipstick
when she drank from it.

526
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,880
It was on my face.
Why isn't it on the cup?

527
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,786
Why is it always reasonable, in
Houseland, to take an emotional problem

528
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,053
and sidestep it by turning it
into a mechanical problem?

529
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,289
Because, in Houseland, and the
rest of the universe, by the way,

530
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,921
when a question presents
itself, it calls for an answer.

531
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,435
If the left brain is the
interpreter of reality

532
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:42,304
and the one that tells us the story of
who we are, then what is your story?

533
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,672
Do you want to be the
man with the answers?

534
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,678
Or do you want to be
the man with Cuddy?

535
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,488
What do I do?

536
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,959
You make her angry.

537
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,972
Do you really think that was
the best time to mock me?

538
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:08,330
I'm as surprised as you,
but I think I'm serious.

539
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,459
Communication can't
start unless you're both...

540
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,879
I've been trying to
make her angry for...

541
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,337
No, you haven't.

542
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:18,376
Come on. Poo? Strippers? It's routine
stuff. You've been pulling your punches.

543
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,638
You're scared.

544
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,009
You should be.

545
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,078
Now go terrorize her.

546
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,960
You don't want to
destroy it, do you?

547
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,594
I said I was gonna
do it, I'll do it.

548
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,605
But you don't want to.

549
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,336
I want to be with you. Maybe
I'm not comfortable with it, but...

550
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:57,678
Let's say it's our fifth anniversary.
Are you ready to destroy it now?

551
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,684
Tenth. Three kids.

552
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,978
They spend their summers in
Melbourne and have annoying accents.

553
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,718
It's disgusting how happy
we are. You ready now?

554
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,292
You don't have doubts.

555
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,504
You just don't want to kill the only
thing left of someone you loved.

556
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,382
Don't do it.

557
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,047
I do have trouble
giving things up.

558
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:40,550
For example, I never cancelled
any of our wedding plans.

559
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,203
Attention! I have
an announcement.

560
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,535
As you go about your day,

561
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:05,710
I would like you to be aware of
the fact that I slept with Lisa Cuddy.

562
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,080
This is beyond asshood.

563
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,517
You have the luxury of not
caring about your image. I do not.

564
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,782
I can permit a lot of crap,

565
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:49,351
but an employee shouting about
his sexual exploits with me, no.

566
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:53,922
That is zero tolerance. So
congratulations, House, I'm angry.

567
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,434
I was wondering if we
should move in together.

568
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,576
You're fired.

569
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,916
I wouldn't worry about
it. I think she likes you.

570
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,567
If I'm fired, I think that probably
means I don't have to see patients.

571
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,890
I'm here as a squeaky wheel.

572
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,829
I know how you doctors are,
you're busy, you get distracted.

573
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,923
My lab results could
be sitting in your inbox.

574
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,833
I don't need your labs,
you have acid reflux.

575
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:31,936
Well, how could you...

576
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,733
Acid splashes on
the vocal cords,

577
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:38,072
they tense, make that squawking
sound. It's completely harmless.

578
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:41,011
I'm gonna give you a prescription,
and you're gonna go away.

579
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,013
You are a great doctor.

580
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,650
Why'd you move your belt?

581
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,584
I always move my belt.

582
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,349
It makes me sore.

583
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,622
You didn't tell me that.

584
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,058
At 86, what isn't sore?

585
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,686
Soreness is less
important than squawking.

586
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,822
It's the squawking that
was bothering my wife.

587
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,362
That's not a potbelly.
That's a tumor.

588
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,368
That's why pancreatic
cancer was on my mind.

589
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,870
My brain was
trying to tell me...

590
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,506
This isn't sounding good.

591
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,382
Pancreatic cancer?

592
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,478
Can cause acid reflux.
We should scope you.

593
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,389
So it's not good. Even
for cancer, it's not good.

594
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,982
No, it's not.

595
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,155
The deodorant has a high
proportion of propylene glycol.

596
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,824
Same stuff made a kid in
Singapore develop a heart condition

597
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,696
and, get this, seizures.

598
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,964
Our patient may never have
needed split-brain surgery.

599
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,734
I'm sure he will half
appreciate the irony.

600
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,404
Can you take this man to
Radiology? Pancreatic scan.

601
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,209
And stay with him.

602
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,379
Eugene Schwartz.

603
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,360
Whatever it is,
just say it quickly.

604
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,031
Do you have more than one
lipstick in the same shade?

605
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,041
Maybe one that has a sealing
agent, and one that doesn't?

606
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,237
How could that possibly
be relevant to anything?

607
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:28,952
You really don't think you're just
overreacting to the other night?

608
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,923
Fine. I am overreacting.

609
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,458
You've said plenty of
lousy things to me before.

610
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,432
But reaching the final
straw has been a good thing,

611
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:48,269
because it made me realize we not
only don't have a personal relationship,

612
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,932
we never could.

613
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,937
You're...

614
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:04,181
You've been overreacting
to something I said?

615
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,851
You insulted me, I walked out.

616
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,260
It's nothing that hasn't
happened a hundred times before.

617
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,799
I quit.

618
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,531
Great.

619
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:28,571
My nanny is off the clock
at 7:30. So your week off...

620
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,913
You can go suckle the little bastard child
who makes you feel good about yourself.

621
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,587
Screw you.

622
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,736
No, no. That's not
what happened.

623
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,440
I told you that I needed
you. You helped me.

624
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,506
Are you okay?

625
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,374
Are you okay?

626
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:27,417
So, this is the story you made up
about who you are. It's a nice one.

627
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,130
Too bad it isn't true.

628
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,537
No.

629
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,703
I'm not okay.
