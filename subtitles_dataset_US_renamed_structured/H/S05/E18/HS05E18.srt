1
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,176
You have a patient waiting. See?

2
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,363
I'm waiting for a follow-up.

3
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,880
If you're talking
about Mr. Casdin,

4
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,212
he has a deceased
sticker on his file,

5
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:53,015
as do all the other follow-ups
you have scheduled for today.

6
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,881
Whoops!

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,034
I had colds all winter.

8
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,733
I've been in this room a
while, but it's spring now, right?

9
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,866
I feel run down, like maybe
something big is coming on.

10
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,379
Run down? Come on, give
me something. Sore throat?

11
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,970
No. Runny nose?

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,912
No. I know it sounds
weird, I'm a nurse,

13
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:25,817
but could you run maybe
a CBC or a thyroid...

14
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,498
Dr. Cuddy, need a consult!

15
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,996
Until she stops seizing,

16
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,665
may as well go back to my
office and get my diagnosis on.

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,297
She's urinating on herself.

18
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,434
She's having a seizure.
If she hadn't peed...

19
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,977
It's green.

20
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,749
Interesting.

21
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,208
Thirty-five-year-old woman.

22
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,583
Head of nursing
in an old-age home.

23
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,022
Neurological symptoms and "P"?

24
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,285
Oh, green pee. I get it. Nice.

25
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,693
Neuro is also written in green.

26
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,597
Does that mean she has green
neurological symptoms as well?

27
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,638
From now on, I'm gonna use
two colors. Green indicates irony.

28
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:51,899
Pseudomonas infection.

29
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,600
She'd have a fever. Toxins?

30
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,870
Why are we taking this case?

31
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,980
Welcome, Your Lordship, we were
just preparing your morning briefing.

32
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,811
Sorry I'm late,

33
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:05,148
and, yes, green pee does meet
the only diagnostic requirement

34
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,119
you care about.
It's interesting.

35
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,554
But is it worth us
taking this case?

36
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,491
"Us" aren't taking anything.
I'm taking. You're accepting.

37
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,689
Okay, I accept. She
has adult-onset epilepsy,

38
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,064
and she really likes those
St. Patrick's Day beers.

39
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,462
Go check out the house and
the office for toxins and infections.

40
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,030
Her neuro exam was normal,
no subsequent seizures.

41
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,372
It's not life threatening.
It's not important.

42
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,242
Luckily, neither are you.

43
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,913
You okay? Fine.

44
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,857
You and House this morning?

45
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,292
The way you were arguing?

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,320
Airing disagreements
doesn't qualify as arguing.

47
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:55,901
Come on, man, I'm just
trying to help. We're friends.

48
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,963
There are 400 Japanese teenagers

49
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,416
you were playing
<i>Halo</i> with last night

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,136
you're better friends with.

51
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,668
Your avatar should ask their
avatars how they're doing.

52
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,772
I consider you a good friend

53
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,841
even if we don't hang
that much outside of work.

54
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,786
I wasn't arguing with him.

55
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,049
You kind of were.

56
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,422
Fine, I was. And you know what?

57
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,619
I was right.

58
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,526
You got conned.
Methylthioninium chloride.

59
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,532
Notable side
effect, green urine.

60
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,809
She's a nurse, she
knows the dosage,

61
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,096
knows how to fake a seizure.

62
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,036
She pees pea soup and gets the
warm attention of doctors all week long.

63
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,801
She's a Munchausen,
and you're her mark.

64
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,069
So your insight is based on

65
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,374
discovering an anti-Alzheimer's
drug at an old-age home.

66
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,022
No good reason it'd
be sitting on her desk.

67
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,016
You ever tried to pee on
yourself in public? It's not easy.

68
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,678
Sorry, I rushed the Jewish
frat, we peed in private.

69
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,688
For good reason. I
can spot a fake seizure,

70
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,324
which means this
was real, which means

71
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,054
her problem is phenol.

72
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,823
Carbolic acid?

73
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,558
Yeah, maybe she
accidentally inhaled some

74
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,431
at a gout treatment
facility, circa 1890.

75
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,663
It's still in some
antiseptic throat sprays.

76
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,070
She's been chugging it
all winter for her colds.

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,903
Phenol explains the
seizure and the urine.

78
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,602
She'd have to drink
five bottles a day.

79
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,120
Which is why I'm sure
you won't have trouble

80
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,911
discovering the evidence of it
when you search her house. Bye.

81
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,089
And you can start her on charcoal
hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning.

82
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,522
Seriously?

83
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,984
Oh, you were lying
about the throat spray.

84
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,394
That does make more sense.

85
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,056
So why are you
wasting Taub's time?

86
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,159
Because I don't want him to
know that I'm wasting my time

87
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,000
disproving his fake
seizure theory. Zip!

88
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,138
Chris?

89
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,077
Chris Taub, right?

90
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,344
Neil Zane.

91
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,183
I was two years under you
at Collegiate High, remember?

92
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,254
Sure.

93
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,120
So you are some
big doctor here now?

94
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,589
I'm a doctor. You?

95
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,272
I was speaking at an econ
course over at the university.

96
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,492
I tripped and banged my leg.

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,235
I have some time. Come with me.

98
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,964
Hi. Tests back?

99
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,739
Head CT was negative.

100
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,079
What about a thyroid uptake
or abdominal ultrasound?

101
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:25,710
Sure. How about I flash some
lights in front of your face first?

102
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,310
You want me to
have another seizure?

103
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,431
We're gonna have
to give up the room

104
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,584
unless we can confirm a problem.

105
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,785
Okay.

106
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,510
Damn it!

107
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,350
Oh, God. Please
forgive me. I'm so sorry.

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,857
What are you worried about? You'll
have maybe a night in jail for fraud.

109
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,155
I have to go tell one of
my employees he was right.

110
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:09,196
I'm not a Munchausen. I'm
gonna die unless you help me.

111
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,973
You'll have to come up
with something more original.

112
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,592
A cat predicted my death.

113
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,238
Cats make terrible doctors.

114
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,140
Oh, no, wait, that's
women. You're screwed.

115
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,042
How'd you slip?

116
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,447
I've had this dizziness
problem for a while now.

117
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,212
You get checked
for labyrinthitis?

118
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,380
On antibiotics for a
week. No difference.

119
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,421
Lie down a sec.
Whoa, whoa, I'm dizzy.

120
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,016
That's normal.

121
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,419
So what are you teaching?

122
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,861
Entrepreneurship.

123
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,367
I'm a CEO. OstTech Industries.
We make medical devices.

124
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,460
All right. You can sit up.

125
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,398
So, did that tell you
anything? Did I...

126
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,640
Oh, my God.

127
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,572
You just cured me.

128
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,047
I figured you had a tiny
calcium deposit in your inner ear.

129
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,981
I just shifted it around.

130
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,451
I've seen three
doctors for this.

131
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,088
I'm buying you
dinner. Forget it.

132
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,320
Come on. I'm also an investor
in a club, we'll make it a night out.

133
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,295
Well, I'm married, boring.

134
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,031
I know some married
people who aren't boring.

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,695
A few years back,
I was one of them.

136
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,163
Good luck, Neil.

137
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,408
If you're gonna kill me and
rape me, please do it in that order.

138
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,315
This is the cat. Debbie.
Have you heard of her?

139
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,785
Debbie? Sorry, but
without a last name...

140
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,048
She was on the news.
We found her as a kitten.

141
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,818
She lives in the nursing home.

142
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,655
She only sleeps next to
people when they're about to die.

143
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,024
Ten patients in the last year.

144
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:52,725
And then yesterday, she did it to
me while I was sitting on my couch.

145
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,169
Please. The whole staff, the
doctors even, we all know this is real.

146
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,728
Can you come back later?

147
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,708
I have some business I'm
conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.

148
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,910
Just watch this video.
It'll prove I'm not lying.

149
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,549
Dr. House, I am begging you.

150
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,021
Chest.

151
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,698
Quick, before she goes without
attention for eight seconds.

152
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,994
House.

153
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,498
She's faking. The
cat told me. Listen.

154
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,649
Soft breath sounds.
Means it's bronchospasm.

155
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,816
You can't fake that.

156
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,954
<i>Debbie the cat spends most of
her time just prowling the halls,</i>

157
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,692
<i>the queen of her own private
world.</i> HOUSE: I gotta say,

158
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,278
I don't think the
changes they've made

159
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,892
to <i>American Idol</i>
really work for me.

160
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,165
<i>When Debbie climbs on a
patient's bed and goes to sleep,</i>

161
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,139
<i>we call the loved ones
and tell them to come in.</i>

162
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,200
You wanna treat
her? She's a nut job.

163
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,211
Don't we all have quirks?

164
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,907
Aren't those eccentricities
what make us human?

165
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,075
<i>It's like Debbie's here on Earth
to bring people to the other side.</i>

166
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,129
<i>The doctors that we spoke
to also agree that the cat...</i>

167
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,985
Nut jobs get sick, too.

168
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:27,624
So you think this
cat story is nonsense,

169
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,658
and you admit she faked
her earlier symptoms,

170
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,222
but you still think
she's actually sick now?

171
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,599
Well, anything would sound
ridiculous if you said it in that voice.

172
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,901
Confirm she's faking or I'm
gonna have to kick her out.

173
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,441
There's that voice again.

174
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,238
I'll give you 24 hours.

175
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,040
Consecutive?

176
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,381
What are you doing?

177
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:59,688
No, Mr. Bond, I expect you
to die. Bronchospasm. Go.

178
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,921
Bronchitis. No cough, no fever,

179
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,690
and Blofeld didn't
smoke a cigar.

180
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,859
He might have. Dude had
a lair, means he was rich.

181
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,598
Rich people enjoy a good stogie,
sometimes send them as gifts.

182
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,864
Hey, Taub, did that sound like

183
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,105
I was awkwardly trying to
segue into making a point?

184
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,235
Yes.

185
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,975
Emphysema. FOREMAN:
Lungs were clean on the CT.

186
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,380
Dogs can be trained to predict
diabetic comas, epileptic seizures,

187
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,512
they can smell cancer. It is
possible there's something to this cat.

188
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,887
It's more possible it
was just a coincidence.

189
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,859
Ten million nursing homes,
hundred million pet cats,

190
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,304
one of them was bound
to pick a few winners.

191
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,306
Debbie was able to predict
there was something wrong

192
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,731
with the patient before you
were. Is that a coincidence, too?

193
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,964
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything,
it might have caused the deaths.

194
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,470
We should've
listened to Ted Nugent.

195
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,906
Yeah. It could be cat scratch
fever, or visceral larva migrans.

196
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,067
Maybe it didn't kill everyone
at the nursing home,

197
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,635
but it may be killing Morgan.

198
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,410
The worms hop from the cat to
the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.

199
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,314
Those cigars were for me.

200
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,579
Hey, that reminds me.

201
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:03,817
Why is some fancy CEO
sending you a box of Cuban cigars?

202
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,915
Is it related to your
money worries?

203
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,016
What money worries?

204
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,222
Extrapolating from the fact that
he's been skipping his morning muffin,

205
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,358
I'd say that he lost almost all
his money in the market last year.

206
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,358
I'm on a diet.

207
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,704
I'm also extrapolating from the
online portfolio you forgot to log off,

208
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,901
but it's mostly the muffins.

209
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,143
Scope her for
worms in the lungs.

210
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,679
We could help out in there.

211
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,279
Yeah, it takes at
least four people

212
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,758
to look inside a crazy woman's
lungs for imaginary worms.

213
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,557
So, you're in a good mood again.

214
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,225
Do you need another speech
about what a great friend I am?

215
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,736
I'm telling my wife we
don't need to downsize,

216
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,635
but maybe we do.

217
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,914
You really lost all that money?

218
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,308
I don't care about the money,
I just feel bad for Rachel.

219
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,143
She married a guy in one
situation, ended up with another.

220
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,115
That's hard on anyone. Thanks,

221
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,494
makes me feel much better,
hearing my wife's a gold digger.

222
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,248
No, I just meant she married

223
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,983
this master-of-the-universe
successful surgeon,

224
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:14,517
and now he's basically a
flunky for this mad scientist,

225
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,429
who saves lives, so that's good.

226
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,799
There are no worms in the lungs.

227
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,396
What else could
cause bronchospasm?

228
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,701
Severe acid reflux.

229
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,242
No esophagitis, it's not reflux.

230
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,005
Why are you
pushing a crash cart?

231
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,909
Because patients sometimes
crash, and they haven't yet invented

232
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,711
a crash tractor for me to drive
wildly around the hallways.

233
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,716
Why are we in the
coma patients' room?

234
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,353
You actually think the cat is
going to predict someone's death?

235
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,991
No. I know the cat is not
going to predict anyone's death.

236
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,297
And then I will have
scientifically disproved...

237
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,012
You didn't keep this
patient despite the cat,

238
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,902
you kept this patient
because of the cat.

239
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,497
You're scared
there's something to it.

240
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,011
If I could prove the non-existence
of an omniscient God

241
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,342
who lovingly guides us
to the other side, I would.

242
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,609
Cat version will have to do.

243
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,111
Are you scared?

244
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,178
Cats' brains are
always in alpha mode.

245
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,690
The few scientific tests that have
seemed to confirm psychic phenomena,

246
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,952
that's where it takes place.

247
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,655
Please tell me that you were
kidding, so I won't have to fire you.

248
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,321
I was kidding.

249
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,257
We still have a
human patient, right?

250
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,665
Airborne allergens possible?
Skin test was negative.

251
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,878
Lungs may be more sensitive.

252
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,064
Or House just screwed up.

253
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,335
If you misinterpreted the breath
sounds as soft instead of loud,

254
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,071
it's laryngospasm
instead of bronchospasm.

255
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,908
Which she can get from
a simple panic attack,

256
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,607
which she was having.

257
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,413
I also heard the lung sounds,
too, Taub. You saying I screwed up?

258
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,455
"Screwed up" is maybe
too harsh, but yes.

259
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,700
Don't you wanna
check their charts?

260
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,920
Of course not, this
is a double-blind.

261
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,794
I don't want to even subconsciously
signal to Teddy which one's the sickest.

262
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,559
Her name's Debbie.

263
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,166
Are those welts
on that guy's arm?

264
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,067
Were they here when we got here?

265
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,802
He has a severe cat allergy.

266
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,978
That never happened.

267
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,210
Look at Debbie.

268
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:28,893
Good news, Mr. Limpert.

269
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,159
When you don't die tonight,

270
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,667
you will finally have done
something good for the world,

271
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,000
as opposed to your
life as a fireman.

272
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,635
Foreman's airborne allergen
theory makes the most sense.

273
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,235
Do a methacholine challenge
on Catgirl to check it out.

274
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,377
I told you to get
rid of Death Cat.

275
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,023
You see a cat?
I see a litter box.

276
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,853
This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy.

277
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:04,864
I can't make it to the men's
room... You pee on the mice, too?

278
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,526
Well, now, you see, the mice
actually prove that I don't have a cat.

279
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,933
Are these...

280
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,367
Are these the genetically
modified lab mice from oncology?

281
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,135
Genetically
modified for tastiness.

282
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,079
Get rid of the cat, and
get rid of your patient.

283
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,175
My team is doing a
methacholine challenge.

284
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,412
Your team just completed
a methacholine challenge,

285
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,547
which came up negative.

286
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,784
Who told you about
the test? Taub?

287
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,123
I'll never say. But yes.

288
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,858
Her airway's clamped
down. I heard it.

289
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,974
We kick her onto the
streets, it could happen again.

290
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,661
Wish there was a "lawsuit
cat," it could warn you.

291
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,032
I'm sorry, but if you
won't escort her out,

292
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,595
I'll have to get
security to do it.

293
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,576
You're joining me
for a goodbye smoke.

294
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,449
I don't smoke.

295
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:04,647
Fine, if you don't want the
seventh graders to think you're cool.

296
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,828
I went through your purse.

297
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,629
Horoscopes, good-luck charms.

298
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,465
You went to a good
college, good nursing school,

299
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,063
so you weren't always
a superstitious idiot.

300
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,402
I'm not a superstitious...

301
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,376
How about four
years, that sound right?

302
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,173
That's when you switched
from the family insurance plan

303
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,475
to the one you're on now.

304
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,074
I was married, I got divorced.

305
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,548
Two years before that,
you got chickenpox shots,

306
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,784
which you only get in
adulthood when you have a kid.

307
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,191
Or I should say
when you had a kid

308
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,388
because no kid has
come to visit you.

309
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,694
Which all makes me think
something bad happened.

310
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,598
It was my stepson, Timothy.

311
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,671
What happened?

312
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,676
He was in school.

313
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,376
He was having his morning
snack, and he choked.

314
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,950
And the teachers saw it, and they did
everything that they were supposed to.

315
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,082
He shouldn't have died.

316
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,755
You wanna make it make sense.

317
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,465
What's wrong with that?

318
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,037
It's meaningless
is what's wrong.

319
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,631
What's wrong is that it doesn't
do a thing to bring your kid back,

320
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,369
or put you and your
ex together again.

321
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,177
Rash on your neck.

322
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,746
Probably not enough for Cuddy.

323
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,854
Can't breathe.

324
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,220
Hey, Doc.

325
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,226
Breath sound soft to you, Doc?

326
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,598
Hooray, you're officially sick.

327
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,973
Churg-Strauss fits
best. Here's the plan.

328
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,172
Taub, change the litter box.

329
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,109
This is pathetic.

330
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,478
You're still punishing me for calling
you out on the green urine lady?

331
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,283
Nope, this is for
ratting me out to Cuddy.

332
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,190
I'm not asking you to apologize,
just scoop some poop out of a box.

333
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,783
Just clean it.

334
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,307
Let House do it. FOREMAN:
Yeah, that'll happen.

335
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,961
He won't just continue to let
our room smell like cat pee.

336
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,060
I'll clean it next time.

337
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,764
I'm out of here.

338
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:46,080
Now that you've delivered that important
lesson, I'm gonna go test the patient.

339
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,843
Whoa!

340
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,587
What, you think your
bag's going to die now?

341
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,855
Now you're punishing me
because you think I'm superstitious?

342
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,522
What do you care? It's not so
much about me caring, per se,

343
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,794
it's more about me wondering
why you're such a credulous idiot.

344
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,735
Thirteen, start the patient on
steroids for the Churg-Strauss.

345
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,266
Unless we have something
we need to argue about?

346
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,409
This is good stuff.

347
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,676
The best.

348
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:17,993
It's made from the
distilled sweat of

349
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,953
recently-laid-off
hedge fund managers.

350
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,511
Aren't you happy
you came out tonight?

351
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,753
Yeah. I wasn't actually going to,
but not the greatest day at work.

352
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,889
I used to have
an office like this.

353
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,022
Used to?

354
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,691
When I was a plastic surgeon.

355
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,565
But one day, I took
stock of my life and...

356
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,573
Oh, screw it.

357
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,176
I had an affair with the
daughter of one of my partners.

358
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,339
They signed a non-disclosure,
I signed a non-compete.

359
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,976
And the funny thing is I wound
up telling my wife anyway.

360
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,581
You like your job?

361
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,252
Same as you, same as
everyone, it has its ups and downs.

362
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,990
You're lying to
make me feel better.

363
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,431
Yeah. It's the best. I'm in charge,
you know. I'm a kid with toys.

364
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,770
Speaking of which, what
do you think of the prototype?

365
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,832
It's amazing.

366
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,140
You gotta make it a
half-inch smaller, though.

367
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,674
You serious? I got small hands,

368
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,409
6.5 gloves, like women surgeons,

369
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,110
which are your
fastest-growing market.

370
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:29,019
Me and the girls would have to
use two hands to hit the switch.

371
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,555
Why do I bother paying
the idiots that work for me?

372
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,219
Put down that
crap you're drinking,

373
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,288
because I am breaking
out the really good stuff.

374
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,613
What's wrong?

375
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,149
I went to the
bathroom. My urine...

376
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,208
Green again? It's brown.

377
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,519
I didn't do anything. Honest.

378
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,491
<i>I'm just a girl who can't say no</i>

379
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,057
It is possible
she's still faking.

380
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,897
She didn't fake
the bronchospasm.

381
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,132
You think she's faking
some stuff, but not other stuff?

382
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,571
Maybe she's Unchausen?

383
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,007
I'm just saying the brown
urine doesn't make sense.

384
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,146
What? Nothing.

385
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,315
We've ruled out every
possible cause for brown urine.

386
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,824
No blood in the urine,
liver and kidneys fine.

387
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,088
Brown could be fecal. Fistula.

388
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,220
We checked.

389
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,321
How do we know the
urine is still brown?

390
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,094
Had to be. Once
you've gone brown...

391
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,667
If we've ruled out everything
that can make the urine brown,

392
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,297
what if it just looked brown.

393
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,572
If the green dye never left her
system, what plus green makes brown?

394
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,207
Purple.

395
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,609
Strep bovis infection
from colon cancer.

396
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,243
Paraneoplastic syndrome
would explain the bronchospasm.

397
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,197
We scoped her when
we checked for the fistula,

398
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,383
there's no tumor.

399
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,922
Oh, no.

400
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,059
I wasn't scared by
the umbrella, either.

401
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,962
What? Not everything's
about you, Kutner.

402
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,201
I realize it's stupid. I just
don't know everything,

403
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,260
I don't want to invite... Great.

404
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,736
I thought your superstitiousness

405
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,048
had to do with your
folks being killed,

406
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,769
but "you're stupid"
works just as well.

407
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,138
Why is there a ladder here?

408
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,706
Whoops. Forgot that one.

409
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:43,086
Scopes don't work as well as
pillcams. Give her one, find the tumor.

410
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,086
Come with me, Tiny Taub.

411
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,179
Sorry, I was late again. I've got a
long commute from the poorhouse.

412
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,112
Knew it when I hired you.

413
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,242
You'd eventually miss the money,

414
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,254
being the big shot like
your new CEO friend,

415
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,723
if that nightclub stamp on
your hand is any indication.

416
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,726
Don't worry, I'm
not quitting. I know.

417
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,730
A guy who signs a non-compete instead
of just telling his wife that he cheated

418
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,095
doesn't have the guts to quit.

419
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,758
Bad example. I did tell her.

420
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,359
From guilt, not from courage.

421
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,071
And bravely running to
Cuddy behind my back,

422
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,472
and arriving heroically
late every day.

423
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,738
Cowards make lousy employees.

424
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,306
Well, maybe you're a
coward, maybe you're quitting.

425
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,382
Either way, I'm screwed.

426
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:56,253
You'll note how Faster,
Pussycat! Kill! Kill!

427
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,025
Has snuggled up by
coma guy over there.

428
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,524
More importantly, she
did yesterday as well.

429
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,860
And he's still breathing.

430
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,600
We done?

431
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,152
Thank you for showing me this.

432
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,394
But maybe she's just confused
in this new environment.

433
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:34,127
In 1844, a preacher
in upstate New York

434
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,227
added up some dates in the
Bible and predicted Jesus' return.

435
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,897
His followers gave
away all their possessions

436
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,669
and showed up in a field.

437
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,739
Guess who didn't show.

438
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,488
So the preacher said
that he miscalculated,

439
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,989
and they went right
back the next month,

440
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,606
but with more followers.

441
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,912
Every time he was
irrefutably proved wrong,

442
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,283
it redoubled everyone's belief.

443
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,412
I know I sound just like them.

444
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,087
But I also know you're wrong.

445
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,595
Something terrible is
gonna happen to me.

446
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,610
You trying to prove
to her she's not dying?

447
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,511
That would be dumb,
as she might be dying.

448
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,880
This woman lost her kid.

449
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,562
Why are you attacking beliefs
that give her a little bit of comfort?

450
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,851
I don't care if her superstitions
make her feel better.

451
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,551
I just want her to
think more clearly. Oh.

452
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,344
Maybe that can make
her as happy as you are.

453
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,095
Where are we going?

454
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,565
Experimenting.

455
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,764
Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It's
just not cute anymore.

456
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,337
You already experimented
on the coma guy.

457
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,811
Haven't you proved your
point? Not to the patient,

458
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,438
and not to the
millions of idiots

459
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,881
who drooled over that news
item about the magic cat.

460
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,544
Why are you so
obsessed with this?

461
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,986
Can't you just call her an
idiot and leave everyone alone?

462
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,717
Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.

463
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,558
You're a liar. Therapy
animals are dogs, not cats.

464
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,392
Aren't you feisty?
This one's special.

465
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,159
If she likes you,
interesting stuff happens.

466
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,669
No. Okay. Kids, playtime's over.

467
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,344
You know what,
this is a good thing.

468
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,365
Because either you're
starting to doubt yourself,

469
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,938
which is healthy, or...

470
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,450
I don't believe in the
legend of Goodbye Kitty.

471
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,919
Or you're starting to give a
crap what other people think,

472
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,564
which is just
another way of saying

473
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,932
you give a crap
about other people.

474
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:41,859
I'd love to hear more of your
theory, but I don't give a crap.

475
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,952
Also, the pillcam's back.

476
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,961
Polypoid. Raised edges.

477
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,799
Raised edges are
actually necessary,

478
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,600
since that's the
opening to the appendix.

479
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,302
How many times are we gonna
watch this? There's no tumor.

480
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,807
Oh, my God,

481
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,938
the Death Cat is attacking
your legs, you're gonna die.

482
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,945
Maybe it has something to do with that
little red dot dancing around down there.

483
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,681
Oh, my God, the death laser

484
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,780
is attacking your
legs, you're gonna die.

485
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,722
We're wasting time
looking for cancer.

486
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,350
She's still walking around,
she's still pretty healthy,

487
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,985
maybe it's something minor.

488
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,724
Maybe we're not wasting time.

489
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,664
We wouldn't have
seen a flat lesion.

490
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,865
Skin cancer could have
metastasized to the intestines.

491
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,299
Cool.

492
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,670
Check for melanomas.

493
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,691
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty. Come here.

494
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,930
Here, kitty.

495
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,243
What? <i>KUTNER: It's not cancer.</i>

496
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,977
We found spider
veins on her back.

497
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,484
They weren't there
when she came in.

498
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,578
Spider veins means Cushing's.

499
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:19,180
Could cause an abdominal
disturbance, brown urine.

500
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,090
<i>But the bronchospasm?</i>

501
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,457
Cushing's myopathy.

502
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,562
It's uncommon, but...

503
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,024
Wait a second.

504
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,569
You didn't wake me up to tell
me a symptom that's not killing her.

505
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,768
<i>What else is going
on?</i> I think she's dying.

506
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,140
I just told you, it's
Cushing's. We treat...

507
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:43,113
I don't mean because of the
spider veins. Mr. Limpert died.

508
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,659
If that's my high
school gym teacher...

509
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,379
It's your coma patient.

510
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,717
He was stable for a
year-and-a-half, and he just died.

511
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,780
<i>The cat was right, House.</i>

512
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,660
Here, puss, puss,
puss, puss, puss.

513
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,132
Say "puss" one more time. It's
the sixth "puss" that really does it.

514
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,364
You're right. Sulking
will solve everything.

515
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,236
That cat sat on my lap, and
that cat knows something.

516
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,832
You believe it now? Yesterday,
it was all a coincidence.

517
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,277
Yesterday, it was, till I
unintentionally proved it wasn't.

518
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,406
Patient must have Cushing's. We
have to figure out whether it's based in...

519
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,611
A cat's nose is powerful, could
smell liver or kidney failure.

520
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,781
Exactly. Except that if you'd
glanced at the nursing home files

521
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,055
I had faxed over this morning,

522
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,602
you'd know that most of the
patients' livers and kidneys were fine.

523
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,390
What else? The
MRIs aren't telling us

524
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,430
if the Cushing's is in
her adrenals or her brain.

525
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,759
So check her ACTH.

526
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,509
The cat's vision is at the
blue end of the spectrum.

527
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,093
ACTH is 11.7.
It's too close to tell.

528
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,313
And we can't treat
the wrong organ,

529
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,805
'cause that won't
solve anything.

530
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,749
She could have a cortisol
storm, could kill her.

531
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,299
Well, maybe, as the senior
fellow, you could have made sure

532
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,402
that my doors were closed so that
I could be concentrating on the cat

533
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,072
instead of looking for the cat.

534
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,109
You all right?

535
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,419
Your nose.

536
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,589
What'd he say?

537
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:09,795
Sounds like he said, "Do
you like cranberry juice?"

538
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,493
Crap.

539
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,404
Cheaper than fake blood.
And more cran-tastic.

540
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,568
Don't ever leave my
door open like that again.

541
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,339
You're playing pranks and
this woman could be dying.

542
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,210
So have Chase do a
venous sampling in her brain.

543
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,806
If he finds
something, it's there,

544
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,819
if he finds nothing,
it's the adrenals.

545
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,749
I'm not who I used to be.

546
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,486
I'm scared. It's
not a way to live.

547
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,491
I wanna come work for you.

548
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,139
Jeez, Chris, you didn't think...

549
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,334
I didn't mean to imply that
I could hire you right now.

550
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,310
You said you
needed guys like me.

551
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:56,007
I know, but you
don't have an MBA,

552
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,243
and I just hired a
Chief Medical Officer.

553
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,785
Then let me invest in
that laser scalpel start-up.

554
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,878
I got money saved,
not a ton, but...

555
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:06,857
We put in a two-million-dollar
minimum for the first round of financing.

556
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,351
Look,

557
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,858
I guess I could take you
on, on a smaller number,

558
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,594
but you have to understand

559
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,260
it wouldn't be
some quick payoff.

560
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,862
Yeah, I know. I know it's not
gonna change my life overnight.

561
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,103
I just need to
start changing it.

562
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,580
Okay, then. Let's start.

563
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,051
What exactly are you hoping to
find inside your dead coma guy?

564
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,217
Catnip, chew toy... I don't
know, that's why I'm looking.

565
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,153
Your patient had a cardiac
arrest during the venous sampling.

566
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,755
We got her back, but
her heart's still tenuous.

567
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,266
That tell us anything?
She's weak, possibly dying.

568
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,926
So nothing.

569
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,799
What about the
ACTH? Slightly elevated.

570
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,204
It confirms the Cushing's
is in the brain. Go.

571
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,368
Are you sure that
it's Cushing's?

572
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,037
You'd expect central body
obesity, she's in good shape.

573
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,712
If it had a normal presentation,
there wouldn't be a cat involved.

574
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:04,875
So it's the brain,

575
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,886
means the next question is whether
to remove her pituitary right now...

576
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:11,822
That's not a question for me,
that's a question for the patient.

577
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,085
Now present both
sides, let her decide.

578
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,286
All right.

579
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,755
I've got to stop telling
you my theories.

580
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,276
You always just try
to prove me wrong.

581
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,896
You mean the theory about Cuddy's
ass getting bigger at the full moon?

582
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,099
I confirmed that one,
photo's on my blog.

583
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,684
Normally, you'd be
up in the patient room,

584
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:30,971
hectoring her on what to do,

585
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,705
instead you're up to your elbows
in some irrelevant dead guy,

586
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:36,680
who may or may not be
connected to a magic cat,

587
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,182
because you want to prove
to me that you don't care.

588
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:43,016
Case is over. I'm exploring
a scientific mystery.

589
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:44,988
I put up with your obsessions,

590
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,150
I even encourage
them, for one reason,

591
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:51,629
they save lives. I don't
know what you're doing now.

592
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,797
Cushing's means your body is
overproducing a hormone called cortisol.

593
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:06,345
The recommended course of
action is to suppress it with drugs.

594
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,437
And that will cure it?

595
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,347
Just treat it. It
could come back.

596
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,011
The only permanent solution is

597
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,645
to cut into your brain and
remove your pituitary gland,

598
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,883
but surgery's dangerous.

599
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,926
Your heart stopped on
the table once already.

600
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,624
I want the surgery.

601
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,564
This thing is gonna kill
me if I don't kill it first.

602
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,332
Because of the cat?

603
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,899
Do you wanna tell me
what an idiot I'm being?

604
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,168
No.

605
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:43,547
I really believe that there are
things that science can't understand,

606
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:49,111
that there is a role for faith and
prayer, but it's in the waiting room,

607
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,321
not the OR.

608
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,722
There's a reason I got sick.

609
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:02,159
There's a reason for all the bad
things that have happened to me.

610
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,761
I don't know what that reason is,
but I know that if there isn't one,

611
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,441
if there's no greater
purpose in the world,

612
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,472
then it's not a
world I wanna live in.

613
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,247
I'll schedule an operating room.

614
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,307
You're early.

615
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm not staying
long. I'm quitting.

616
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,449
You got a new job? No.

617
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,078
Well, then you're not quitting.

618
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,417
I'll see you back here tomorrow.

619
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,323
You're not accepting
my resignation?

620
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,859
Easier this way.

621
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,791
It avoids the whole thing where
you panic, run back and grovel,

622
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,696
and I punish you, and
then take you back.

623
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,895
Bye.

624
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,536
Bring donuts. Everyone
loves those bear claws.

625
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,715
Here, puss, puss,
puss, puss, puss. Puss?

626
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,095
Mr. Taub?

627
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,361
I've been waiting 15
minutes. Where's Neil?

628
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,960
Neil doesn't work here anymore.

629
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,436
But he's the CEO.

630
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,805
I'm sorry. I wish I
could help you. Sorry.

631
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,804
This is crazy. I'm
investing with his company.

632
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,905
He doesn't have a company.

633
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,506
He worked here, but he
was a receptionist, a temp.

634
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,484
Where is he? He's in custody.

635
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,783
I really am not supposed
to say anything else.

636
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,686
I went to high school with him.

637
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,351
That's what everyone
else thought, too.

638
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,327
I'm guessing you also
cured his ear problem?

639
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,398
Did you give him the money yet?

640
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,991
No.

641
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,602
I was right,

642
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,581
and more satisfyingly,
you were wrong.

643
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,741
It was coincidence.

644
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,685
That cat was not
predicting deaths,

645
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,034
it was just trying to keep warm.

646
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,717
Yes, dead people are
renowned for their warm glow.

647
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,020
They are if they're feverish,

648
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,618
like three of the patients were.

649
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:54,227
Or if they are wasting
away, like the other eight.

650
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,063
Wasting doesn't... It does,

651
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,468
if it means someone sticks
a heating blanket on you.

652
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,242
Congrats. Because of your
crazy obsession with this cat

653
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,073
you've solved a
completely trivial mystery.

654
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,443
Completely trivial?

655
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,244
My God, it's clearly
only partially trivial.

656
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,719
Debbie climbed on Morgan, too,

657
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,084
which means she was overheated.

658
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:19,613
So what causes flushing,
mimics every Cushing's symptom

659
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,886
except central body obesity?

660
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:24,960
Cancer.

661
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,294
A corticotropin-producing
carcinoid tumor of the intestine.

662
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,267
But your pillcam
didn't find anything.

663
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:34,636
Means it must be somewhere
the pillcam couldn't go.

664
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,969
The appendix.

665
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,875
Congratulations. You
probably saved her life.

666
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,846
You definitely saved
her needless surgery.

667
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,139
Yes, I did.

668
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,512
What's the OR extension number?

669
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,713
Just curious.

670
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,163
Thank you.

671
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:06,571
I wouldn't come here for
thanks, that would be ungracious.

672
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,797
It's more about gloating.

673
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,340
You were about to cut
out a piece of your brain

674
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,176
just to chase some
crazy superstition.

675
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,341
But I didn't.

676
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,909
You didn't didn't do
anything. I stopped it.

677
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,347
And what made you do that?

678
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,856
Science. Logic.
Reason. Pick any three.

679
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:33,658
A cat chooses that exact
moment to sit on your computer.

680
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,291
Maybe that's science
and logic and reason,

681
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,393
or maybe it's something else.

682
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,601
You're an idiot.

683
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,780
I looked up the preacher
from New York State.

684
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,350
His followers never faded out.

685
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,614
They became the
Seventh-Day Adventists.

686
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,952
A major religion. That man
changed the course of history.

687
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,686
Because his followers
were as deluded as he was.

688
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,857
Maybe he just gave
them something to live for.

689
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,903
Feel better.

690
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,839
Kutner!

691
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,382
Cat pee on my chair?

692
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,716
Blood on my face? Fake blood.

693
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,990
You pay for the dry-cleaning.

694
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,995
Why are you still alive?

695
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,094
I'm not sure.

696
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,606
I guess he was impressed
you stood up to him.

697
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,642
And got a cat to
pee on his chair.

698
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,474
Yeah. A cat.

699
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,324
See you tomorrow. Yeah.
