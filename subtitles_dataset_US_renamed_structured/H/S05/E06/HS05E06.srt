1
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,984
What time?

2
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,393
4:30.

3
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,463
Why so late?

4
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,466
Make-up test in social studies.

5
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,997
Did you invite
Shelby for Saturday?

6
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,092
No.

7
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,914
Do you want me to call
her? Yeah, that'd be great.

8
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,339
You calling a 12-year-old
girl for a sleepover.

9
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,171
It'll be fine. Make you a deal.

10
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,370
I'll call a friend when
you call a friend.

11
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,006
It's your birthday.
Do what you want.

12
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,482
Thank you. Bye.

13
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,078
Bye.

14
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,164
What did you forget? Nothing.

15
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,400
Then why'd you come back?

16
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,965
'Cause I live here.

17
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,887
Come on, Samantha, you're
gonna be late for school.

18
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,244
What are you talking
about? It's 4:30.

19
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,586
Are you okay?

20
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,431
Tired, I guess.

21
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,669
What's wrong?

22
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,710
I don't know.

23
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,313
Right.

24
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:12,655
That's all I need to know.
You're late! Okay, bye.

25
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,886
37-year-old male with
recurring blackouts.

26
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,592
Tell him to switch from tequila
to bourbon. Worked for me.

27
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,159
The three doctors he's already seen
already ruled out drugs and alcohol.

28
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,236
Then it's epilepsy.

29
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,381
Tell him to buy a
hockey helmet and...

30
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,567
EEG's clean, so is the CT.

31
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,305
Relax. Just because you got
approved by an adoption agency

32
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,357
doesn't mean you'll get
approved by the birth mother.

33
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,542
You're a single mom.

34
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:39,347
That puts you somewhere below
couples acquitted in day care scandals.

35
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,115
You're welcome, Dr. House.

36
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,816
It is an interesting case.

37
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,022
What time are you
seeing the mom?

38
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,559
Are you having
your guy follow me?

39
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,757
I just trashed your
social value as a mother,

40
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,596
and all I got was
a little sarcasm.

41
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,678
It means you don't feel
the need to defend yourself,

42
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,638
which means you're not
worried about getting a kid,

43
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,072
which means you've
already got one.

44
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,406
We're meeting at 11:00.

45
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,571
She's due to deliver a
baby girl in two weeks.

46
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,104
Well, I'm sure the mom will be thrilled
to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.

47
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,309
She's not a crack baby.

48
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,045
No, mother's perfectly healthy.

49
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,563
She just had to give
up the baby in order

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,716
to continue her work
on the human genome.

51
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,157
She confessed to
some past meth use.

52
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,428
What they don't confess to is
almost always more interesting.

53
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,658
This is a mistake.

54
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,826
Because a kid you don't know may
have some problems you don't know about

55
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,278
that she may have
passed on to a kid...

56
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,498
Because you're a
control-seeking narcissist,

57
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,563
which is fine, good
even, in some jobs,

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,168
but you're not equipped to handle a
real kid, never mind a factory second.

59
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,240
Where are you meeting her?

60
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,043
In a little place
called, "Follow me,

61
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,880
"and your urologist will be
buying himself a new yacht."

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,817
They explained the
returns policy, right?

63
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:47,964
It's worse than video games.

64
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,479
I'm not changing my mind.

65
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,956
Could be
post-concussion syndrome.

66
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,020
Not without a pre-concussion.

67
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,224
Pick a number.

68
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,322
For what?

69
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,163
Cuddy pool. She got the nod.

70
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,930
Little tweaker's
due in fourteen days.

71
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,063
That's great news. I think.

72
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,265
It's good news.

73
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,332
The great news is she insisted that
she's not gonna change her mind,

74
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,354
which means she's actually
thought about changing her mind,

75
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,378
which means she's not
sure she's ready to be a mom,

76
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,039
which means she's
not ready to be a mom,

77
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,777
which means she's
gonna change her mind.

78
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,318
The only question is when.

79
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,184
$100 buy-in, less than seven
means the next seven days.

80
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,450
But she's been dying
for a kid for three years.

81
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,767
No way she's gonna back out now.

82
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,952
Not one of the options.

83
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,322
Mini strokes can cause
blackouts and memory loss.

84
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,868
Nine hours is a lot of time
to be out for a mini stroke.

85
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,801
And there'd be residual
damage on the CT.

86
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,914
The guy works at home

87
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,167
as a consumer product tester.

88
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,951
He could've been exposed to a toxin
that caused short-term memory loss.

89
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,052
Wouldn't show up on imaging.

90
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,911
A cavernous sinus thrombosis could
cause absence seizures and memory loss.

91
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,642
I'll take seven to fourteen.

92
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,842
We have a player.

93
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,127
You just said it was great news.

94
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,295
Now you want to bet against her?

95
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,397
It's only great news if she
wants it to be great news.

96
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,185
House knows her
better than any of us.

97
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,316
I'd rather use a pseudonym.

98
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,859
Good thinking.

99
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,289
I say she's gonna
meet the mom and bolt.

100
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,696
I'm going for the early fold.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,797
Check his home for toxins,
and his sinuses for thrombosises.

102
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,471
Maybe he OD'd on caffeine.

103
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,478
Apparently he didn't drink
the coffee, just smelled it.

104
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,075
Wow.

105
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,747
Did they just move here?

106
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,186
Six years ago.

107
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,985
This is no way to raise a kid.

108
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,184
He's a single dad. I'm
sure he's doing his best.

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,228
Which is why single
people shouldn't have kids.

110
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,874
You got a problem with
what Cuddy's doing?

111
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,041
You think single
mothers can't...

112
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,864
I think the traditional
family is a fraud.

113
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,961
Even married moms
are single moms.

114
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,370
Daddy just pays some bills and
reads just enough bedtime stories

115
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,738
to not kill himself
out of guilt.

116
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,832
My dad was great.

117
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,910
After my mom died, he...

118
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,502
He might be the exception.

119
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,606
On the other hand, you
are fairly screwed up.

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,991
No booze, no meds, no drugs.

121
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,083
And no view.

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,039
The building's half empty. He'd rather
a view of the turnpike than the park.

123
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,588
Park views are
probably 50% more.

124
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,243
You're surprised the guy's a
pragmatist after looking at this place?

125
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,600
The guy's not a
pragmatist, he's a flagellant.

126
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,865
Mmm.

127
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,634
Looks like mold.

128
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,314
Mom would have cleaned better.

129
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,120
Exposure to certain types of mold
can cause short-term memory loss.

130
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,626
We're testing both of you.

131
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,322
I feel fine.

132
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm sure you are. We're
just being cautious.

133
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,796
So, where do you guys go,
other than home and school?

134
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,303
Nowhere. Dad works at
home, and I go to school.

135
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,136
What about sports,
friends, travel?

136
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,972
Like I said, Dad works at
home, and I go to school.

137
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,611
Must be hard not having
your mom around, huh?

138
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,208
I was only four when
the accident happened.

139
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,922
Still, I'm sure you both
miss her sometimes.

140
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,457
Not really.

141
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,893
You're strong.
No, I just don't get

142
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,329
what the big deal about
death is, you know?

143
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,828
Yeah.

144
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,067
How is she?

145
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,833
Physically, she's fine.
Mentally, she's weird.

146
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,870
I'm sure she's just freaked
out about her dad. Mr. Harmon?

147
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,476
Mr. Harmon?

148
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,644
Where are you going?

149
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,018
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

150
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,535
We haven't finished
with your treatment,

151
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,837
and we're still waiting
on some test results.

152
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,885
I have an appointment.

153
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,272
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to reschedule.

154
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,855
I really have to go.

155
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,578
Mr. Harmon, do you
know where you are?

156
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,764
Why are you trying to stop me?

157
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,509
Look at his eyes.

158
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,134
Is he having a seizure?

159
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,648
His pupils are responsive.
I think he's asleep.

160
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,217
He was just asleep. It
means no memory loss.

161
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,602
And sleepwalking doesn't kill,
unless he walks out a window.

162
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,095
Sleepwalking's not a
diagnosis, it's a symptom.

163
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,506
As long as we can't
figure out why...

164
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,590
Stress-induced insomnia.
Lots of people sleepwalk.

165
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,444
Not in the middle of the day before
they've even put their head on a pillow.

166
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,748
Could be some
sort of narcolepsy.

167
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,704
Which is caused by...

168
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,467
There's usually
a genetic history.

169
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,940
Or?

170
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,001
If you know the answer,
can you tell us the answer?

171
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,412
I don't know the answer.
Which brings us back to "Or?"

172
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,712
Some sort of
environmental trigger.

173
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,308
Which means? It's a toxin.

174
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,409
So we are?

175
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,216
Being led down an annoying path.

176
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,588
I honestly don't know where this
is going. Just following the clues.

177
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,935
We're right back
where we started.

178
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,155
The mold we found doesn't
cause these symptoms,

179
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,459
and there's nothing
else at his home.

180
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,431
And? And you're obnoxious.

181
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,797
He never goes anywhere else.

182
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,130
Which we know because?

183
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,568
Because he says so.

184
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,401
Because his daughter says so.
Because they have no reason to lie.

185
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,534
Which proves he never
goes anywhere else

186
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,177
when

187
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,544
he's...

188
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,348
Conscious.

189
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,150
Oh, my God, you're right.

190
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,422
He said he had an appointment.

191
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,822
Next time, let him keep it.

192
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,918
Send him home, see
where his dreams take him.

193
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,316
Becca?

194
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,383
Dr. Cuddy?

195
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,044
Lisa. Nice to meet you.

196
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,715
Oh! You want one? No, thanks.

197
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,122
I can't stop eating them. I
guess it's, like, a craving.

198
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,923
I must have, like,
a dozen a day.

199
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,294
And this is decaf.

200
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,238
How have you been feeling?

201
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:10,033
Uh... You know,
tired, fat, nervous.

202
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,031
Is there anything
you want to ask me?

203
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,941
Yeah, actually, I just
have one question.

204
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,037
What are you going to call her?

205
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,742
I'm not sure.

206
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,647
It's all been rather
sudden, you know?

207
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,151
I like Joy.

208
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,623
But as I said, I haven't
really decided yet.

209
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,955
Well, is there anything
you want to ask me?

210
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,495
It's okay.

211
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,098
The agency website is
filled with prospective parents.

212
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,829
There are their photos,
their biographies.

213
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,167
There're so many
wonderful people out there.

214
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,331
Wonderful couples.

215
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,873
Why did I choose a single mom?

216
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:54,779
My grandmother was married for 37 years
to a man that treated her like garbage,

217
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,373
and my mom would've stayed
married to my loser dad that long,

218
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,816
but he dumped her.

219
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,845
You know, I never understood how you could
fall for the same crap as your mother.

220
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,515
Then I met Tony.

221
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,957
When I read your bio, a
doctor, a head of a hospital.

222
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,930
When I saw your picture...

223
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,168
I don't want her
raised by a loser.

224
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,212
How long have you had that rash?

225
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,249
I don't know, a few days.

226
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,647
Have you had any joint pain?

227
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,152
Yeah, I'm pregnant.
All my joints hurt.

228
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,051
They shouldn't all hurt.

229
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,121
Have you been using?

230
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,418
Not in seven months.

231
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,721
Not since I found
out I was pregnant.

232
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,725
That needs to be checked out.

233
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,399
You sure you
don't want children?

234
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:58,138
You know, just because we're
stuck here, and I'm lying down,

235
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,941
doesn't mean we
need to get deep.

236
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,676
You're afraid you'll make the same
mistake you made with your wife?

237
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,878
Get caught taking some
other kid to a ball game?

238
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,318
I like my life as it is.

239
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,081
Alpha waves increasing.

240
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,233
Any change in demeanor?

241
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,987
No, nothing. He just got up.

242
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,052
Maybe it's a result of a
blood pressure change.

243
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,724
Delta waves. Out of nowhere.

244
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,397
He's now asleep.

245
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,847
Brain's supposed to
turn off motor function.

246
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:28,069
If the brain was doing what it was
supposed to be doing, we wouldn't be here.

247
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,609
He's leaving. Come on.

248
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,376
She's 38 weeks. You
think it's Fifth disease?

249
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,972
What's that? It's
a viral infection.

250
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,049
It can infect the fetus.

251
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,880
Usually in the first 20
weeks of pregnancy,

252
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,796
and in women who have
trouble with their immune system.

253
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,380
History of drug use could have
compromised her immune system.

254
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,925
I told you I haven't used
anything in seven months.

255
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,790
It does look more
like a heat rash to me.

256
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,854
Yes, well, maybe we want to
look at the actual blood tests.

257
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,894
Of course.

258
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,893
Does she work for you? Yeah.

259
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,132
Everybody here works for you?

260
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,336
When this happens for real,
are you okay to deliver here?

261
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,345
Yeah, sure. Good.

262
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,016
Blood work's normal.

263
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,107
Test it again.

264
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,982
Tested it twice.

265
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,078
I'll get you some topical
cream for that rash.

266
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,884
I'm admitting her.

267
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,535
There's nothing wrong with her.

268
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,840
There are dozens of other
things this rash could indicate.

269
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,362
I want a full fetal workup.

270
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,464
You're losing it. That's what
happens when you have kids.

271
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,403
Ceaseless crying and
nagging leads to irrational fears.

272
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,184
It's impressive that you didn't wait
for the actual crying and nagging.

273
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,144
She had a lace-patterned rash,
joint pain and a history of drug abuse.

274
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,839
You would've done
exactly the same thing.

275
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,676
And I'd be an excellent father.

276
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,151
Hey, what are you doing?

277
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,379
Baby barf.

278
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,047
Maternity ward was
handing out free samples.

279
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,952
Well played, sir.

280
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,220
You leave me no
choice but to change.

281
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,556
My clothes, not my mind.

282
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,187
That's exactly my point.

283
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,307
It's not gonna be me and a cup.

284
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,475
It's gonna be eight times a day.

285
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,010
If you can't handle wearing that
stain, you can't handle a baby.

286
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,229
Why do you even care?

287
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,294
It's not like I'm ever
gonna ask you to baby-sit.

288
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,896
I'm a humanitarian.

289
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,574
We should stop him.

290
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,724
The whole point was to...

291
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,580
Let him plow into some
innocent bystander?

292
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,711
His legs are working. Obviously
his eyes are working, too.

293
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,264
His reaction time
could be slower.

294
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,288
He's stopping.

295
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,483
Yeah, I see.

296
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,724
He's having sleep sex.

297
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,955
Maybe.

298
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,020
Pull up to her. I know.

299
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,338
What'd that guy want?

300
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,875
Piss off.

301
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,501
Go after him.
She's not a hooker.

302
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,601
How do you know?

303
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,889
Do you want me to
describe the clues,

304
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:50,281
or do you want to stop him before he
finishes off the drugs he just bought?

305
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,063
Apparently, Rip's a coke fiend.

306
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,804
So, Sleeping Beauty has
a jones for Snow White.

307
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,470
Coke explains the narcolepsy,

308
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,036
narcolepsy explains
the sleepwalking.

309
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,616
But it doesn't explain the rip
in the space-time continuum.

310
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,676
Coke leads to sleepwalking,
which leads to coke,

311
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,913
which leads to sleepwalking.

312
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,512
What caused the
first sleepwalking?

313
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,766
The coke he took while
he was wide awake.

314
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,814
He says he didn't.

315
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,122
Wouldn't be the first time
somebody lied about drug use.

316
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,337
He has no reason to lie.

317
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,523
He knows he's sick,
his job doesn't drug test,

318
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,475
no relationship, his
daughter wouldn't find out.

319
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,024
Maybe he just forgot.

320
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,894
Forgot he did cocaine? You're
going with forgot over lying?

321
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:51,741
It fits. Cocaine explains the narcolepsy,
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.

322
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,804
Whatever's in the cocaine other than
the cocaine explains the memory loss.

323
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,801
Dealers cut that stuff
with all kinds of garbage.

324
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,561
Great. We'll start him on immediate
treatment for "all kinds of garbage."

325
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,951
You can narrow
it down in the lab.

326
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,044
Not without a sample.

327
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,453
So get a sample.

328
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,516
You want us to score
cocaine from a drug dealer?

329
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,651
It's exciting.

330
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,727
It's a felony.

331
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,387
It's necessary.

332
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,098
There she is. Amniotic
fluid looks good.

333
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,197
Good fetal movement,
heart's beating nicely.

334
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,446
What?

335
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,346
It looks like
pulmonary hypoplasia.

336
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,577
What's that?

337
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,449
The baby's lungs
are underdeveloped.

338
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,863
She won't be able to
breathe on her own.

339
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,719
She might die? I don't know.

340
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,469
If she was born today,
she'd be in trouble,

341
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,002
but we're not going
to let that happen.

342
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,824
We'll put you on
magnesium to prevent labor,

343
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,658
and steroids to grow the lungs.

344
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,062
It's a good thing
Dr. Cuddy brought you in.

345
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,914
How do you know what
a drug dealer looks like?

346
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,815
I'm not doing drugs, if
that's what you're asking.

347
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,585
I just noticed that she had cash in
her hand. Obviously came from him.

348
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,921
Obviously didn't have enough
time to perform any other services.

349
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,155
I didn't notice
her holding any...

350
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,374
Mmm. There she is.

351
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,284
We're not cops.

352
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,498
Cops aren't allowed
to say that, right?

353
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,683
Yeah, they can say it.

354
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,780
Oh!

355
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,021
But if you were a cop, you'd
know that. What do you want?

356
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,532
I'd like to buy some
cocaine, please.

357
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,433
Definitely not a cop.

358
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,504
Thank you.

359
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,577
Wait.

360
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,312
It's good. Glad you like
it, Pablo. Now can we go?

361
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,914
No. You gave us the wrong stuff.

362
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,468
What are you talking
about? You got my best.

363
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,104
I know. I don't want the good,
"get the new customer hooked" stuff.

364
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,098
I want the stepped-on, "keep the old
customer coming back for more" stuff.

365
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,427
Are you crazy, bitch?

366
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,525
No, I'm just a bitch who
knows what she wants.

367
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,372
Looks like this kid thing is
really working out for you.

368
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,571
All of the shopping,
none of the stretch marks.

369
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,978
Not a good time.

370
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,039
Right. Kid's getting worse.

371
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,575
Blessing in disguise,
although completely predictable.

372
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,487
If you take in strays, don't
be surprised by the worms.

373
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,699
I'm still wearing the sweater.

374
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,522
I didn't say you weren't stubborn,
I said you weren't maternal.

375
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,755
Thank you. Go away.

376
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,888
You're getting
crankier. Baby's sick.

377
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,058
Sorry I'm not
finding the fun in that.

378
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,831
Is it really worth it? Just for
the pursuit of unconditional love?

379
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,573
Only you could see
that as a bad thing.

380
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,767
It's a fake thing.

381
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,606
There's no unconditional
love, it's just unconditional need.

382
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,614
Don't make this child a
victim of your biological clock.

383
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,944
Victim?

384
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,781
You think she's
better off staying...

385
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,114
Yes.

386
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,179
'Cause at least she knows
she's not qualified for the job.

387
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,855
Let me guess. I'm gonna tell
her not to play ball in the house,

388
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,901
but she's not gonna listen. No.

389
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,563
Actually, I was going for she sneaks
her boyfriend in while you're sleeping,

390
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,970
and he wants to
do it on the desk,

391
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,737
and at first she says no, but
she has issues with self-esteem...

392
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,853
You know you're
gonna pay for that.

393
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,574
I'm paying for it right
now with wisdom.

394
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,009
Get out.

395
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,559
We found lactose. The coke
was cut with milk powder.

396
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,757
Makes it nutritious.

397
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,357
Not much of a toxin.

398
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,958
It is if he's allergic to milk.

399
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,312
He's not. There's
milk in his fridge.

400
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,702
How does he like his coffee?

401
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,011
I don't know. What does that...

402
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,098
What type of cereal's
in the cabinet?

403
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,666
Cocoa something. Why?
What does it matter?

404
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,544
He likes his coffee
black. Milk's for the kid.

405
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,603
How can you be sure?

406
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,844
Because if he drank the milk, he'd
know that he's lactose intolerant.

407
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,112
Ask him, then treat
him for allergic reaction.

408
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,087
If he gets better, we
all get to go home early.

409
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,149
Steroids make you
more prone to infection.

410
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,755
You'll have to stay here for the next
two weeks, so we can monitor you.

411
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,226
The baby's lungs, is
that because of the meth?

412
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,365
Could be.

413
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,871
You must hate me.

414
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,312
If you had done everything right in
your life, I wouldn't be getting a baby.

415
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,685
You're not scared?

416
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:32,757
I am scared.

417
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,686
You got, like,
this perfect life.

418
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,493
Not yet.

419
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,501
What's that?

420
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,003
Heart rate's climbing.

421
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,972
What's wrong with her?

422
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,670
It's not the baby, it's you.

423
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,774
I need two units
of O-negative, stat!

424
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,292
The mother had a Stage Two
placental abruption, she's losing blood.

425
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,699
So, deliver the baby.

426
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,466
Lungs are 10 weeks premature.

427
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,835
So, deliver now, risk the baby.

428
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,346
Deliver later, risk the mom.

429
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,848
It's not your baby
yet, it's not your call.

430
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,319
She'll do whatever
I tell her to do.

431
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,482
Self-worth issues...
That's genetic, you know.

432
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,919
You should deliver now.

433
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,495
Right.

434
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,566
Are you serious?

435
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,867
You're not? You just told me...

436
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,306
The wrong answer.

437
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,519
You can give the mom more blood.

438
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,920
You can't give the
fetus more lungs.

439
00:22:58,944 --> 00:22:59,944
The lungs might work.

440
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,844
It's the right
decision, medically.

441
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,712
And yet, you're here.

442
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,953
To get your opinion,
not to get jerked around.

443
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,887
See, this is what's
screwed up here.

444
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,467
You're not sure that
this is the right call,

445
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,691
but you are sure that this
is what you want to tell her.

446
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,526
And that scares you because
your motives aren't medical.

447
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,829
Some part of you
doesn't want this baby,

448
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,892
and that part wants
to tell her to kill it.

449
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,563
This is an impossible situation.

450
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,474
I'm advising her to
take the safest route.

451
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,908
Right.

452
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,244
Doesn't explain why you
changed your sweater.

453
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,695
I need your advice.

454
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,659
It's not cancer.

455
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,193
Wow! Can you remove
spleens with your mind, too?

456
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,105
You're here to talk about
Cuddy. The file is a pretext.

457
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,643
Why the hell haven't you
come to talk to me about Cuddy?

458
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,736
I've been doing all
sorts of insane stuff.

459
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,839
If she can't handle your
insanity, she can't handle a baby.

460
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,076
That's exactly my point.

461
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,243
No, it isn't.

462
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,796
You're feeling threatened because
she's going on to high school

463
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,016
and leaving you behind
to repeat the 8th grade.

464
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,684
She's sleeping with her math
teacher to get her diploma.

465
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,125
Adoption is cheating? Are
they giving her a fake kid?

466
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,662
That's the problem.

467
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,206
She gets to have a
relationship with a kid,

468
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,426
but she can't handle
one with an adult.

469
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,331
So she's gonna kill it.

470
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,926
That does seem cleaner.

471
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,206
I've seen the file. She's
making a judgment call.

472
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,038
Decisions are never
made in a vacuum.

473
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,375
Just like your decision
to make her miserable.

474
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,677
You're doing this because
we no longer have inkwells,

475
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,842
and Cuddy doesn't have pigtails.

476
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,450
Why do you think I did that?

477
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,992
How you doing?

478
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,965
Not sure.

479
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,196
Been keeping an eye
on the clock, like you said.

480
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,669
I don't think I lost any time.

481
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,800
The machinery agrees with you. That means
your problems were caused by the coke.

482
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,173
Can't believe I did coke.

483
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,506
You were asleep.

484
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,638
I chose to do coke.

485
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,511
In your sleep. You
weren't responsible.

486
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,881
Something inside
me wanted to do it.

487
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,011
Something inside of me
didn't think it was wrong.

488
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,349
It's like a dream.

489
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,947
We all do stuff in our dreams
we wouldn't do when we're awake.

490
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,322
I don't.

491
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,755
What's that?

492
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,497
Did I fall asleep
and hurt myself?

493
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,933
I don't see any cuts.

494
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,567
'Cause there aren't any.

495
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,077
I think

496
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,106
you're sweating blood.

497
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:56,749
The guy is bleeding out of his
pores. What does that tell us?

498
00:25:56,822 --> 00:26:00,452
Other than you don't want to play
basketball against him, and he's dying.

499
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,570
That neither cocaine or
allergies are the answer.

500
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,672
It's gotta be systemic.
Hemorrhagic virus maybe?

501
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,936
You think it's Ebola?

502
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,910
His white blood cell count would be
through the roof. It's not an infection.

503
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:09,934
DIC?

504
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,334
Coags are normal.

505
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,168
It's cancer. Leukemia
explains everything.

506
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,550
- No fever.
- The bleeding.

507
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,751
No weight loss. - The rash.

508
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,086
No Headaches. The fatigue.

509
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,942
Leukemia would be
obvious from the CBC.

510
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,174
Leukemia has false
negatives all the time.

511
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:30,152
So, we have four reasons for
leukemia, four reasons against.

512
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,485
You only need one against.

513
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:36,222
Yeah, if we had one reason for anything
else. Go do a bone marrow biopsy.

514
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,900
What would you do?

515
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,204
I think...

516
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,369
I think you should wait.

517
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,404
But if I wait, I could die.

518
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:59,077
There would be more
danger for you, but...

519
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,950
Is this your
opinion as a doctor,

520
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,716
as a mother?

521
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,223
It's my medical opinion.

522
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,858
It's my personal
opinion. I don't...

523
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,623
I don't wanna wait.

524
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,992
It might only be one week.
We will keep you on plasma.

525
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,004
This is not my baby.

526
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:24,099
I already sacrificed nine
months for this stupid mistake.

527
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,908
I don't wanna
sacrifice any more.

528
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:35,414
Becca, you asked my opinion
because you wanted to do the right thing.

529
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,185
You are giving up this baby because
you don't want to make the mistakes

530
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,092
your mom made, her mom made.

531
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:47,395
You have a chance to break this
cycle, to do something great for this baby.

532
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,895
No.

533
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,147
I need you to hold still.

534
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,184
Wait.

535
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:15,251
You been testing any
tanning creams or sprays?

536
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,386
No.

537
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,060
It's not a tan. Means
it's not leukemia.

538
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,468
Chem panel confirms
kidney failure, end stage.

539
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,737
Got him on dialysis?

540
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,301
BP's too low.

541
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,940
Too bad. Would have been nice to
have more than an hour to solve this thing.

542
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,142
Haemachromatosis?

543
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,276
He have tiny testes?

544
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,649
No. Scleroderma.

545
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,984
His skin's darker, not lighter.

546
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,286
As much fun as 20
Questions tends to be,

547
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,485
he's blowing blood
out of every orifice.

548
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,993
You think it just
might be vascular?

549
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,552
Vasculitis?

550
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:55,067
If I said it might be vitas gerular,
would you have said Vitas Gerulaitis?

551
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,568
Test him for vasculitis.
Angio and blood.

552
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:01,038
Even if we're right, he's going
to need a kidney transplant.

553
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,802
Test the daughter. She's 12.

554
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,173
Small kidney? It just
means he won't pee as much.

555
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,303
Great for road trips.

556
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,471
I meant she's a minor,

557
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:10,914
and Daddy has a conflict, so
we're gonna need Cuddy's sign-off.

558
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:11,983
So get it.

559
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,916
She's kind of busy.

560
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,220
Clamp.

561
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Suction.

562
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,064
Entering the abdominal cavity.

563
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,601
There's the head.

564
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,477
Got a minute?

565
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,313
Get out of here.

566
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,445
Who's that? CHASE:
Dr. Gregory House.

567
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,819
He's the one you'll be suing
when you develop sepsis.

568
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:51,948
Well, why is he here?

569
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,822
Better question
is, why is she here?

570
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,861
You're an administrator,
administrate.

571
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,739
My patient's daughter
needs a guardian ad litem.

572
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,107
That's it. HOUSE:
Tests are inconclusive,

573
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,091
but either way, he's gonna
need... House, get out!

574
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,601
This doesn't need you, I do.

575
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,668
Head's out.

576
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,305
Later.

577
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,396
Later's too late.

578
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,102
And there she is.

579
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,477
Come on, cry.

580
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,584
There we go.

581
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,113
Come on.

582
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:32,224
Come on. Joy, cry!

583
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,724
Cry, Joy.

584
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,166
I'm sorry.

585
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,698
I'm so sorry.

586
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,168
That's a sound we like to hear.

587
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,769
Apgar's 9 out of 10.

588
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,273
You hear that?

589
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,243
You just got your first A.

590
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,783
She's yours now.

591
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,968
Mazel tov.

592
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,083
Now it's time to say
those magic words you'll

593
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,944
be telling her for
the rest of her life,

594
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,071
"Mommy's gotta go to work."

595
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,564
Have the risks of the transplant
procedure been explained to you?

596
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,456
Damn it! I was hoping you
weren't going to ask her that.

597
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,891
Of course she knows. Can
you just sign the paperwork?

598
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,523
Dr. House explained to you that all
surgeries carry risks? You could die.

599
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,328
And if you don't
do it, Daddy will die.

600
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,868
Stop pressuring her.

601
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,028
Sorry. Daddy's
perfectly healthy.

602
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,547
But we want you to give
him the kidney anyway,

603
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,665
'cause it'd be cool
if he had three.

604
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,006
Shut up.

605
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,010
Do you understand the
risks of living with one kidney?

606
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,081
Yeah.

607
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,175
And you still want to
proceed with the transplant?

608
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,583
Yeah.

609
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,385
Okay. Go ahead.

610
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,959
No.

611
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,830
I'm saying you can proceed.

612
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,369
And I'm saying I can't.

613
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,666
Whatever he has, she has, too.

614
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,075
She's sleepwalking.

615
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,529
If we don't give him a new
kidney, he's dead in a week.

616
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:35,919
We have to transplant.

617
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,115
When your remote
has a dead battery,

618
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,251
you don't replace it with
another dead battery.

619
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,227
Whatever's killing
the dad's kidneys

620
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,405
is going to kill the kid's, too.

621
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,524
It is possible the sleep
issues aren't medically related.

622
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,501
Maybe they're both insomniacs
due to the turnpike noise,

623
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,538
maybe they both drink
too much coffee, maybe...

624
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:53,833
House is right.

625
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,905
How do you know?

626
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,204
Because the daughter
is sweating blood.

627
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,821
But if they have the same thing, it
means there has to be a common cause,

628
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,337
which means it has to be
a toxin, infection or genetic.

629
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,645
And since we've ruled
out infections and toxins...

630
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,550
It narrows it down to any one
of a dozen genetic disorders,

631
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,952
each of which takes
more than a week to run.

632
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,882
Call Foreman, get to work.

633
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,822
<i>Cuddy is positively aglow.</i>

634
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,391
What's your theory, she's only
acting happy to make you miserable?

635
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,528
I need a genetic disease.

636
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,197
I'm sure you're carrying a few.

637
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:30,970
Symptoms are kidney
failure, bleeding and insomnia.

638
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,704
You paid off the pool?

639
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,542
Technically, anyone who
didn't enter is a winner.

640
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:36,809
It's not over yet.

641
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,181
Everyone's happy until they
unwrap that pretty present

642
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,362
and find they got a wall
clock in the shape of Africa.

643
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,514
Adoption's a cheat, remember?

644
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:47,184
There's no real pregnancy, so
there's no stranded dopamine receptors,

645
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,728
so there's no
post-partum depression.

646
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,696
Cuddy will be the happiest
new mother you've ever seen.

647
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,998
I've just given you
the answer, haven't I?

648
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,438
And now you're going to walk
out of here without saying a word.

649
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,036
Nope.

650
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,540
Good news. I know what you have,

651
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,448
and you're both gonna be fine.

652
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,850
What? Are you serious?

653
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,255
Yes, and no.

654
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,656
So you do know what they have?

655
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,920
Yeah.

656
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,723
But they aren't
going to be fine.

657
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,821
No idea. They might be.

658
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,957
Why the hell would
you say they were?

659
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,433
To make them happy.

660
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,799
For two seconds?

661
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,805
Technically, to see
if they can be happy.

662
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:37,900
I should have seen a grin, a
twinkle, a sigh of relief, something.

663
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,671
They're sick, they're tired.

664
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,007
They're anhedonic.

665
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,741
Incapable of
experiencing pleasure.

666
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,749
Something's bushwhacked
their dopamine receptors.

667
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,684
They're depressed.
Mom's dead, Dad's dying.

668
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,120
You should know that being
bummed isn't necessarily a pathology.

669
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,954
Being bummed doesn't
explain their lack of friends,

670
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,618
or their indifference
to each other.

671
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,687
Why their place had no
music, no view, no decor.

672
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,608
But if you can't feel pleasure,
what's with the cocaine?

673
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:04,160
Really? Is that why you do
drugs? 'Cause you're happy?

674
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,329
Most people do them
'cause they wanna be happy.

675
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,305
His subconscious
craved it, needed it.

676
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:10,808
The most common cause of
anhedonia is schizophrenia.

677
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,104
Sure, in white folk.

678
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,475
They're black?

679
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,911
They're liars.

680
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,614
What's your name?

681
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,848
Jerry Harmon.

682
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:31,062
Your real name. Hosarian?
Herzog? H'Ali-Baba?

683
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,693
Hammoud.

684
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,665
Jamal Hammoud.

685
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:43,573
Changed it when we
invaded Iraq, the first time.

686
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,770
How did you know?

687
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:49,372
You and your daughter have
Familial Mediterranean Fever.

688
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,849
It's a genetic disease contracted
by people of Mediterranean descent.

689
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,751
Sephardic Jews,
Armenians, Arabs.

690
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,190
Causes anhedonia, seizures,
kidney failure, even lactose intolerance.

691
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,591
Symptoms are set
off by age and stress.

692
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,859
Kid couldn't get happy, but she
could get stressed by Daddy dying.

693
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,421
You don't know
if we'll get better?

694
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:12,335
Treatment tends to be hit and miss,
once you reach the sweating blood stage.

695
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,568
Start them on
colchicine and melphalan.

696
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,939
His kidneys are fried.

697
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,535
If he doesn't have FMF,
the colchicine will kill him.

698
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,410
Boy, I sure hope I'm right.

699
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,790
Mr. Harmon?

700
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,058
Mr. Harmon, I need
you to open your eyes.

701
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,959
Feeling better?

702
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,209
How's Samantha?

703
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,150
Healthy enough to
toss you a kidney.

704
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,624
Dad? Sammy.

705
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,943
Baby's doing great.

706
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,585
I can't imagine how
hard this must be for you.

707
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,789
I was stupid and selfish.

708
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:12,856
You were scared.

709
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,155
Yeah. But you
wouldn't have been.

710
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,094
That's not true.

711
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,155
Well, I mean, you
would have been scared,

712
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,791
but you would have done
the right thing anyway.

713
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,329
And I wanna be like that.

714
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:33,372
I don't wanna be a loser.

715
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,912
You're not a loser.

716
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:41,346
When I saw you hold her,
and the look on your face,

717
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,947
it was the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

718
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,192
And that's when I realized

719
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,096
I can't...

720
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,696
Becca.

721
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:07,969
My life, it's always been about
pain and anger and disappointment,

722
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,106
never about love.

723
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,913
And that's when I realized,
you know, it could be.

724
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,011
And I can't give that away.

725
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,754
Becca, don't do this.

726
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,263
What you're feeling is natural,

727
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:37,401
but you're filled with
hormones and emotion and fear.

728
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,322
And you just can't make a
huge decision like this right now,

729
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,508
you have to give it some time.

730
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,177
I'm so sorry.

731
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,288
It's a decision that
changes everything.

732
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,391
Changes the rest of your life.

733
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,425
I hope so.

734
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,198
It's really not the
greatest time for gloating.

735
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,877
There's more than
one baby in the sea.

736
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:31,116
The world is full of teenage
boys riding bareback.

737
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,350
No.

738
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:37,392
I'm done. I can't go
through that again.

739
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,397
You're quitting?

740
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,693
Just like you quit IVF?

741
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,859
Yeah. Just like that.

742
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,596
There, you just did it again.

743
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,474
It's too bad.

744
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,878
You would have
made a great mother.

745
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,451
You son of a bitch.

746
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,888
When I was getting a baby,
you told me I'd suck as a mother.

747
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:10,258
Now that I've lost it, you tell
me I'd be great as a mother.

748
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,230
Why do you need
to negate everything?

749
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,669
I don't know.

750
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,632
Good night.

751
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,230
Good night.
