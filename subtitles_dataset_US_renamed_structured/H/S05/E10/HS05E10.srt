1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:05,031
Do you want a lean body for
summer? Well, the time to start is now.

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,872
No gimmicks, no crash
diets, and absolutely no drugs.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,774
Think healthy, and be healthy.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,073
You can start now,

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,445
just pick up the phone and
become the best you you can be.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,946
Cut! Going again.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,714
Sorry. Did I mess
up the commercial?

8
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,277
No, it's fine. Are you okay?

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,086
I think it's cramps. Oh!
I'm burning on my side.

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,592
Sit down, take a few
minutes and catch your breath.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,821
Everybody else, keep running.

12
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,919
We're not filming.

13
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,522
We don't do this for the
cameras, we do it for ourselves.

14
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,176
We can't go again
with him sitting there.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,796
Fine. But that felt phony. At
least let me get a little workout,

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,932
maybe if I'm breathing as hard as they are
I won't seem like such an evil taskmaster.

17
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,772
All right, take five, guys.

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,107
How you feeling?

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,408
I think I'm ready to do this.

20
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,883
You sure? That's it. That's
the way to fight through.

21
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,480
All right, concentrate on
those knees, lean into it and lift.

22
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,287
Lifting. Lifting. Lifting.
Come on, push it!

23
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,327
Come on, you're
almost at the top.

24
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,626
Those eight steps are the
difference between fat and thin.

25
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:09,329
Seven, six, five, four,
one more. Nice job!

26
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,802
Feel that burn?

27
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,807
That's your body
carving out its new shape.

28
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:14,898
New shape.

29
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,002
Don't sit, just take it
slow on the way down.

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,410
Oh, boy.

31
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,583
Are you okay?

32
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,255
You okay?

33
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,863
Any idea why we're getting half
as many requests for you as usual?

34
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,534
Democrats' health care plan?

35
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,204
At least we have one
case that looks intriguing.

36
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,645
30-year-old fitness trainer
suddenly can't breathe,

37
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,876
collapses and breaks her ankle.

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,409
That's it? You're not gonna argue
why this case is beneath you?

39
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,184
No point, I'm in an
elevator. I can't run away.

40
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,088
You can't run away anyway.

41
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,626
That's just mean.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,028
Why are we still together?

43
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,332
We are going to our office.

44
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:54,569
Pronoun confusion, starts kicking in
once you pass the childbearing age.

45
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,373
Now that's just mean. My
office was recently destroyed.

46
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,279
I thought I'd use the office of
the doctor directly responsible.

47
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,925
I think the patient
holding the gun to my head

48
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,611
was actually the one
directly responsible.

49
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,281
My desk won't fit in his cell.
You can use our outer office.

50
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,093
Where's Foreman and Thirteen?

51
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,637
Down in the GRC.

52
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,381
Thirteen started her
clinical trials today.

53
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,896
What's Cuddy
doing in your office?

54
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,703
Other than throwing
off the feng shui

55
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,177
with her ass that faces all
eight sides of the Bagua at once?

56
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,907
These walls aren't soundproof.

57
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,141
I'm well aware.

58
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,275
Normal CT means
that her lung problem

59
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,670
has the distinction of having
nothing to do with her lungs.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,747
Steroids. No one looks
this fit without cheating.

61
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,019
Anabolic steroids hack
away at the immune system,

62
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,493
left her open to a
pulmonary infection.

63
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,657
Wow. Muscles and curves.
My penis is so confused.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,825
She's not on steroids.

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,061
Her program's all about
getting in shape naturally,

66
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,569
exercising, eating right.

67
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,104
And you know this because?

68
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,834
She has infomercials
to sell her DVDs.

69
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,102
What? I'm up late a lot.

70
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,407
And you actually believe what
you see on TV? Go run the labs.

71
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,347
The labs are back and
there's no sign of steroid use.

72
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,577
Can someone
please read her file?

73
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,415
Can someone please stop
back seat differential-ating?

74
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,681
What about allergies?

75
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,987
She goes jogging every morning,
inhales car fumes during rush hour.

76
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,995
Perfect, except that she was jogging
half a mile from the nearest road.

77
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,090
In the cold.

78
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:29,626
Cold air hits the lungs, sets off an
attack, exercise-induced asthma.

79
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,196
Nice try, except EIA doesn't
account for the elevated BP.

80
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,367
If you'd read the file...

81
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,901
Come on, before the
shrieking harpy melts my brain.

82
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,346
Her BP's fine. I know.

83
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,386
Exercise-induced
asthma actually fits.

84
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,285
I know. You know.
She can't know.

85
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,983
The only good
way to test for EIA

86
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,201
is to recreate the conditions
in which the attack occurred.

87
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,821
But we can't exactly make her
run out in the cold on a broken ankle.

88
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,091
Get creative.

89
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,763
It's gonna be okay.

90
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,005
Any shortness of breath?
Tightness in your chest?

91
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,338
Feeling pretty good, actually.

92
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,434
Not even breathing hard.

93
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,742
O2 sats and lung capacity
are still well within range.

94
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,491
Cuff's slipping down, you
wanna stop for a moment?

95
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,075
Rather not. Haven't had
any exercise in two days.

96
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,245
Take it you don't get
a lot of fat in your diet.

97
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,551
I take it from your tone
you think that's a bad thing.

98
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,783
Do you ever indulge?

99
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,417
There's more to life than
indulging your every whim.

100
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,293
I didn't say "every." But a whim every
now and then can make life a little...

101
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,025
You okay? Trouble breathing?

102
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,862
No, I feel fine. Why?

103
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,202
No pulse. This isn't asthma.

104
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,583
There are a lot of
other people in the trial?

105
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,518
I'm taking over the people that already
started it at Mercy, so I'm pretty full.

106
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,648
Stop.

107
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,217
One more time. No talking.

108
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,333
I shouldn't be
here. It's nepotism.

109
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,301
I know the guy running
the drug trial, so I get a spot.

110
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,500
You have Huntington's,
so you get a spot. Stop.

111
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,005
One more time. Just
the fingers, no mouth.

112
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,874
The point of this thing is to
improve neural cell longevity,

113
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,361
which doesn't matter
much before symptoms,

114
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,528
so you should give
my spot to someone...

115
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,850
Shut up.

116
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,989
Stop.

117
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,225
You can stop feeling guilty.

118
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,657
Your best tapping rate was
.004 taps per millisecond.

119
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,498
Means your nerves
have started degenerating.

120
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:37,487
You want to work in
here? Fine. Me, too.

121
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:42,495
We'll split the desk 50-50. That
side's yours, this side's mine.

122
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,689
You're right.

123
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,229
There's plenty of space here,
neither one of us needs all of it.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,465
That's your strategy? Taking the
high road? It's not going to work.

125
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,869
Huh? Did you say something?

126
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,502
I couldn't hear you from all the
way over here on my side of the desk.

127
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,943
Patient's heart stopped.

128
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,412
We shocked her back to
sinus rhythm, she's stable.

129
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,916
Test didn't set it off,
her EKG was normal.

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,354
Well, she's consistent.

131
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,913
Lung problems have
nothing to do with her lungs,

132
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,222
heart problem that has
nothing to do with her heart.

133
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,194
Something is
strangling her system.

134
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,285
Carcinoid tumor.

135
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,065
Find it, cut it out.

136
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,537
Can a leaking breast
implant cause joint pain?

137
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:38,051
No, and she clearly doesn't have
implants. Or joint pain. What's going on?

138
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,552
Got another patient.

139
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,886
I set up an online
second opinion clinic.

140
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,824
People who don't like or trust
their doctors e-mail symptoms,

141
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,118
I can knock off four
or five cases over

142
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,796
lunch, clear two grand
by e-mailing them back.

143
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,457
Ascending colon's clean.

144
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,693
That's gotta be illegal.

145
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,293
Only in nine states,
and this isn't one of them.

146
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,271
Legal notice spells out it
doesn't replace doctor's visits,

147
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,240
so there's no opportunity
for malpractice.

148
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,451
How come you haven't
said anything about this?

149
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,944
It's no big secret. I guess
I'm just not very chatty.

150
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,209
You told us when you renewed your
subscription to <i>National Geographic.</i>

151
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,080
Small intestine looks clean,
moving into the pylorus.

152
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,382
So you don't mind
if I tell House?

153
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:18,391
Actually, House may sort of mind. Because
I sort of set it up in House's name.

154
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,954
Nothing in the bile duct.

155
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,861
And by "set it up in
his name," you mean?

156
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,797
I mean, it's Dr. Gregory
House's Second Opinion Clinic

157
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,496
with medical advice direct
from Dr. Gregory House.

158
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,768
You're insane.
With two days to live.

159
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,069
House's never gonna find out.

160
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,575
He will if I tell him.

161
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,442
Or you cut me in for 30%,
and I keep your secret safe.

162
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,777
That's blackmail.

163
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:43,873
Yes.

164
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,879
Moving into the... Whoa.

165
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,257
That's her stomach? It's
the size of a shot glass.

166
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,694
Because our patient's
a big, fat cheater.

167
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,733
Subtle. No way you geniuses
could have spotted this.

168
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,799
Gastric bypass surgery,
she had her stomach stapled,

169
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:14,246
then had the records from her files
pulled so it wouldn't ruin her DVD sales.

170
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,306
Can you do this outside?

171
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,614
I could. But that would defeat
the purpose of doing it here.

172
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,952
Where are the smart guys?

173
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,512
If you mean
Foreman and Thirteen,

174
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,856
apparently the first appointment
of the drug trial is an all-day thing.

175
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,189
I said yes to this?

176
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,805
Her gastric bypass
procedure could cause...

177
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,264
Forget the bypass,
treat her like a fat girl.

178
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,268
Should we treat her like a
60-year-old Asian man, too?

179
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,428
She's not fat.

180
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:40,770
Not on the outside, but on
the inside she's still tons of fun.

181
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,907
When she was obese, she
probably had Type 2 diabetes,

182
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,655
could have left her with
permanent nerve damage.

183
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,413
Ten points for doing what I said,
minus ten points for doing it badly.

184
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,182
If this was diabetes-induced nerve
damage, it would've kicked in years ago.

185
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,621
Have you seen my balls?

186
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,085
Can you hold on a second?

187
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,360
My balls. Have you seen my
balls? The giant one and the red one.

188
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,631
Your plan isn't going to work.

189
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,793
Of course it is.

190
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,733
I try to make you
miserable to make you leave.

191
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,247
You deny that it's
making you miserable,

192
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,797
you try to make me miserable
so I'll stop making you miserable.

193
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,601
And eventually
you will leave, citing

194
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,708
reasons that have
nothing to do with misery.

195
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,507
You're not bothering me.

196
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,639
Step one, complete.

197
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:27,551
I'm gonna call you from my cell.
And then I will come back in here.

198
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,454
Hey. Yeah, I just had to
explain to him that I had his balls,

199
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,052
and he's not getting
them back. Excuse me.

200
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,323
Sleep apnea explains...

201
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,456
Apnea would've
disappeared when she shrank.

202
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,330
Not if it destroyed the
musculature of her trachea.

203
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,241
Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain,
the resulting neurological damage...

204
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,328
She been snoring?

205
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,429
She didn't mention it.

206
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,442
Did she mention feeling
tired after a full night's sleep?

207
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,842
No, but... HOUSE:
This isn't apnea.

208
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,547
And this is a stupid room
to be doing a DDX in.

209
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:06,956
Cliff notes. Gastric bypass only
makes her skinny on the outside.

210
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,690
On the inside we have heart and lung
issues not caused by heart and lung issues.

211
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,028
Private area,
House. It can wait.

212
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,578
You need to consider side-effects
from her gastric bypass surgery.

213
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,070
Forget the bypass.

214
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,627
Let the dying girl finish.

215
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,606
You said forget
the bypass... Shh.

216
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,172
Dr. Thirteen has the floor.

217
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,509
Bypass could create malabsorption
issues, leads to low potassium.

218
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,105
Very stupid. Her
potassium is fine.

219
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,679
But her intestines aren't.

220
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,620
Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption
by creating a blind loop of bowel.

221
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,367
It ulcerates during exercise,
bacteria get loose in the blood stream,

222
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,757
migrate to the heart and lungs.

223
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,692
Very not stupid.

224
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,095
Bacteria in the bowels means
there's bacteria in the poop.

225
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,792
Get some and test it.

226
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,426
He could have come up with
SIBO anywhere else in the hospital.

227
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,513
You didn't need to come
down here and screw with us.

228
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,030
But her wrong idea led to his
right one. It was a vital screwing.

229
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,972
We think your surgery might have
caused an infection called SIBO.

230
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:05,644
A stool test will help us to confirm.
Put some of what you're full of in here.

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,353
If surgery could somehow make
you taller, wouldn't you do it?

232
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,518
Sure, but I wouldn't call a
meeting of the Lollipop Guild

233
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,225
and tell them they can grow
if they work real hard at it.

234
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,359
I don't tell anyone not
to get gastric bypass.

235
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,495
I tell them how to get healthy,
how to improve their lives.

236
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,301
Yeah, by telling them to do
what you were unwilling to.

237
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,069
I was willing to do anything.

238
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,306
Thyroid hormones, crash
diets, none of it worked.

239
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,347
My body was like a prison.

240
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:39,910
When I got the surgery, I got healthy
and when I got healthy, I got happy.

241
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,788
I'm not sure you're happy.

242
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,485
But if you are, being healthy
didn't do it, being pretty did.

243
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,118
Poop in the bedpan.

244
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,356
House's office? Really?

245
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,799
Did he send you
here to beg for it back?

246
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,267
There are dozens
of other doctors...

247
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,239
Other doctors actually use their offices
for crazy stuff like seeing patients,

248
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,741
not throwing a ball against
the wall and calling it work.

249
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,869
It's his process.
That ball saves lives.

250
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,913
Did he give you talking points?

251
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,845
Yeah, but I added one of my own.

252
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:13,376
Don't take his office and pretend
like all you're doing is taking his office.

253
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,752
You chose his room
because you want to be there.

254
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:20,055
But sitting near him and
hoping isn't going to get it done.

255
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,824
Leave here now or
I'll take your office.

256
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,594
No, you won't.

257
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,041
The boob lady e-mailed me again,
complaining of chronic fatigue now.

258
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,373
She's convinced the
implants are responsible.

259
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,934
They're not. I told her.

260
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,173
She says something is
and if I don't find out what

261
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,614
she's gonna complain
to the Licensing Board.

262
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,912
It's not funny. It is.

263
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,386
You just can't appreciate it because
it's going to destroy your career.

264
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,091
What happened? Did he call
Foreman clean and articulate again?

265
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,320
It is surprising.

266
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,829
Clinic patient's just whining.

267
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,057
What's the poop?

268
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,109
It's going to take about an
hour to spin down the sample.

269
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,795
What are we looking for?

270
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,496
You don't know?

271
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,665
I'm doing my famous Socrates impression.
Think I really nailed the accent.

272
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,936
High fat content indicates SIBO.

273
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,478
And what does fat do in water?

274
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,569
It floats.

275
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,444
And what else floats in water?

276
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,317
The correct answer is a duck.

277
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,419
If it doesn't float,
Kutner missed the boat.

278
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,534
Looks like I was
wrong to dismiss apnea.

279
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,199
You guys can stay up all
night gloating in the sleep lab.

280
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,625
What about all that scar tissue
around the implant, could that be...

281
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,743
That amount of encapsulation
is perfectly normal.

282
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:52,945
I gotta tell her something.

283
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,597
Tell her to find a decent plastic
surgeon who can correct the placement...

284
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,261
Yeah, that's what she wants to
hear, she's sick and she's lopsided.

285
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,125
Tell her it's a virus. It probably is, and
it'll get her off your back for a few...

286
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,061
Emmy's EEG is flat-lining.

287
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,028
Where would she have gone?

288
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,604
Hey, I looked for you guys in the
control room, but you seemed busy.

289
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,440
Get off of there, last time you
exercised you had a cardiac incident.

290
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,571
I feel fine. You
felt fine last time.

291
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,740
I only slept a couple
of hours but I feel great.

292
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,092
Can I get one of those machines?

293
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,360
You're running
on a broken ankle.

294
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,408
It doesn't hurt.

295
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,148
And your leg is bleeding.

296
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,692
You feel that?

297
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,059
What does that mean?

298
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,131
The numbness in her left
foot is ascending into her leg.

299
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,503
How'd she manage
to sneak out for a run?

300
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,304
She said she needed
to use the bathroom.

301
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,811
You two get the results
of the sleep apnea test,

302
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,609
or did those need to
use the bathroom, too?

303
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,876
Alpha waves on
the EEG ruled it out.

304
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,512
I was mixing some hydrogen
sulphide for good and valid reasons

305
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,682
and must have spilled
some on my side.

306
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,123
Did it waft over to your side?

307
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,353
Cunning plan.

308
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,362
You do realize it's going to
stink for hours, on both sides.

309
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,897
Oh! Would you look at the time?

310
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:17,067
I hope your patient isn't still sick,
forcing you to stay here all night.

311
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,185
Ascending numbness means
her nerves are breaking down.

312
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,253
Or her brain.

313
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,711
Or both.

314
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,270
We've gotta go. Let me
finish, I'll meet you down there.

315
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,875
You were 15 minutes late yesterday.
I don't want you to develop bad habits.

316
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,146
Appreciate the life lesson,

317
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,779
but 15 minutes, give or take,
isn't going to make a difference.

318
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,348
Get started on your other patients, I'll
be down there when we're done here.

319
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,827
Way to know where your
bread is buttered, sister. Up high.

320
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,735
If the problem is in her
brain, it could be MS.

321
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,062
Or early onset Parkinson's.

322
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,068
But if it's her nerves, it
could be transverse myelitis.

323
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,070
Or a million other things.

324
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,402
We're gonna stay in the
dark until we can figure out

325
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:58,433
if her electrical problem is in her
power station or in the high tension wires.

326
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:05,617
Power station's the brain, wires
are the nerves. Run an NCV test.

327
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,534
The test will measure the
amount of time it will take

328
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,686
this electrical impulse to
travel along your nerves.

329
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,229
Will it hurt? No.
Give me your arm.

330
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,662
You can ask nicely.

331
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,562
I learned in med school, you
don't actually cure with kindness.

332
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,942
You're right, I'm a hypocrite.

333
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,908
But I don't have a choice.

334
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,140
Not really interested
in your rationalizations.

335
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,741
If I'm open about the gastric bypass,
no one would listen to me anymore.

336
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,649
You mean no one
would buy your DVDs.

337
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:43,554
It's not about the DVD
sales. I'm helping people.

338
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,788
My clients are making themselves
healthy. They're living better lives.

339
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,661
Can you honestly tell me you've
never done anything hypocritical?

340
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,999
I'm sure you had good reasons.

341
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,701
Give me your arm, please.

342
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,041
Keep your arm raised.

343
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,451
Does this mean something
is wrong with my nerves?

344
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,753
No. It's your muscles.

345
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,226
We don't need to run this
test. It's not what we thought.

346
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,752
She has muscle weakness,
could indicate myasthenia gravis.

347
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,049
Yeah.

348
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,419
Also could be
some kind of toxin.

349
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,788
Excuse me. Are you going
up to the personnel floors?

350
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,157
I'm going to see Dr. House.

351
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,627
Do you have an
appointment with him?

352
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,460
We've been emailing.

353
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,329
Joint pain and
fatigue thanks to these.

354
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,423
I'm sure it's nothing.

355
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,991
Oh, now this.

356
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,465
He's actually downstairs.

357
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,270
Gone. Gone for the day.

358
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,641
But we work for him, we
can set you up in the ER.

359
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,794
The antibiotics will make her feel
better, she's out of here by morning.

360
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,719
If it is a staph
infection. It's gotta be.

361
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:25,121
She has sleeves of tattoos and
piercings from God knows where.

362
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:29,026
She has muscle weakness,
could indicate myasthenia gravis.

363
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:36,125
I had the weirdest dream, you guys did
the test in a reasonable amount of time

364
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:39,138
and came back here before
I had time to fall asleep.

365
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,134
You guys still smell that?

366
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,778
Maybe you should just
let her have your office?

367
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,473
Or...

368
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,524
She sends one of
yours to the hospital,

369
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,642
send one of hers to the morgue.

370
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,516
It's not myasthenia gravis,

371
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,489
her breathing's improving and
the weakness is in her extremities.

372
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,655
Could be a botulinum reaction.

373
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,597
I don't think sabotaging your
boss' office is a wise counterattack.

374
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,602
All that is needed for evil to
succeed is for good men to do nothing.

375
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,681
She probably used a lot of
Botox to tighten up her skin.

376
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:16,767
True. Could also be any
kind of heavy metal toxicity.

377
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,969
PSP or arsenic from
eating too much seafood,

378
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,139
cadmium from bad bottled water,

379
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,184
lead or nickel from canned
fruits or natural grains.

380
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:32,181
I don't think replacing that
was part of the renovation plans.

381
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,692
It is now.

382
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,924
Lucky for us, we can treat all those
toxins with the same thing, chelation.

383
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,838
You never showed up.

384
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,469
Get out of my house.

385
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,638
I wanted to find proof
that you were slipping

386
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:56,515
back into your
self-destructive pattern,

387
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,551
confirm you weren't
worth my time.

388
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,746
Instead I found this.

389
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,391
You've followed all of my
instructions to the letter,

390
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,394
probably better than
any patient I have.

391
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,260
So why are you the only one who
can't show up for appointments?

392
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,276
I came down right after I
was finished with House.

393
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,633
You were in your office
with another patient.

394
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,129
And there was another
patient in the waiting room.

395
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,238
Janice.

396
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:26,221
I'm well aware of what's going to happen
to my body over the next eight to 10 years.

397
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,807
I do not need a visual reminder
every time I walk into that place.

398
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,677
That's understandable.

399
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,356
It's human.

400
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,129
And you need to get over it.

401
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,598
Now, you show up on time
tomorrow or you don't show up at all.

402
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,606
Your mom is leaving. You're
gonna regret this the rest of your life.

403
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,284
The chelation didn't work, her
muscles are still deteriorating.

404
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:11,450
Rules out toxins. So what else that can
go wrong when the <i>Hindenburg</i> deflates?

405
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,219
Why aren't we doing
this in your office?

406
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:17,388
Obviously because it would be stupid
to do this in an office with no furniture.

407
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,332
Cuddy overreacted
to my overreaction.

408
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,165
Coronaro-cardiac fistula.
Even a small hole could cause...

409
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,933
They start in the
lungs, not the heart.

410
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:31,341
And why are you leaning on a 45
degree angle away from Foreman?

411
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,302
I'm sitting straight.

412
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,848
Trouble in the
Land of False Hope?

413
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,942
Everything is fine.
Austrian syndrome.

414
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:43,012
Nice deflection, but our patient
doesn't drink, she's a health nut.

415
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,751
And even if I was a cynical
guy and thought she was a liar,

416
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,386
I would have done a tox screen which
would've come back negative for alcohol.

417
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,301
You should come to these
gatherings more often,

418
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,958
keep you from
looking like an idiot.

419
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,471
You making book or did something
else happen to our patient?

420
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,201
Personal. I'll
put it on vibrate.

421
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,508
Guillain-Barré.

422
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:10,413
Usually starts as a muscle pain patients
compare to the pain of over-exercising.

423
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,951
So who's paging you? Your wife?

424
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,078
Does it worry you that
she paged Kutner first?

425
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,647
Guillain-Barré fits, patient
didn't notice the initial symptoms

426
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,455
because it's no different
than how she feels every day.

427
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,520
Her muscle weakness is
the precursor to full paralysis.

428
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,366
Gastric bypass
probably set it off.

429
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,700
At what price beauty? Go
start her on plasmapheresis.

430
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:44,445
<i>She put the lime in the
coconut She drank it all up</i>

431
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,816
<i>She put the lime in the
coconut She drank it all up</i>

432
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,721
Deedee? Can you stop singing?

433
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,727
Musical automatism, she could be
having a partial seizure right now.

434
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:56,794
You need to get House.

435
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,057
Deedee!

436
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,395
Yelling at her is not gonna
be an effective treatment.

437
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,833
She's faking. It's
a cry for attention.

438
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,369
Her brain could be misfiring.

439
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,430
Right, a rare neurological disorder is
far more likely than a cry for attention.

440
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,840
I mean, nothing about this
woman screams "look at me."

441
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,310
On the other hand, look at her.

442
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:20,082
She needs a full neurological
work-up. Get House.

443
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,920
Ultimate irony. I killed myself
trying to make myself healthy.

444
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,452
You're not dying, okay?
This disease is manageable.

445
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,363
Better start getting
used to that wheelchair.

446
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,766
Self-pity doesn't suit you.

447
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,915
Just take me down to the...

448
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,737
No. You're strong
enough to walk.

449
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,834
Come on, get your
ass out of bed and walk.

450
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,716
Could be an aneurysm, we've
got to control her blood pressure,

451
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,421
start her on a calcium
channel blocker.

452
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,089
Or you could tell House.

453
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,655
I can't tell House.

454
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,132
You'll be in trouble.

455
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,964
On the other hand, she's sick.

456
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,094
She's singing.

457
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,265
And bleeding out of her
ears and losing her hair.

458
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,017
And an aneurysm doesn't
explain her joint pain.

459
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,168
Wilson's disease does.

460
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,608
No Kayser-Fleischer rings.

461
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,677
Anorexia.

462
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,077
Now you're just desperate.

463
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,344
Biliary tumor causing
paraneoplastic syndrome.

464
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:29,515
That might actually
fit. I'll scan to confirm.

465
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,491
You'd do that for me?
You don't have the time.

466
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,019
Which means I can ask for 25% of
your income and you'll give it to me.

467
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,470
You going over the fence?

468
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,874
It took three visits, but I
finally convinced the contractor

469
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:56,348
that I'm Cuddy's boss and all the office
renovation plans need to go through me.

470
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,509
You did do the
math on this, right?

471
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,096
Screwing with her office means
her renovations will take longer,

472
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,146
means she'll be in
your office longer.

473
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:08,058
See there? I'm having a
bidet put in instead of a toilet.

474
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,824
Not in addition to, instead of.

475
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,888
You want to know what
happened to the old toilet?

476
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,561
She'll be with you where
you claim to not want her.

477
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,504
I smashed it with
a sledgehammer.

478
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,837
I think in some ancient cultures

479
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,537
that was actually considered
a proposal of marriage.

480
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:31,706
Is this fun for you? Analyzing
everyone else's fun away?

481
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,083
Ask her out, it'll cost
the hospital a lot less.

482
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,523
I brought some
visitors. Cheer you up.

483
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,429
It's okay, come on in, guys.

484
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,058
We're all staying on your
plan. Nobody's cheating.

485
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:53,071
That's great. You're on my arm.

486
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:57,633
We found out about your gastric
bypass. How could you lie to us like that?

487
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,611
The doctors told you?
You're really hurting my arm.

488
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,478
You're not the best
you you can be.

489
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,447
You're a fraud. You're
a self-hating fat person.

490
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,830
You're really hurting me.

491
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,288
Feel the burn.

492
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,018
Burn. Burn.

493
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,616
Help. Help!

494
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,527
Burn. Burn! Burn!

495
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,428
Burn! Burn! Burn!
Burn! Burn! Help!

496
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,830
Get off of me! Get off
of me! Get off of me!

497
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,413
Mood congruent hallucinations.

498
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,890
Means it's not Guillain-Barré.

499
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,713
Which means whatever
it is, it's now in her brain.

500
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,782
Where are you going?

501
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,846
Sorry. Treatment.

502
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,155
Does Foreman schedule your
appointments by numbers on the clock,

503
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,938
or just by when I'm in
the middle of something?

504
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:53,865
Sorry if I'm dying at a bad time
for you. Could be CNS lymphoma.

505
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,492
So losing the 200 pounds
was just a coincidence?

506
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,234
What about a prion disease?

507
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,203
If her brain is slowly
turning into a Swiss cheese,

508
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,907
there's not a lot we can do.

509
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,147
There are some
possible treatments.

510
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,049
Get a brain biopsy to confirm.

511
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,021
You are not cutting into this
woman's brain before you test.

512
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,785
That is the test.

513
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,417
Not for CNS lymphoma,

514
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:26,864
which is a perfectly legitimate diagnosis,
one you can test for non-invasively.

515
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,197
You're, obviously, not
opposed to being invasive.

516
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:33,865
Rule out CNS lymphoma
first, then rule out astrocytoma,

517
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,635
then rule out other
brain tumors...

518
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,707
I hereby declare them ruled out.

519
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,269
Run the tests.

520
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,180
You can do a brain biopsy,
but only as a last resort.

521
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,148
Start running down Cuddy's
list of "Diseases it's not."

522
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,097
You're not stopping
me for medical reasons.

523
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,563
You're stopping me because
you have the hots for me.

524
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,174
You're still here because
you have the hots for me.

525
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,373
Evidenced by the fact that I'm
the one who moved into your office.

526
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,487
It's the biggest office.
And I'm not the one that...

527
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:22,216
Why are you dressed like that? Why
do you try so hard to get my attention?

528
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,454
Are you screwing with me?

529
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,551
Are you screwing with me?

530
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,793
Depends on your answer.

531
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,101
Everybody knows this
is going somewhere.

532
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:44,305
I think we're
supposed to kiss now.

533
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,639
We already did that.

534
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,890
Seemed like the
logical next step.

535
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:58,980
Really?

536
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,521
I'm an idiot for
being surprised.

537
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,594
Can you leave these?

538
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,499
I'll keep coming. But can you
change my appointment time?

539
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,660
Can't. Schedule's full.

540
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,934
You're stuck with her,
might as well get to know her.

541
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,825
Your head MRI was clean, means
you don't have CNS lymphoma.

542
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,019
What's next on the list?

543
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,153
Other types of brain tumors.

544
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,492
Can we stop at the cafeteria?

545
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:46,707
I can have something
brought up for you.

546
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,030
What do you want?
Chocolate cake.

547
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,969
You can't give up. We're
going to figure this out.

548
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:00,376
What am I supposed to be hoping
for? That you find a brain tumor?

549
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,946
What else could it be?

550
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,014
You were so hard
on me about lying.

551
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,249
How about you take some of your
own advice and tell me the truth?

552
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,817
What's next on the list?

553
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,453
Prion disease.

554
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,921
And if that's what
I got? How bad?

555
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,566
There are a few treatments.
But there's no guarantee.

556
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,105
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,574
And you won't let me
have a piece of cake?

558
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,891
Where's Cuddy?

559
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,723
It's not CNS lymphoma.

560
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,799
I know.

561
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,212
She's getting worse,
you want me to find Cuddy

562
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,501
and get her approval
for the brain biopsy?

563
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:07,168
When you were philandering
with impunity, how did that feel?

564
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:14,650
Superficially, I loved it, but
deep down I think I was miserable.

565
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,881
Why? What's going on?

566
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,184
You weren't miserable.

567
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,156
You gave something away
to make a relationship work,

568
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,755
you rationalized that you're
getting something back.

569
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,501
Okay. I'm gonna go get Cuddy's
approval for the brain biopsy.

570
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,871
Leave them there. I'm
gonna do the biopsy myself.

571
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,608
Cuddy wanted us to
eliminate seven different things.

572
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,444
Cuddy doesn't always
get what she wants.

573
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,960
Bad idea to get into a power play
with somebody who has the power.

574
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:50,115
You're fired. Just
reinforcing your point.

575
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,023
Whatever personal drama you're
playing out, you'd be a lot smarter to...

576
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,659
I thought you said she was sick.

577
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:09,269
Sick people don't
spontaneously get better.

578
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,867
Yes, they do, it's called
an immune system.

579
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,738
Sick people who are sick
enough to make it to me

580
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,305
don't spontaneously get better.

581
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:20,716
Not as pithy, but yeah,
technically more accurate.

582
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,049
What's the last
thing you gave her?

583
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,680
I took her for a
MRI looking for...

584
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,089
MRIs detect, they don't treat.

585
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,649
What did you give
her after the MRI?

586
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:32,323
I didn't give her anything, she got
depressed at the lack of direction.

587
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,764
We went to the cafeteria
for some chocolate cake,

588
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,201
took her to her room, hung
a banana bag, let her rest.

589
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,900
You gave her cake?

590
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,305
She asked for it, I figured...

591
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,834
You figured you'd let me play 20
questions instead of just telling me.

592
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,723
Feeling crappy again?
I've brought your cure.

593
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,320
I'd give you an IV of the stuff,

594
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:10,165
but the frosting tends to
get stuck in the little tube.

595
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,430
Is this a joke?

596
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:15,770
It's not a joke, not a lie, not an
attempt to defraud in any way.

597
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,710
Just an actual licensed
physician with an actual diagnosis.

598
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,214
Hereditary coproporphyria.

599
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:33,286
Your face is genetically blessed,
your body chemistry is slightly less so,

600
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,661
doesn't make enough of a certain
enzyme that I can't pronounce,

601
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,359
but it's apparently important
for your liver and everything else.

602
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,993
Treatment is a high-carb
diet, rich in sugar.

603
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,834
When you were a porker,
you were self-medicating.

604
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,339
So this is treatable?

605
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,205
We just have to reverse
your gastric bypass

606
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,144
and get you back on a
high-carb, glucose enriched diet.

607
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,546
The best you you can
be is a lot more you.

608
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,046
Open the hangar,
here comes the plane.

609
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,146
There's nothing
else you can try?

610
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,887
No. There's a drug that manages
the symptoms but it's not a cure.

611
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,620
Let's try that.

612
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,864
You don't want to
have the surgery?

613
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,973
Understand.

614
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,496
There's not many people
who have the guts to

615
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,713
admit they'd rather
be pretty than healthy.

616
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,249
Income's better and
you get more action.

617
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,554
We'll start you on your
drug treatment right away.

618
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,019
I bought it. I bought
that it was really about

619
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,894
trying to make people's
lives a little better.

620
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,363
You're surprised
she's superficial?

621
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,991
You're a plastic surgeon.
This is the human condition.

622
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,535
No, she's a freak.

623
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,546
Every time you put someone
under to bob their nose,

624
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,095
you were risking their life.

625
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,808
What?

626
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,741
No singing. She's better.

627
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,094
No one was supposed to
let my patient leave her bed.

628
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,279
She had a respiratory arrest,

629
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:11,221
we coded her nearly 20
minutes, but she didn't make it.

630
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:18,760
House is an unemotional child
incapable of intimacy or romance.

631
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,958
Trust me. It's done.

632
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,295
It's perfect.

633
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,164
I like the desk.
A lot of character.

634
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,838
That's not the one I ordered.

635
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,841
This is my desk from med school.

636
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,415
You have it in
storage or something?

637
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,714
My mom did.

638
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,913
That was sweet
of her to do that.

639
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,947
She didn't. My mom has
no idea I'm redoing my office.

640
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,239
I lied to you the other night.

641
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:13,384
That woman in the waiting room,
she didn't freak me out about my future.

642
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,051
She freaked me
out about my past.

643
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,421
Your mother.

644
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,527
Must have been
horrible watching her die.

645
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,359
I wanted her to die.

646
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,201
She just yelled so much.

647
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,738
And for no reason. Just screamed
at me in front of my friends.

648
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,685
My father tried to explain to me
that her brain was literally shrinking,

649
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:53,589
that she didn't mean it,
that it was the disease.

650
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,524
But I didn't care.

651
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,553
I hated her.

652
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,499
I never said goodbye,

653
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,039
and she died with me hating her.

654
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,792
Did Chase test for
the biliary tumor?

655
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,855
He said it was negative.

656
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,027
She was stable when he left her.

657
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,946
We should have found
more time, we should have...

658
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,666
House is gonna kill us.

659
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,006
Slowly

660
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,469
and painfully.

661
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,580
You're not only idiots, you're
frauds. Fraudulent idiots.

662
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,781
Fraudulent idiotic
killers, as it turns out.

663
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,519
House, this was really
my... Your fault, yeah!

664
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,890
For pretending to be me when
you're not even competent.

665
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,489
And your fault for not ratting him
out while the patient was still alive.

666
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:14,436
What she had was easily
treatable, she could have been fine.

667
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,568
Damn treatment's so simple.

668
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,506
It might still be possible.

669
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,707
House?

670
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,916
House? House,
she's clearly dead.

671
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,147
Oh, God! Oh, God!

672
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,019
She was dead.

673
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:39,553
She wasn't dead. She
wasn't even sick, you moron.

674
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:44,430
Seriously, how good was she? No
formal training. At least not in acting.

675
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,765
Did you see their faces?

676
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,035
I think we may have an
anal hygiene violation there.

677
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,268
So the CT?

678
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,005
That was from a patient three
years ago. That was hard to find.

679
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,569
But the hair, makeup,

680
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,208
getting Chase and Cameron
to play along, much easier.

681
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,447
We deserved it. I'll take
down the website before...

682
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,252
Take it down? You kidding? It's
way too lucrative to shut it down.

683
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,589
For Chase, for me.

684
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:12,689
I earn 50% for letting
you use my name.

685
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,765
Chop, chop, go to work,
first dollars go to expenses.

686
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,702
I booked our little thespian
here for two full days.

687
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,501
That's three G's I owe her.

688
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,541
And you still got
three hours left.

689
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,807
Do I?
