1
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,449
Let's stay focused, Johnny.

2
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,626
What are you looking at?

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,925
Who is she?

4
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,996
That's Miss Cindy,
Zeke's new aide.

5
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,003
What happened to his old aide?

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,504
She got married.

7
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:46,474
So, first, you want to rub the glue
on the paper in any shapes you like.

8
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,617
Why do people get married?

9
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,743
Because they love each other.

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,684
Why aren't you married?

11
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:59,749
I haven't found the person I love yet
because I spend all of my time loving you.

12
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,660
Does that mean
we can get married?

13
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,363
Well, love comes in many types,
and there's lots of it to go around.

14
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,771
My snow is ruined.

15
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,670
It's not ruined.

16
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,647
Oh, it's pretty.

17
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,738
See, look, I like the green.

18
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,443
Who ever heard of green snow?

19
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,247
It's magical.

20
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:34,961
Come here, we'll get
you cleaned up, okay?

21
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,663
It's okay.

22
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,658
Are you okay?

23
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,759
You gonna pay for that?

24
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,795
Nice of you to offer.

25
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,888
Now I can actually get
some cream cheese.

26
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,900
29-year-old teacher, she works
with special needs children. She...

27
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,768
I love what you're wearing. It
brings out the blue of the case file.

28
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,739
Which means it's not from
the ER. So why are you here?

29
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,333
Because Dr. Cuddy is not here.

30
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,921
She's decided to spend some more
time at home with the baby for a while.

31
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,823
I'm taking over some of her
day-to-day responsibilities,

32
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,282
like babysitting you.

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,082
Interesting. You have
your whole life ahead of you,

34
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,147
so why would Cuddy
want you to die so young?

35
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,955
She figured I'd spent three years
working for you, I was inoculated.

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,462
Good. Fun.

37
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,258
You get to exercise your newfound
power, I squirm under your thumb,

38
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,945
resent the student becoming the
teacher, and then push comes to shove

39
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,871
and we all get to realize
what our real roles should be.

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,274
And then you put out.

41
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,900
That's why I took the job.

42
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:50,161
29-year-old special ed teacher
coughs up blood all over Corky.

43
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,995
No dyspnea, no weight loss.

44
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,568
Why are you smirking?

45
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,071
Never thought I'd see the day you
were taking orders from Cameron.

46
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,717
Cameron's in charge?
When did that happen?

47
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,552
You're going to
destroy her, aren't you?

48
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:07,241
I am going to do my job. If that
involves leaving her a rotting pulp...

49
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,907
Cameron's going
to mark her territory.

50
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,280
She'll probably overcompensate

51
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,841
and destroy you. Bleeding ulcer.

52
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,614
Scope of the stomach
and lungs were clean,

53
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,488
yet she continues to spit up blood
from both her stomach and lungs.

54
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,635
Means there's probably something
wrong with the blood itself,

55
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,150
leukemia, von Willebrands.

56
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,457
Thoracic tumor's a better fit.

57
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,140
Erodes into her airway and
esophagus, explains the...

58
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,599
Oh, will you two
stop it already?

59
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,760
Stop what? Disagreeing.

60
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,827
Okay. Which one of us
shouldn't have an opinion?

61
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,772
It's not an opinion,
it's a smoke screen.

62
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,935
You toss out a lame idea instead of
agreeing with Foreman's better idea

63
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,354
because you're
worried that will confirm

64
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,940
that he's boldly gone where
no man has gone before.

65
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,873
You slept with Foreman?

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,077
Sorry. You were busy.

67
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,450
Drop it, House.

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,284
We're seeing each
other, end of discussion.

69
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,880
Anything else isn't relevant.

70
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,916
It's extremely relevant.
Apparently, it colors everything.

71
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,905
Now I have no idea if
you have differing opinions

72
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,329
because you have
differing opinions

73
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,333
or because you're just trying to
prove that you can think for yourselves.

74
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,995
How about you just judge
our ideas on their own merit?

75
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,061
You don't want me to do that.

76
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,903
Go run a bleeding time test,
confirm our patient's blood is screwy,

77
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,173
then you can come back and
pretend to disagree about why.

78
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,884
Time zero.

79
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,785
I'm impressed, you
didn't even flinch.

80
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,984
I just went to my happy place.

81
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,719
We cannot let House
anywhere near this woman.

82
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,229
Where is your happy place?

83
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,323
My class. With them.

84
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,365
Pass the first mark.

85
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,527
It's a great thing you do.

86
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,934
Not really.

87
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:42,273
Most kids, typical children, you hand
them a pair of scissors and they cut.

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,470
Well, Tony, he's got CP,

89
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:49,209
and when I gave him scissors,
we went on a journey together,

90
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,775
learning to get his fingers in those
holes, to hold the scissors apart,

91
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,151
to hold the paper.

92
00:05:54,221 --> 00:06:00,024
I mean, when he finally learned
to cut, we both just wept with joy.

93
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,995
If you ever meet our boss,
just yes or no answers, okay?

94
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,332
It's not slowing up.
No sign of clotting.

95
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,771
So there is something
wrong with my blood?

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,496
Don't worry, we'll
run some lab tests to

97
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,368
find out which clotting
factor is off and...

98
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,345
I'm not worried.

99
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,176
Must be one hell
of a happy place.

100
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,722
She's beautiful.

101
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,589
I know. I'm lucky.

102
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,060
Absolutely.

103
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,994
What's she like?

104
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,057
She's eight weeks old.

105
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,694
Are you asking me about her
politics or her sense of humor?

106
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,916
My cousin had a kid. They
acted like they knew the thing

107
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,876
from the time it was two
minutes old. I just thought...

108
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,174
She cries, she
eats, and she poops.

109
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,047
What's wrong?

110
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,995
I don't feel anything.

111
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,493
You're tired.

112
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,056
I'm not sleep deprived.

113
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:18,094
She sleeps fine. I'm
obviously not hormonal.

114
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,403
I know I'm supposed
to feel amazement.

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,141
I'm supposed to love her.

116
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,446
I just...

117
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,710
I don't feel anything at all.

118
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,349
Sorry. Maybe I'm just tired.

119
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,495
Thank you for
stopping by. I'm okay.

120
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,587
Lisa,

121
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,264
if you're...

122
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,466
I'm feeding her, I'm changing
her, and I'm burping her.

123
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,068
I'm doing everything I'm
supposed to do. She will be okay.

124
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,110
Please go back to work.

125
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,389
It is the blood, but the clotting
proteins aren't the problem.

126
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,296
It's her platelets. Looked like
they had bite marks in them.

127
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,391
So, now you're agreeing?

128
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,301
Either you folded because I gave
you crap, or you broke up, or...

129
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,066
We disagree, you
blame our relationship.

130
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,970
We agree, you
blame our relationship.

131
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,150
Don't you see a problem there?

132
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,767
Yes. Don't you?

133
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,843
Could be lymphoma.

134
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,310
Not with a normal LDH.

135
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,780
ITP fits. We should
start her on methotrexate.

136
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,977
Absolutely. And
total body irradiation.

137
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,077
Because she failed
the bleeding time test?

138
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,588
TBI will promote cancers,
kill her digestive tract.

139
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,090
Don't forget, stop her
from bleeding into her brain.

140
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,111
It's premature, reckless,
and potentially lethal.

141
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,523
True. Must be somebody's job to stop
me from being reckless and irresponsible.

142
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,500
Nobody can stop me
from being premature.

143
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:03,204
I got a patient with ITP. I
want to hit her with radiation.

144
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,676
I'm gonna have to call you back.

145
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,610
Methotrexate. Good point.

146
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,012
On the other hand, if
she bleeds in her brain,

147
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,984
she's gonna need a
special ed class of her own.

148
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,849
Fine.

149
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,381
Really?

150
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,392
Yeah. If you think
it's right, do it.

151
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,821
Hmm.

152
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,858
Some people thought you were
going to be brutal, marking your territory.

153
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,866
Who? Nobody.

154
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,300
Just because I call him
nobody, doesn't make me a racist.

155
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,394
I'm not going to play games.

156
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,033
If you come to me with a request,
and it makes medical sense, I'll say yes.

157
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,244
I need oral sex.

158
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:43,608
I'm pretty sure biological
imperative qualifies as medical sense.

159
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,276
Can I return my phone call now?

160
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,820
I don't really see how
that's going to be possible.

161
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,098
Patient won't respond to methotrexate,
bleeding time hasn't improved.

162
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,605
You have a medical dilemma
for me, I have one for you.

163
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,199
I need a reason to not
do total body irradiation.

164
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,141
Other than that
Cameron said you can't.

165
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,270
She said I can.

166
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,779
Then why don't we just do it?

167
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,976
Because it's premature,
reckless, and potentially lethal.

168
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,951
Then why don't
we just don't do it?

169
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,362
Because that would let
Cameron in on the fact

170
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,752
that I never intended to do it.

171
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,290
This is gonna be
convoluted, isn't it?

172
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,225
Figured I'd ask for something
really crazy so she'd shoot me down,

173
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,627
and get the whole, "I can control House"
thing out of her perky little system.

174
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,565
So the next time I went back and I
asked for something marginally crazy,

175
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,694
it would seem marginally
reasonable, and she'd say yes.

176
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,329
So, yeah, slightly convoluted.

177
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,839
You're screwed.

178
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,341
Unless we irradiate her.

179
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,375
Without the radiation.

180
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,471
We book the nuclear lab,
we fill out the paperwork,

181
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:51,040
we bring the patient down there,
we do everything but flip the switch.

182
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,609
Go. Do. Don't flip.

183
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,053
And is there anything
we should be doing,

184
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,489
you know, to actually
help the patient?

185
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,460
Trust me, for the long term,
this will help all our patients.

186
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:05,124
In the short term, double the dose
of methotrexate and add prednisone.

187
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,734
Cameron's got the
keys to the castle.

188
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,568
This trial I'm running, the
drug really seems to be working.

189
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,939
She's kind of liking the power.

190
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,910
Think I'm kind of
liking her liking it.

191
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,671
I'm not sure what I'm
going to do about Thirteen.

192
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,739
She's sort of
dressing like Cuddy.

193
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,583
She's on the placebo.

194
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,985
You can't possibly know that.

195
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,285
Accidents happen. I found out.

196
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,864
You cannot tell her. You'd
be compromising the trial.

197
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,568
She knows she had a 50-50
chance of not being on the drug.

198
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,571
If you feel like you're
lying to her, too bad.

199
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,163
I don't want to tell her.

200
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,308
I want to put her
on the real drug.

201
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,677
And you want me to
tell you that that's okay?

202
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:58,514
Her trial results are already
compromised just from the fact that I know.

203
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,019
As long as she's
wasting her time,

204
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,921
why not give her something
that might actually help her?

205
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,257
Valid point, except for the
fact that it's a load of crap.

206
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,163
Don't be an idiot.

207
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,176
So, how long until we
start the procedure?

208
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,706
<i>We already started. Told
you, you wouldn't feel a thing.</i>

209
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,986
<i>You should lie back.
Just stay really still.</i>

210
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,123
I have to pee.

211
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,858
Can we, like, call a timeout for a
minute? Let me go to the bathroom?

212
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,859
<i>Yeah. Sure. We'll just start
up again when you're done.</i>

213
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,165
Thanks.

214
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,366
<i>Sorry. I didn't
realize I had to go.</i>

215
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,840
No problem.

216
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,040
Sarah!

217
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,982
No pulse. Get the paddles.

218
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,820
Clear!

219
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,658
Got a pulse.

220
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,633
It's not ITP. She clearly
doesn't need fake radiation.

221
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,436
No structural
defects in her heart.

222
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,408
What about a calcified valve
or a patent foramen ovale?

223
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,535
Transthoracic echo and
bubble study show nothing.

224
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,704
Her heart's clean.

225
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,509
The patient said
she had to go pee.

226
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,947
Maybe when she got
up, she started to urinate,

227
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,009
increased the vagal tone, caused
arrhythmia and stopped her heart.

228
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,885
Who has to go pee in the
middle of a nuclear procedure?

229
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,548
It wasn't really a
nuclear procedure.

230
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,024
She didn't know that.

231
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,588
People don't die from peeing.

232
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,026
Heavy metal, toxin.

233
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,226
Drugs or alcohol.

234
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,395
Or her own body is making
a toxin. Cold agglutinins.

235
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,939
Abnormal protein gets
activated by cold temperatures.

236
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,606
Like the classroom
with the broken heater

237
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,185
and the cold metal table
in the procedure room.

238
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,007
For God's sake, get a room.

239
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,380
Immerse her in an ice bath. The
cold will activate her cold agglutinins.

240
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,542
Causing her heart to race.

241
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,811
Confirming our diagnosis.

242
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,443
And giving her
another heart attack.

243
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,320
Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired
maiden who loves to say yes.

244
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,060
How in the world could you
approve total body irradiation

245
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,529
for a patient with possible ITP?

246
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,656
It was the right call.

247
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,443
There was no medical
justification for that kind of...

248
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,302
Not medically, no. Absolutely
no medical rationalization.

249
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,773
I had to say yes because
House wanted me to say no.

250
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,968
You think he was bluffing?

251
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,068
I'm the new kid,
he had to test me.

252
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,046
Don't get cute,
don't engage him.

253
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,583
Do not play his games
because you will lose.

254
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,709
You hired me to do
this job, let me do it.

255
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:54,320
Oh! I'm sorry, looks like you guys
are in the middle of a conversation.

256
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,090
I can wait until Cuddy leaves.

257
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,199
You are gonna leave
soon, aren't you?

258
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,065
I mean, the nurses have
got your baby out there.

259
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,764
Not that they're going
to kidnap it or anything,

260
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,205
but I figured that the new
mother brings the baby to work

261
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,140
because she wants to
listen to all the cooing.

262
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,337
If you're gonna wait,
you can wait outside.

263
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,847
Unless the new mother
brings the baby to work

264
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,782
because she wants
to dump the baby,

265
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,345
because she hates the baby
and thinks she made a big mistake.

266
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,117
You can't trust that
Wilson guy with anything.

267
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,387
Lisa, are you...

268
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,796
It's not a big deal, I
was having a bad day.

269
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,959
Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?

270
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,936
For betraying my trust
in a vulnerable time? No.

271
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,063
Why would that bother me?

272
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,199
He was worried, he
made a bad choice.

273
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,810
It's not a big deal.

274
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,348
I know it seems like crap, you
probably feel like crap, but it's not.

275
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,975
Legally, you haven't
adopted her yet.

276
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,078
There's no obligations, no strings.
It could be undone tomorrow.

277
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,591
Emotionally, you'll
feel guilty for a while,

278
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,958
but the kid, she won't
even know you existed.

279
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,153
You saying I should
give her back?

280
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,667
Much better than having a
mother who doesn't give a crap.

281
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,835
Thanks.

282
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm just gonna go
drop it off at the pound.

283
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,573
What did you want?

284
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,615
We got a green light. Go
draw the patient's blood.

285
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,915
Why?

286
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,649
To see if it clumps in the cold.

287
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,089
She's making you confirm
your theory before you treat?

288
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,717
She approved the bath.

289
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,285
She just thought we ought
to do a test to confirm.

290
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,126
That's more of a
yellow light, isn't it?

291
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,666
So, she lets you nuke
the patient, no problem,

292
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,295
but makes you jump through
hoops to give her a bath?

293
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,861
Why would she do that?

294
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,566
I think she was playing you.

295
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,575
Go draw the blood.

296
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,949
I didn't realize the nurses
allowed any visitors in here.

297
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,610
They don't.

298
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,917
We'll just do these problems,
and then you have to go. Okay?

299
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,481
Okay. I need to draw some blood.

300
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,923
I had a crush on my teacher
in fourth grade. And fifth.

301
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:13,763
It's more that... Johnny
was a non-verbal autistic.

302
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,839
Then for Sarah, he talks, makes
eye contact. He's like a regular kid.

303
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,871
Since she got sick, he started
going back away from us.

304
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,878
I had to bring
him in for a visit.

305
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,914
Tell you what,

306
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,347
I'll close the blinds so the
nurses don't ask questions.

307
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,544
You can stay as
long as you want.

308
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,263
We should have the
results in about an hour.

309
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,550
I'll be here.

310
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,187
Good job.

311
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,195
One minute at 39 degrees.

312
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,827
Oh! Damn. Sorry.

313
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,902
You all right?

314
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,768
Don't be paranoid. I feel great.

315
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,239
Didn't expect the meds
to work this quickly.

316
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,745
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
you might not even be on the real drug.

317
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,077
Several patients have shown improvement.
I know my test results have been better.

318
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,673
I know I have more energy.

319
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,309
You ever hear the
term "placebo effect"?

320
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,481
I guess I do have a
few reasons to feel good.

321
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:15,318
But let's not get ahead
of ourselves, you're good,

322
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,590
but not "curing
Huntington's" good.

323
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,061
Good.

324
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,405
It's clumped. House
was right, ice bath's on.

325
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,814
You got a sec?

326
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,018
Don't be an idiot.

327
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,786
<i>I know it's hard, but you need
to stay in there for three minutes.</i>

328
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,025
<i>It's okay.</i>

329
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,937
You come to procedures now?

330
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,872
Only the ones that might involve
stopping the patient's heart.

331
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,772
Cameron tell you to be here?

332
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:03,901
Shut up.

333
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,622
<i>Tell me about Jonathan. How'd
you get him to come out of hiding?</i>

334
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,275
<i>He was extremely
sensitive to touch,</i>

335
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,877
yet he had a tactile
fascination with newspaper.

336
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:20,052
I mean, he wouldn't read it,
he would just touch it, crinkle it.

337
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,358
I thought maybe that was a
way in. Papier-mâché and...

338
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,666
And it was. He let
me into his world.

339
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,398
Please tell her that
talking will ruin the test.

340
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:38,934
All the kids, I try to become a part of
them, and have them become a part of me.

341
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,980
How much longer
until the heart attack?

342
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,659
<i>I wanted to be a doctor from
the time I was eight years old,</i>

343
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,993
<i>never wanted to be
a pediatrician though.</i>

344
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,610
Now they're both talking.

345
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,814
<i>Well, I wanted to
be a sociologist.</i>

346
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:55,090
I was supposed to observe a
class. I was sent to room 214,

347
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,528
but I went to room 241 instead.

348
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,399
It was a special ed
class. And I just...

349
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,937
I just felt at home.

350
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,415
Time. Heart rate's normal.

351
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,702
You can get out now.

352
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,070
It's not cold agglutinins.

353
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,143
I'm not surprised.

354
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,975
She obviously has brain damage.

355
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,285
Seriously.

356
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,984
She screwed up a room
number six years ago,

357
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,254
and you decide she
has brain damage?

358
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,920
Transposed digits.

359
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,459
Classic marker for
number confusion.

360
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,400
It means she has a lesion in
her left parahippocampal region.

361
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,132
I misdialed a phone number this
morning. It must be contagious.

362
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,902
She also forgot to pee
before your fake test.

363
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,067
So she has a small bladder.

364
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,077
Shows an inability
to predict the future.

365
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,375
Also located in the left
hemisphere of the brain.

366
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,381
Close to the
parahippocampal region.

367
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,677
Means the damage is ongoing.

368
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,480
Two subtle clues,
six years apart,

369
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,628
that's hardly
compelling evidence.

370
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,676
I'm compelled.

371
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,724
That's not what this is. Every
time a decent person comes in,

372
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,601
you set out to prove that
they have brain damage.

373
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,322
I never said her deranged
personality was a symptom.

374
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,363
You don't need to. I've
been here five years.

375
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,524
I can hear your thoughts
from my apartment.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
Can you hear me now?

377
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,734
Move on to another organ.

378
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,898
I did.

379
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,072
The screwed-up numbers and forgetting
to pee points to her being a human being.

380
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,444
The platelet dysfunction and cardiac
arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.

381
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,074
Or Multiple Sclerosis.

382
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,217
The brain is like the Internet,

383
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,280
packets of information constantly
flowing from one area to another.

384
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:35,385
Plaques in her brain are like a
bad server, slow down the flow.

385
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,659
If it's in the parahippocampus,
it'll spread to the brain stem,

386
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,733
which means it'll
be the lungs next.

387
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,026
Brain biopsy will
show you the plaques.

388
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,732
Or we could not
cut into her brain.

389
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,275
It's just her pancreas.
We should do an ERCP.

390
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,474
Or we could settle this
with rock, paper, scissors,

391
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:56,846
but, unfortunately, there are
people who adjudicate these disputes.

392
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,494
A pancreatic tumor is
much more likely to kill her.

393
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,147
Not this week, not next
week, not next month.

394
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,814
The number confusion
was six years ago.

395
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,033
You don't think we
have time for an ERCP?

396
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,117
The heart attack
was six hours ago.

397
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,371
Now, maybe, it's planning to go
into hiding for a couple of years

398
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,705
or maybe it's
gonna hit her lungs.

399
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,890
Stop!

400
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,524
We have to
assume it's the brain.

401
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,627
I'll go fire up
the biopsy drill.

402
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:22,004
No. We have to assume it's the
brain until we prove otherwise.

403
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,009
Do an MRI, T-2 images.

404
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,942
You want me to do another test?

405
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,879
You should be able
to see the MS plaques.

406
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,180
If they exist, you
can do your biopsy.

407
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,748
No.

408
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,289
You want to say yes, you
know you should say yes.

409
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,160
But you also think that this
job is about standing up to me.

410
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,998
So you're not gonna say yes, you're not
gonna say no. You're just gonna waste time.

411
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:52,061
And the patient's brain or pancreas,
or whatever is wrong with her,

412
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,915
is not gonna wait for
you to impress your boss.

413
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,965
So, pick one, either him or me.

414
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,576
Do the MRI.

415
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,651
You still here?

416
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,996
The whole point of giving
Cameron the job was so you could...

417
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,588
I don't want to go home.

418
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,343
House told me I
should give her back.

419
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:36,038
Instead of being offended,
I've been wondering if he's right.

420
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,411
He's not. He never is,

421
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:43,149
not when it's anything
personal or human or...

422
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:48,752
No. He's always cold, he's always
an ass, but he's very rarely just wrong.

423
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,999
I've read every bonding
and attachment book there is.

424
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:58,768
I feel like I'm in prison at
home. I feel like I'm free here.

425
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,898
Parents make sacrifices.

426
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,439
I don't know if I want to.

427
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,474
I'm not proud of
this. I feel terrible.

428
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,051
I feel like a failure.

429
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,392
But she deserves to be loved.

430
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:27,831
I don't know what to say.

431
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,305
No plaques on
the left hemisphere.

432
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,432
Or the right.

433
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,239
Even magnified images of her
hippocampal region. Nothing.

434
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,444
This is surprising.

435
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,584
So, can we cancel the biopsy?

436
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,918
Go ahead with ERCP.

437
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,485
I need to talk to
you about Remy.

438
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:57,929
Who?

439
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,260
Thirteen.

440
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,557
What did you call her?

441
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,157
She's on placebo.

442
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,204
And you want to change that?

443
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:11,266
I'm the last person you'd ever
come to for ethical advice, literally,

444
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,507
which means you've already
asked every other person,

445
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,741
and no one's giving
you the answer you want.

446
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,411
Or I respect your opinion, and I
want to hear what comes to your mind.

447
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:24,048
She invited any of her lesbian
friends into bed with you?

448
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,591
I was mistaken.

449
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,182
Drug gonna cure her?

450
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,930
It looks promising,
reducing symptoms.

451
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,056
No cure then.

452
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:37,399
So, the pros are you might
delay the onset of symptoms,

453
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:41,804
give her an extra year, maybe
three. She's still dead before you're 45.

454
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,967
The question is,

455
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,342
are those few years worth risking
the rest of your life in medicine?

456
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,907
No.

457
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,044
There. That wasn't
so hard, was it?

458
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,781
Thank you.

459
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:57,948
You're welcome.

460
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,852
Unless you love her.

461
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:11,326
If you love her, then
you do stupid things.

462
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,169
Common bile duct is clear.

463
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,772
No filling defects
in the biliary tree.

464
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,647
Oh, God. What?

465
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,915
It's her lungs. House was
right. O2 sats down to 89.

466
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,498
Increasing to 100% O2.

467
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,615
Better get out.

468
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,991
Do we have to tell him?

469
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,117
<i>The surgeons were able to
drain the pleural effusions.</i>

470
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,077
The patient's breathing on her
own, but she's still pretty weak.

471
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,114
Lung failure proves
that one of us was right.

472
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,239
Who said "brain"?

473
00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:01,185
Yes, you predicted that her lungs would
fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.

474
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,688
I was right about the
where, but not the what.

475
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:08,090
A picornavirus could cause
localized demyelination

476
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,719
that the MRI wouldn't pick up.

477
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,991
If we run a nerve conduction
study on the surface of her brain,

478
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,625
we'll see the dead spots.

479
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,966
You're talking about
cutting into her skull?

480
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,007
Actually, I'm talking about cutting
off her skull, exposing her brain.

481
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,718
A pancreatic
tumor could still fit.

482
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,677
It explains the heart,
the blood and her lungs.

483
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,770
ERCP was negative.

484
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,783
And she agrees with me because
she agrees with me. Right, sweetie?

485
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,412
All we need is a more sensitive
test. Endoscopic ultrasound.

486
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,457
Just accept that you've
been proven wrong.

487
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:42,184
You were also proven wrong.
Why don't I get a second test?

488
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,025
Because if I'm
right about the brain,

489
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,191
then we don't have time
to indulge your wrongness.

490
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:51,033
Let me know when Cameron says
yes to cutting off our patient's skull.

491
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,595
I'll be doing the
endoscopic ultrasound.

492
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:01,473
Good news, I don't need your approval
for some crazy, unproven treatment.

493
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,742
I just need to do a test.

494
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,579
You want to remove
your patient's skull.

495
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,314
Remind me to revoke
Kutner's telephone privileges.

496
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,448
I didn't realize that was an
AMA-approved treatment for MS.

497
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,790
Not searching for MS, but what
set it off. Equine encephalitis.

498
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,763
Turned a cool breeze
of MS into a Cat 5 storm.

499
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,299
I didn't realize your
patient was a horse.

500
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,164
There's been human cases.

501
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,103
Not when it's 30 degrees outside.
Transmission is by mosquito.

502
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,572
So, she got bitten
six months ago.

503
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,573
Or it's some other infection.

504
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,919
Whatever it is, it's
running rampant

505
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:34,277
in the left side of her brain. When I
get in there I'll get you the specifics.

506
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:38,249
You're asking me to let you cut
off the top of someone's head.

507
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,149
I need more than "I'll
know it when I see it."

508
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,916
So, you want proof before you
let me go looking for the proof?

509
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,012
This is the test.

510
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,580
You have to give me something.

511
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:54,490
Cuddy's gonna love you. The patient,
on the other hand, is gonna hate you

512
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,728
until the day she
dies next week.

513
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,438
Actually, this idiot will
probably forgive you.

514
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,483
You gonna help or what?

515
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,742
I want kids.

516
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,279
Um...

517
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,981
I think these kids are
already spoken for.

518
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:22,152
Not now. But since we're dating
I just thought you should know.

519
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,258
I thought, because
of your illness...

520
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,559
So did I.

521
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,095
Even when I didn't
know if I had it or not,

522
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,229
I just assumed I couldn't
take the chance. But now,

523
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:39,570
even though I know I have
it, it feels like an option.

524
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,820
You really don't have to
keep buying me things.

525
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,382
Just open it.

526
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,561
This is nice.

527
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,199
The picture is
actually your gift.

528
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,704
That's your baby.

529
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,896
I took her picture to one of those places
that does that age enhancement thing.

530
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,971
And according to the
kid who works there,

531
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,448
this is a pretty
good approximation

532
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,315
of what your daughter will
look like 18 years from now.

533
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,411
That's sort of cool.

534
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,322
Right now, she's just
this weird little creature

535
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,225
that sleeps and poops and cries.

536
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,065
But that is who
she's going to be.

537
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,992
You will be teaching
her how to ride a bike,

538
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:41,598
giving her advice about friends and
school and having her heart broken,

539
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,041
she'll ignore most of it,
but some of it will stick.

540
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,672
You're gonna be there
for her through all of that.

541
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,808
You just have to get
through this part. That's all.

542
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,921
It's very sweet.

543
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,490
I'll pay you back for the photo.

544
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,143
Don't worry about it. That's just
the picture that came with the frame.

545
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,533
You can chuck it.

546
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,606
A kid with a raging
viral syndrome

547
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,612
and three dead mosquitoes.

548
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,317
I'm off to storm the Bastille.

549
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,624
These aren't mosquitoes.

550
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,425
Fruit flies. Close enough.

551
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,293
Acute viral nasopharyngitis?

552
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,931
One of her students
has the common cold?

553
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
Team's not what it used to be.

554
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:48,004
On the other hand, Kutner ran his
endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep.

555
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,235
So, disproving it's her
pancreas proves it's her brain?

556
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,503
Yes!

557
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,671
You used to do this job. Remember?
It's what used to pass for evidence.

558
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,808
Now I do this job. You brought me
three dead bugs and a runny nose!

559
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,562
I can't find you the proof you want
because it's trapped inside her head.

560
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,181
The only way I can get at it
is to cut it open and rip it out,

561
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,100
which, apparently, is the
one test you won't let me run.

562
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,150
So, either I do
this or I do nothing.

563
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,594
What do you want me to do?
Say yes just because you're House?

564
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,263
I'd certainly like that, yeah.

565
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,068
Yes.

566
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,320
Cameron actually said yes?

567
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,882
No, I'm just obsessive
about clean cuticles.

568
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,655
Sawing off the top of her skull

569
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,060
and placing electrodes
on her brain is insane.

570
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,328
Right, we should be re-testing
her pancreas for the umpteenth time.

571
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,096
You're skipping steps
because it's Cameron.

572
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,480
You haven't figured her out, you
want to see how far you can push.

573
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,704
I'm skipping steps because
our patient is skipping steps

574
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,401
on the way to being dead.

575
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,552
If you got a better idea...

576
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,696
We should remove her spleen.

577
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:02,612
Splenic lymphoma explains the
damaged platelets, the heart, the lungs.

578
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,278
If this doesn't work,
spleen is all yours.

579
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,915
Unless I kill her, of course.

580
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,128
Not only will this allow us to
clock your brain's processing speed,

581
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,493
you'll also get free cable
for the first three months.

582
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,223
What's this?

583
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,633
A blue car. Is that
part of the test?

584
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,366
No, my lease is up
next month. You like it?

585
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,632
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions

586
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,644
designed to stimulate
left-brain function,

587
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,875
logic, reasoning,
problem solving.

588
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,884
Or as my mentor Old Ben
liked to call it, "The dark side."

589
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,314
If we find slow areas, we
know we found damage.

590
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,254
We treat, you go home. Ready?

591
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,191
I'd nod yes, but I
can't move my head.

592
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:54,158
This pen is red. Its
ink is red. Is all ink red?

593
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,959
No.

594
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,731
Nerve conduction's 12.8 meters
per second, right within range.

595
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,982
Cameron's letting him
cut into our patient's skull

596
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,669
based on nothing but dead bugs
and someone else's runny nose.

597
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,509
There are two pints in a quart.

598
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,105
Four quarts in a gallon. How
many pints in five gallons?

599
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,911
<i>House, step away
from the patient.</i>

600
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,819
Who's that?

601
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,918
That's my old boss. And by
"old," I don't mean "former".

602
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,963
Insulting me is not
gonna make me go away.

603
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,990
You're not here, obviously, I'm
not trying to make you go away.

604
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,933
Hint, the answer is a number.

605
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,095
Um...

606
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,566
40?

607
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,404
12.4 meters per second.
Conduction's still normal.

608
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,001
Dr. Cameron? You're
actually assisting him with this?

609
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,775
Yes, because I'm actually
familiar with this case.

610
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,458
Well, I'm familiar
enough to know

611
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,951
that cutting into this woman's
brain is not necessary.

612
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,179
Is she serious?

613
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,449
She's certainly not funny.

614
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,651
Put the phone down, pick up
the baby. Make us all happy.

615
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,354
Okay, settle down, baby. It's
okay. We'll be done in a minute.

616
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,732
<i>House, I can call
security. I can...</i>

617
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,461
BP's dropping.

618
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,526
Get it back up. I got a
whole stack of these.

619
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,196
Give her 10 cc dopamine.

620
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,173
Already am, thanks. Your baby
needs you a lot more than we do.

621
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,210
You aren't hungry, you aren't
wet, I don't know what it is.

622
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,448
That is so annoying.
Can you make it stop?

623
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,848
Baby's crying is annoying you?
What's her nerve conduction?

624
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,888
14.3. It's actually speeding up.

625
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,219
But her BP's 80 over palp.
We're gonna have to stop.

626
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,189
That doesn't make any sense.

627
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,737
The fact that you're wrong
doesn't make any sense

628
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,272
or the fact that I believed
that you were right?

629
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,889
BP's still dropping.
She's gonna stroke.

630
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,869
I'm giving her 10 more cc,
and I'm putting an end to this.

631
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,908
Okay, Rachel, quiet down.
I need you to be quiet.

632
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,707
Please, turn that phone off.

633
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,410
Why does the baby annoy
you, but no one else does?

634
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,963
I mean, you're
right about her, but...

635
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,010
I don't know what you want. I will
give you anything that you want.

636
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,852
I don't know what it is.

637
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,589
Tell me. Please.
Just help me. Please!

638
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,836
Really?

639
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,097
That worked?

640
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,169
She's stable.

641
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,306
We're finished
here. Close her up.

642
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,142
How long until we can
perform the splenectomy?

643
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,625
Can't dose her with anesthesia
until the last batch completely clears.

644
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,638
How come the baby annoyed her?

645
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,182
We should get her in
there as soon as we can.

646
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,333
Two hours, at least.

647
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,502
Her blood pressure's in the
tank. I hope she lasts two hours.

648
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,011
What was different?

649
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,015
Our patient loves
all things annoying.

650
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,486
She'd love this conversation.

651
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,682
She's an earth mother,

652
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,693
takes in the freaks and rejects of
humanity and tells them they're A-okay.

653
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,388
So, what was different?

654
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:15,695
Her head was open, you were
asking her questions, a baby was crying.

655
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,496
She had low blood pressure.

656
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,606
According to the
laws of physics,

657
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,336
low blood pressure
causes light-headedness

658
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,039
chest pain, but not annoyance.

659
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,061
Move your feet.

660
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:50,894
You decided to keep her. Thank
you for telling me. You can go now.

661
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,738
I talked to her. We connected.

662
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:03,872
You talked at her, you
had a chemical reaction.

663
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,280
Are you trying to annoy me?

664
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,182
I'm trying to explain you.

665
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:11,485
I know it doesn't make
any sense, but it was real.

666
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,115
It was there.

667
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:17,021
You want to hold her?
Come here, come say hi.

668
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,698
You think we'll bond?

669
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,733
Is that cute?

670
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,040
A little.

671
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,711
If I threw up on
you, you'd be pissed.

672
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,882
Your puke isn't as cute.

673
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:45,356
That's 'cause of your hips. If she
would've just gestated a little longer,

674
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,222
her stomach sphincter
would be fully mature.

675
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,262
But, no, we have
to walk upright,

676
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,025
which means that baby's head
is too big for mommy's hips.

677
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:57,034
And by the way, your hips may
be an evolutionary improvement.

678
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,401
So we've evolved to
find baby puke cute.

679
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,238
'Cause otherwise we'd kill them
all before they became functional.

680
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,011
Bonding's over. I got
to go see another baby.

681
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,417
So, I can just live spleen-free?

682
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,572
Plenty of people live
perfectly normal lives without...

683
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,428
Spleen's fine.

684
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,726
It's not her brain.

685
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,233
Of course it's her brain.

686
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,067
You've looked at her brain, you
took off her skull, you found nothing.

687
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,871
Didn't look in the right part.
Didn't look in the heart part.

688
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:45,473
In the womb, blood has to bypass
the lungs since they don't work yet.

689
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:50,282
When we're born, we take our
first big breath, lungs expand,

690
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,655
and the ductus
closes. Yours didn't.

691
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,290
She has a Patent
ductus arteriosus.

692
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:03,157
When you get stressed,
your blood pressure goes up

693
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,966
<i>forces open the ductus,
blood takes a little detour,</i>

694
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:10,907
<i>makes it leak from your
nose, your stomach, your lungs,</i>

695
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,571
<i>and more significantly, keeps it
flowing to the right side of your brain</i>

696
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,137
<i>and away from your left.</i>

697
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:21,175
Which means that when you
get stressed, you get un-stressed.

698
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,750
That's why you're so good
with those annoying kids.

699
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,656
And why, when your
blood pressure dropped,

700
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,594
you were able to identify Cuddy
as an annoying human being.

701
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,561
Good news is we
can fix the heart.

702
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,704
Bad news for the annoying kids.

703
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,877
She's incredible.

704
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,107
Thank you.

705
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:52,716
Great work today.

706
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,754
I should have trusted your
instincts. I will in the future.

707
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,154
I quit.

708
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,097
I think I just apologized. If you
want, I can get down on my knees.

709
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,757
It's not because of you.

710
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:13,100
I approved an insane procedure
with no proof, no evidence, no...

711
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,638
You made the right call.

712
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:19,041
The problem was a brain
problem. Without the procedure,

713
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,875
House never notices the
increased left brain function.

714
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,539
She'd be dead if
you hadn't said yes.

715
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,980
I know.

716
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,210
But

717
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:33,815
I'll always say yes to House. I
studied under him. He's in my head.

718
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,725
And if you gave anyone else
this job, they would always say no.

719
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,696
Because... Well,
because they should.

720
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,094
House is insane.

721
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,503
Which leaves me.

722
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,207
I'm sorry.

723
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,750
Hey, buddy.

724
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,249
It's okay, buddy, come here.

725
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:07,884
I missed you so
much. I missed you.

726
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:11,521
How are you?

727
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,895
Good. Yeah? You
look so handsome.
