1
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,787
Wow.

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,326
Yeah.

3
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,805
Come back to bed.

4
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,113
Give me a minute.

5
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,016
You get 20 seconds.

6
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,765
Hey. What are you...

7
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,351
Female, late 20s,
tonic-clonic seizure.

8
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,421
Duration of the seizure?

9
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,854
A little over three minutes.

10
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,534
Does your friend have
a history of epilepsy?

11
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,787
She never said.

12
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,504
My name is Dr. Cameron.
You're in a hospital.

13
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,688
We're gonna take care of you.

14
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,595
What's her name? I don't know.

15
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,230
House?

16
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,327
I have a case I think
you might be interested in.

17
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,736
Not now.

18
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,174
Twenty-six-year-old woman
had a tonic-clonic seizure.

19
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,407
What about me speeding
away says to you "let's chat"?

20
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,450
History of fatigue, and two years
ago she had a retinal vein occlusion.

21
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,779
She's diabetic.

22
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:34,344
No, she's not, and she has
no history of hypertension.

23
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,656
It can wait.

24
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,053
I knew I should have set up
the video camera. Stay there.

25
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,899
Oh, my goodness, I played a
practical joke on my best friend,

26
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,905
and he's badly injured.

27
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,840
Wish I'd learnt this
valuable lesson earlier.

28
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,974
I was waiting by my window
for an hour. Why are you late?

29
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,572
I had a breakfast
meeting at Mickey's Diner

30
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,947
with the Mercy
people to tell them

31
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,945
I'm coming back to work here.

32
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,653
Sorry if it interfered with
your plan to maim me.

33
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,055
Donut's a nice touch.

34
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,108
That's just my way of
saying welcome back.

35
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,011
The seizure could be the result of
dehydration or something neurological.

36
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,175
Or the Ecstasy you
found in her system.

37
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,994
According to Dr. Hadley,
the patient took the drugs

38
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,385
about five hours
before the seizure, so...

39
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,116
How does Thirteen know about it?

40
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,624
Apparently, she was
with the patient last night.

41
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,857
At 3:00 a.m.?

42
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,098
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,794
<i>Penthouse</i> Forum
meets medical mystery.

44
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,029
Maybe there is a God.

45
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,234
Empty, transient sex?

46
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,573
I've been waiting for
you to spiral out of control

47
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,976
ever since you got your
Huntington's diagnosis,

48
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,571
but this is more
than I dared hope for.

49
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,392
The patient's seizure
resulted from dehydration,

50
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,908
which resulted from a
cocktail of alcohol and ecstasy.

51
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,985
Mystery solved.

52
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,988
Wait, were you doing drugs?

53
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,421
Not diagnostically relevant.

54
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,254
That's what we're
trying to diagnose.

55
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,317
It's how steep of
a spiral you're on.

56
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,726
Our patient hemorrhaged
into her eye two years ago.

57
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,094
Also not
diagnostically relevant.

58
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,441
Retinal vein
occlusion was fixed.

59
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,976
Her doctor said it
was a venous anomaly.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is he in this room? Because if
he's not, I don't care what he thinks.

61
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,115
Unless he's a she, and
she was there last night, too,

62
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,835
in which case, I
care very deeply.

63
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,319
What if the eye problem wasn't
with her vein, but with her blood?

64
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,287
It would explain why she
seized, why she's always tired.

65
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,590
She parties until 3:00 a.m.,
that's why she's always tired.

66
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,775
Yet, you seem fine.

67
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,044
She's visited four other
doctors in the past year,

68
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,312
none of them found anything.

69
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,183
She's a hypochondriac
who drank too much.

70
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,722
Blood clots could
explain everything.

71
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,659
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in
overdrive, too many platelets. Sorry.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,788
Thirteen, go stick a needle
in your girlfriend's pelvis.

73
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,390
And, no, that one
wasn't a metaphor.

74
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,369
Suck out some
marrow. That one was.

75
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,803
I like to watch.

76
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,081
I can handle this alone.

77
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,550
You've already handled it,

78
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,896
that's why you need a chaperone.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,085
Of course, I'm a very permissive,
understanding chaperone,

80
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,989
so feel free to ignore me,

81
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,223
you know, if you're in the mood to
start kissing or groping or showering...

82
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:33,256
You'll have to excuse Dr. House,
he mistakes immaturity for edginess.

83
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,926
You're Dr. House?

84
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,568
I assume my name came up
last night in the form of a moan.

85
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,404
You had sex, then a seizure.

86
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,241
Could be a particular
position or activity that set it off.

87
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,510
That sounds like a valid
medical theory, doesn't it?

88
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,142
I'm really sorry,
just ignore him.

89
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,019
Whatever you think we
did, we did. And then some.

90
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,317
Lights on or off?

91
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,167
You got a medical
rationalization for that one?

92
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,955
Light sensitivity could... On.

93
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,695
Huh! Figured she had
more shame than that.

94
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,632
She talk dirty, or make you
rely on vague hand signals?

95
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,865
She's pretty direct
about what she wants.

96
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,565
I'm learning so much.

97
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,238
Okay, score the score,
scale of one to 10.

98
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,334
Don't answer.

99
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,737
Seven.

100
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,084
Finally get one right.

101
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,116
You want to investigate
him because he ate a donut?

102
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,386
He claimed he had a morning
meeting at Mickey's Diner.

103
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,722
Wilson loves Mickey's Diner.

104
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,524
He has the French Toast Tower
whenever he sets foot in the door.

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,363
There's no way he would have
come to work wanting more carbs.

106
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,595
He lied to me. I
need to know why.

107
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,989
What do you think
you'll find out?

108
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,472
I'm worried that
he might be a spy.

109
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,285
He's been gone four months. You're
worried the friendship has changed.

110
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,369
I'm just not sure if
he's working for Hirohito

111
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,639
or the New England Patriots.

112
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,840
You played a practical
joke on him, he didn't laugh...

113
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,316
I need something
to lord over him, a lie.

114
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,910
He didn't try to
retaliate, he moralized.

115
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,079
He always moralized.

116
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,594
And he always
moralized and got even.

117
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,147
He hasn't fired back.

118
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,522
Things always change.

119
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,822
And that sucks.

120
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,626
Yeah. Find out where he was.

121
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,267
I should've known it wasn't a
coincidence. I found your letters.

122
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,581
You recognized House's name,
and you're the first patient I've seen

123
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,612
who actually enjoyed
being accosted by him.

124
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,113
I would've told you, but...

125
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,648
What exactly would
you have told me?

126
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,650
That you slept with
me to get to House?

127
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,062
That you've been trying to get him
to take your case for over a year?

128
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,215
I'm sick, no one
even wrote back.

129
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,416
You used me.

130
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,514
You used me.

131
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,082
My motives were clear.

132
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,063
You might've figured out my motives
faster if you had bothered to ask my name.

133
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,763
I followed you to that bar
because I wanted to talk to you,

134
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,636
see if you'd help
me get to House.

135
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:57,940
I didn't expect you
to be so aggressive.

136
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,274
Was that seizure even real?

137
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,905
Why would I fake a symptom?

138
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,347
It would just make it harder
for House to diagnose me.

139
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,250
There's nothing to diagnose.
Your biopsy results are negative.

140
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,083
Then it's something else.

141
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,823
Get dressed. I'm
discharging you.

142
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,485
House admitted me.
He obviously thinks...

143
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,553
House is using you as an excuse
to stick his nose in my personal life.

144
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,030
I'm tired all the time.

145
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,094
Some nights I fall asleep at 10:00
and wake up at noon, still tired.

146
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,334
Every doctor I see, tells
me there's nothing wrong.

147
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,069
And that proves what, exactly?

148
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,008
That they're wrong
or that you're wrong?

149
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,080
Come on, you
expect me to believe...

150
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,282
Sit back, deep
breaths. Try and relax.

151
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,349
Get the paddles,
she's gonna crash.

152
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,384
Damn.

153
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,794
<i>We had to use paddles to
stabilize the patient's heart.</i>

154
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,597
Eye issue, brain issue,
now a heart issue,

155
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,296
sounds like a real case to me.

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,566
Yeah, I get it. I was
wrong. Can we move on?

157
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,165
You're just upset because the
whole time she was with you,

158
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:08,045
she was thinking about my
huge, throbbing diagnostic skills.

159
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,013
Drugs would explain everything.

160
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,574
This morning you rejected drugs.

161
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,162
That's when I thought
that Thirteen was right

162
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,348
and I was just
jerking her around.

163
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:18,483
Cardiac arrest means
she could be a serious user.

164
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,356
Great. What?

165
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,331
That means that something
she did at my place set this off,

166
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,696
either she brought drugs in

167
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,577
or she grabbed something
from my medicine cabinet.

168
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,866
And that means my place
needs to be searched.

169
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,872
Now, I'd be happy
to do that myself,

170
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,670
but unfortunately, that would
be far less titillating for House,

171
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,234
so he's about to come up with
some convoluted medical reason

172
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,338
why I have to stay here
while he goes through my stuff.

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,314
Patient's dad had
bypass surgery,

174
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,322
means she's a candidate for
atherosclerosis, she needs an ultrasound.

175
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,434
That was much less convoluted
than what you just said.

176
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,501
I'm not giving you my keys.

177
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,153
If you want to
do this, I'm going.

178
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,718
Who can pick a lock?

179
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,596
I'll go. Make sure he
doesn't steal any underwear.

180
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,331
You're a disgrace to your
stereotype. Move over.

181
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,535
Think you can pick a
lock faster than me?

182
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,804
No need to pick.

183
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,415
Nice. Steal from your employees.

184
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,882
Never.

185
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,978
I had my dick make keys when
I hired him to dick up the team.

186
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,126
I always imagined she'd have
a sex swing in the living room.

187
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,195
Give me my key.

188
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,595
Don't have your key.

189
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,462
You expect me to believe
that you hired Lucas

190
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,559
to investigate
everyone except for me?

191
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,635
Waste of money.

192
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,263
I already know
everything about you.

193
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,604
Thirteen had her purse,
that's gotta be the patient's.

194
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,674
Check it for drugs.

195
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,177
I call shotgun on her bedroom.

196
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,977
You know that I stole a
car when I was a teenager.

197
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,847
You know that my
mom has Alzheimer's.

198
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:52,942
You know nothing else.

199
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,750
Want me to have you investigated?
When did you get so needy?

200
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,348
I'm not needy, I
just don't buy it.

201
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,326
You always want more
information about people.

202
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,656
Look where we
are. Purse is clean.

203
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,872
Last night wasn't the first time that
Thirteen brought home some strange.

204
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,037
If you found her
diary... No toys.

205
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,173
When you sleep with the
same person over and over,

206
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,648
that's when you
need accessories.

207
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,016
First time is plenty
exciting on its own. Unless...

208
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,822
You think an asthma inhaler
could be used as a sex toy?

209
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,363
There are ways of getting to know
people without committing felonies.

210
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,901
People interest me.
Conversations don't.

211
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,267
Because conversations
go both ways.

212
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,932
Like Thirteen. Like Thirteen.

213
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,008
Brown recluse, found
it at your apartment.

214
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,516
Their venom can cause
seizures and heart problems.

215
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,015
Unless the ultrasound
showed anything.

216
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,109
No.

217
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,381
What room did you find it in?

218
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,615
Bathroom.

219
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,988
Nice bidet, by the
way. Very refreshing.

220
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,390
I don't have a bidet.

221
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,483
Oh.

222
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,159
Spider's not the only
interesting thing I found.

223
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,303
Yeah, my inhaler is fascinating.

224
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,002
It's got its own
extensive online following.

225
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,567
You have asthma?

226
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,668
When I was a kid.

227
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,856
It started acting up again
when I moved into my new place.

228
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,542
You moved? Who cares?

229
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,450
He doesn't. He's just
surprised he didn't know.

230
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,283
You withhold things other
people would never bother to.

231
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,880
A move, a little wheeze,

232
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,290
whatever you thought was in
my pocket instead of your inhaler.

233
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,352
Maybe I should make a
return trip to your place.

234
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,839
A spider bite doesn't
explain anything

235
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,697
unless the patient was
actually bitten by a spider.

236
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,766
I'll do the exam.

237
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,874
Don't be ridiculous,
that'd be inappropriate.

238
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,427
It'd be better if a
woman gropes her.

239
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,735
There's no sexual
tension that way.

240
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,940
I need you to stand up
and take off your gown.

241
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,982
I think I would've
felt a spider biting me.

242
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,615
Not necessarily.

243
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,690
You really need those after
everything we did the other night?

244
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,894
The other night I
wasn't your doctor.

245
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,736
How long are you
going to stay mad at me?

246
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,706
How long are you
going to be here?

247
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,400
Okay, then.

248
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,773
Look,

249
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,747
I really had no intention
of ever seeing you again.

250
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,623
So, having me end up here is
a little less than ideal. I get it.

251
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,562
But we just met. How did you know
you didn't want to see me again?

252
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,592
It's nothing personal.

253
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,499
I'm just really not that
into repeat performances.

254
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,175
I figured I wasn't the
first girl you cruised.

255
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,744
Why is that?

256
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,508
You're awfully good at it.

257
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,047
You'd think with all that experience
that I'd be better than a seven.

258
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,851
We just met, we were both drunk.

259
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,358
Not like there wasn't potential.

260
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,398
A little more practice
for the both of us,

261
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,370
I'd say we're looking
at a nine, easy.

262
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,077
But that would require
a repeat performance.

263
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,472
You didn't have
to move your hand.

264
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,016
I didn't.

265
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,883
My hand's on your
hip, you don't feel that?

266
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,891
No. What does that mean?

267
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,483
It means it's not a spider bite.

268
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,897
Blood test confirms
low potassium levels,

269
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,299
explains the
numbness in her hip.

270
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,645
It's not good, but I
think we've got time

271
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,848
for at least one or two
comments about my personal life.

272
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,842
Which you just wasted with that
comment about my comments.

273
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,174
Low potassium means her heart
problem is a symptom of a kidney problem.

274
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,485
What caused the kidney problem?

275
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,946
Could be lgA nephropathy.

276
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,414
Not without blood in the urine.

277
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,643
PSAGN?

278
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,413
Not with normal blood pressure.

279
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,317
Renal tubular acidosis?

280
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,227
Her kidneys don't filter
acid out of the blood,

281
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,556
excess acid drives down potassium,
causes kidney calcifications.

282
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,595
If it's RTA, all she needs is
sodium bicarbonate for the acid

283
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,101
and surgery to remove the
calcifications. CT her kidneys.

284
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,036
If you find calcifications,
we have our diagnosis.

285
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,406
What's he doing now?

286
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,414
Mmm-mmm. He's playing
that carjacking video game.

287
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,927
He'd get a lot farther if he
didn't stop at all the red lights.

288
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,388
Maybe he was doing something
he thinks I'll mock him for.

289
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,119
Like just about anything.

290
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,387
You don't think it's that.

291
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,725
I don't think it's "just
about anything"?

292
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,128
You don't think it's
about anything trivial.

293
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,242
If you weren't worried, you
wouldn't be sitting in my car.

294
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,701
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.

295
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,637
That does not look
like a pizza delivery.

296
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,733
Doesn't matter if it isn't,
Wilson doesn't buy his pizza.

297
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,536
Eight units in this building,

298
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,378
there's gotta be a pervert like
me living in at least one of them.

299
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,180
Yes, because you represent
one out of every eight people

300
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,550
living in this country.

301
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,116
Well, apparently, he has
developed a taste for pizza.

302
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,559
Things change.

303
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,667
CT shows one more calcification

304
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,436
near the superior
pyramid on the left kidney.

305
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,807
See it.

306
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,853
That thing you were hoping
House didn't find at your place.

307
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,620
I found it.

308
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,062
You did the CAG
test two weeks ago.

309
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,928
A number this high means you
have less time than you thought.

310
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,343
It's understandable
you'd be upset.

311
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,235
It doesn't mean you
have to self-destruct.

312
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,898
It's not noble for you to
protect me from House

313
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,083
if you're just going to judge.

314
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,905
There are things
you should be doing,

315
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,444
working out, improving
balance and coordination...

316
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,343
Yeah, that sounds like a blast.

317
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,350
I'm having fun, cramming as
much life into my life as I can.

318
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,445
You're doing drugs, staying up
all night, having sex with strangers.

319
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,989
It sounds fun to me.

320
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:39,954
Good night.

321
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,461
Close the incisions.

322
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,022
She won't even have a scar.

323
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,099
Her O2 Sats are dropping.

324
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,259
Did you nick something?

325
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,929
The procedure was
clean, BP's strong.

326
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,337
Well, she's not breathing.
We need to intubate.

327
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,606
The breathing problem started
after we fixed her kidney problem,

328
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,709
means the RTA isn't
the underlying cause.

329
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,946
Where's Thirteen?

330
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,487
Traffic's bad, she's
probably just...

331
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,022
Not here.

332
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,548
It's not her lungs. No
masses, no infiltrates.

333
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,221
Her lungs are working,
but she still can't breathe.

334
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,854
Distribution plant
can't distribute

335
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,364
if it's not getting deliveries.

336
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,209
If her lungs are fine, maybe
the problem's in the supply line,

337
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,257
airway collapse.

338
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,703
That could signal autoimmune or some
kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.

339
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,038
There's only way to find out if her
airway failed. Make it happen again.

340
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,070
Stick Thirteen's carpet cleaner on
a treadmill, methacholine challenge.

341
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,945
And someone find the carpet.

342
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,618
Exam going on, 15 minutes.

343
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,296
Morning, Dr. Hadley.

344
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,497
Just spoke to my brother.

345
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,235
And by brother you mean...

346
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,742
I mean, my parents' other son.

347
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,835
Wow, same dad.

348
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,846
He got a call last
week from your PI.

349
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,576
You lied. You did
have me investigated.

350
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,694
You've been taunting the
team with what you've learnt,

351
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,653
but you never came after me.

352
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,313
Means you couldn't
find anything.

353
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,415
You're right.

354
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,759
That's because you
haven't done anything stupid,

355
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,794
spontaneous, or even vaguely
interesting since you were 17.

356
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,998
And that's just sad.

357
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,779
I found her in the clinic
giving herself IV fluids.

358
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,319
At least you could've let
her finish. She looks terrible.

359
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,719
She has a fresh nightclub
stamp on her wrist.

360
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,223
She's in no
condition to practice.

361
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,759
Unless this is a prelude
to an actual spanking,

362
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:54,903
there's no reason
for me to be...

363
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,486
I want her to take a drug test.

364
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,860
You can't make me do that.

365
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,161
But I can suspend
you until you do.

366
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,463
Because she went to a
nightclub in her free time?

367
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,004
Or because she had
sex in her free time?

368
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,336
The patient was undergoing
a routine surgery for RTA.

369
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,874
I didn't need
Thirteen here for that,

370
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,400
and I don't need you making my
employees punch a clock or pee in a cup.

371
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,471
Let's go. Come on.

372
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,384
Thank you.

373
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,656
By the way, the
surgery was not routine,

374
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,925
the patient stopped breathing,
and you missed a differential.

375
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,396
You're fired.

376
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,794
What? You just defended me.

377
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,672
No, I just prevented you from getting a
drug test, probably saved your career.

378
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,906
I'm already taking responsibility
for one doctor with a drug habit.

379
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,879
I don't have a drug habit.

380
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,416
The slutty party girl is fun

381
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:55,683
till she pukes on your shoes,
then she's just a pain in the ass.

382
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:15,571
I haven't sat on this couch for four
months. It remembers my cheeks.

383
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,303
I've missed this.

384
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,402
Me, too.

385
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,574
Me trying to work,
you interrupting.

386
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,245
Come on, your patients can wait
five minutes, get me caught up.

387
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,185
Come on. What
did you do? Travel?

388
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,783
Did you get a new hobby?
Did you meet someone?

389
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:39,457
Actually, yes, I sort of
started dating someone.

390
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,434
Great.

391
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,737
What does she do?
Is she an actress?

392
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,167
No. Why would you think that?

393
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,941
I just figured you'd want
something a little more exciting...

394
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,642
She's not...

395
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:02,084
You're gonna find out anyway
because you're gonna meet her.

396
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,751
She's a prostitute.

397
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:13,455
Used to be. She
made some mistakes.

398
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,967
Single mom, had
some drug issues,

399
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,436
but she's so smart.

400
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,573
She wants to go to law school,

401
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:28,876
and I told her I'd
help her with tuition.

402
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,661
How long have you known her?

403
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,881
I knew you'd be like this.

404
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:35,978
I asked a question.

405
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,957
House, you are a drug addict,

406
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,391
you go to prostitutes,
you can't be judgmental.

407
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,493
And yet...

408
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,496
Please, don't do this to me.

409
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,727
I was hurting, and I
wanted to feel good.

410
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,736
I didn't expect
it to go this way.

411
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:57,568
Amber said that she
wanted me to move on,

412
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,443
that she wanted me to be happy,

413
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:07,043
and Debbie makes me happy.

414
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,954
If you're happy, I'm...

415
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,903
I heard.

416
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,738
Yeah. I'm looking
for my ticket back.

417
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,604
I'm sorry if I upset you. I didn't
want to invade your privacy...

418
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,310
It wasn't your fault. Can
you get me caught up?

419
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,161
You think you're going to
find something we didn't?

420
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,711
It's good for the
patient, good for me.

421
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,690
Films are clean, we
ruled out hypertension,

422
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,695
the guys have her on a treadmill
running a methacholine challenge.

423
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:53,255
And I still think you've
been acting like an idiot.

424
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,268
I know. Did you talk about whether
this lung field looks a little dark?

425
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,701
It's probably just overexposed.

426
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,763
Or her diaphragm's
a little flat.

427
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,330
Could be a sign
of hyperinflation.

428
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,070
Suggests a
pulmonary obstruction.

429
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:07,978
Lung cysts, they wouldn't
show up on an X-ray.

430
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,778
The treadmill test isn't gonna close
her airway, it'll make her lungs explode.

431
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,583
Her throat's fine.

432
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,601
We made her airway
collapse, but it's not collapsed.

433
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,652
You ruptured a cyst,
her lung collapsed.

434
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,986
Breath sounds on both sides.

435
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,088
Move.

436
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,768
Trachea's deviating to the left.

437
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,276
Nice.

438
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,619
Chest CT confirmed
multiple lung cysts,

439
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,399
one of which burst
during the treadmill test.

440
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,023
Luckily, Thirteen
figured out the problem

441
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,788
and was there to
re-inflate her lung.

442
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,205
Lung cysts plus all her other
symptoms, could be amyloidosis,

443
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,357
which we can manage, or
pulmonary fibrosis, which...

444
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,763
Thank you.

445
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,462
My employees can
take care of it from here.

446
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,901
We need to biopsy the cysts.

447
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,461
You fired me
because I screwed up.

448
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,336
I just proved I
can pull my weight.

449
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,467
All you proved is you know
how to make an entrance.

450
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,511
House, she deserves
another shot.

451
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,178
She found the cysts,
saved the patient...

452
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,423
Who wouldn't have needed saving

453
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,315
if Thirteen had shown up to
the differential in the first place.

454
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,045
Give her job back, House.

455
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,054
Or what? You're gonna quit?

456
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,887
Go do the biopsy.

457
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,489
I'm sorry.

458
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,401
How much clearer
do I need to make this?

459
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,304
What does it even
mean, dating a hooker?

460
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,408
He's an idiot with
a messiah complex,

461
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,282
savior to all who need saving.

462
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,219
That's why his first
wife had a wooden leg,

463
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,052
his second wife was Canadian.

464
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,624
He's the one who
needs to be saved.

465
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,819
From you or the ho?

466
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,295
The ho's just using
him for his money.

467
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,561
Wait, it was a bad example.

468
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,898
Normally, in these
situations, I'd follow the girl,

469
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,013
find out something embarrassing
about her to show him.

470
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,871
But since that's our
starting position...

471
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,341
We proceed directly
to the leg breaking.

472
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,243
I'm not breaking her legs,
she probably has a pimp,

473
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,677
or at least an older brother,

474
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,478
or younger brother, or
overprotective sister...

475
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:29,181
Find her. Find her family.
Find client number 9.

476
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,315
Just get me something I can
use to force her to back off.

477
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,384
Sorry to interrupt
your meeting, Mannix.

478
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,930
Here's the result
from the lung biopsy.

479
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,901
Why not men?

480
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,214
You're bisexual.

481
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,113
If you were just
being self-destructive,

482
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,947
you'd be having
random sex with men.

483
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,182
Better chance of getting
assaulted, catching a disease.

484
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,350
If this were just
about getting laid,

485
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:10,726
it'd be a lot easier to
pick up men or ugly girls.

486
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:16,133
This woman's hot, which means
you like the challenge, the conquest.

487
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,901
It's the control
that gets you off.

488
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,338
And controlling women
is as close as you can get

489
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,204
to controlling what's
going to happen to you.

490
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,903
Here I thought I
was just into boobs.

491
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,606
Instead of getting
sweaty with a stranger,

492
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,672
why don't you try
taking it to the next level?

493
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,217
Play God.

494
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,584
Tell a girl that she's
got 10 years to live.

495
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,256
She has LAM.

496
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,634
Okay.

497
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,226
This is not a test.

498
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,981
You're not getting your
job back if you can...

499
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,133
I know what it's
like to get this news,

500
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,073
and no one should
have to get it from you.

501
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,159
Hey.

502
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,140
The biopsy of your lung cyst
showed smooth muscle cells.

503
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,142
That's indicative of a
disease called LAM.

504
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,173
What do you do for that?

505
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,487
Surgery to remove the cysts,

506
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,188
but they'll come back.

507
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,783
Little by little, the
cysts replace healthy

508
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:52,393
lung tissue until your
lungs stop working.

509
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,575
I'm going to die.

510
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,743
Yes.

511
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,657
I'm so sorry.

512
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,631
<i>They removed all
the cysts they could.</i>

513
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,166
<i>That should help
you breathe better.</i>

514
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,330
How long until the
cysts come back?

515
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:35,670
We don't know
exactly. I'm sorry.

516
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,204
Stop saying you're sorry.

517
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,942
I know you're scared.

518
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,687
I don't know what I feel.

519
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,068
You're going to be
numb for a few more days.

520
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,434
Then you'll go home
and cry for a few weeks.

521
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:13,208
And then you get angry, start telling
yourself nothing matters anymore.

522
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,482
You start doing stupid things.

523
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,747
Maybe you go out to bars
and pick up a bunch of women.

524
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,956
You're...

525
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,829
How long do you have?

526
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,929
Maybe a little more than
you, maybe a little less.

527
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,665
I'll race you.

528
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,621
I was thinking maybe
I'd come back later?

529
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,457
Sounds good.

530
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,536
Oh, God. What's going on?

531
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,516
All her blood counts are down.

532
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,202
It's a new symptom,
aplastic anemia.

533
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:21,906
Does the word "fired" have some whole
other definition that I'm not aware of?

534
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,381
I don't work for you.
Fine, don't pay me.

535
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,475
Just let me finish
out this case.

536
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,213
So you like her
now that she's dying.

537
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,777
What happens if she stops dying?

538
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,366
There's no danger
of that right now.

539
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,035
If we don't figure out what's wrong
with her, she's got days, not years.

540
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,119
Aplastic anemia
takes LAM off the table.

541
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,527
Unfortunately, none of our
other choices are any better.

542
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,395
PNH with some sort
of respiratory infection...

543
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,798
Best case gives her 12 years.

544
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,837
Or fast-moving
Langerhans. Few months.

545
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,305
Or mastocytosis, which can cause
systemic shock and kill her in days.

546
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,275
Go. Test for
everything. Not you.

547
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,136
You're just a visitor.

548
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,086
How's your patient?

549
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,316
She doesn't have Langerhans.

550
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,482
That's good.

551
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,425
Actually, a cancer diagnosis
would be good news right now.

552
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,566
Do you think I'm boring?

553
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,534
Yes.

554
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,107
You're saying that
just to screw with me.

555
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,838
Yeah. Why would you
expect anything else?

556
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,880
I expect House
to pull my strings,

557
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,881
I expect Cameron to
make me feel better,

558
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,940
I expect the new
team to kiss my ass,

559
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:35,215
and I expect you to be honest
'cause you don't give a crap.

560
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:41,618
Yes, you're boring.
That speech was boring.

561
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,161
Thanks so much.

562
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,356
You don't let other
people's problems affect you.

563
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,296
You don't let your own
problems affect you.

564
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,857
And it's the screw-ups
that make us interesting.

565
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:54,873
You're never out of control,
which is good and boring.

566
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,286
Never losing control also means
you're never putting yourself out there,

567
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,176
never pushing your limits.

568
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:03,943
On the other hand, you do have
a tattoo, so maybe I'm wrong.

569
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,365
I'm glad you're here.

570
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,756
She needs a bone
marrow transplant.

571
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,473
Test results are back?
What's she positive for?

572
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,932
Nothing. But we've
got a donor match.

573
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,044
Jumping to a transplant
when we don't know what she...

574
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,060
I know she has a blood disorder.

575
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,868
Could be PNH. She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

576
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,000
Or leukemia. She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

577
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,219
Or thalassemia. She
needs a bone marrow...

578
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,336
Yeah, I get it.

579
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,313
But she'll never survive
total body irradiation.

580
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,042
So we don't radiate her.

581
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,418
Her marrow's nearly wiped
out already, count is almost zero.

582
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,232
"Almost" being the key word. The
new marrow would attack the old marrow.

583
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,952
She'll die from
graft-versus-host.

584
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,390
You got a better idea?

585
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,788
She trusts you.
Go get her consent.

586
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,844
Sometimes I find out
things you'd rather not know.

587
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,083
This was in his trash.

588
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,091
He's using.

589
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,993
You're back.

590
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,096
Genius.

591
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:47,302
Damn, I knew the fake
works was too much.

592
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,245
Well, you had no choice.

593
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,284
Where were you gonna go
after fake-hooker-girlfriend?

594
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,481
How did you know he was outside?

595
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,454
Cane prints.

596
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,787
I'm actually kind of insulted.
No way I'm a drug addict

597
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:03,761
but you completely buy that
I fell in love with a prostitute?

598
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,626
You played to your strengths.

599
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:08,030
By which I mean you
played to your weaknesses.

600
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,637
Oh, my God.

601
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,242
You invoked your dead
girlfriend's name to sell me.

602
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,837
You're my hero.

603
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,177
Best $30 I ever spent.

604
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,410
Thirty? Did you keep her number?

605
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,612
Unfortunately, I killed her
and buried her in the basement.

606
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,656
Shame. Hungry?

607
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,749
Yeah.

608
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,420
So, seriously, where were
you the other morning?

609
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,989
Oh, don't make me do this again.

610
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,366
It has nothing to do with you.

611
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,436
Then tell me.

612
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,766
We're going bowling on Monday.

613
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,036
I'm coming over to play poker
this weekend. Nothing's changed.

614
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,633
You have to trust that.

615
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:54,874
Okay.

616
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,118
You're gonna keep
following me, aren't you?

617
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,748
It's what we do.

618
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,588
Be outside my
apartment at 8:00 tonight.

619
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,099
She said yes to the transplant.

620
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,401
Good.

621
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,739
You're in a downward
spiral of destruction.

622
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,303
I can stop.

623
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,373
You're gonna keep spiraling,
keep screwing around,

624
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,490
keep slashing away at
every person who tries to help

625
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,488
until no one tries
to help anymore,

626
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,922
until you hit bottom,
until you're dead.

627
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:47,092
But until then, I can use you.

628
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,730
You're hiring me back?

629
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,074
You did good work.

630
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:08,751
I did good work yesterday, and
I was still fired. What changed?

631
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,990
You wanted me to
spend time with her,

632
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,758
see if I could still
make a connection.

633
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,959
You connected with the
diagnosis, not with her.

634
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,866
You're trying to save
me, trying to control me.

635
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,929
You're doing exactly
what you think I'm...

636
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,030
Cracks.

637
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,068
Your lips are cracked.

638
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,206
Been using your inhaler lately?

639
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:42,652
Allergies. Don't deflect,
you always deflect.

640
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,953
Did she cry?

641
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,924
When you told her that she
was going to die, did she cry?

642
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,830
She got upset, she...

643
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,923
Were there tears?

644
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:58,597
No.

645
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,635
Chopping an onion
releases a mist

646
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,340
of Syn-propanethial-S-oxide.

647
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:15,353
A chemical irritant which causes
people to have a very predictable reaction.

648
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,183
She has no tears.

649
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,820
It was either this or
put on <i>Brian's Song,</i>

650
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,690
but I didn't have time
to stop by Wilson's.

651
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:29,461
She has Sjögren's, that attacks the
glands that produce tears and saliva.

652
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,801
It also, by the way,
causes lung cysts and RTA.

653
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,500
It doesn't cause bleeding.

654
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,132
It's like you and men.

655
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,575
Just because you usually
don't doesn't mean you can't.

656
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,409
And it doesn't cause
cracked lips in other people.

657
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,282
Lack of spit makes her mouth a
breeding ground for a fungus like Candida.

658
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,378
Her asthma inhaler
did the same for you,

659
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:52,253
wiped out your
mouth's immune system.

660
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,724
So, she's got what I've got.

661
00:39:55,994 --> 00:40:00,090
Just the opportunistic infection,
not the underlying condition.

662
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,926
Another life saved
by girl-on-girl action.

663
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,942
I'm gonna be okay?

664
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,315
You're gonna be okay.

665
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:24,481
Methylprednisolone to get
the Sjögren's under control,

666
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:29,016
and some artificial tears to maximize
the visual impact of this moment.

667
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,833
Spencer's gonna be fine,

668
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,502
and I hear you
got your job back.

669
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,044
I'm gonna keep standing
here until you say something.

670
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,758
I feel alone,

671
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,367
and she hasn't gone anywhere.

672
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,406
She gets to live.

673
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,888
I'm gonna go home. I'm tired.

674
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,337
What do you think?

675
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,005
Oh, my God.

676
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:58,539
You guys shop here, too?
Best nipples in Princeton.

677
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,278
Why are you here?

678
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,718
Because he ate the donut.

679
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:06,224
I'm so sorry. He must
have followed me.

680
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,588
I'm sure.

681
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,354
You're clearly not pregnant.

682
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,419
So either you're
buying this as a gift

683
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:15,490
or this is some kind of weird "if
you build it, they will come" moment.

684
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,330
I'm adopting a baby.

685
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,098
She asked me to be
a character reference.

686
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,036
That's where I was
