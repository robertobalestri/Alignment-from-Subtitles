00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,302
<i>Joy to the world

<i>And heaven, and
heaven and nature sing</i>

6
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:26,621
This sucks. This is why we need
to make a statement, you know?

7
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,588
I don't think that...

8
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,598
What? You afraid we'll
end up in detention?

9
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,225
Well, yeah. That's
what teachers do.

10
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,133
They're not going to
send all of us to detention.

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,571
Mr. Henderson is totally lame,

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,132
and this is our best chance
to inform him of that fact.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,811
You don't think he's lame?

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,972
Well, yeah, but...

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,447
Then what's the problem?

16
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,577
Okay.

17
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,719
<i>The Robert Page Academy
vocal jazz ensemble.</i>

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,636
<i>Chestnuts roasting

19
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,537
<i>Jack Frost nipping at your nose</i>

20
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,474
<i>Yuletide carols

21
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,875

00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,038
<i>Everybody knows</i>

23
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,604
<i>Mr. Henderson's a stupid...</i>

24
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,852
I can't believe
she fell for that.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,513
Why'd you do that...

26
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,833
I don't feel so good.

27
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:30,242
Sixteen-year-old female gets pranked, also
gets visual hallucinations and vomiting.

28
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,582
Turns out to be a failing liver.

29
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,555
Why have Foreman's breasts
suddenly started to droop?

30
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,059
Large breasts are a classic symptom of
you letting Foreman take vacation days

31
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,789
so he can finish his FDA
reports before the end of the year.

32
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,524
When are you taking vacation?

33
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,293
Hepatic and
neurological involvement...

34
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,529
So, I understand Foreman's
absence. Your presence, not so much.

35
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,114
I'm bringing in a case. You may
have noticed me doing that before.

36
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,936
I've noticed you
a lot of recently.

37
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,942
It's almost as if you have a
sexual interest in someone here.

38
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,569
Like, say, Taub?

39
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:04,380
Well, Taub might think I like him if I
stayed, which is why I'm going to do this.

40
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,981
Somehow, I don't think
that was really about me.

41
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,056
Wilson's Disease.

42
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,334
Ceruloplasmin's normal.

43
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,849
You got a Christmas present.

44
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,255
"Greg, made me think of you."

45
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,804
That's funny. It usually
explodes after I do that.

46
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,103
Alcohol abuse?

47
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,769
She's 16.

48
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,555
The kind of boozing that
destroys your liver that early,

49
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,242
her parents or
teachers would notice.

50
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,979
Wow.<i>"Manual of the Operations
of Surgery</i> by Joseph Bell."

51
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,092
You're throwing that away?

52
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,177
Twice.

53
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,400
Someone's screwing
with me, forget it.

54
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,122
Yeah, gifting antique medical
texts. Oldest gag in the book.

55
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,596
Handwriting's kind of girly.
You got an admirer, House?

56
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,394
I said, forget the book.

57
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,001
Why'd they pick on her?

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,506
She's an overachiever, high grades,
she volunteers, she's a big target.

59
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,973
I'm assuming literally,

60
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,476
depending on where this
school falls on the <i>Heathers</i> scale.

61
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,022
You think the kids slipped her
something? Their teachers grilled them.

62
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,107
When did teachers ever know
how to motivate their students?

63
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,151
What did you do to Natalie?

64
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:15,212
It's all my fault. I didn't stop
her from being a total pig.

65
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,682
What are you... Your
friend's liver is failing.

66
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,923
We're doing what we can, but
she still might need a transplant.

67
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,225
She could die, unless you
tell us what you gave her.

68
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,164
Just tell him. Shut up.

69
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,697
We gave her some shrooms.

70
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:35,038
We took some ourselves, we just
wanted to make her loosen up a little.

71
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,373
How thoughtful of
you. You got any left?

72
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,472
They're in Simon's locker.

73
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,442
This was your idea?

74
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,884
No way. I didn't
give her anything.

75
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,921
Right, you just knew
about it and let them do it.

76
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,321
Poisonous mushrooms and
hallucinogenic ones are different.

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,256
Not if they're not
dried correctly.

78
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,318
Get back to school. You
better hope we got to her in time.

79
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,564
What?

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,407
Am I going to get in trouble?
Should we apologize or something?

81
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,608
Yes, you should.
Natalie's on the third floor.

82
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,513
Who's down there? Mr. Ravitz.

83
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,846
Where's the woman
I spoke to last week?

84
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:25,120
The trial patient with
the advanced symptoms.

85
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,524
She dropped out.

86
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,593
She okay?

87
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,685
Not health related.

88
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,754
She just wants to drop out.

89
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,855
Why?

90
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,424
She didn't say. And I
only break into the houses

91
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,403
of very special patients to
get to understand them better.

92
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,436
I do good today, boss?

93
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,538
No rigidity, no cogwheeling.
So absolutely, I'd call that good.

94
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,276
Great. Thanks.

95
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,746
Your clipboard.

96
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,843
Keep it.

97
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,229
This place actually
smells of evil.

98
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,764
Where do you work again?

99
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,232
Why would House throw out a
book worth hundreds of dollars?

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,928
To make you ask that question.

101
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,147
Can you really put a price
tag on screwing with people?

102
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,198
Can you get us into Natalie
Soellner's locker while we're here?

103
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,304
House always has an agenda.
Just screwing with us isn't...

104
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,246
Yeah, he'd never do that. Oh,
wait, he already did, last year.

105
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,825
Remember the Secret
Santa gift he got himself?

106
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,341
He was making us fight over
who could get him the best present.

107
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,444
This time, he's just
making us wonder.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,151
No animosity, no ugly
competition. I think it's a real present.

109
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,592
If it's real, then House
really was freaked.

110
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,995
And if it affects him,
eventually it'll affect us.

111
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,064
Uh-oh.

112
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,365
Maybe it wasn't those
kids who poisoned Natalie.

113
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,233
Maybe it was Natalie herself.

114
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,374
I didn't try to kill myself.

115
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,809
Then why'd you have
all those painkillers?

116
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,346
In case I get a headache.

117
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,213
Well, maybe, you
took a few too many.

118
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,512
Do you have any kids? No.

119
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,318
But high school wasn't all that
different when I was your age.

120
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,726
Teenagers can be incredibly mean.
I know what you're going through.

121
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,562
I bet you were
cool. You're pretty.

122
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,569
You're pretty, too.

123
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,731
I'm fat. I'm a loser.

124
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,375
They all hate me.

125
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,708
You know what
they did last year?

126
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,042
They took these photos
of me for the yearbook.

127
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,217
But it wasn't. It was for this
website making fun of me,

128
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,589
calling me a pig.

129
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,124
Forget about them.

130
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,460
Let's just make you better.

131
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,792
What's the point?

132
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,193
Acetylcysteine could save
her liver, but we have to act fast.

133
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,813
If there's any chance that
she took all those pills...

134
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,100
There's no chance.

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,502
Okay.

136
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,874
She was the happiest,
sweetest little girl.

137
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,438
And a year ago,
she hits puberty,

138
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,678
and it's like this secretive little
stranger moved into her room.

139
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,483
I tried to talk to her about
what she's going through, but...

140
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,123
Give her the treatment.

141
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,236
Kimberley, you think
that she tried to...

142
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,354
I don't know what to think.

143
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,068
If it's a subpoena, he's gotten
that kind of present before.

144
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,607
It was a book.

145
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,142
That narrows it down.

146
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,973
Just look for someone
who knows how to read

147
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,444
or has been to a bookstore.

148
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,607
Most bookstores don't
carry Joseph Bell on surgery.

149
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,350
Did it have a note?

150
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,651
"Greg, made me think of you."

151
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,955
Green wrapping paper.

152
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,493
How did you know that?

153
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,859
What is it?

154
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,533
It's nothing.

155
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,932
Yes, when something's nothing,

156
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,683
the natural response is to guess
the color of the paper it's wrapped in

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,972
and then descend
into stunned silence.

158
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,249
Irene Adler. Christmas 2001.

159
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,980
Sarcoid symptoms, but she
didn't respond to methotrexate.

160
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,988
I've never seen him so obsessed.

161
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,294
He saved her with a
last-minute Wegener's diagnosis.

162
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,856
But the hours he put in,
I thought it would kill him.

163
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:32,996
And then, well, he fell for her.

164
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,870
But it was too soon
after Stacy and...

165
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:43,781
It sounds silly, but Irene
was the one who got away.

166
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,512
Really?

167
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,813
No, you idiots. House
is just screwing with you.

168
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,367
You think there's some
woman with a mysterious

169
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,984
green wrapping paper trademark?

170
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,994
Then how did you guess...

171
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,154
I could be wrong.

172
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:00,360
It's possible a secret admirer gave House
the same book I gave him last Christmas,

173
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,631
and the same
paper I wrapped it in,

174
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,933
and the note I wrote.

175
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,371
We gotta go.

176
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,709
Heartbeat?

177
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,805
One-fifty.

178
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,410
BP 180 over 110. Crackling
three-quarters of the way up.

179
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,987
At least this means she
didn't try to kill herself.

180
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,593
Scratch the hallucinations,
that's from the mushrooms.

181
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,602
Leaves liver failure and
now pulmonary edema.

182
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:41,268
And you standing
there beseechingly.

183
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,741
Yes, I was gonna
stalk you at home,

184
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,744
but it was a busy week
and your office is closer.

185
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,643
Thirteen and Foreman
were busy drug-trialing

186
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,182
and we needed an answer on
the overdose, so we called her in.

187
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,445
She's just updating us.

188
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,612
Convenient. Update's done.

189
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,788
This is a good experience for me
as my parents never got divorced.

190
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,920
Theories? Glue sniffing.

191
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,673
Effects on the lungs
would have been immediate.

192
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,326
House, we all know
what's going on here.

193
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,234
Cuddy gave you that present.

194
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,362
No.

195
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,632
Infections?

196
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,640
No fever, no polys
in the sputum.

197
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,107
I think...

198
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,701
I think she loves you.

199
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,906
I told you to lay
off the present.

200
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,115
And the LSD.

201
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,483
We got distracted by the painkillers,
toxins are still the most likely...

202
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,545
Just tell her how you feel.

203
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:33,322
If you won't, then I will.
I'll walk right down there.

204
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,491
Damn it, love like
this needs to fly free.

205
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,832
You talked to Wilson.

206
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,340
He has very girly
handwriting, by the way.

207
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,843
I knew I should have just
wrapped a new present.

208
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,072
You said the patient
volunteered. Where?

209
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,775
Pleasant Valley.

210
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,976
Soup kitchen in Trenton.

211
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,350
Thirteen and Kutner, go
search the home and the school.

212
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,951
Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the
fragrant and contagious homeless men.

213
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,597
Why don't you hang
out in the video store

214
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,100
and tell everyone Kevin
Spacey's Keyser Soze?

215
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,497
By the way, that ending
really made no sense at all.

216
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,372
You had my present for a
year and didn't even open it?

217
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,968
I had no way of knowing there
was an expensive book inside.

218
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,276
Completely meaningless
prank, even for you.

219
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,308
Stealing your ice cream is a completely
meaningless, albeit delicious, prank.

220
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,505
Observing my team's reactions
to unexplained phenomena

221
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,988
could have been pretty useful.

222
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,959
Of all the ways to mess with people,
why give yourself an imaginary present?

223
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,861
Have you checked the prices
for firemen strippers recently?

224
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,364
Yes.

225
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,993
The holidays. They're
hard for you, I get it.

226
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,561
You see the people around
you giving and receiving gifts,

227
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,132
having sustained, meaningful
relationships. And since you can't,

228
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,977
something deep in your subconscious
makes you create the appearance of a gift.

229
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,139
Sad.

230
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,685
You really passed
your psych rotation?

231
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,643
It's too bad you
can't just be nice to

232
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,985
people. You could get
a real present that way.

233
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,922
If I wanted gifts,

234
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,155
I would just look deep into my
patient's eyes and act like you.

235
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,232
"Oh, I'm so sorry
you're dying, Mrs. Moron.

236
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,565
"Of course I'll sleep with you. What
I lack in skill, I can make up for in..."

237
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,504
You'd just wind up insulting her.
Perhaps calling her Mrs. Moron.

238
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,167
Right. 'Cause I'm physically
incapable of being polite.

239
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:34,271
Being kind in a sustained,
meaningful way? No.

240
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,509
Oh, I get it. You're trying to
get me to prove you wrong,

241
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,713
then I'm gonna be nice to all my
patients all through the holiday season

242
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,384
and then Mr. Potter won't steal
Tiny Tim's porridge. I'm totally on it.

243
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,520
Yeah, that actually is
what I'm trying to do.

244
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,861
And the pathetic part
is, it's not going to work.

245
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,527
You're right.

246
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,033
I gotta stop being such a jerk.

247
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,466
Oops!

248
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,637
Kind of undercut myself there.

249
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,150
Janice?

250
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,719
I'm Remy. I'm...
Yeah, I remember you.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,764
I heard you left the trial.

252
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,895
Yeah.

253
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,204
If there's some
way I could help...

254
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,441
It was that doctor. The one
that was running the test.

255
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,174
Dr. Foreman. Yeah.

256
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,411
He's a great neurologist.
He's a great guy.

257
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,282
You like him?

258
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,449
Why don't you?

259
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,982
I told him that those injections
were making me sick in my stomach,

260
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,757
and he just gave me antacid.

261
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,764
We were warned that
nausea's a side effect,

262
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,300
and giving you antacid
is all he really could do.

263
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,930
No. He told me, "Get over it."

264
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,704
With or without these drugs,

265
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,242
I don't have a long time.

266
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,879
I'm not gonna spend
it being his guinea pig.

267
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,555
House.

268
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,593
It's tuberculosis.

269
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,025
You got that from an anal
swab? Man, you're good.

270
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,622
There was a more subtle clue.

271
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,066
Homeless guy, uncontrollably
hacking up blood.

272
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,866
Cough's lasted two
months. He was cachectic.

273
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,169
Unless you could
tie him to the patient...

274
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,573
Yes, again, if only there
was some subtle clue,

275
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,512
like the fact that he was standing
next to her in the soup line for a week.

276
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,673
I hate spunk.

277
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,842
TB can cause liver
failure, lung symptoms.

278
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,976
Fits.

279
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,720
Start her on the
standard regimen.

280
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,415
You don't have
clinic duty today.

281
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,748
Who says it's a duty?

282
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,561
Hi. I'm Greg.

283
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,153
Hi. I'm Whitney.

284
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,563
Hi, Whitney, how can I help you?

285
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,227
I have a terrible headache.

286
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,533
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

287
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:15,200
We'll get you fixed up. Is
there anything else you need?

288
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,766
Bottled water? Coffee? Mint tea?

289
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,278
No, but that's so nice.

290
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,712
Usually, the clinic
doctors are kind of rushed.

291
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,350
If you can't be nice,
why be a doctor?

292
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,514
So, where do you feel the pain?

293
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,613
In the back of my
head, here. Uh-huh.

294
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,320
It's Beccaria's sign. It'll be
gone by your third trimester.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,251
Oh, I'm not in school.

296
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,993
Neither is your fetus.

297
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,235
Oh, God.

298
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,513
You didn't know
you were pregnant?

299
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,063
How do... You know that
just from the headache?

300
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,236
How do I know?

301
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,480
I missed my period, I
got fat and threw up.

302
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,345
Oh, no, wait, that's
how you know.

303
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,439
What?

304
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,453
I know because of the tight shirt
stretched over the swollen boobs,

305
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,614
the salt craving you
imported into the clinic,

306
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,816
the motion sickness patch
that doesn't do anything

307
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,156
for the kind of sickness
that you feel in the morning.

308
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,219
I'm a virgin. So is my fiancé.

309
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,731
I believe him.

310
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,733
Aren't there other ways
I could get pregnant?

311
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,100
Like sitting on a toilet seat?

312
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,766
Absolutely. There would need to be a guy
sitting between you and the toilet seat,

313
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,332
but, yes, absolutely.

314
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,678
And I was doing so well.

315
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,378
Natalie?

316
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,654
Oh, God. Natalie.

317
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,122
She's having a seizure.

318
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,317
Put her on her side. Nurse!

319
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,190
Is this from the TB?

320
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,593
Not with a supple neck.
I don't know what this is.

321
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,097
Four milligrams lorazepam.

322
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:55,732
Liver, lungs, and now brain,
which has mysteriously reappeared.

323
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,437
Speaking of
mysteriously reappeared...

324
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:03,608
Her ALT is 20 times normal,
transaminases and PTs, way up.

325
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,744
She's going to lose her liver. We
gotta get her on the transplant list.

326
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,653
You keep showing up.
You also keep leaving.

327
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:13,853
It's possible that you have the hots
for me, but really, really hate this kid.

328
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,919
It's also remotely possible
I have that reversed.

329
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,726
She's a nice kid, I want
to make sure she's okay.

330
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,960
Hepatic fibrosis.

331
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,968
Normal complement
level, normal-sized liver.

332
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,231
She remind you of you?

333
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,965
No, you weren't a
loser in high school.

334
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,033
You had every Tom, Dick and
Hershel wet dreaming about you.

335
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,080
But she could be making
you think of another helpless,

336
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,240
chubby little girl
that you recently met.

337
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:40,082
You're not really making this
about the baby I tried to adopt.

338
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,814
It's been a few weeks.

339
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,516
Just enough time to
get over hurt feelings.

340
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,422
Natalie's 16.

341
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,894
I think you're confusing being
maternal with being human.

342
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,655
If we hadn't ruled
out the mushrooms...

343
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,564
Maybe we shouldn't have.

344
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,500
Forget toxic, think allergic.

345
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:00,370
Severe mold allergy could cause
liver failure, respiratory arrest,

346
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,566
and encephalopathy.

347
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,052
She ate the shrooms days ago.
There's no way she'd still be sick.

348
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:09,140
Unless it also gave her a fungal infection.
Give her a prick test and antifungals.

349
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,417
Hey. Thank you for the
gift. I really appreciate it.

350
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,192
I spoke to Janice.

351
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,355
She okay?

352
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,489
Yeah.

353
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,728
Her nausea, she said you
told her, like, "Get over it"?

354
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,033
And?

355
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,504
Nausea isn't something you can
overcome with sheer willpower.

356
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,881
Which is why I didn't prescribe
willpower, I prescribed antacids.

357
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,883
She can't handle that, she'd
have to leave the trial anyway.

358
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,284
Just call her, say you're
sorry, she'll come back.

359
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,112
No.

360
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,090
God, you're acting
like House now.

361
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,922
No, I'm not acting like House,

362
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,894
which is exactly why I
don't need to apologize.

363
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,673
I'm not being cruel, I'm
not being manipulative.

364
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,442
You said the same thing to me when
I told you I was having a hard time.

365
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,094
And it worked.

366
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,660
She's a 40-year-old
woman who's falling apart,

367
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,707
physically and
emotionally. She's dying.

368
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:13,138
Look, I know seeing the Ghost
of your Christmas Future is tough,

369
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,957
but the only way I can help her is to
make sure she follows her regimen,

370
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,677
not by becoming her life coach.

371
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:22,480
You're not acting like
House. You are like him.

372
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,727
Dr. House?

373
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,321
This is my fiancé, Geoff.

374
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,227
She says you told her you can get
pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.

375
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,773
I said those words, but
with a particular inflection.

376
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,408
I knew it wasn't true.

377
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,777
Is there any other
way? Isn't it possible?

378
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,178
There was a reported
case of a Civil War soldier.

379
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,394
He was shot in the testicles,

380
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:57,049
and the musket ball
carried the non-musket ball

381
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,116
into the uterus of a woman
working in a neighboring field.

382
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,627
Nine months later, a
miracle child was born.

383
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,793
Also, maybe she cheated on you.

384
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,060
We made a promise.

385
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,035
We do other stuff in bed.

386
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,163
Couldn't some of his sperm
have made it up there somehow?

387
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,471
More likely it came from the guy
whose penis made it up there somehow,

388
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,535
but sure, anything's possible.

389
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,240
I want a paternity test.

390
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,892
Tell him that amnios are dangerous
this early on in the pregnancy.

391
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,385
Are they? Who cares?
He doesn't know.

392
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,046
We'll do the paternity test.

393
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,359
No reaction.

394
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,523
That's bad?

395
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,710
If you had a mold allergy, it
would explain your symptoms.

396
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,726
We'll find out what's
wrong, don't worry.

397
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,069
And I know some things are hard to
talk about with your parents around,

398
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,701
but kids can be really mean. There
are people you can talk to, programs...

399
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,267
I'll be okay.

400
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,574
You're in good spirits.
You feeling better?

401
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,586
No. I was just
doing my homework.

402
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,849
I'm such a dork, I
guess that cheers me up.

403
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,117
Parents brought it?

404
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,624
No, Simon did.

405
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,024
The jockey kid in your class?

406
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,153
Yeah. He just left.

407
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,500
Security.

408
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,469
I was just bringing
her homework.

409
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,217
You helped bully
this little girl and

410
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,268
completely refused
to accept responsibility.

411
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,618
No way you came here out of
compassion. That only leaves guilt.

412
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:24,920
What did you do to her? Nothing.

413
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,088
Stop lying or I'll take the
drugs I found in your locker

414
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,206
down to the cops,
you slimy little jerk.

415
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,261
This kid didn't do
anything to you.

416
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,309
This isn't about me.

417
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,584
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, you were
bullied yourself when you were in school.

418
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,625
Take it easy. I wasn't bullied.

419
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,337
Right. The Indian foster kid whose
parents were shot in front of him.

420
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,353
You were clearly
Homecoming King.

421
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,032
Let's try this
again. Just tell me...

422
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,071
Honestly, you don't understand.

423
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,302
We used to be friends.

424
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,006
And I'd be friends with her now if
people wouldn't make fun of me.

425
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,073
There's nothing you
could tell us that'll help?

426
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,887
Did she mention she
used to drink a lot?

427
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,683
No. How do you know that?

428
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,185
Look, don't tell
anyone, all right?

429
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,660
I have my brother's ID
and I kind of supply people.

430
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,028
I used to get her a few
bottles of vodka each week.

431
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,259
Why'd you stop?

432
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,356
She got her own ID.

433
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,163
Said it was cheaper
buying it herself.

434
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,298
You can go.

435
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,273
I think we got our diagnosis.
Our little girl's a drunk.

436
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,176
I don't drink. I did
back then, but...

437
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,949
You could die.

438
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,686
We can't get you on the transplant list
until we know why your liver is failing.

439
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,558
Alcohol abuse
would explain that.

440
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,742
The seizures could
be from withdrawal.

441
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,426
I haven't drunk in six months.

442
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,662
I didn't even drink
that much back then.

443
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,670
A couple of vodka
bottles a week?

444
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,237
I didn't open half of them.

445
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:07,803
I just bought them because
Simon was selling them.

446
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,042
We used to be friends,
and that's, like, the only way

447
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,606
I could get him
to even talk to me.

448
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:15,485
Then why did you stop buying from
him? He said you got your own ID.

449
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,618
I don't know.

450
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,215
See, that's not a good answer.

451
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,723
Remember when you
asked me if I had any kids?

452
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,707
I don't. I don't know, maybe
it has nothing to do with it,

453
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:30,294
but I was good at school,
good at work, lousy at life.

454
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,634
I screwed up every
relationship I ever had.

455
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,368
I thought, why would I
want to bring a child into this?

456
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,409
But then I got older and...

457
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:48,511
How you feel now will pass.
Don't let it screw up your whole life.

458
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,085
It's already screwed up.

459
00:24:54,927 --> 00:25:00,093
My asthma. They said they'd fix it,
but it didn't make any difference at all.

460
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,133
Well, sometimes doctors
make mistakes, Anna,

461
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,605
and then we have to try
twice as hard to fix them.

462
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,800
You using your inhaler?

463
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,002
All the time. Go
through one a week.

464
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,071
You sure you're using it right?

465
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,240
Do I look like an idiot?

466
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,374
No.

467
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,379
Why don't you show me
how your inhaler works?

468
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:31,924
Jerk.

469
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,865
What was that all about?

470
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,904
Jamaican chicken recipes.

471
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,181
The parents said
no to the benzos.

472
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,198
But I still think Natalie's
not being honest with me.

473
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,540
So she's willing to die to
cover up some boozing?

474
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,977
She's very depressed.

475
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,505
She feels like she deserves what
the other kids are dishing out on her.

476
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,914
I think she either wants to die

477
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:55,045
or she wants the attention
that dying gives her.

478
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,921
I have no idea why you care so
much. Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.

479
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,084
House, the parents just...

480
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,718
Uh-uh. Not the alcoholism,

481
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:05,026
the seizures, totally different.
Don't need their approval for that.

482
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,272
You sure you want to know?

483
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,538
If it makes it any easier,
I'm going to tell you anyway.

484
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,836
We want to know.

485
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,114
What does it say?

486
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,522
Don't leave.

487
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,740
You go home last night?

488
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,244
I meant to, but started reading
this file, just couldn't put it down.

489
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,802
Let me ask you.

490
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,757
That patient who dropped
out, the one I told you about?

491
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,044
Yeah.

492
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,812
Do you think I should
pursue it more?

493
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:02,787
No. Patients drop out, that's
why we start with hundreds.

494
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:03,914
I just thought,

495
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,968
if there's an easy way to make the people
who drop off come back, then why not?

496
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,223
They're not people. Really?

497
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,321
I thought the zombie trials were
all completed during Phase Two.

498
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,317
You can't see the patients as people.
You can't even see them as patients.

499
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,391
They're numbers.

500
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,561
Look.

501
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,632
A friend of mine
has this disease.

502
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,302
I don't want to know. There's
a reason this is double-blind.

503
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,242
Any personal stake we
have skews the study.

504
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,406
Science is not about human
relationships, it's about results.

505
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,575
But you know that.
You work for House.

506
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,846
Why do you think I brought
you on as my partner?

507
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,321
Dr. Taub!

508
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,000
She was talking to me and
then she just passed out.

509
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,424
Her heart's slowing down.

510
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,551
Can you fix it?

511
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,029
Can you fix it? I'm trying.

512
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,758
Push one amp atropine.

513
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:59,069
We've been waiting here for
six hours. Am I the father or not?

514
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:06,885
No, but she also
didn't cheat on you.

515
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,292
Normally, sperm meets egg,

516
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,161
<i>DNA meets DNA, goes
back to her place, cells divide.</i>

517
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,099
<i>Nine months later,
joy is bundled.</i>

518
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,499
That's normally.

519
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:28,832
Abnormally, an egg could have two
naturally occurring gene mutations

520
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,069
that don't naturally
occur together.

521
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:37,074
<i>Spontaneous calcium spike could prep
the egg for fertilization without sperm.</i>

522
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,675
<i>And a division mistake
could let the egg split up</i>

523
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,913
<i>without ever needing
male DNA at all.</i>

524
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,216
Parthenogenesis. A
baby without a daddy.

525
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,626
In humans, it's only ever been
theorized, and it was never proved.

526
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,031
Until now.

527
00:28:55,367 --> 00:29:00,567
Mommy, baby. Your daughter
has only maternal DNA.

528
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:06,510
I personally checked this five
times. In seven months, you will have

529
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,547
a virgin birth.

530
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,052
Merry Christmas.

531
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,833
I've got to tell you
about this clinic patient.

532
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,029
Natalie's liver's continuing
to fail. And now bradycardia.

533
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,732
Atropine isn't keeping
the heart rate up,

534
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,740
we're going to have to
put her on a pacemaker.

535
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,903
Alcohol withdrawal would
cause her heart to race, not crawl.

536
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,656
There's nothing structurally
wrong with her heart.

537
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,377
EKG, echo, electrolyte
panel are all normal.

538
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,917
Multiple endocrine syndrome?

539
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,317
Free T4's normal.
Hypothalamic brain tumor?

540
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,322
Didn't come up on the CT scan.

541
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:55,422
It's hitting all her organs. Could
be the blood. What's her Alk-Phos?

542
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,659
Three hundred.

543
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,159
It can't be leukemia.

544
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,286
High Alk-Phos could
also be from liver failure.

545
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,906
She's a teenager, means bone
growth and destruction could throw it off.

546
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,176
Maybe. But it's higher
than you'd expect.

547
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,748
Start her on chemo.

548
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,447
We'll do a bone marrow
biopsy to confirm.

549
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,547
Why are you ordering
tests instead of treatment?

550
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,889
Her heart and liver are about to
give up. Do whatever you need to.

551
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,486
Why are you so
attached to this girl?

552
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,931
It's your call.

553
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,633
He doesn't want us to treat her.

554
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:43,676
If it's leukemia, even if
we kill every cancer cell,

555
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,086
her heart and liver
are too far gone.

556
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,134
A double transplant.

557
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,943
With brain involvement? The
committee won't even open the file.

558
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,446
There's no reason
to put a dying girl

559
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,043
through a painful
treatment if it can't save her.

560
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59,889
He's being kind.

561
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,059
I'll arrange a biopsy.

562
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,669
Mrs. Burke?

563
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,105
We're conducting another
trial in tandem with yours.

564
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,078
Same drug, lower dose.

565
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,140
The nausea would be less.

566
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,345
I did some checking,
I can switch you.

567
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,647
Here's the forms
if you want back in.

568
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,263
What if we're wrong?

569
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,860
Maybe we shouldn't have
overlooked autoimmunes.

570
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,165
High sed rate.

571
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,433
We went over this.

572
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,801
Normal complement level.

573
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:56,213
So it isn't hepatic fibrosis, it could
still be microangiopathic vasculitis.

574
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,543
With high dose steroids,
we might be able to reverse...

575
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,612
You run a hospital that treats
thousands of patients every day.

576
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,123
Some of them die. Every day.

577
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:09,184
If you're gonna get this worked
up over every one of them...

578
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,995
Yes.

579
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,292
BRB.

580
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,369
What is it?

581
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,065
Thank you from a patient.

582
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,401
For you?

583
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,805
I saved her marriage

584
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,675
by showing that her pregnancy
was a result of parthenogenesis.

585
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,907
Human parthenogenesis?
You proved...

586
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,004
Yep.

587
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,074
It's unbelievable. But I
personally checked it five times.

588
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,813
How did you check it five times?

589
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,597
The cycler's broken. You
would have had to send it out.

590
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,385
It would have taken... Oh, yeah.

591
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,359
That does sound impossible
now that I think of it.

592
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,056
I guess the better explanation is that
the paternity test showed she cheated,

593
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,996
so I faked the whole
parthenogenesis thingy.

594
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,000
What? Why?

595
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,331
I win.

596
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:58,701
You faked a scientific miracle
just to win a bet with Wilson?

597
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,972
More an argument.

598
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,523
I realize it would have been
simpler to just fake the paternity test,

599
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,073
but, hey, Christmas
spirit and all that.

600
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,810
I think you're confusing
"nice" and "evil" again.

601
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,133
Letting the woman
deceive her husband by

602
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,655
inventing a virgin
birth, just so you can...

603
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,436
And it obviously would
have been more fitting

604
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,555
if the baby had been born on
Christmas, not just invented then.

605
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,296
It's not leukemia.

606
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,232
Seizures, liver failure.

607
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,700
It's eclampsia.

608
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,107
Which means we don't
have one dead patient,

609
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,640
we have two.

610
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,529
You have a disease
called eclampsia.

611
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:56,500
It causes liver failure,
pulmonary edema and seizures.

612
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,662
It's also associated
with cardio myopathy.

613
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,697
That's a pregnancy disease.
You tested her when she came in.

614
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,804
You can get eclampsia up
to a month after giving birth.

615
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,871
That's ridiculous. How
could she hide a pregnancy?

616
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:14,147
Loose clothes. She's heavy to
begin with, it was probably premature.

617
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,917
If it was three weeks ago, they could
have missed it on a physical exam.

618
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,254
The baby's why you
quit drinking, isn't it?

619
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,888
Why you asked me if I had kids.

620
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,056
Why you feel guilty.

621
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,237
I'm sorry.

622
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,538
Oh...

623
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,971
Who did this to you?

624
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,101
Simon.

625
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,003
It wasn't bad.

626
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,957
We were, like,
boyfriend-girlfriend for a while,

627
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,177
we just didn't tell anyone.

628
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,749
He doesn't even know about...

629
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,121
What happened to the baby?

630
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,750
I was going to give her away.

631
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,326
If they found out at school...

632
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,857
I was at the soup kitchen,
and she started coming.

633
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,765
There was this empty
house down the street, but...

634
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,500
And she wasn't breathing.

635
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:15,546
I tried so hard, but I couldn't
do anything. I'm so sorry.

636
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,185
If I had her in a hospital,
maybe she'd be alive.

637
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,846
Can you cure this?

638
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:29,051
The damage to the heart
and liver are permanent.

639
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,887
I'm gonna die?

640
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,869
I'm sorry.

641
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,141
I didn't even bury her.

642
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,981
I just put my coat over her.

643
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,470
Get out of my house.

644
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,272
I'm a doctor.

645
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,540
I don't care who you are.

646
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,209
Did you find the body of a baby?

647
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,377
I said get out.

648
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,619
Michael?

649
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,853
Who are you?

650
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,599
That's not your baby.

651
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,027
You're tiny. There's no way
you gave birth three weeks ago.

652
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,936
She's my sister's.

653
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,442
That baby is sick. She needs
clean water. She needs real heat.

654
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:28,207
She was probably born
with a partially blocked airway

655
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,805
and might even
have brain damage.

656
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,652
You can't take care of
her in a place like this.

657
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,050
Shut up.

658
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,948
I took care of her.

659
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,115
I know.

660
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,856
You found her.

661
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,560
You saved her life.

662
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,003
Now you have to let her go.

663
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,904
Who's that?

664
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,839
It's your daughter.
She was alive.

665
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,834
People found her
and took care of her.

666
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,527
She's beautiful.

667
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,303
It's okay.

668
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,500
Kutner.

669
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,736
No transplant?

670
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,903
We appealed. Too sick.

671
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,978
How much time
does she have left?

672
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,412
A couple days at most.

673
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,813
What about the baby?

674
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,852
Seems healthy, but
it's too early to tell.

675
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,355
She's in the hospital for observation
for a few days. But after that...

676
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,447
Best case, winds up
with her teenage father,

677
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,687
who just got voted captain
of the varsity bullying team.

678
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,023
He's just a kid.

679
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,595
You all right? I gotta go.

680
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,546
Jonathan? Yeah?

681
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,658
It's Lawrence Kutner.

682
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,994
Why are you here?

683
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:36,364
I wanted to apologize for all the
horrible stuff I did to you in high school.

684
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,530
I'm sorry.

685
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,228
What's going to happen to her?

686
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,560
I spoke to both
sets of grandparents.

687
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,763
It's too painful. They're
putting her up for adoption.

688
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,873
What are you going to do?

689
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,307
I already spoke to a lawyer.

690
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:26,815
I become a foster
parent and then I adopt.

691
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,166
Merry Christmas, Cuddy.

692
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,325
Hey.

693
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,157
Where is everybody?

694
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,722
Down at the party.

695
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,626
I heard Janice is
back on the trial.

696
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,327
My Christmas gift to you.

697
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,736
I was wrong. You're not House.

698
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,136
Yeah. Well, that's my
Christmas gift to myself.

699
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,720
We should go to the party.

700
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,690
We should.
