1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,297
Who picked this dump?

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,467
You suggested it.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,538
I suggested you look into it.

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,046
Sorry, the online reviews...

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,015
Were obviously written by some
geek in their own marketing department.

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,745
Next time, call
someone you know.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,413
Stop relying on a computer
to do your job for you.

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,511
Brightsize Apparel,

9
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,266
eight sexual harassment
suits in two years.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,952
Who asked for the
meeting? They did.

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,558
Patty Michener, President
of Women's Majority.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,798
And, wow, do you guys need me.

13
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,070
Nine men?

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,110
No one thought it might be a good
idea to put a suit on one of the gals

15
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,441
from the steno pool to make
it look like you give a damn?

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,072
We've made it a priority to
promote more women, but...

17
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,777
Well, from now on, you
have me standing beside you.

18
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,219
Which is good, because your
problem is a national problem.

19
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,498
With all due respect,
Miss Michener,

20
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,084
I'd hardly call a few isolated
incidents a national problem.

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,494
Six out of 10 victims never
even report harassment,

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,807
this is bigger than
just eight women.

23
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,356
That still only means 20.

24
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,129
Not enough for you?

25
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:12,104
How many asses does your
corporate policy allow you to grab?

26
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,765
Tell you what
you're going to do,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,275
you're gonna settle with
anyone you haven't settled with,

28
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,642
you're going to fire any man
who's even been accused.

29
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:19,839
Somebody, help me!

30
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,745
Please, help me! I
can't get them off!

31
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:26,082
Please help me! Help me, please!

32
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:29,089
Somebody help me! Get them off!

33
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,524
You gonna call an ambulance or
you just gonna sit there and stare?

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,757
Help me, please!

35
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,246
Wilson's back. You gonna...

36
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,839
Been gone two months,

37
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,250
he can wait till I finish slaying a
guy in a skullcap and a pair of tights.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,516
On a video game you stole
from the pediatric ward?

39
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,993
On advice of counsel, I assert
my privilege pursuant to the Fifth.

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,011
When was the last
time you talked to him?

41
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,834
Uh, I think it was after...

42
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,872
When did his girlfriend die?

43
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,610
He wanted time alone.

44
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,646
I considered being a
horrendous pain in the ass,

45
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,147
but I didn't want to
tread on your turf.

46
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,807
We got a case.

47
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,327
I got to remember
to close the blinds.

48
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,115
Just got a call from
Patty Michener,

49
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,830
from Women's Majority,
the women's rights...

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,414
We know who she is. I dated her.

51
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,049
Well, not really dated her,

52
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,289
more metaphorically
raped her by having a penis.

53
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,729
You did, too. Her
assistant flipped out,

54
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,597
ripped off her clothes in front
of a roomful of businessmen.

55
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,397
Either she cracked
under the whip,

56
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,496
or she started to realize
that her evolutionary purpose

57
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,803
is to arouse men,
not to castrate them.

58
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,967
Send her to psychiatric...

59
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,601
Anemia, bradycardia,

60
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,273
and abdominal pain aren't
psychiatric symptoms.

61
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,784
Then it's the latter, send
her to my apartment.

62
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,183
I'll give it to Segal.

63
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,482
House actually wants a
case, and you're saying no?

64
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,218
House has more
important things to do.

65
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,385
Sorry, can't help you.

66
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,929
You need a specialist to
remove those kinds of warts.

67
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,362
Preferably one with
experience spelunking.

68
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,831
Hallucinations,
possible memory loss,

69
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,172
tests show anemia,
slow heart rate,

70
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,179
and a stubborn refusal
to shave her pits.

71
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,544
Have you seen Wilson?

72
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:11,346
No, but I have seen the
patient's frequent flyer balance.

73
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,150
Eastern Europe, Asia, third-world
countries, sometimes more than one a day.

74
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,214
No fever means it's
not a tropical disease.

75
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,759
If it's not where she went,
maybe it's the work hours.

76
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,226
Could be amphetamine abuse.

77
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,263
She's probably popping
them like breath mints.

78
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,662
You haven't been by his office?

79
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,896
Is Wilson hallucinating ants
crawling all over him, too?

80
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,337
Tox screen's cleaner than
the windows she won't do.

81
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,816
Her job keeps her
constantly on the road,

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,436
probably living off of airline
peanuts and diet soda.

83
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,946
Severe B12 deficiency
could cause all her symptoms.

84
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,657
Why is everyone
leaping to conclude

85
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,708
a strong career woman's been
made sick by her strong career?

86
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,947
It's not B12. It's an
insulinoma in her pancreas,

87
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,454
it's making her hypoglycemic.

88
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,959
Great, now everyone knows.

89
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,086
You knew the patient had cancer?

90
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,131
Is that what she said?

91
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,688
I thought she said,

92
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,792
"I'm suddenly and irrationally
defending the patient's strong career,

93
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,099
"even though in reality
she's just a glorified grunt

94
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,783
"because I'm trying to convince
myself that it's okay not to have a life,

95
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,800
"" cause I don't have a life,
because I was tested for Huntington's

96
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,902
"and my lifespan's
been cut in half."

97
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,746
Been waiting two
months for her to say that.

98
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,308
Hallucinations,
anemia, bradycardia...

99
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,877
Hyper segmented polys
says that Taub's right.

100
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,252
Pump her full of B12,

101
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,282
see how a strong career woman's
been made sick by her strong career.

102
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,900
Are you okay?

103
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,838
It could be years before
you see any symptoms.

104
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,136
Why wouldn't you tell us?

105
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,768
I don't have Huntington's.

106
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,973
Are you lying to us? Because
it's none of our business.

107
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,392
If it's none of your business, I
shouldn't have to answer questions.

108
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,294
And I wouldn't have to, except
House doesn't want to answer

109
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,411
questions about Wilson.

110
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,613
He's deflecting his
own problems onto me.

111
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,589
Are you deflecting now?

112
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,151
Time for the B12
cocktail and my life lesson.

113
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,458
No, Patty'll do the hearing, she just
needs to be the lead-off witness so she...

114
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,130
Okay. I'll lock it down today.

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,533
Need you back in bed.

116
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,009
My boss has a big Beijing trip,
I've been planning it for months.

117
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,773
I was just tired
and dehydrated...

118
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,245
Yeah, whenever I
lose some shut-eye,

119
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,148
I pound my legs clawing
at imaginary ant colonies.

120
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,809
You have a severe
B12 deficiency.

121
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,650
Get back in bed.

122
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,413
I'm sure your boss can do
without you for a few days.

123
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,407
It's not about
her, it's about me.

124
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,568
I want to be there,
I want to matter.

125
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,580
Yeah, I mean, without you, who knows
how much starch they'd put in her shirts?

126
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,126
I'm sorry, I'm sure your
boss depends on you for...

127
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,895
I need to get up. No,
you need to stay in bed.

128
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,947
Please, where's the bed pan?
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I just...

129
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,452
I just had a bowel movement.

130
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,620
It's okay, B12 deficiency
can cause sudden...

131
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,166
That's not a bowel movement.

132
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,340
My patient is still fighting in the
feminist trenches, but the war is over.

133
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,346
Yesterday's sluts are
today's empowered women,

134
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,645
today's sluts are celebrities.
If that isn't progress...

135
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,241
I'm leaving.

136
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,150
What, you're gonna
take another two months?

137
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,214
Boy, you're really milking this
bereavement thing, aren't you?

138
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,653
I mean, good for you.
Take all the time you need.

139
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,163
I'm resigning.

140
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,696
Maybe moving out of New
Jersey, I don't know yet.

141
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,363
Okay, that's an
understandable reaction.

142
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,407
It's not a reaction,
it's a decision.

143
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,339
I'm writing Cuddy my
resignation right now.

144
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,175
I'm just back for the week to wrap up
my clinical and administrative duties.

145
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,983
You of all people should
know, this is bereavement 101.

146
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,484
You think that a
change in venue...

147
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,351
Well, that spares me
decades of psychoanalysis.

148
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,151
I'm not saying
you're not in pain.

149
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,851
You're saying
my pain's a cliché.

150
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,621
I'm saying that pain fades.

151
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,161
Did yours?

152
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,719
Physical pain is different.

153
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,662
I'd rather have
my leg chopped off.

154
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,209
You don't know that
'cause you haven't felt...

155
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,462
Neither have you.

156
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,899
Sorry, patient's
got a rectal bleed.

157
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,270
I'm busy. We need you to...

158
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,400
Actually, as you
can see, I'm not busy.

159
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,378
It was just a euphemism
for "get the hell out of here."

160
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:41,221
This is your grief talking,
and, yeah, it is a bit textbook.

161
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,086
So before you give away all your
possessions to the Salvation Army...

162
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,284
My girlfriend's dead.

163
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,987
I'm glad you've read
that book before, I haven't.

164
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,589
I'm late to meet Dr. Olan to brief
him on the cases I'm handing over.

165
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,196
Bye.

166
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,459
It doesn't bother you
that House wouldn't take

167
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,384
just two seconds to
talk about the patient?

168
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,750
Wilson's dealing with a lot.

169
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,220
And our patient may be dying.

170
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,528
She was bleeding out her
rear, we're looking up her rear.

171
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,802
You think we needed House's
expertise to set us on this course?

172
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,670
Her heart rate's slow, bleed
should have made it faster.

173
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,822
And it can wait till after we
know where it came from.

174
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,025
And after he's done
dealing with personal issues.

175
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,610
Yeah? That the way
it works around here?

176
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,627
We get cut slack while we
deal with personal issues?

177
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,005
You're not the boss.

178
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,409
Boss gets to make the
rules, boss gets to ignore...

179
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,648
She's bleeding from nowhere.

180
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,811
You did an endoscopy?

181
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,013
And a colonoscopy.

182
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,283
CT scan? Ordered.

183
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,067
But it shouldn't show
anything the endoscopy didn't.

184
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,457
We can't do a CT scan.

185
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,549
Why not?

186
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,822
We don't need a CT
scan, we don't need House.

187
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,158
Stop grinning and talk.

188
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,270
One of the routine
pre-procedure tests was positive.

189
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,528
Which one? The
one that if it's positive

190
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,001
would explain a
hormone imbalance

191
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,436
that could screw with
heart rate and blood flow.

192
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,740
Guess she does have
a life beyond her career.

193
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,507
I'm pregnant?

194
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,275
You want to call the
father? Let him know?

195
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,943
Soon as you do some
DNA testing, let me know.

196
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,796
Must be hard to have a real
relationship when you're...

197
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,085
Are you making excuses for me?

198
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm just saying it's
understandable.

199
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,692
You only have to understand
something if it needs an explanation.

200
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,026
I have needs, I met my
needs, end of explanation.

201
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,623
How recently were you needy?

202
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,660
It's been two or
three months at least.

203
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,500
What? What is it?

204
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,598
Nothing.

205
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,611
Tell me. It's actually, nothing.

206
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,747
The ultrasound shows
no trace of a baby at all.

207
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,650
Positive pregnancy
test, no pregnancy.

208
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,450
B12 deficit rectified, but her
heart's slowing even more.

209
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,689
And a bleed should
speed her heart rate.

210
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,225
House, this is the
kind of case you love,

211
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,430
contradictions piling
up left and right.

212
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,708
Two false positive
pregnancy tests,

213
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,143
bradycardia, lower GI bleed. Go.

214
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,738
Choriocarcinoma, would've
triggered pregnancy hormones.

215
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,373
Also would've shown
on the sonogram.

216
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,611
Immunoglobulin A deficiency.

217
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,709
No urinary bleed.

218
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,655
If she's had beta-HCG injections,
they can cross-react with...

219
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,483
Keep going.

220
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,397
You're being an idiot.

221
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,933
You're gonna blow up your
career, then six months from now,

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,333
when you've moved on
from Amber to burnt sienna,

223
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,568
you're gonna be stuck on a mobile
oncology truck in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

224
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,940
I'd need a flow chart to
explain all the ways in which

225
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,808
that was ridiculously
insensitive.

226
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,279
You can't hide from misery.

227
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,111
This isn't your business.

228
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,413
My skull was cracked
open trying to save her.

229
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,683
Then we all need a little tea and
sympathy. I'm through discussing it.

230
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,117
We have a patient.

231
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,854
Who's obviously not going
anywhere with a bloody rectum.

232
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,828
Great to have you
back. Actually, I'm...

233
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,526
Actually, he's about to thrust a
tanto into the belly of his career.

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,159
I'm leaving the hospital.

235
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,846
I'm sorry. This is obviously
a terrible time, but...

236
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,668
Why are you leaving?

237
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,799
I just need a change of scenery.

238
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,035
Buy a plant.

239
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,203
Rectal bleeding, two
positive pregnancy tests.

240
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,678
There's nothing we can do...

241
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,147
You could ask House to be a
grownup and respect my decision.

242
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,150
I respect things
that deserve respect.

243
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,652
This decision, on the other
hand, is a dog wearing a cape.

244
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,164
Hallucinations, heart
rate won't respond...

245
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,623
The patient tested
positive for pregnancy

246
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,091
because the patient is pregnant.

247
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,835
Hey, who are you?

248
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,966
This is Dr. House.

249
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,978
He's too brilliant for
introductions. False positive.

250
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,674
You're too busy to be running a
day care center in your abdomen.

251
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,273
False positive.

252
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,682
Not to mention, you should
wait till at least 30 to punish

253
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,813
that pleasure portal with a
seven-pound tissue expander.

254
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,325
I'm 37. And I thought
I wasn't pregnant.

255
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,487
Thirty-seven? Impressive.

256
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,364
Too bad you're not
passing on those genes.

257
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,127
Does that look false to you?

258
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,837
You were looking
in the wrong room.

259
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,939
It's more common when
the egg lands in the oven,

260
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,754
sometimes it winds up
in the fallopian tubes,

261
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,044
in rare cases, it plummets
through the plumbing entirely.

262
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,049
It's using her intestine
as a blood supply.

263
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:41,816
Caused the rectal bleed, and
now Junior Miss Steinem's junior

264
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,882
must be pressing on her vagus
nerve, slowing her heart to a crawl.

265
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,861
Yank the fetus. If she survives
the surgery, she'll be fine.

266
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,770
What if she wants
to keep the baby?

267
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,866
She doesn't.

268
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,878
We can't take two
seconds to discuss this?

269
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,489
I mean, fetuses have
been transplanted before,

270
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,209
whole uteruses, too.

271
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,979
Just terminating the fetus
when it's glued to her intestines

272
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,385
is high-risk surgery,
saving it is a fantasy.

273
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,754
That was at least three seconds.

274
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,453
She's a 37-year old
woman who deserves...

275
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,085
People get what they get,

276
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,323
it has nothing to do
with what they deserve.

277
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,161
And this has nothing
to do with her genitalia

278
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,292
and everything to
do with your genetics.

279
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,597
You told me to get tested.

280
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,813
I didn't know it was gonna color

281
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,837
your every medical opinion,
every personal opinion.

282
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,283
You didn't think a
death sentence would...

283
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:39,143
People die. You,
Amber, everyone.

284
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,810
Don't act like you
just figured that out.

285
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,249
I gave you a diagnosis, you don't
like it, there are exits on every floor.

286
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,131
I'm sorry to be so
definitive about this.

287
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,870
I know you're still absorbing the
news, but we have no choice but to...

288
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,310
Remove the fetus, absolutely.

289
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,440
I have no boyfriend, no husband,

290
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,112
I'm on the road with
Patty all the time.

291
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,386
Where do I sign?

292
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,583
Oh!

293
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,662
Feel any tenderness back here?

294
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,198
No, not at all.

295
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,363
So you're treating
professional sports injuries now?

296
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,563
No, I'm not...

297
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,469
Familiar with the
concept of sarcasm.

298
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,532
Don't sweat it, it's new.
Have you spoken to Wilson?

299
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,304
We'll get you an
EKG. I'll be right back.

300
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,403
You want me to sleep
with him to get him to stay?

301
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,916
I put the bisexual chick on
that, but if you'd like to sit in,

302
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,076
so to speak. I spoke to him.

303
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,151
What did you tell him?

304
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,450
I didn't tell him
anything. I listened.

305
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,013
So you could feel good
about doing nothing.

306
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,888
Tell him... I am
not your errand girl,

307
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,689
the best thing
about leaving you.

308
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,855
The two of you
used to be together?

309
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,627
She dumped me when
I lost the last 85 pounds.

310
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,167
Said there was
less of me to love.

311
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,780
Grief means different
things to different people,

312
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,399
case in point, means
very little to you.

313
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,965
Grief is Newark.

314
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,915
Okay, it's there, you can't avoid
it, but the idea is to hold your nose,

315
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,088
hope the traffic's not too bad

316
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,378
and get on to Manhattan as quickly
as possible, not to buy property.

317
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,042
You think that's
facing up to things?

318
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,261
I'm not the one who's quitting.

319
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,753
'Cause you haven't
lost anything.

320
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,722
But you have.
He'll listen to you.

321
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,589
What did you do when
your husband died?

322
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,628
I got a new job, and I moved.

323
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,090
See how crappy that worked out.

324
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:49,136
Separating the placenta from
the wall of the large intestine.

325
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,911
Sponge. Suction,
we got some bleeding.

326
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,208
BP's dropping, 90 systolic.

327
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,773
And bleeding like hell, clamp.

328
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,318
BP's still dropping.

329
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,047
Amp of calcium chloride, fast.

330
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,247
Still dropping. Shut up.

331
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,687
Squeeze her spleen,

332
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,467
we need to force some
platelets out so her blood clots.

333
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,652
She's in weak shape,

334
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,592
spleen's friable,
it could rupture.

335
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,034
She's stabilizing,
oozing's drying up.

336
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,836
And I hate Visitor's Day.

337
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,870
Removing the fetus.

338
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,181
Bye.

339
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:36,252
You have to stop Wilson from
committing career malpractice.

340
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,382
Talk to him.

341
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,723
Already talked to him
twice, he threw me out.

342
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,628
Mocking him and
insulting him, let's see, yes,

343
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,223
technically, those are
categories of conversation.

344
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,081
Block his references
to other hospitals,

345
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:51,135
tell him he can't hand
off his cases until...

346
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,933
Talk to him.

347
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,485
Deal with his grief, talk to him
about what he's going through.

348
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,238
That's a brilliant idea.
I'll take him out for a beer,

349
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,803
that'll make up for the fact
that Amber's in a pine box,

350
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,315
that there's randomness
and chaos in the universe.

351
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,010
Tell him you're sorry.

352
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,643
I didn't kill her.

353
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,982
You were drunk and...

354
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,991
Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk,
she might never have been born. So...

355
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,959
You called her up in
the middle of the night,

356
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,257
she was on the
bus because of you.

357
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,299
I didn't ask her to come
out, I wasn't driving the bus,

358
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,698
I wasn't driving the
garbage truck that hit the bus,

359
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,362
and I did not prescribe her
the flu meds that killed her.

360
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,566
Yes, I know,
that's all true, but...

361
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,542
You really don't feel
any sense of guilt?

362
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,317
You want to keep him, he
needs to know he's not alone.

363
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,548
Just tell him
you feel like crap.

364
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,016
It'd be meaningless.

365
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:50,052
Well, then find some
meaning. And do something.

366
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,804
She's got a
neurological problem.

367
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,932
Surgical complication?

368
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,567
Don't think so, she
keeps on blinking.

369
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,287
Her heart's not
recovering either.

370
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,671
So the pregnancy
was a coincidence?

371
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,590
Pulse's down to 39, she's
maxed out on atropine.

372
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,412
We're installing
a pacing wire to...

373
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,828
Avoid that. We need
some help in here!

374
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:13,876
Page House.

375
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,819
Already paged
him. Page him again.

376
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,622
It's for you.

377
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,533
If I told you that I was sorry,
would it change anything?

378
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,230
I wouldn't believe you.

379
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,498
If you believed me.

380
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,798
It's hard to imagine
such a world.

381
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,468
I'm going home

382
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,513
until you agree to
stay at this hospital.

383
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:46,113
You can't be... That's
blackmail. And to do your job?

384
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,051
Why not hold a gun
to your own head?

385
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,817
Your conscience bleeds
more freely than my head.

386
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,654
Text. Patient's in
cardiac arrest. Ouchy.

387
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,291
You'd jeopardize a
patient because of my...

388
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,996
If it keeps you here.

389
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,068
Your friendship matters
more to me than this patient.

390
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:14,447
I've gotta do what's right for me.
You gotta do what's right for you.

391
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,642
Yeah. But it comes
easier for me.

392
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,821
Where is he? Where is he?

393
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,301
Status?

394
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,522
Her heart's stabilized,

395
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,516
we have a pacing wire in her, but
the bradycardia's not getting any better.

396
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,676
House was bluffing.

397
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,743
I called him three
times, he's not picking up.

398
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,859
What do you want us to do?

399
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,031
Same thing you'd
do if he was here.

400
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,320
If he was here, we'd be
asking him what to do.

401
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,036
What are the usual
suspects? There aren't any.

402
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,086
She had a vitamin
deficiency and we corrected it,

403
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,687
an ectopic pregnancy,
we removed it.

404
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,357
But her heart
problem won't go away,

405
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,958
and now something's
wrong with her brain.

406
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,833
I have complete
confidence in you guys.

407
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,376
Who wants to go service
House so this patient can live?

408
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,877
We can do this without him.

409
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,422
Maybe something
happened during the surgery,

410
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,390
caused her to... Surgery was
on her bowel, not her brain.

411
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,713
Anxiety, stroke, Tourette's,
could all cause eye-blinking.

412
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,980
And cause her heart to
beat faster, it's slowing down.

413
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,045
MS. If a lesion took out the
sympathetic innervation of her heart,

414
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,988
it'd explain the
bradycardia and the blinking.

415
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,993
But not the vitamin deficiency
or the ectopic pregnancy.

416
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,585
House would want
a unifying theory.

417
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,790
House is gone. And
so are those symptoms.

418
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,698
MS explains everything
that's wrong with her right now.

419
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,236
Start her on interferon for MS.

420
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,535
Mind if I come in?

421
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,602
Not at all. You mind if I leave?

422
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,241
I told you not to take that case
specifically so you could deal with Wilson.

423
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,379
And the two ended up dovetailing
rather nicely, don't you think?

424
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,356
This is how you show your friendship?
By bludgeoning him with guilt?

425
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,223
Because he's my friend, I
know what works on him.

426
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,229
Well, I can't let you
walk away from a patient.

427
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,320
Then fire me.

428
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,809
You're willing to risk your career
but you're not willing to say sorry?

429
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,200
I told him I'm sorry,
he didn't believe it.

430
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,979
Well, make him believe
it. I don't believe it.

431
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,699
You don't want to believe it.

432
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,469
Because if you tell Wilson
how you actually feel about him,

433
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,373
about what happened to Amber,

434
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:28,141
about your part in what happened,
and he walks out the door anyway,

435
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,943
if you make yourself
vulnerable for once

436
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,985
in your nerve-deadening,
emotionally-obliterating...

437
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,681
You're doing the same thing
he is, you're running away.

438
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,021
Only he's not killing
anyone in the process.

439
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,799
Where's Dr. House?

440
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,232
He's not feeling well.

441
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,963
Was MS his idea?

442
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,562
We work as a team.
You know how it is,

443
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,575
collaborative, sometimes it's hard
to tell where an idea comes from.

444
00:22:56,642 --> 00:23:01,171
But you're not really a
team. You work for him.

445
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,810
And you work for Patty.

446
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,286
I'm sure a lot of her
ideas are actually...

447
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,687
She would be fine without me.

448
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,492
I'd be nothing without her.

449
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,156
Maybe if you just had the chance.
I'm sure you've learned a lot.

450
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,358
Not everybody's created equal.

451
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,837
Does Dr. House think I have MS?

452
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,232
Yes.

453
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,472
Did you just shiver?

454
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,780
You're running a slight fever.

455
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,047
Is that bad?

456
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,047
It means we were
wrong about the MS.

457
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,995
You had my cable disconnected.

458
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,530
Well, that's quite a leap.

459
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,009
Just because I happen to have a
31-person maintenance department,

460
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,298
each of whom you've
personally abused at some point...

461
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,802
Why?

462
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,547
'Cause you think I'm okay
with letting someone die,

463
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,006
but I'm gonna fold if I can't
watch celebrity bowling?

464
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,906
That is not an
unreasonable theory,

465
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,003
especially with only 10
minutes till your favorite soap.

466
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,379
Gee, is this the remote
from the doctors' lounge?

467
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,251
This is your 911? Goodbye.

468
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,347
Stop.

469
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,637
I'm withholding your salary history
from every hospital in the Tri-State Area.

470
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,061
You go, girl.

471
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,191
And I'm permanently setting every TV
in this building to the Pottery Channel

472
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,031
unless you both sit down.

473
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,071
Welcome to couples counseling.

474
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,043
It's not the
surgery. Timing fits.

475
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,088
The location doesn't, unless
her brain's in her bowels.

476
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,356
If bacteria entered
her bloodstream,

477
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,315
it could have caused
an infection in her brain.

478
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,460
The surgery went fine.
You were there, you saw...

479
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,429
Peptostreptococcus could
explain the blinking and...

480
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,719
No. You want to watch a grainy
video and have an epiphany.

481
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,725
Shut up, you're making
me miss House's mocking.

482
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,330
I know you told us it
was none of our business,

483
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,408
but if House thinks that your Huntington's
is affecting you, maybe it really...

484
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,543
It's not, because
I don't have...

485
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,127
You're desperate to
do this without him.

486
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,280
You're not trying to cure
her, you're trying to prove...

487
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,738
Stop the tape.

488
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,372
Zoom in.

489
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,638
On the anastomosis,
that little bump.

490
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,478
It's a hematoma, a
harmless pocket of blood,

491
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,643
which is why Chase
ignored it during the surgery.

492
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,246
Could be a ganglioma, which is
why Chase shouldn't have ignored it.

493
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,154
If it's an abnormal
growth of nerves,

494
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,784
it could be causing all
the patient's symptoms.

495
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,657
We have to open her
up again, get a piece of it.

496
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,560
So what do you want to tell us?

497
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,900
Nothing.

498
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:43,033
Nothing I say is gonna change
anything. You guys need to talk.

499
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,509
Actually, you should read
the latest psych literature,

500
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,512
repression's
gaining a lot of fans.

501
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,241
What you don't
face can't crush you.

502
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,646
Talk to each other.

503
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,214
How you doing? Good?

504
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,584
Fine. Thanks.

505
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:58,916
Sit.

506
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,093
See, the two of you are
friends, look how you both...

507
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,687
Think you're an idiot.

508
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,392
We both also eat with forks,
that doesn't really prove...

509
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:11,267
Talk to him. Tell him how
you feel about what he's doing.

510
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,497
I told him he's an idiot.

511
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,040
Tell him what you
think about him leaving.

512
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,042
- I think he's an idiot.
- You're an idiot.

513
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,136
He's in pain, and your response
is just to emotionally blackmail him.

514
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,113
You told me what your
position is on that one.

515
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,308
You're against it, right?

516
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,875
She hasn't told you in front of me.
She needs to prove she's on my side.

517
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,352
Go to hell.

518
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,786
So much for that theory.

519
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,551
I'm sorry you lost Amber.

520
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,615
I cannot imagine what it
is you're going through,

521
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,251
but it will not get better

522
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,354
by you walking away from
everyone that cares about you.

523
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,896
Do you think Amber would
want you to walk away?

524
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,801
Nobody at this hospital
even liked Amber.

525
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,346
Same time next week?

526
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,283
You want me to do a second
major surgery on a patient

527
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,325
we almost lost during
a first major surgery

528
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,826
to see if she needs
a third major surgery?

529
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,419
We need a piece
of the ganglioma.

530
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,692
Then you're talking
about another patient,

531
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,392
yours doesn't have a ganglioma.

532
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,401
And if there is one
and you missed it?

533
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,438
Then you're talking about another
surgeon, I didn't miss anything.

534
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,305
But we're not talking
about another videotape,

535
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,241
this one showed a bump,
we need to biopsy it.

536
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,746
A bump? Oh, yeah, my
grandfather died of a bump.

537
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:33,543
She can't survive a second round of
general anesthesia, let alone a third.

538
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,850
You'd do this for House.

539
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:36,945
Yeah.

540
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,115
Then what do you suggest?

541
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,625
Because the patient's got a
high fever, a low heart rate,

542
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,787
and a dim chance of survival
if we stand here like idiots.

543
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,855
Then I suggest you don't
stand there like idiots.

544
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,563
How do you get coal out of a mountain
when it's someone else's mountain?

545
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,850
If we don't have House, doesn't
mean we can't think like House.

546
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,343
But it does mean we
don't have to talk like him.

547
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,777
You don't dig down.
You go in from the side.

548
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,390
We insert a lighted
scope through the rectum,

549
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,383
move the intestine till
we find the ganglioma,

550
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,908
then push it to the surface.
Where we see the light, we cut.

551
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,517
We'll make as small
an incision as we can,

552
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,290
but unfortunately
it'll be very painful.

553
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,831
After your surgery experience,
we can't give you anesthesia...

554
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,526
Can I talk to Dr. House?

555
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,661
No.

556
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,295
We can do this, we
know what we're doing.

557
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,634
I don't mean to be insulting,

558
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,507
but my former boss didn't insist on
me coming here because of you or...

559
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,943
Your former boss?

560
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,809
I've been replaced.

561
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,750
I'm sorry. I mean,
you must be... I'm fine.

562
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,047
She has a big Beijing trip,

563
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,215
ton of work to do, she can't
just wait for me to get better.

564
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,560
We've been well trained,
we'll take good care of you.

565
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,797
How can you let her
treat you like a footstool?

566
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,400
The world needs flunkies.

567
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,773
Don't say that,
you're better than that.

568
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,312
I have no problem
with it. Why do you?

569
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,479
Because life is short.

570
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,882
I mean, yours could've
ended in that surgery.

571
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:17,150
You'd have never lived for
yourself. What kind of feminist...

572
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,589
We can have
anything. No, we can't.

573
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:26,922
We can aspire to anything. But we
don't get it just because we want it.

574
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,725
I would rather spend
my life close to the birds

575
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,362
than waste it
wishing I had wings.

576
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,474
You're through the sigmoid,
into the descending colon.

577
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,179
Switching on the light.

578
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,313
Advance toward the anastomosis.

579
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,225
That's it.

580
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,785
Push the wall of the
intestine toward the skin.

581
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,663
There, I see it.

582
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:06,999
Don't look down.

583
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,802
Scalpel.

584
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,850
So your last day is Friday?

585
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,455
I'm gonna miss you.

586
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,060
You shouldn't go.

587
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,675
Did House ask you to talk to me?
Or are you trying to save the patient,

588
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,842
because there'll
always be another...

589
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,890
House asked me.

590
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,493
And you're doing it? I
told him to go to hell.

591
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,367
Thanks.

592
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,141
But I think he's right.

593
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:52,977
You think you're making a rational
choice. You think the worst is over,

594
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:58,422
and then six months later,
you look back and you realize

595
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,152
you didn't know
what you were doing.

596
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,194
Are you saying the
pain doesn't go away?

597
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,455
It gets easier.

598
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,021
Not in two months.
Not in two years.

599
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:11,002
But, no, it never
really goes away.

600
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:15,302
Being here, in this building...

601
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,652
I was just in the lounge, I
kept staring at Amber's locker.

602
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,907
I saw a guy wearing
a scarf this morning.

603
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,345
The color reminded
me of his eyes.

604
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,080
We lived 500 miles from here.

605
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,153
I have to do something.

606
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,347
Then do it.

607
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:37,559
But don't think it's the right
choice, because there isn't one.

608
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,597
It's not a ganglioma, the
problem wasn't the surgery.

609
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,137
Abnormally deposited
proteins. It's amyloidosis.

610
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,284
It would explain the blinking
and the low heart rate.

611
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,952
The only way to treat amyloidosis
is to treat whatever's causing it.

612
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,708
It's not as if a lot of things cause
amyloid, rheumatoid arthritis.

613
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,248
Familial Mediterranean fever.

614
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,314
Lymphoma.

615
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,611
Well, we can't all be right.

616
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,551
But you can all be wrong.
Patient's joints don't hurt,

617
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,264
abdominal pain went
away when the fetus did,

618
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,654
and no palpable lymph nodes.

619
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,486
Got anything
constructive to say?

620
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,787
Sorry. Sorry.

621
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,605
She has lots and lots
of palpable lymph nodes,

622
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,224
joint and abdominal pain,
she'll be better by dinner time.

623
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,267
If we don't find the
cause of the amyloidosis,

624
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,701
we never get her off that wire,
she never walks out of this hospital.

625
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:24,608
But, hey, who needs House? So
glad we lost those training wheels.

626
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,446
You want me to make the call?

627
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,610
There seems to be
some disagreement.

628
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,883
And this isn't just a pretext
to pressure me into staying?

629
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,220
Does it look like a pretext?

630
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,418
No.

631
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,025
She really is dying, isn't she?

632
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:50,431
Inflammation, enlarged nuclei, some
mitotic activity. It could be lymphoma.

633
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,027
There are no
palpable lymph nodes.

634
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,629
Makes it less likely,
but doesn't rule it out.

635
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,406
I'm an oncologist, I see cancer.

636
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,639
Show it to an immunologist,
they'll see autoimmune.

637
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,648
I already showed it
to an immunologist.

638
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,445
We'll start her on chemo.

639
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,481
You should leave.

640
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,119
House doesn't want
to lose his sidekick.

641
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,489
Cuddy doesn't want to
lose her check on House.

642
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,290
No one's talking
about what you want.

643
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,092
It's not that I want to.

644
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,894
Want to, need to.

645
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,807
If there's any chance
that being away from here

646
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:27,738
will make your life even
a little bit easier, do it.

647
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,903
That's what everyone
else here would do.

648
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,357
Don't expect anything
to change too fast.

649
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,194
Lymphoma was your idea?

650
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,491
Why?

651
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,797
I feel better.

652
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,865
Sometimes just knowing
you're being treated helps.

653
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,381
You've given me 18
different treatments, this

654
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:05,707
is the first one that
made me feel better.

655
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,643
I don't think it's
psychological.

656
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,442
Thank you.

657
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,985
I'm sorry.

658
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,779
I shouldn't have
gotten angry at you.

659
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,256
Your choices are your choices.

660
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,017
You're not like me.

661
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,297
Maybe you have wings.

662
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,634
I have Huntington's Chorea.

663
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:43,809
Dozen years or so, my nervous
system, my cognitive skills,

664
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:47,580
even my emotional
balance, they'll all start to fray.

665
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:53,216
I won't be able to fly, I
won't be able to walk,

666
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,855
I won't be able to breathe.

667
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,327
And you want to make
sure your life matters?

668
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:09,233
I don't want to just be tightening
bolts and following instructions.

669
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:15,269
I want something to be
different because of me.

670
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,877
I am.

671
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,686
Not just 'cause
you saved my life.

672
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,490
I'm applying for a job at a foundation.
Running the finance division.

673
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,625
I mean, I don't know
if I'm gonna get it,

674
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:38,432
but if I don't, there
are other foundations.

675
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,345
It's almost 4:00. Soap time.

676
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,850
Nurses' remote, works
in the doctors' lounge.

677
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,080
Why do you think
Wilson's leaving?

678
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,786
How many times do I
have to use the word "idiot"?

679
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,590
And that's a good
enough answer for you?

680
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,339
Whenever anyone does
anything out of the norm,

681
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:09,425
you have to tell them what screwed-up
process is really at work in their head.

682
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,493
That's why I locked
the two of you in a room,

683
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,129
so you would say something
stupid and insensitive

684
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,231
and maybe with
a little bit of truth.

685
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,567
But you didn't.

686
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,942
So I can only assume that you
don't want to know the reason.

687
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,778
You're afraid to know.

688
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,718
You're not listening
to me, are you?

689
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,418
Try it sometime, you'll see why.

690
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,964
You look 37.

691
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,867
I am 37.

692
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,697
You looked 27 last week.

693
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,470
Unless I blacked out
for 10 years, your skin...

694
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,808
She has got lymphoma,
chemo's probably...

695
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,870
Stop the chemo.
She's getting better.

696
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,258
Bradycardia's
improving, we didn't...

697
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,511
She have bruising?

698
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,451
She was pounding her
legs during the hallucinations.

699
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,351
It's not lymphoma.

700
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,724
Hey, don't... No, no, no.

701
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,492
My bad. Thought
"no" meant "yes".

702
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,600
Those aren't bruises,
they're mycobacterial lesions.

703
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,571
She has diffuse
lepromatous leprosy,

704
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:24,131
must've caught it on one of
her overseas estrogen tours.

705
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,509
Chemo wipes out some of the
bacteria, she feels a little better,

706
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,208
wipes out most of her immune
system, she gets a whole lot worse.

707
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,979
Leprosy? Like where
my limbs fall off?

708
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,648
Actually, this is the flattering one.
It's also known as "pretty leprosy".

709
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,056
Doesn't disfigure, makes your
skin look younger, smoother.

710
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:44,221
Don't let the girls hear,
they'll all want to lick your face.

711
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,924
Unless you're that
kind of feminist.

712
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,063
Blast her with antibiotics
and prednisone, she'll be fine.

713
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,629
Damn, it's after 4:00. I'm late.

714
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,077
Damn. What?

715
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,508
She's happy you're
gonna be fine,

716
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,913
but she'd be happier if you were
gonna be fine five minutes ago.

717
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,093
Test confirmed
Dr. House's diagnosis.

718
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,561
Thank God.

719
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,457
When you got pregnant,

720
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,765
the physical stress triggered
e-nodosum leprosum,

721
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,271
a common
complication of leprosy.

722
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,934
Inflamed the nerves to your heart,
made it hard to absorb vitamins,

723
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:34,309
scarred your fallopian
tubes. It explains everything.

724
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,542
Better prescribe me
some skin cream, too, huh?

725
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,813
You might want it for
those job interviews.

726
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,816
I'm going back on the road with
Patty. My replacement flamed out.

727
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,890
She says I can manage some projects
on my own, carve out more of a role.

728
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,901
Do you really think
she can change?

729
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,459
I don't know.

730
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,101
The truth is I'm not sure I...

731
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,437
You can change.

732
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,738
No.

733
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,609
I'm not sure I
want her to change.

734
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,548
If she's reasonable, if
she's just another employer,

735
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:19,057
then I'm just another employee.

736
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,652
In a weird way, I matter.

737
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,228
I like you better
now that you're dying.

738
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,740
I was wrong.

739
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,139
You took a shot.

740
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:44,073
She's going back to work
for that idiot. It's pathetic.

741
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,682
You thought something
would change?

742
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:51,655
She almost died because
of that job. Yeah, I thought...

743
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,190
Almost dying changes nothing.

744
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,992
Dying changes everything.

745
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,828
I'm sorry. I know I
didn't try to kill her,

746
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:39,269
I know I didn't want her hurt,
I know it was a freak accident,

747
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,065
but I feel like crap, and
she's dead because of me.

748
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,341
I don't blame you.

749
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,342
I wanted to. I tried to.

750
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:56,252
I must've reviewed Amber's case
file a hundred times to find a way...

751
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,786
But it wasn't your fault.

752
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,191
Then we're okay?

753
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:12,136
I mean, I know you're
not, but maybe I can help.

754
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,694
We're not okay.

755
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,705
Amber was never the
reason I was leaving.

756
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,711
I didn't want to
tell you because...

757
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:29,220
Because I was trying, like
I always do, to protect you,

758
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,322
which is the problem.

759
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:38,257
You spread misery because
you can't feel anything else.

760
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,266
You manipulate people because you
can't handle any kind of real relationship.

761
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:47,670
And I've enabled it for
years, the games, the binges,

762
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,004
the middle-of-the-night
phone calls.

763
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,046
I should have been
the one on the bus, not...

764
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,878
You should have
been alone on the bus.

765
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,085
If I've learned anything from Amber,
it's that I have to take care of myself.

766
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,029
We're not friends
anymore, House.

767
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,793
I'm not sure we ever were.
