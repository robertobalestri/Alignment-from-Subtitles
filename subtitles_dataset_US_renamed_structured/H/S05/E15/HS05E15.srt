1
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,630
That's okay, Eileen. I got this.

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,731
You sure?

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:08,832
Yeah, you get home.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,400
Thanks, Danny. See
you in the morning.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,945
I'll be here.

6
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,133
Food's gone,
Daryl. We're closed.

7
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,968
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra coat in there, would you?

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,635
You're wearing a coat. A
winter coat, man. It's cold.

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,109
Come on.

10
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,012
Here.

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,855
Rangers? You expect
me to wear this in Jersey?

12
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,194
Come on, man, where's
your sense of humor?

13
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,493
Good night, Daryl.

14
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,302
Go away.

15
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,730
That's not funny, freak.

16
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,761
No one is laughing, Daniel.

17
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,647
You doing anything Friday?

18
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,552
I'm taking a lovely young
lady to the Philharmonic.

19
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,666
Is that your way of saying
you're having sex with a hooker?

20
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,751
Two. Can't create a
harmonic with just one.

21
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,660
Well, I was hoping you might be
available for Rachel's Simchat Bat.

22
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,729
It's a...

23
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,129
Jewish baby naming ceremony.

24
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,691
A time-honored tradition, dating
all the way back to the 1960s.

25
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,065
My house at 7:00.

26
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,665
It'll just be the rabbi and a
few friends and some family.

27
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,573
Nothing like welcoming
a baby into the world

28
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,010
with a completely naked
display of hypocrisy.

29
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,638
There'll be plenty of wine

30
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,411
and nice people
you can quietly mock.

31
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,610
Wish I could,

32
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,415
but I already put down a
deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O.

33
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,648
House.

34
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,652
It's one evening. I'd
like you to be there.

35
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,563
Religious hokum against sponge
bath. Can I get back to you?

36
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,608
Can I help you?

37
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,169
Just browsing, thanks.

38
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,740
Happy to be
underachieving again?

39
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,717
Running the ER
is slacker heaven.

40
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,943
Looking for anything
in particular?

41
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,716
Not anymore.

42
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,382
Where's this guy? Why?

43
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,894
'Cause he's my next patient. It'd be
rude of me not to introduce myself.

44
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,726
He's a drunk priest
who hallucinated Jesus.

45
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,541
Afraid you might have
missed something?

46
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,976
Afraid you're wasting
everyone's time?

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,526
It's obviously either
alcohol or exhaustion.

48
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,528
So, you admit you
have no idea which?

49
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,537
I admit that I'm too busy to
care who you're screwing with.

50
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,138
Don't thank me.

51
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,274
Just knowing I can be of
assistance is thanks enough.

52
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,886
You went out of your way
to pick him? This is nothing.

53
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,188
There are no small cases...

54
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,320
Any guesses where
this joke is going?

55
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,959
Could be psychomotor epilepsy.

56
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,329
Could be alcohol.

57
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,444
Shouldn't we let the ER
rule the obvious out before...

58
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,960
Could be atropine
toxicity, occipital lobe tumor.

59
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,015
You know something about
this case you're not telling us?

60
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,117
Why would you think that?
'Cause you wanna screw with us.

61
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,872
Or screw with a
hallucinating priest.

62
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,504
Both are possible. There's
only one way to find out.

63
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,414
Run an EEG for epilepsy,
CT his brain for tumors.

64
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,645
And go check his
house of God for toxins.

65
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,555
Fourteen, hold up.

66
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,154
This department is broken,

67
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,197
and I'm not going to take
a real case until it's fixed.

68
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,631
Job or relationship,
your choice.

69
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,494
What?

70
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,869
To put it in terms you
might better understand,

71
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,499
if you don't split,
you must quit.

72
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,908
The drug trial is
over. I'm out, she's out.

73
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,001
Don't care.

74
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,444
We're adults, we
can handle this.

75
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,623
You just have to
give us a chance.

76
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,617
No, you're not, no, you
can't, and, no, I don't.

77
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,077
Mull it over. You got till the
end of this fake case to decide.

78
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,852
I wasn't drunk.

79
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,727
I had one or two drinks.

80
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,028
People often underestimate
alcohol's effect on their...

81
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,762
I was on my way to six. I
know how alcohol affects me.

82
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,360
This wasn't the alcohol.

83
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,532
You lived in Manhattan for
three years, then a year in Oregon,

84
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,634
18 months in New Mexico,
less than a year in Wisconsin,

85
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,509
and now you've been living in
Trenton for the last six months.

86
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,808
Yeah.

87
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,450
The more we know about you,
the more likely it is we can help you.

88
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,453
Mmm. It's not
medically relevant, so...

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,456
No way to know, unless
you went to medical school.

90
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,929
Four years ago, a teen in
a youth group at my church

91
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,297
accused me of
inappropriate contact.

92
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,529
I was innocent, but the
church decided to transfer me,

93
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,094
said it would be
easier for all involved.

94
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,630
When the parishioners at the new church
got wind of why I'd been transferred,

95
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,940
they were unhappy.

96
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,641
I was sent off again and again.

97
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,513
And how is any of
that medically relevant?

98
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,319
So, the kid lied?

99
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,812
He was confused.

100
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,688
Confused whether you
molested him or not?

101
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,695
Okay, you wanted to know why I
moved around so much, and I told you.

102
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,697
How about telling me
why I was hallucinating?

103
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,199
Syphilis could explain
the hallucination.

104
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,167
I'm not sexually active.

105
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,880
You don't have to admit
you did anything with the kid.

106
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,270
You weren't always a priest.

107
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,932
I wanted to be since I was 12.

108
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,533
I entered the seminary
when I was 17.

109
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,374
Maybe it wasn't a hallucination.

110
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,879
Maybe it really was Jesus.

111
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm not insane.

112
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,844
Seeing Jesus makes you insane?

113
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,112
Bit of an odd attitude
coming from a priest.

114
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,917
Well, it's just a job now. The
fairytale ended a long time ago.

115
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,486
You're a wuss,
part wimp, part puss.

116
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,030
I have no choice. I'm
part of the ceremony.

117
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,396
I thought you were
already circumcised.

118
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,867
It's one night for a friend.

119
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,235
What about the friend who has two
tickets to see Brubeck at the Blue Note?

120
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,773
I thought you had
an orgy planned.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,899
I lied.

122
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,485
Are you lying about
the Brubeck tickets?

123
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,172
Yes, but only to save
you from yourself.

124
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,409
I'll be fine, and so will
Cuddy, if you don't show up.

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,644
I'm surprised she
even invited you.

126
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,617
It is oddly flattering.

127
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,956
God, I'm so sick
of his stupid stunts.

128
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,550
Everybody has to put up
with their boss' stupid stunts.

129
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,494
No, they don't. There's HR,
there's Cuddy, there's other jobs.

130
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:20,398
House doesn't listen to HR, Cuddy'll
let him fire us before she fires him,

131
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,436
and I don't want another job.

132
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,733
Why do you cling to him?
Why do you defend him?

133
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,316
Just because I don't want to be
unemployed doesn't mean I'm co-dependent.

134
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,208
I'm not saying you're co-dependent,
I'm saying you're scared.

135
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,911
You know what? You're right.

136
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,954
So, you wanna quit?

137
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,754
No, I wanna stop a stupid stunt.

138
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,693
House doesn't want either
one of us to quit. He wants this.

139
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,597
He's got two lab rats in a maze
and thrown in one piece of cheese.

140
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,499
So, what do we do?

141
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,834
Nothing.

142
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,867
Cool.

143
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,122
It's cool he's a child molester?

144
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,445
It's cool that a priest
doesn't believe in God.

145
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,984
It's cool that God did to
him what he did to the kid.

146
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,383
Allegedly.

147
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,476
You think he's innocent?

148
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,816
He had honest eyes?

149
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,949
And you think he's guilty, which
explains why you're dying to discharge him.

150
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,702
I'm dying to discharge
him because he's not sick,

151
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,558
not because he's a
pedophile. Allegedly.

152
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,529
You actually believe
the kid got confused?

153
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,691
If everybody lies, that
includes teenage boys.

154
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,928
Aren't we lucky to have
such an interesting patient?

155
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,868
Had. There's nothing
wrong with him.

156
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,497
World's most boring case
just became a page turner,

157
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,213
and you want to tear
out the last chapter?

158
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,574
You want to examine his
character, go to his soup kitchen.

159
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,478
We're done testing him
for things he doesn't have.

160
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,806
Bad news for
Foreman and Thirteen.

161
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,310
Case is over.

162
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,820
We're not splitting up.

163
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,232
So, which one of
you is taking a hike?

164
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,418
And neither of us is quitting.

165
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,326
Interesting.

166
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,260
You were fine with Chase
and Cameron dating.

167
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,849
You obviously don't
actually have an...

168
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,263
You're fired.

169
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,269
How long you gonna keep this up?

170
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,101
We know you're
not... Wrong. Again.

171
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,105
In fact, in the last few weeks,

172
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,370
it's hard to remember
a correct call you made.

173
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,022
If Chase had compromised his
professional judgment to help Cameron,

174
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,810
I would have fired his ass, too.

175
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,213
When my mistake blew up,

176
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,150
you did everything to keep me
from contacting the drug company.

177
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,518
To save your
license, not your job,

178
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,284
and definitely not
your relationship.

179
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,189
So, badge.

180
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,556
Fine.

181
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,309
Why don't you see if you
can find us a real case?

182
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,066
How can you discharge me when
you have no idea what's wrong?

183
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,583
We know what's wrong, and
now that you've slept it off...

184
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,390
It's not just the hallucination.

185
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:06,092
I feel nauseous, my foot feels
numb, like it's fallen asleep.

186
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,464
You didn't mention that before.

187
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,900
I didn't notice it before.

188
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,402
Are you hiding from someone?

189
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,914
Why are you so
intent on staying here?

190
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,272
I don't feel well. I know there's
something wrong with me.

191
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,900
Which foot?

192
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,239
My left.

193
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,079
Oh, God.

194
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,592
What the hell is
that? What is that?

195
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,962
Your toe just fell off.

196
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,528
Must be my lucky day.

197
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,096
New symptom means the old
symptom was a real symptom,

198
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,972
and I get to keep our
pederast priest after all.

199
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,807
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?

200
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,039
They left.

201
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,445
Leprosy could cause
necrosis and hallucinations.

202
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,608
Why would they leave?

203
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,243
Because Foreman
doesn't work here any more,

204
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,619
and Thirteen is
mad that I fired him.

205
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,614
Don't worry, she'll be back.

206
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,786
She'll be pissed off,
she'll want to take a stand,

207
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,672
and then Foreman will
convince her there's no reason

208
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,562
both of them should
be out of a job.

209
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,758
Leprosy's a bad fit.

210
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,891
Why'd you fire Foreman?

211
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,368
I gave him a
choice, split or quit.

212
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,235
He chose neither.
How about ergotism?

213
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,796
He's giving up
his career for her?

214
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,001
He's giving up
this career for her.

215
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,513
No, normal white blood count.
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

216
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,603
They're good doctors.

217
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,672
Separately, they're
great doctors.

218
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,277
Better than you.
Together they're morons.

219
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,365
Go, check out the house that they would
have checked had this been a real case.

220
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,483
And page Thirteen, tell
her to run the blood for CO,

221
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,051
and get the priest in a hyperbaric
chamber before anything else falls off.

222
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,459
So, what are we gonna do now?

223
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,527
I get a letter of recommendation
from Cuddy and find a new job.

224
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,766
Oh, that's it? You're
just gonna give up?

225
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,072
House was right. Our
relationship did affect my judgment.

226
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,680
Then I should quit. It'll be
easier for me to find another job.

227
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,984
Not like this one.

228
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,853
We should both quit.

229
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,514
What's that gonna accomplish?

230
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,861
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

231
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,798
We'll be fine.

232
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,144
Go ahead.

233
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,303
I'll see you tonight?

234
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,575
I'll be home early.

235
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,034
You really think House
is done with Foreman?

236
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,269
If you ask me, Foreman
should be done with Thirteen.

237
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,727
He's not gonna get a better job,

238
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,663
which means he'll end up
resenting her for losing this one,

239
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,131
which she'll end up resenting.

240
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,168
Or the hardship will
bring them closer together,

241
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,999
she'll invite friends over
for Foreman to share.

242
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,464
No leaks from the heater.

243
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,702
She's not a nympho,
she's bisexual,

244
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,687
which, by the way, means
she's accustomed to partners

245
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,805
who don't need a map
to find the treasure.

246
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,974
CO poisoning might have
come from these cigarettes.

247
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,143
Not unless he was
smoking them in a bell jar.

248
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,629
And even if you know
where the treasure is,

249
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,054
it can still be pretty hard
to dig it up without a shovel.

250
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,784
You can buy a shovel.

251
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,631
Let's see, how do I keep House

252
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,538
from ruining my precious
display of religious hypocrisy?

253
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,008
I know, I'll pressure
him to attend,

254
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,688
knowing that he'll never agree to
anything I actually want him to do.

255
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,341
I didn't pressure
you, I invited you.

256
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,078
And there's nothing hypocritical
about recognizing your heritage.

257
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,744
So, you keeping kosher now?

258
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,515
Wearing four-cornered garments?

259
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,422
Slaughtering heifers
to the god Ra?

260
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,687
Wait, is that one
of your people?

261
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,854
Do it all, do
nothing or option C,

262
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,920
you're a liar and a hypocrite.

263
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:02,367
House, for better or for
worse, you are a part of my life.

264
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,769
It isn't a ploy, it's
a sincere invitation.

265
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,704
I honestly want you to come.

266
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,374
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

267
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,446
I'm glad.

268
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,481
You idiot. I was free and clear.

269
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,787
Now he's coming,
and it's your fault.

270
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,588
Since when have
your failed attempts

271
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,289
at communication through
lies become my fault?

272
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,663
Since you forgot how
to keep your mouth shut.

273
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,464
You messed it up, and
now you're gonna fix it.

274
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,767
And you're gonna
keep my name out of it.

275
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,934
- How is he?
- Stable.

276
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,672
Necrosis doesn't
look to be spreading.

277
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,271
I was talking about Foreman.
Is he really gonna leave?

278
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,441
That's usually what people
do when they get fired.

279
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,593
Why are you biting my head off?

280
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,257
I was just wondering
what he was gonna do.

281
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,997
You're right, I'm
sorry. It's not your fault.

282
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,489
It's not House's fault, either.

283
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,966
He gave you guys a
chance, you blew it.

284
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,002
He didn't give us a chance,
he gave us an ultimatum.

285
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,155
I would have thought five years
here would buy a mistake or two.

286
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,192
Help me!

287
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:09,727
Help me.

288
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,535
I can't breathe. Feels like
someone's sitting on my chest.

289
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,634
Looks like a heart attack.

290
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,049
I assume you've heard.

291
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,655
I can't override him.

292
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,659
I'm not asking
you to override him.

293
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,718
I'm asking for a letter
of recommendation.

294
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,694
Eric, the reality here is,
House should have fired you.

295
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,736
You falsified medical records,

296
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,170
put this hospital's
reputation in jeopardy.

297
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,265
You're lucky you
still have a license.

298
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,577
I can't get a decent position at another
hospital without a recommendation.

299
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,907
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,989
Chest pain wasn't angina.
EKG ruled out heart attack.

301
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,995
So, the good news is, he
didn't have a heart attack.

302
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,940
The bad news is, I
apparently fired the only guy

303
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,729
who actually knows what
a heart attack looks like.

304
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,632
So, the man of God who
doesn't believe in God

305
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,967
had a heart attack
that isn't a heart attack.

306
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,633
Do I know how to pick
awesome cases or what?

307
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,175
Could be a clotting disorder.

308
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,053
Three different symptoms,
three different clots?

309
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,310
I know. How cool is
that? You two do an angio.

310
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,480
You don't want to work, so why
don't you just go get me a lottery ticket?

311
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,524
The sicker he gets,
the luckier I feel.

312
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,183
Where are you going?

313
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,420
I've been wanting
to introduce myself.

314
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,797
You really a virgin?

315
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,049
You have to treat me, you
don't have to believe me.

316
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,668
And before we treat you,
we have to diagnose you.

317
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,187
Not knowing whether we can
believe you is making that difficult.

318
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,736
Everything I've
told you is true.

319
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,944
You lost your faith because
a teenager got confused.

320
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,350
And my church abandoned
me, and my God forsook me,

321
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,083
and I couldn't come up with a
reason why a god would do that.

322
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,557
God gave the church
and the kid free will.

323
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,992
Their exercise of
that free will hurt you.

324
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,088
Means you're just a victim
of God's gift to mankind.

325
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,190
Oh, yeah. God wants
life to have meaning.

326
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,132
Life's meaningless
without free will.

327
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,729
With free will, there's always
suffering. So God wants suffering.

328
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,572
I got tired of that argument
before I even finished saying it.

329
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:34,512
And even if I bought that, what the
hell is God doing? Just the big stuff?

330
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,811
The acts of God, the
hurricanes, the earthquakes,

331
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,477
the random killings of
millions of innocent people?

332
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,111
Then we better damn pray.

333
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,216
God, I wish you
weren't a pedophile.

334
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:50,760
Lungs are clean. No embolism,
no pleurisy, no pneumonia.

335
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,560
I'm sorry, this
is going to hurt.

336
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,860
No, it's fine.

337
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,266
No pain at all?

338
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,770
No, why?

339
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,272
Because there should be.

340
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,433
You feel that?

341
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,568
No.

342
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,080
Regional anesthesia's
a new symptom.

343
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,274
Unless the chest pain is
related to the numbness.

344
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,249
It's not circulatory,
it's neurological.

345
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,910
Run a nerve conduction study.

346
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,977
And be careful. If you kill him,

347
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,818
he'll be dancing
with the Dark One.

348
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,086
Why the hell are you going
to Cuddy's baby naming?

349
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,188
It's a religious
ceremony, it's boring.

350
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,109
Why waste a good evening
that could be much better spent

351
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,001
in a drunken stupor,
feeling sorry for yourself?

352
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,093
Okay.

353
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,832
Okay? Okay, you won't go?

354
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,806
Okay, your obligation
to Cuddy is fulfilled.

355
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,101
Why are you doing this?

356
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,576
Why did Hillary conquer Everest?

357
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,204
You always have a reason. It's
usually a bad one, but a reason.

358
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,407
She's being childish.

359
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,576
See, that's an example from
the bad category. Is it resentment?

360
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,063
The stork brought home a new baby
and you don't want to share Mommy,

361
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,682
or you just can't stand
to see others happy?

362
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,023
She's trying to play me. If I let
her succeed, the terrorists win.

363
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,498
I heard there might be
an opening in the ER.

364
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,436
Foreman's a neurologist,
that's not where he...

365
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,565
I did an ER rotation in Miami.

366
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,271
If I can find another position, I
figure House will rehire Foreman.

367
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,573
Don't quit.

368
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,357
Cuddy wouldn't give
Foreman a recommendation.

369
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,145
He's not gonna be
able to find a decent job.

370
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,460
Foreman shouldn't leave, either.

371
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,215
You think they should split up?

372
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,586
Office romances are a bad idea.

373
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,053
We beat some very long odds.

374
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,561
Wow, honey, save the
gushy stuff for the wedding.

375
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,721
House is playing with you.

376
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,841
If you let him get away with it,
he won't respect you anyway.

377
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,265
Or House is helping you.

378
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,824
He knows it probably
won't work out,

379
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,962
and he's actually
doing you a favor.

380
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,507
Yeah, that sounds a
lot more like House.

381
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,669
I know they're looking for
someone at Mercy. I'll make a call.

382
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,179
Is your boss always like that?

383
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,341
Usually worse.

384
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,476
Finding a fellow atheist
always makes his day.

385
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,020
You think it's possible
maybe God's testing your faith?

386
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,819
No, I already failed. There'd be no
point in what he's doing to me now.

387
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,588
Got something. Looks
like intercostal neuralgia.

388
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,026
What's that?

389
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,156
Something's traumatizing one of
the nerves that runs along your ribs.

390
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,064
Explains the chest
pain and numbness.

391
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,693
Could also cause muscle atrophy.

392
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,680
Does it do anything to the
eyes? Why? What's wrong?

393
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,468
You're seeing Jesus again?

394
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,804
I'm seeing nothing.
My right eye went blind.

395
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,326
Ophthalmological exam's normal.

396
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,910
Nothing structurally
wrong with the eye.

397
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,115
His heart rate's down, sensory
loss is becoming more diffuse,

398
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,066
progressive muscle
weakness. He's shutting down.

399
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,855
It's got to be something
systemic, like autoimmune.

400
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,527
CSF was clear for
Guillain-Barré. Cancer?

401
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,569
Imaging studies have
been clear for tumors.

402
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,104
Then that leaves infection.

403
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,764
He'd be brimming
with white blood cells.

404
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,106
Or we're at the backstage
door of a Duran Duran concert.

405
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,477
Hundreds of screaming
girls clustered around.

406
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,571
What does that mean?

407
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,775
That girls like rock bands.

408
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,251
The presence of the fans
indicates the presence of the band.

409
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,584
Different night. Same
band, same door.

410
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,590
Now there's not a girl in sight.

411
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,681
What does that mean?

412
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,124
Sorry, I don't speak hair band.

413
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,104
They weren't a hair band,
they were new romantics.

414
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,187
The band already left?

415
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,164
Nope. Band's still
there, still rocking out.

416
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,499
When does the absence of the fans
not indicate the absence of the band?

417
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,071
When it's 2009. There
aren't any Duran Duran fans.

418
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,474
They don't make them any more.

419
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,344
If there's no infection, it's because
there aren't any fans, no white cells.

420
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,248
You think his spleen?

421
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,680
Why do I bother with these great
metaphors if I still have to spell it out?

422
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,155
Yes, I think it's his
spleen. Go get a biopsy.

423
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,819
I'll try to get <i>New Moon
on Monday</i> out of my head.

424
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,560
Why are you talking this time?

425
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,395
If I quit, will you
rehire Foreman?

426
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,495
Why?

427
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,064
He can't find
another job, I can.

428
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,477
And you're willing to
make that sacrifice for him?

429
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,568
Yes.

430
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,348
Does Foreman
know about this plan?

431
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,508
Yes.

432
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,592
Well, if he's okay with
it, who am I to say no?

433
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,024
Hold still.

434
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,364
You think it's my spleen?

435
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,929
That's what they're testing.

436
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,103
So, if I happen to cure
you, what happens then?

437
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,812
You start thinking that God
was working through me,

438
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,577
this is some sort of miracle?

439
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,619
Do you think I'm an idiot?

440
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:40,948
That's what I'm testing.

441
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,456
Losing my faith
wasn't a choice I made.

442
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,355
It happened, it's
gone, for good.

443
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,226
But if it can magically disappear,
it can magically reappear.

444
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,322
And that's what you're hoping.

445
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,092
Your job... Sucks.

446
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:59,161
That's my point. You could
make more money frapping decafs,

447
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:02,003
and yet you're still
ministering to the meek.

448
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,566
Why do the Lord's work if
the Lord has left the building?

449
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,483
I've been with the
church my entire adult life.

450
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,640
It's my only marketable skill.

451
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,582
I detect the stink
of leftover faith.

452
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,182
You want to talk
hypocrisy, what about you?

453
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,553
You act like you don't
care about anyone,

454
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,525
but here you are, saving lives.

455
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,427
Solving puzzles. Saving
lives is just collateral damage.

456
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,762
Nice try. I don't think you're looking
for somebody to prove you right,

457
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,668
I think you're looking for somebody
to prove you wrong, to give you hope.

458
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,271
You want to believe, don't you?

459
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:44,007
Yeah. I want to walk out and find
myself in a forest of whore trees.

460
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,850
But I don't think it's a good idea to
tell people to go fornicate with fruit.

461
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,828
Hey, I was just
talking about you.

462
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,263
Well, not you specifically,
whores and hypocrisy.

463
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:04,426
You were right. I
don't want you there.

464
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,463
It's a special occasion, filled
with love and acceptance,

465
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,443
and the last thing I need is someone there
who's filled with loathing and contempt.

466
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,512
Okay.

467
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,777
That's it?

468
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,355
You're really not coming?

469
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,719
I'm really not coming.

470
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,550
Thank you.

471
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,185
You're welcome.

472
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,861
Gosh, I feel so grown-up.

473
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,265
He's obviously just
jerking you around.

474
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,826
Wants to see if you're serious.

475
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,215
If you just stick it out, I think
he'll bring Foreman back.

476
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,037
I don't. And even if I'm wrong,

477
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,939
I think you
should still split up.

478
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,001
It's just a matter of time
before one of you finds

479
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,047
the other in bed
with another woman.

480
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,979
This coming from
the relationship expert.

481
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,312
12 years and counting.

482
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,716
Hey, if you can make it
that long, then anyone can.

483
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:57,279
Funny how the two people in the
room who think relationships are easy

484
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,483
are both single.

485
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,637
I don't think they're easy.

486
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,836
That's why I think if you find
something that could be good,

487
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,884
you should hang on to it.

488
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,863
Everything could be
good, very little ever is.

489
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,026
His spleen is fine. Just some
insignificant traces of minor bugs.

490
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,626
Nothing that'd make him sick.

491
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,068
Which minor bugs?

492
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,369
Why do people suddenly find
religion when they have kids?

493
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:19,844
Fear of the unknown.

494
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,271
Cornerstone of faith.

495
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,077
I think it makes perfect sense.

496
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,484
So it makes sense because
it doesn't make sense?

497
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,718
The fact that you're railing about
it doesn't make a lot of sense.

498
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,126
You really got a thing
for your boss, huh?

499
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,358
I've got a thing
for my boss's thing.

500
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,595
She doesn't have a thing
per se. I'm big on metaphors.

501
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,801
What about you?
Twenty-nine years of celibacy.

502
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,705
What's holding you back now?

503
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,744
Who wants a
relationship with a priest?

504
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,301
Who wants a relationship?

505
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,850
House.

506
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,687
It's the holy water.

507
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,089
We assumed if it was an infection,
it had to be something big and nasty.

508
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,094
But he has pneumocystis,

509
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,029
a harmless bug that's everywhere
and never makes anyone sick,

510
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,259
unless they have a
compromised immune system.

511
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,843
So Father Nietzsche has AIDS.

512
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,381
Impossible.

513
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,362
I've never had a
blood transfusion,

514
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,787
I've never done IV
drugs, I've never had sex.

515
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,448
So prove it. Have an AIDS test.

516
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,289
No. I know I don't have AIDS.

517
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,454
We can't treat you
until we know what it is.

518
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,020
A negative result
proves nothing.

519
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,066
On the off chance
it's a false positive,

520
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,328
I permanently lose
any credibility I have left.

521
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,562
I'd say you just lost that.

522
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,696
I'd say I lost that with
you a long time ago.

523
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,186
We should start
treatment for AIDS.

524
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,290
We need to be sure.

525
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,178
The antiretrovirals could fry
his heart, his liver, his kidneys...

526
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,977
I'm willing to take
that chance. Big of you.

527
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,729
I'm more worried about
the kid he molested.

528
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,228
We should be finding
him and getting him tested.

529
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,396
You don't think he
already got tested?

530
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,150
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't,

531
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,986
but that's a chance
I'm not willing to take.

532
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,492
Legally, we can't inform
sexual partners about STDs.

533
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,325
This isn't some middle-aged
barfly who likes it bareback,

534
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,940
this is an innocent
kid who was molested.

535
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,676
You just want to rub the priest's
face in it. Get him transferred again.

536
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,034
Yeah, heaven forbid a
diddler has job issues.

537
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,073
And you get brought
up on charges.

538
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,440
Lost enough doctors this
week. Treat him for AIDS.

539
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,511
Found a job.

540
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,483
I didn't know you were looking.

541
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,145
Eggers at Mercy says
I can start Monday.

542
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,917
Why would you... House
says if I go, you can come back.

543
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,719
It's been less than two days.

544
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,590
You give up on me that fast?
You get a job behind my back?

545
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,138
You're acting like
I'm cheating on you.

546
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,154
I said I would handle this.

547
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,363
House knew you'd be like this.

548
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:58,663
Wow.

549
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,302
Guess House knows
me better than you do.

550
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,206
Too bad I don't go both ways.

551
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,507
Good night.

552
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,046
Don't you hate when they put the
mushrooms underneath the cheese?

553
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,420
Your attendance is
validating her hypocrisy.

554
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,586
If she invited you to a
ceremonial lynching, would you go?

555
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,462
It would depend on what she
was serving. Everyone's a hypocrite.

556
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:30,093
Why are you suddenly so obsessed
with Cuddy's particular brand?

557
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,137
I'm just making conversation.

558
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,902
Would you rather we go back to
talking about mushrooms and cheese?

559
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,136
You're the hypocrite.
You want to go.

560
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,907
You don't resent this baby,
you want to be a part of it.

561
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,313
Yes, but not until her 16th
birthday in some states.

562
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,094
This is ridiculous. You
two deserve each other.

563
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,646
If you want to go, just go
and act like a human being.

564
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:53,488
Wow. Solid advice.
Except for two things.

565
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,460
I'm acting like I don't want to
go because I don't want to go,

566
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:02,195
and I am incapable of
acting like a human being.

567
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,709
Ryan?

568
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,751
Yeah. I'm Dr. Chris
Taub. Can we talk?

569
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,414
Yeah. What's wrong?

570
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,353
In private?

571
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,088
Nobody's listening to us here.

572
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,997
I work at
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

573
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,466
I have some news about
Father Daniel Bresson.

574
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,702
What about him?

575
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,938
We believe he has AIDS.

576
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,742
Okay, so?

577
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:50,840
Well, given the
incident four years ago,

578
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:54,148
I think you should be tested,
unless you've already done so.

579
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,556
How sick is he?

580
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,718
Very.

581
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,321
Okay. Well, thanks.

582
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,297
Have you been tested?

583
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,666
Yeah.

584
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,169
And?

585
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,632
And it really isn't
any of your business.

586
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,855
I want my job back.

587
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,696
Love, sacrifice, deception
and now betrayal.

588
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,956
This is better
than a telenovela.

589
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,590
What's going on?

590
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,898
Well, either Foreman is here
as the two of you discussed,

591
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,407
to beg for his job back in
exchange for me dumping you

592
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,637
or nothing.

593
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,007
You're trying to get me fired?

594
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,139
I'm suggesting
you quit and I stay,

595
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,240
which is exactly what
you suggested last night.

596
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,217
I told Eggers I
didn't want the job.

597
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,687
Find another one. It took you
eight hours to find that one.

598
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,623
The point is, why didn't you
tell me you were doing this?

599
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,886
Why are you here without me?

600
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,053
You're overreacting.
We'll talk about this later.

601
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,173
That's what this is about.
It's about you taking control.

602
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,564
It's about you not being able
to handle me saving your ass.

603
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,465
And you're not being
controlling right now?

604
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,334
Yeah, who's the
controlling bitch now?

605
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,929
House, shut up.

606
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,967
You never wanted
to take that other job.

607
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,011
You never wanted to save me.

608
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,740
You wanted to offer to save
me, so you wouldn't feel guilty.

609
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:32,148
You knew I'd say no. That's
why you're so mad right now.

610
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,350
You're an idiot.

611
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:47,355
Well, either you can go after
her and try and patch things up,

612
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,294
or you blow her off and
take your old job back.

613
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,447
Welcome back.

614
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,455
The AIDS meds aren't gonna work.

615
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:16,655
If you'd let us do a test, we could
stop treating you, or you could stop lying.

616
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,331
I know the feeling.

617
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,398
BP's climbing. You feeling okay?

618
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,369
No. I feel flushed.

619
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:29,568
I'm burning all
over. My chest...

620
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,079
It's not a new symptom, it's
just a reaction to the AIDS meds.

621
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,414
Yeah, he reacted by getting
worse. Means it's not AIDS.

622
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:45,788
"So went Satan forth from the presence
of the Lord and smote Job sore with boils."

623
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,292
You think it's Hyper
IgE Syndrome?

624
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,159
I prefer the colloquial
term, Job's Syndrome.

625
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,528
Explains the symptoms,
and my quote.

626
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,676
It's the first thing I checked.
IgE levels are normal.

627
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,260
It could be some
other genetic disorder.

628
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,362
Cerebral microtumors could explain
the blindness and the hallucinations.

629
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,304
We didn't find any tumors.

630
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,570
That's why I didn't say
tumors, I said microtumors.

631
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,580
So your explanation doesn't depend
on us being major morons, just morons?

632
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,026
We should start genetic
testing. Takes too long.

633
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,985
So we start treatment.
Treatment is surgery.

634
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,630
We can't open him up
without confirmation.

635
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,782
So your position is we
can't test and we can't treat?

636
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,848
My position is you're wrong.

637
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,587
This isn't going to work.

638
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,994
Are you kidding? I've
never felt more alive.

639
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,726
Conflict breeds creativity.
Go run the genetic test.

640
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,892
On it.

641
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,143
So, now you don't
think I have AIDS?

642
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:43,273
I still think it's AIDS. On the off chance
it isn't, we're pursuing other avenues.

643
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,380
Ryan.

644
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,250
He's... He's dying?

645
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,159
We don't know
what's wrong with him.

646
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,857
Can I speak to him? I
don't think that's a good idea.

647
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,990
Ryan?

648
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,371
Why don't I get you a... Come
on, Ryan. Now's not a good time.

649
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,081
I'm sorry.

650
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,289
For everything.

651
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,632
I'm sorry.

652
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,083
I know.

653
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,414
I know.

654
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,577
Any second thoughts about Cuddy?

655
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,740
No, but please feel
free to blather on.

656
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,046
Raising a child on
her own is scary.

657
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:30,486
She's just doing what you do, what
everyone does. Trying to avoid pain.

658
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,456
Religion is not the
opiate of the masses,

659
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,255
religion is the
placebo of the masses.

660
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,771
If you're saying that
she's not a hypocrite...

661
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:40,459
I'm not. I'm trying to
give you a rational reason

662
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,936
to overlook her hypocrisy, so you
don't feel like a hypocrite for going.

663
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,302
Oh. Sorry, continue.

664
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,635
Okay.

665
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,941
Even if an absolute truth
exists, we can't know all of it.

666
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:56,311
And you can't condemn
her for recognizing that.

667
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,525
Are you eliminating symptoms?

668
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,696
We can know everything.

669
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,206
This is medicine,
not metaphysics.

670
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,969
Truth is truth.

671
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,071
It fits.

672
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,707
It doesn't fit.

673
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:34,014
You can't eliminate a symptom.

674
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,917
I can if it's not a symptom.

675
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,546
Well, what is it?

676
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,988
Not a symptom.

677
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,058
You're not going to die.

678
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,962
You have
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.

679
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,365
It impairs your immune system,

680
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:01,277
makes you susceptible to all the
AIDS stuff without actually having AIDS.

681
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,180
And you didn't catch
it, you were born with it.

682
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,808
Another gift from God.

683
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,477
You sure?

684
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,284
Genetic tests should confirm it,

685
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:15,191
but it explains all your
symptoms. Toe, chest, eyes, skin.

686
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,855
What about my hallucination?

687
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,864
Scotch explains that.

688
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,365
That was just a coincidence?

689
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,974
Coincidences do happen.

690
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,576
But that coincidence is what
brought me to you in the first place.

691
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,912
You promised you
wouldn't go there.

692
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:48,853
Einstein said, "Coincidences are
God's way of remaining anonymous."

693
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,989
A woman in Florida said, "Look,
Jesus is on my cheese sandwich."

694
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,468
You didn't even want to take my
case. You didn't even think I was sick.

695
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,900
The fact that I was wrong
is not a proof of God.

696
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:12,747
I'm just trying to understand how my life
can completely turn around in a single day.

697
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,121
Don't worry, your life will go
back to sucking soon enough.

698
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,923
Everything that happened to
you can be rationally explained.

699
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,996
I know. It's just...

700
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,364
That's a lot of coincidences.

701
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,459
House was right
about the priest.

702
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,023
Genetic test confirmed
it was Wiskott-Aldrich.

703
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,360
And I would've discharged him.

704
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,831
Everybody would've
discharged him.

705
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,133
House included. He only
took that case as a stall.

706
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,740
And yet it was a real
case, and he solved it.

707
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,436
By violating his own principles,

708
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,911
and ignoring the
admitting symptoms.

709
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,845
Still, he somehow
got away with it.

710
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,551
Saved another life.

711
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,079
You want him there tonight.

712
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,092
You should tell him.

713
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,108
Cold out there.

714
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,516
At least you have shoes
that cover your toes.

715
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,155
So, it's tonight?

716
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,384
Yeah.

717
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,926
Bad weather for it, huh?

718
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,326
Maybe you'll get lucky.

719
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,127
Maybe your sister will decide the
roads are too dangerous to drive on.

720
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,663
Fingers crossed.

721
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,637
Have fun.
