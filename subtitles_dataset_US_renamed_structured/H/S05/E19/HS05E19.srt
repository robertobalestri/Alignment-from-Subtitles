1
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,128
<i>Hey!</i>

2
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,793
<i>How long have I...</i>

3
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,101
Blunt force trauma to the
head did the fatal damage.

4
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,902
Since the accident,
he's had a continuous...

5
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,809
<i>Can't get up. What's
wrong with my legs?</i>

6
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,247
<i>Hey, someone talk to me!</i>

7
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,349
<i>Hey, you don't hear
me talking to you?</i>

8
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,721
Great heart for transplant.

9
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,952
<i>Who?</i>

10
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,588
<i>My heart? Oh, God. They
don't know I'm in here.</i>

11
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:07,397
Hey, genius. I think it
violates certain ethical laws

12
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,800
to rip the organs out
of a guy that's still alive.

13
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,305
Possibly certain law laws,
too. <i>LEE: Thank you. Thank you.</i>

14
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,501
Could you get back in your
bed, please, Mr. House?

15
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,787
- It's actually Dr. House.
<i>- This guy's a doctor?</i>

16
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,803
There's also a Navy SEAL House,

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,357
but you're gonna have
to save up for that one.

18
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,646
Really? Well,
that's interesting,

19
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,361
but you're here because
you crashed your motorcycle,

20
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,685
not because I need a
consult, so get back in bed.

21
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,418
Scraped my elbow. Just
need a truckload of Vicodin.

22
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,460
Whereas this guy...
He's brain dead.

23
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,586
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

24
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,323
So drop it.

25
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,094
See that? KURTZ: Minimal
brain waves don't mean he's alive.

26
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,111
<i>I am alive. I'm here.</i> Isoelectric
EEG for several hours,

27
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,297
no EEG response to
painful stimuli, hot or cold.

28
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,738
What you're seeing is
random, barely discernable.

29
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,833
- I discerned it.
<i>- Listen to him. Please.</i>

30
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,140
No. That's just the
amplifier's internal noise level.

31
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,440
It's on increased sensitivity.

32
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,606
<i>No, no, no, it's not! It's me.</i>

33
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,150
Then why is his eye
following you? <i>LEE: Exactly.</i>

34
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,311
Following motion is
an involuntary reflex.

35
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,150
<i>No.</i> You're a doctor,

36
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,450
you should know these things.

37
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,425
<i>No, no. I'm not dead.
I need help. I'm here.</i>

38
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,397
I also know about
locked-in syndrome.

39
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:17,232
And things are either
involuntary or voluntary.

40
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,999
Blink if you can hear me.

41
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,542
<i>I hear you.</i>

42
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,209
Oh. This is gonna be fun.

43
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,886
Eye movement is deliberate.

44
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,952
Can you blink once
for yes, twice for no?

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,356
<i>I hope so.</i>

46
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,992
Square root of nine?

47
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,266
He got that faster than
you. Brain is fully functional.

48
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,203
<i>Where's Molly?</i> Lee,
you were in an accident.

49
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,644
<i>Lee, hit the brake. Hit
the brake. Hit the brake.</i>

50
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,380
You sustained a traumatic
injury to your brain stem,

51
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,826
which has cut off
your brain's ability

52
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,490
to communicate with
the rest of your body.

53
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,919
<i>Can you fix me? Where's Molly?</i>

54
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,149
You still have
movement in your eyes,

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,748
so we can get you
to a rehab facility

56
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,436
where they can teach
you how to communicate.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,055
<i>No, I can't be stuck like this.</i>

58
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,793
Unless the crash didn't
cause the brain damage.

59
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,096
Maybe the brain
damage caused the crash.

60
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,334
<i>Yeah. I couldn't stop.
Why couldn't I stop?</i>

61
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,967
Look at his palms. No scrapes.

62
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,943
He didn't even try
to protect himself.

63
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,415
Suggests slowed
reflexes or no reflexes.

64
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,215
You're not a doctor in this
hospital, you are a patient.

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,755
<i>Yeah. And you're the guy
who wants to cut out my organs</i>

66
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,982
<i>and he's the guy who doesn't.</i>

67
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,301
Get me the scans.
Stroke, cancer,

68
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:22,092
even a simple infection, anything that
insults the central pons could do this.

69
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,406
<i>Then that means
I could be fixed.</i>

70
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,092
You're giving him false hope.

71
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,760
He needs to accept
what's happened

72
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,894
and work on
making the most of it.

73
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,443
<i>Molly.</i>

74
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,710
Hey.

75
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,945
<i>Don't look at me like that.
That's not making me feel better.</i>

76
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,785
<i>I love you.</i>

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,652
I don't know how God is gonna
get us through this, but he will.

78
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,788
Stop it, I'm blushing.

79
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,495
What are you doing?

80
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,592
Just looking for some
reading material for the crapper.

81
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,900
These CTs... Get back
in your bed. Come on.

82
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,600
The children are in the waiting
area. Can I bring them in?

83
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,734
<i>No. No, don't.</i>

84
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,506
You don't wanna see them?

85
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,672
<i>I don't want them having nightmares.
I don't wanna scare them, Molly.</i>

86
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,613
You don't want them to see you?

87
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,948
It's okay. I understand.

88
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,656
You're gonna be
better soon enough.

89
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,955
<i>You really that sure?</i>

90
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,188
<i>Why are you so sure, babe?
How do you get so sure?</i>

91
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,430
Are you okay?

92
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,634
Never better.
Here's your burger.

93
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:49,005
If you can't bring Mohammed to
Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed.

94
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,482
It's my diagnostics posse.

95
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,383
Hot, dark and darker.

96
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,183
<i>Talk about getting
me better, please.</i>

97
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,099
What are you doing up in
Middletown? <i>LEE: Who cares?</i>

98
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,888
Buying a Gibson '57 Goldtop.

99
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,224
It's the guitar Duane
Allman used to play.

100
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,457
Next to the trauma,
the most likely causes of

101
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,659
a sudden onset of
locked-in syndrome

102
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,634
are basilar artery stroke
and brain hemorrhage.

103
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,795
CT was clean.

104
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,947
<i>Man, those fries look good.</i>

105
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,114
Certain circulatory diseases.

106
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,573
Guy's an active bike
rider, his heart's fine.

107
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,473
A well-placed tumor
could explain it.

108
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,002
<i>Jeez, is the last thing I ate
gonna be the last thing I ate?</i>

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,312
It could evade the CT, and still
show up on an MRI with contrast.

110
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,249
<i>It was a melted PowerBar.</i>

111
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,411
She's the smart one.

112
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,853
I just keep dark and
darker to fill out the quota.

113
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,823
If we find it, treat
it, you can be fine.

114
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,006
<i>I never thought I'd be
praying for a brain tumor,</i>

115
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,999
<i>but please, dear God.</i>

116
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,098
If you're praying in
there, stop it right now.

117
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,694
We'll get his doctor
to order an MRI.

118
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,674
His doctor's busy teaching him how
to blink out "kill me" in Morse code.

119
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,243
Luckily, I found some
forms under the mattress.

120
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,118
Check it out, they have
those MRI video goggles.

121
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,849
- I heard these were awesome.
- What do you see?

122
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,391
It's a beach.

123
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,017
Oh, look. There's Taub.

124
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,053
Drinking a margarita and mocking
us for driving all the way up here

125
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,862
- because House said "jump."
<i>- Easy. I can still feel in here.</i>

126
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,564
Excuse Dr. Kutner. He gets a
little excited about new technology.

127
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,539
It can get loud in there,
and a little closed off.

128
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,236
These will put you
in a quiet place.

129
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,779
You can create a relaxing
scenario for yourself.

130
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,009
<i>I hope they work.</i>

131
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,277
<i>Wow.</i>

132
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,683
You're in my relaxing scenario?

133
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,462
I guess you like me.

134
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,167
Either that or
you got sent here.

135
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,065
What, by God?

136
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,604
I'm not sure if I
believe in God.

137
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,005
You spend an awful lot of time in
church for someone who doesn't.

138
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,474
I don't not believe either.

139
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,473
It's either one or the other.

140
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,382
I go to church to mainly
keep my wife happy, but...

141
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,363
I don't know. I've never
actually thought that

142
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,788
God could reach
out and affect my life.

143
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,954
But getting a brilliant
doctor in the bed next to me...

144
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,795
God is also the guy who
opened his car door in front of you.

145
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,766
I think Molly was right.

146
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,429
I think you were sent
here to make me get better.

147
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,999
I think so.

148
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,143
Hey.

149
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,240
Hey, Dad. Making a volcano.

150
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,515
Yeah. You're making a volcano.
Looks like it. What you doing, baby?

151
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,693
<i>What time is it?</i>

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,754
Hope you don't mind.
My new roommate snores.

153
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,597
And my new room
doesn't have you.

154
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,599
Your MRI showed a
lesion in the central pons.

155
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,368
<i>What is that? What
does that mean?</i>

156
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,376
See it there? <i>LEE: No.</i>

157
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,438
Yeah, that's what they said.

158
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,576
But it's there, which means
no way head trauma did this.

159
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,954
It's cancer, causing a
paraneoplastic syndrome.

160
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,117
Unfortunately, your
current doctor thinks

161
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,219
its diffused nature
means an infection.

162
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,855
Now, the bad
news is the antivirals

163
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,901
he's got you on might kill you.

164
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,162
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

165
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,603
The good news is, if
they just almost kill you,

166
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:37,042
then Dr. Idiot will realize that
his name is not a coincidence,

167
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,772
and he'll let me
do whatever I want.

168
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,006
<i>Thank you.</i>

169
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,247
See, the irony here is,

170
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,617
you're kind of fascinating.

171
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,688
So many questions.

172
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,322
But if you could
answer any of them,

173
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,056
then you wouldn't
be fascinating.

174
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,156
<i>I get it. You're a
little nuts, aren't you?</i>

175
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,194
Your wife is the one
getting you through this.

176
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,967
Your wife and me.

177
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,671
Although, frankly, the MRI was a lot more
useful than four hours of hand holding.

178
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,639
I think.

179
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,811
<i>If he had a wife,
he'd know it matters.</i>

180
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,391
You're a good
guy. Easy to talk to.

181
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:28,622
<i>Wait, something's happening.
What's happening to me?</i>

182
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,823
Need some help in here.

183
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,025
Your patient is seizing.

184
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,161
Why would he have a seizure?

185
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,832
Because he has cancer. His
brain stem is compromised.

186
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,618
<i>Why are you still arguing with
this guy? You thought I was dead.</i>

187
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,043
Welcome back. And nicely played.

188
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,775
You almost died,
exactly as we planned.

189
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,316
You knew this was gonna happen?

190
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,842
Usually happens when you treat
cancer by pretending it's not cancer.

191
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,651
Right, Doctor? My
turn? It's cancer?

192
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,816
No, it isn't. <i>LEE: Yes.</i>

193
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,986
Small tumor in his brain stem
causing paraneoplastic syndrome.

194
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,859
He needs plasmapheresis.
Can you give that to him?

195
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,195
No, no, I'm sorry. I completely
disagree with Dr. House.

196
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,497
<i>Please shut up!</i> I don't.

197
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,696
Which means I can treat him.

198
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,602
<i>Let him. Let him.</i>

199
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,163
Is that what you want?

200
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,708
<i>Absolutely.</i>

201
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,369
Could you send up
a couple of bellboys?

202
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,717
I got the transfer papers,
plasmapheresis is all set up.

203
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,021
Are you okay?

204
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,722
Fresh infusion of
macho. You like?

205
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,028
<i>I can't move, and she's
worried about his boo-boo?</i>

206
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,692
What were you doing
up there anyway?

207
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,327
Antiquing.

208
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,996
Found you a late
Victorian corset.

209
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,539
Come by later. I'll tie you up.

210
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:50,702
<i>He hitting on her? If she turns
around, she's into him, too.</i>

211
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,972
<i>And there you have it.</i>

212
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,356
Sorry, I didn't show up in
Middletown. I didn't get the message.

213
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,281
Probably 'cause
there was no message.

214
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,750
I decided to accept
your resignation.

215
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,344
Uh, I thought we were
past this. I decided to stay.

216
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,390
No, you didn't, you
had it decided for you.

217
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,049
So now you're stuck
here with a boss

218
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,059
who knows that you
wanna be somewhere else.

219
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,104
Which means you're no
longer motivated to impress me.

220
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,098
Which means you're no longer
motivated to come up with good ideas.

221
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,531
Unless I'm wrong.

222
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,498
Save the cheerleader,
save your world.

223
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,207
I got it from here. <i>LEE: I
thought you already solved this.</i>

224
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,539
<i>You thinking you might be wrong?</i>

225
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,238
<i>What's going on?</i>

226
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,281
Hey, just curious.

227
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,443
What're you driving up to
Middletown for? Why do you care?

228
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,952
<i>Why does he care?</i>
Because I'm your friend.

229
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,285
I was buying a guitar.
Yeah. I heard that.

230
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,588
Used to belong to a guitarist
who died in a motorcycle accident.

231
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,356
Just reeks of you
screwing with people.

232
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,798
Your crash was 10 miles from the
Orange County Progressive Pain Clinic.

233
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,131
You live 10 miles from
Mary's Dress Shop.

234
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,846
And yet, that's not even
on my list of reasons

235
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,066
that I think you're
secretly a transvestite.

236
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,803
If you're going to another
state to get more narcotics...

237
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,954
<i>He's on drugs?</i> I went to
visit your ex-ex-ex-wife...

238
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,742
<i>What?</i> who lives
in Thompson Ridge.

239
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,459
Let her know about the extra money
you're making on the lecture circuit,

240
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,828
so She'll be sure to
adjust your alimony.

241
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,286
You wouldn't do that.

242
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,083
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

243
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,282
Would you?

244
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,654
<i>You guys are friends?</i>

245
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,088
Shouldn't we be
entertaining our patient?

246
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,896
I performed Euripides with
sock puppets, you just missed it.

247
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,800
House said we should.

248
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,338
The mind is like a muscle.

249
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,432
If you don't exercise it, it'll
atrophy, just like anything else.

250
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,637
Whoever's with him needs
to talk, keep his mind active.

251
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,681
And it'll show
House you still care.

252
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,908
Not sure if I do.

253
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,746
<i>Jeez, you're my doctor.</i>

254
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,257
Then why don't you just quit?

255
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,083
Not sure I want to
do that, either. Oh.

256
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,257
Maybe you should figure it out
before House figures it out for you.

257
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,319
<i>Dude, maybe you should have
your midlife crisis after I'm better.</i>

258
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,761
Kutner.

259
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,197
We'll be right back.

260
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,998
<i>Wait. Wait, what
did you just see?</i>

261
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,505
Do you drink?

262
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,547
He's a roofer, alcohol
hardly proves your theory.

263
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,479
Marchiafava-Bignami
disease fits.

264
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,676
LFT's are normal.

265
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,811
<i>Speak English. Is it fixable?
What does that mean?</i>

266
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,481
<i>- That hurts.</i>
- No tremors.

267
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,457
How much do you
drink? A six-pack a day?

268
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,935
<i>I hate beer. I don't
even drink beer.</i>

269
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,170
Could mean he
drinks more or less,

270
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,539
- or maybe something else.
- It may not be alcohol at all.

271
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,940
Street opiates could
also cause locked-in...

272
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,557
<i>I don't get high.</i> MPPP.

273
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,727
Either we play 20,000
questions with every street drug,

274
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,966
or instead of talking to
him, we talk to the lesion.

275
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,098
<i>Talk to me.</i>

276
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,836
We're going to
biopsy the brain stem?

277
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,879
For the record, that doesn't
count as your inspired idea.

278
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,226
It's sort of where
I was heading.

279
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,943
<i>You're gonna cut
into my head? Why?</i>

280
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,943
<i>Stop treating me like
a piece of furniture!</i>

281
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,215
<i>I have a right to
know what's going on!</i>

282
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,286
<i>Where is that going?</i>

283
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,729
Blood in your urine
clogged up your old catheter.

284
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,599
<i>Peeing blood? That must be
what the insecure doctor saw.</i>

285
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,638
Every clue gets us
closer to the answer.

286
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,035
<i>Damn it!</i> The surgery
will get us more clues.

287
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,216
You have visitors.

288
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,489
<i>No. No, Molly.</i>

289
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,025
You can come in now.

290
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,186
Daddy. Daddy.

291
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,025
<i>I told you not to bring them.</i>

292
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,826
They wanted to see their father.

293
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,065
<i>I can't even hug them.</i>

294
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,695
They can handle it.
It's gonna be all right.

295
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,263
<i>You're not so sure
any more, are you?</i>

296
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,471
<i>They must have told you that
it's dangerous, that I could die.</i>

297
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,776
<i>And that's why you
brought them in here.</i>

298
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,406
I got an A plus on my test.

299
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,451
<i>To see me before I die.</i>

300
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,576
I love you, Daddy.

301
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,177
<i>Daddy loves you, too.</i>

302
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,984
I want to show my drawings.

303
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,925
<i>Kids just want a dad.
Even if he's just a lump.</i>

304
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,455
Maybe you should go now.

305
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,523
<i>Oh no, they can stay.
Please, let them stay.</i>

306
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,294
Bye, Daddy.

307
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,432
Bye, Daddy.

308
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,674
Sorry. You were crying.

309
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,286
<i>Damn.</i>

310
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,558
We're going to put you out,
just so we can drill the hole.

311
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,497
<i>Oh, that's very
thoughtful of you.</i>

312
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,295
Then we'll wake you back up.

313
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,964
We need you to answer some
simple "yes" or "no" questions

314
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,316
while we're cutting to make sure

315
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,351
we're not cutting where we
shouldn't. <i>LEE: Seems to be working.</i>

316
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:54,245
Deep breaths. In about 10
seconds, you will feel light headed.

317
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,580
By now, you should
be floating high...

318
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,798
How come I'm not better?

319
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,706
God's not supposed
to work in trial and error.

320
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,108
God's mistakes are
well documented.

321
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,655
If he'd done everything
right the first time,

322
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,148
there'd have been one
plague and zero great floods.

323
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,275
Those were because
of human mistakes.

324
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,876
You think your doctor has an
apartment on Mount Olympus?

325
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,922
God put me with
you for a reason.

326
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,024
I'm gonna be all
right still, right?

327
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,387
I don't know.

328
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,459
Lee? You with me now?

329
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,801
Easy questions.

330
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,544
You'll be done
before you know it.

331
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,545
Is this equation correct?

332
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,240
<i>What? So if you make a mistake,</i>

333
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,408
<i>I'm not gonna know that anymore?</i>

334
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,144
Are these lines parallel?

335
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,487
Spatial relationship's intact.

336
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,045
Take a look at this circle.

337
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,986
Is more than half of it shaded?

338
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,391
<i>Of course.</i>

339
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,322
Don't forget to blink. Is more
than half of the circle shaded?

340
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,263
<i>Sorry. Yes.</i>

341
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,562
Look at me, Lee.

342
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,036
Again. Is more than
half of this circle shaded?

343
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,936
<i>Blink. Come on, Lee. Blink.</i>

344
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,167
Foreman, back out.

345
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,300
<i>I can't blink. Cannot blink.</i>

346
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,476
Why aren't his eyes moving?

347
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,046
Two options, my
neurologist screwed up,

348
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,249
or else something
that the hospital lawyer

349
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,834
is going to have to come
up with when you sue us.

350
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,158
Blinking and eye movements are
controlled by a small cluster of nerves

351
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,288
just millimeters
from the biopsy site.

352
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,443
But he's still in there, right? I
mean, he just can't communicate?

353
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,560
It's possible.

354
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,969
Also possible is that the surgery
caused so much swelling in his brain stem

355
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,404
that he's just gone.

356
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,876
He had one way to communicate
and now that's gone. Well played.

357
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:10,144
Brain biopsy revealed severe damage
to the myelin sheath. The question is why.

358
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,811
Epstein Barr.
Picornaviruses. Malaria.

359
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,322
He runs a business, meets a lot of
people, could have picked up rotavirus.

360
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,119
Did he report having
bloody diarrhea?

361
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,159
Wife's not sure. Says
he doesn't complain.

362
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,956
- Did you ask him?
- We prioritized.

363
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,293
He can only blink, a real
history would've taken weeks.

364
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,423
If he had Epstein-Barr,
he'd have belly pains.

365
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,525
If he had picornavirus,
he'd have headaches.

366
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,001
Five other "yes/no" questions,

367
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,867
and maybe we'd know
what treatment to give,

368
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,803
and what treatment
would kill him.

369
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,035
Unless he's already dead.

370
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,271
Maybe there's another way.

371
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,954
Brain-computer interface,
better known as BCI.

372
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:53,455
The goal is to get you to
move that cursor with your mind.

373
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,360
When you think "up", the
computer records the pattern.

374
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,230
Think "up" enough times, it
eventually learns what you're thinking.

375
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,360
So, start thinking "up."

376
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,685
You in there?

377
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,285
Are you trying?

378
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,539
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife.

379
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,073
She was at a sweat lodge
in New Mexico last week.

380
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,279
What were you really
doing in New York?

381
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,682
Know how you hate it
when I meddle in your lies?

382
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,989
I mean, your life?

383
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,494
Why are you being so evasive?

384
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,757
Unless you have
something to evade.

385
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,232
Interesting.

386
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,065
So it's nothing to do with
you, your ex-wife, or my pain.

387
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:16,098
I was heading to the Downstate
Correctional Facility in Fishkill.

388
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,339
One of your hookers
arrange a conjugal visit?

389
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,676
It's where Foreman's
brother is being held.

390
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:31,283
This is gonna mean months
of sleepless nights wondering

391
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,485
if I could've done
something differently.

392
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,289
Maybe it's not that
I'm sick of House,

393
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,527
it's that I'm sick
of being scared

394
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,001
out of my mind to
go to work every day.

395
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,403
Sorry.

396
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,283
Did that just...

397
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,350
Was that you?

398
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,364
Are you really in there?

399
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,609
I knew you were in there.

400
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,050
<i>I was scared.</i>

401
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,451
Thank God.

402
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,884
<i>I am scared.</i>

403
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,626
<i>Molly, I love you so much.</i>

404
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,527
Have you had any bloody
diarrhea in the last two weeks?

405
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,492
Rotavirus out.

406
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,503
Any recent joint pain?

407
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,436
Epstein-Barr's out.

408
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,031
Have you traveled out
of the country lately?

409
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,770
What about inside the country?

410
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,375
He was in St. Louis.

411
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,850
Good.

412
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,778
Could be Missouri malaria.
We'll start treatment.

413
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,984
He was there.

414
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,759
The machine must not be working.

415
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,460
Hmm.

416
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,626
Either that or he
lied to you about it.

417
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,561
People do that sometimes.

418
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:28,197
For example, I just lied to
him about Missouri malaria.

419
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,039
Did you go to St. Louis?

420
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,810
<i>I should've told you.
Why didn't I just tell you?</i>

421
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,151
<i>Down.</i>

422
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,129
When you weren't in
St. Louis for two days,

423
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,763
I assume you were getting
some strange for two days.

424
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,272
<i>So does she.</i>

425
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,340
<i>You have to tell her I wasn't.</i>

426
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,741
Amazing.

427
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,270
A man who only has two
blips at his disposal can still lie.

428
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,009
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

429
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,484
If you were getting some
really strange strange,

430
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,078
you could have
contracted neurosyphilis.

431
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,715
Infection went to your
brain, froze you right up.

432
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,726
Good news is, it's treatable.

433
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,496
You'll be up and moving in
time to sign the divorce papers.

434
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,608
<i>Why would I tell you the
truth about being in St. Louis</i>

435
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,152
<i>and then not tell you
the truth about this?</i>

436
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,432
He just admitted he wasn't
in St. Louis in front of his wife.

437
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,600
And you think he's lying
when she's not even in here?

438
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,577
<i>I'm liking this one more
and more. Don't fire him.</i>

439
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,081
Were you out of the state?

440
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,668
<i>LEE: I never left.</i>

441
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,220
Were you within 20
miles of your house?

442
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,256
<i>Yes.</i>

443
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,348
Were you within five miles?

444
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,790
<i>Yes.</i>

445
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,259
Within two miles?

446
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,590
Yes.

447
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,889
Did you stay at a hotel?

448
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,627
No.

449
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,639
You had to sleep
somewhere. Your car?

450
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,335
No.

451
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,905
A friend's house?

452
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,610
Yes.

453
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,509
Yes.

454
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,143
That narrows it down,
depending on how popular you are.

455
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,780
Tell the wife to stop
crying, get in here.

456
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,961
He says that when he was
supposed to be in St. Louis,

457
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,499
he was staying
at a friend's house.

458
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,134
Really? Yes.

459
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,103
Let's assume that you
believe him for the moment.

460
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,799
Name your friends
within two miles.

461
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,842
Martin and Kim's?

462
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,103
No.

463
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,503
Guess someone who
doesn't have a wife.

464
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,277
Dave? Yes.

465
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,352
You got an address?

466
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,524
If this is where he got sick, someone
else here should have symptoms.

467
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,289
Not if Lee was the only one
coming down to the basement.

468
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,264
Furnace is rusty
but no gas leaks.

469
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,766
Résumés and cover letters here.

470
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:12,771
Some are weeks old, he's been
spending time here for a while.

471
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,804
Business wasn't going good.

472
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:20,108
I didn't want you
and the kids to worry.

473
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,347
I was trying to protect you.

474
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:30,650
Molly...

475
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,720
I wish you could hear me.

476
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,124
I wish I could make
all of this better.

477
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,431
Looks like he
temped a few times.

478
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,630
As a janitor. Factory
out on Route 10.

479
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,107
The factory foreman says they
make rechargeable batteries,

480
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,545
mostly for cell phones.

481
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,415
Big step down from running
your own business to sweeping up.

482
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,579
<i>Doing what I had to do.</i>

483
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,246
Metal filings.

484
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,417
Judging by the color,
I'd say cadmium.

485
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,758
Which he'd aerosolize with the
broom, then right into his lungs.

486
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,229
Heavy metal poisoning
explains everything.

487
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:28,572
The chelation will scrub the
heavy metals out of your blood.

488
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,824
If we're right about the cause,

489
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,249
we should see some
movement in about a day or so.

490
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,286
<i>Can you put this thing on turbo?</i>

491
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,930
<i>Getting a little
anxious in here.</i>

492
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,446
Somebody will
be here at all times

493
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:43,224
to irrigate your eyes,
keep you company.

494
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,991
Hopefully help make
the time go quicker.

495
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,225
<i>My eyes still feel really dry.</i>

496
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,736
Thank you for thinking "up".

497
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,532
For helping me
find you in there.

498
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,032
Man, when you
moved that cursor...

499
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,150
Bought my first girlfriend
a necklace, it was silver.

500
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,685
Cost 180 bucks. Had
to save for six months.

501
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,657
She hated it.

502
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,824
<i>Really, seriously,
would you tell this story</i>

503
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,629
<i>to someone who could walk away?</i>

504
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,193
Never bought another
girlfriend jewelry again.

505
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,966
Until Dr. Hadley.

506
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,001
<i>You're dating her? You might
want to start all your stories with that.</i>

507
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,878
Same thing. She
didn't even wear it.

508
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,382
<i>The diamond thing? She
was wearing it the other day.</i>

509
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,975
If she doesn't like
it, she doesn't like it.

510
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,748
Apparently, I suck
at picking out jewelry,

511
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,448
but at least have
the guts to tell me.

512
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,616
<i>Okay, getting boring again.</i>

513
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,490
<i>How long till we know if
this treatment is working?</i>

514
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,454
You lied to me.

515
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,432
<i>I wasn't having an affair!</i>

516
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,663
So, we needed money, who cares?

517
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,315
<i>The last time business was
slow, you got migraines every day.</i>

518
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,466
Why would you do that to me?

519
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,906
<i>I'm sorry, I was
stupid, I was...</i>

520
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,445
<i>Don't go. Don't...
Damn it! Somebody put</i>

521
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,912
<i>"I'm sorry" on this
stupid computer.</i>

522
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,840
<i>My eye is killing me.</i>

523
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,794
I want to keep my job.

524
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:28,099
Great. All you gotta do is
come up with a good idea.

525
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:33,096
How about we hook the guy's brain
to a computer so he can communicate?

526
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,605
That's a great idea.

527
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,806
For the guy who invented the
computer that can read minds.

528
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,709
Your idea was to use his idea.

529
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,681
You didn't come up with it.
No one else came up with it.

530
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,427
If I didn't re-establish communication,
we never would have found...

531
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,649
What's interesting is
why you're here now.

532
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,781
Not when I gave
you the ultimatum.

533
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,758
Was it something
the patient said?

534
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:05,229
I realized that what
we do here terrifies me.

535
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,976
And overcoming that

536
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,078
is the only way I can matter.

537
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:23,550
Kutner found the battery factory,
Kutner came up with cadmium.

538
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,650
Maybe you don't matter.

539
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm gonna close your eyes
so you can get some sleep.

540
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,343
Hopefully, when you wake
up, we'll see some improvement.

541
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,780
<i>Hope that includes
my eye feeling better.</i>

542
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,113
Hand me the fluorescein stain.

543
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,125
What does that mean?
Epithelium looks torn.

544
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,492
These drops sting.

545
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:06,191
I'm going to close your
left eye to keep it protected.

546
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,674
I'm gonna blink your eye a
few times to distribute the dye.

547
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,756
Ulcerative keratitis.

548
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,728
It means it's not
cadmium poisoning.

549
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,995
<i>Which means you
don't know what's wrong.</i>

550
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,896
<i>Again.</i>

551
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,747
When was the last time
you changed that dressing?

552
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,581
Judging by the smell
of it, I'd say never.

553
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,823
He's locked-in, his
kidneys blew a fuse,

554
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,954
and now his eye's oozing pus.

555
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,869
I assume you went over
all that with your team.

556
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,776
Also assume they didn't
have any brilliant ideas

557
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,099
or you wouldn't still
be muttering to yourself.

558
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,432
This is gonna hurt.

559
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,664
Ow!

560
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,972
The way he's losing his myelin

561
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,136
makes an infection most likely.

562
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,645
Could be varicella.

563
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,773
Road debris has come to the
surface. I'm gonna have to scrub it out.

564
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,250
And the initial acyclovir
would've treated that.

565
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,447
Which pushes me towards
an auto-immune disease.

566
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,716
Like Behcet's.

567
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,781
Here, this is gonna
hurt even more.

568
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,793
Take two now, two later.

569
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,523
Oops.

570
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,432
Of course, if the
varicella was resistant,

571
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,469
it wouldn't matter what
they did up in Middletown.

572
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,672
Do an LP.

573
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,840
You've been in the ER too long.

574
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,260
When the patient
had a head trauma,

575
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,810
white blood cells only indicate
that he had head trauma.

576
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,356
Or you could use the
LP for something useful.

577
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:15,292
If you find polys, it's
varicella, lymph's, Behcet's.

578
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,054
Why did I fire you again?

579
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,827
You didn't. I quit.

580
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,574
You weren't visiting
Foreman's brother either.

581
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,042
Busy. Kutner's doing
an LP so I have to focus.

582
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,216
I had prison security check
visitor logs, phone records,

583
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,685
you've never had any
contact with anyone at Fishkill.

584
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,654
So I ask again,

585
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,789
what were you doing
up in Middletown?

586
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,392
You know what's more
interesting than what I was doing?

587
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:55,195
The reason you are so
obsessed with what I was doing.

588
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,291
Stop deflecting, House.

589
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,700
Says the deflector.

590
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,807
The reason I was up there is the
reason you're scared I was up there.

591
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,304
I was checking out
your dirty little secret.

592
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,777
How long have you
been sleeping with her?

593
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,980
How did you know?

594
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,116
Your only secrets are the
girls you find embarrassing.

595
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,252
And the only embarrassing
girl you've met recently

596
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,559
is the one at your
brother's cuckoo facility.

597
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,189
We've only been out a few times.

598
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,259
She's a caregiver. Like
all your other failed exes.

599
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,101
And someone who
takes care of your brother.

600
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,532
Say, who was the last person
that took care of your brother?

601
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,573
You think this is oedipal?

602
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,943
Actually I was
thinking masturbatory,

603
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,448
but I guess your mom
took care of him first.

604
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:48,612
So the safe course is
to gouge your eyes out.

605
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,062
LP stands for lumbar puncture.

606
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,758
We use this needle to
collect fluid from your spine.

607
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,630
<i>That's a really big needle.</i>

608
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,645
You're going to feel some
extreme pressure in your back.

609
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,969
<i>I already feel pressure in
my front. My chest hurts.</i>

610
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,817
- Sort of a fetal position...
<i>- Something's wrong.</i>

611
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,118
The best angle into your spine.

612
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,633
<i>No, my chest.</i>

613
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,545
<i>Something's
wrong. I think I'm...</i>

614
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,967
Pull the needle out! <i>LEE:
Oh, God, I'm flatlining.</i>

615
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,345
Call a Code.

616
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,758
There is no God.

617
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,857
You don't know
what's wrong with me.

618
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,295
Doesn't seem that way.

619
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,301
So am I dead?

620
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,168
Not yet.

621
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,980
But you're about to be.

622
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:50,605
Okay.

623
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,146
Charging. Clear.

624
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,554
Again. Clear.

625
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,449
He's back.

626
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,221
<i>LEE: No. No. Let me go.</i> HOUSE:
The arrest means the demyelination

627
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,454
hit the area in his brainstem

628
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,139
- that controls heart rhythm.
<i>- You can't fix me.</i>

629
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,741
<i>I've been here for three
days.</i> We need answers fast,

630
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,509
'cause this is going to happen
again. <i>LEE: Everything hurts.</i>

631
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,677
We need to get him
started on steroids.

632
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:10,945
<i>It's okay. Just stop fighting.</i>

633
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,461
Not without the
results of the LP.

634
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,769
<i>She's gotta go on with her life.</i>

635
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,508
<i>The kids don't need this. I
can't do nothing for them. I can't.</i>

636
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:27,547
<i>God, this foot. Oh,
that really, really itches.</i>

637
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,572
So we put in a temporary
pacer, it's not gonna...

638
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,782
Shut up! Shut up!

639
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,323
He's trying to talk.

640
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,821
Something bothering you?

641
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,201
If there's still tightness in
your chest, it's expected.

642
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,532
Is it your eye?

643
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,745
Why's he saying "no" three
times? You only asked one question.

644
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,144
Maybe he's not saying "no".

645
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,806
Maybe he's saying "down"?

646
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,981
Are you saying that
the pain is lower?

647
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,353
How low? Your leg?

648
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,082
Your foot?

649
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,754
Left foot?

650
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,694
Check his... Let me see
now. Yeah. His right foot.

651
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,429
No bruises, no rashes, no cuts.

652
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,869
Then there should be no pain.

653
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,839
Is it a tingling sensation?

654
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,437
Is it itching?

655
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,811
Itchy foot means liver failure.

656
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,843
The liver's fine, his enzymes have
been normal since we admitted him.

657
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,752
I didn't say failing,
I said failure.

658
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,380
Just like you.

659
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,256
Liver's like a cruise
ship taking on water.

660
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,227
As it starts to sink,
it sends out an SOS.

661
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,025
Only instead of radio
waves, it uses enzymes.

662
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,566
The more enzymes in the
blood, the worse the liver is.

663
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,161
But once the ship has
sunk, there's no more SOS.

664
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,264
You think the liver's fine, but it's
already at the bottom of the sea.

665
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,898
So dying liver released toxins,

666
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,672
damaged the nerves,
led to locked-in syndrome.

667
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,179
Now we just need to know
what's causing the liver failure.

668
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,877
Liver plus eye plus kidney,
most likely sclerosing cholangitis.

669
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,749
Oh, God, if only
Taub had said that,

670
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,812
it would have been
a happy ending.

671
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,323
Do a biopsy to confirm.

672
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:20,488
I'm gonna numb up the area
where we'll go in for the punch biopsy.

673
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,890
Where's the new bracelet?

674
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,736
She was wearing the bracelet?

675
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,467
You didn't notice that I was
wearing it? Because you weren't.

676
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,872
He noticed and you didn't?

677
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,886
If you don't like it, it's
fine, it's not a big deal.

678
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,401
I like it. That's the point.

679
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:37,472
I'd rather have it at home in the
jewelry box than getting peed on at work.

680
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,245
You got the patient's
urine on that arm?

681
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,048
When I was putting
in the catheter. Why?

682
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,749
You've got a rash.
The bracelet's real.

683
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,850
I figured. So what if the rash

684
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,919
isn't just a rash, what
if it's an infection?

685
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,555
If there were rats
in that basement,

686
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,068
<i>then the liver failure could
be caused by leptospirosis.</i>

687
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,503
<i>Transfers through urine.
Rat pee to him. His pee to you.</i>

688
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,132
The infection would
need an entry point.

689
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,541
Look for any recent
scratches, cuts.

690
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,908
Look. Next to his fingernail.

691
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,120
The infection
destroyed your liver,

692
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,785
which released toxins that
caused the locked-in syndrome.

693
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,294
You were dying of a paper cut.

694
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,954
<i>I hope you're right this time.</i>

695
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,607
Let's start him on
high dose penicillin G.

696
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,328
We found rats in your
buddy, Dave's basement.

697
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,665
Tested positive
for leptospirosis.

698
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,302
Means we're on
the right treatment.

699
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,102
So try moving a finger.

700
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,579
Your brain needs to get
used to doing its job again.

701
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,116
Try harder.

702
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,514
I'm sure you've lost hope.

703
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,348
I know we've told you several
times that we knew what this was,

704
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,393
but this time we're right.

705
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:00,722
Concentrate. Move
one finger for me.

706
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,139
Welcome back.

707
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,172
<i>I did it.</i>

708
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:24,948
Rat pee.

709
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,522
Very nice idea.

710
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,191
Who came up with it?

711
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,391
I did.

712
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,729
Good.

713
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,475
You okay with him
claiming the credit?

714
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,535
It was his idea, he
saw the rash, he...

715
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,513
If he did, he would have hung

716
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,550
a "Mission Accomplished"
banner in my outer office.

717
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,864
Don't toy with him, if
you're going to fire him...

718
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,518
Fact that he stole your idea
means that he cares enough to lie.

719
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,224
That's all I needed to know.

720
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,696
Rat pee. It's a very nice idea.

721
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,899
House, you left
this in my office.

722
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,573
No, I didn't.

723
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,703
So either I have a
hole in my pocket...

724
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,678
No, that's right. I
remember now. I stole it.

725
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,545
Because if you had gone up
there to check out my girlfriend,

726
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,560
you wouldn't have come back
here and lied to me about it.

727
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,195
You would have thrown
her right in my face.

728
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,654
You underestimate the
entertainment value of your obsessions.

729
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:34,351
And then there were all those
calls you weren't taking in front of me.

730
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,390
So I dialed the number of
the calls you weren't taking.

731
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,228
You're seeing a psychiatrist.

732
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,143
You had no right to
invade my privacy.

733
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,273
Is that? Yeah, it's irony.

734
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,180
Hey.

735
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,181
God sent you.

736
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,622
Suddenly, you're
not so fascinating.

737
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,234
You're spying on your team?

738
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,133
Prioritize, Wilson.

739
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,415
Is that really what you want
to torture me about right now?

740
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,917
I don't want to torture you at
all. I think this is a great thing,

741
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,241
not something you have to drive an
hour out of town to shroud in mystery.

742
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,212
Yeah, whining on someone's couch

743
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,976
is an excellent use of my time.

744
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,280
Maybe I'll discover that
my childhood wasn't perfect.

745
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,116
So your attitude about
therapy clearly hasn't changed.

746
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,088
And yet you went.

747
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,092
Which leads me to believe that
maybe something else has changed.

748
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,789
Maybe you think you can
change. Credit Cuddy with that.

749
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,764
Not much credit to take
'cause I'm not going back.

750
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,562
Oh, House, please.

751
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,212
I assume you went because
you're tired of screwing up

752
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,829
every chance you
get at happiness.

753
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,134
View contact. Delete contact.

754
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,651
Do not let the fact that
I found out about it...

755
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,837
Don't beat yourself up.

756
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,176
I'm not going back
because it doesn't work.

757
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,185
You'll end up alone.
