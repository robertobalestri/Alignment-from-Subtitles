1
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,398
You made your point, now
how about letting us do our job?

2
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,565
Our point will be made when your
company stops tearing down this mountain.

3
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,506
Then who's gonna
feed our kids? You?

4
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,887
If you really cared
about your kids,

5
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,210
you'd want them to have air
to breathe when they grow up.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,720
What did you say,
you son of a bitch?

7
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,740
You guys aren't the problem.

8
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,717
You're being hurt
more than anyone.

9
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,515
You breathe in that coal dust...

10
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,749
Coal is the dirtiest
energy on Earth.

11
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,621
Gonna need some backup.

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,738
Not enough for you thugs
to assault the environment?

13
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,196
Doug, please, don't.

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,064
Susan? Susan, you okay?

15
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,204
She needs to get to a hospital.

16
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,073
She's just dehydrated. We have
medics here. Let them give her fluids.

17
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,305
She has no pulse.

18
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,944
Either unhook your arm
or I'm gonna break it off.

19
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,779
Either way, this
protest is over.

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,876
The protest is over, come on!

21
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,987
All right.

22
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,099
What happened? You passed out.

23
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,832
It's okay. Just dehydrated.

24
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,572
You know we'll be
back. We'll be back!

25
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,318
Hey, stop screwing around.

26
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,587
I'm not screwing
around. I just can't...

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,729
I can't stand up.

28
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,318
I need to push back our getaway.

29
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,913
No, you don't. I found you a
board, perfect size to learn on.

30
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm just postponing.
O'Neil, from Philly General,

31
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,825
wants me to get a
patient in to see House.

32
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:13,986
So?

33
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,256
I owe him a favor.

34
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,820
He's taken about a dozen of
my referrals over the last year.

35
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,391
I meant, so, that's five
seconds to hand House the file,

36
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,697
30 for him to question
your real motives,

37
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,068
a minute for witty comments

38
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,698
comparing the length of
your legs to Thirteen's...

39
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,085
Plenty of time left
over for the shore.

40
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,287
I need to make sure he
doesn't toss the file in the trash

41
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,506
as soon as I'm out of sight.

42
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,174
Babe, can't you repay
the favor on another case?

43
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,585
After last week, I could really
use a break from this place.

44
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,847
We both could.

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,490
Once I'm sure he's
really on the case,

46
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,150
then we're out of here.

47
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,224
And these legs, and every
other part of me, will be all yours.

48
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,795
He's seen three
different specialists.

49
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,734
Interesting.

50
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,568
Almost as interesting as you
trying to step into Kutner's shoes

51
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,505
just days after he
stepped out of them.

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,703
I am not shoe shopping,

53
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,076
I'm just trying to repay a
favor to his referring doctor.

54
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,170
What's the mystery?

55
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,740
The nutcase spends all his free time
wreaking havoc at toxic waste dumps.

56
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,876
Tox screen's negative.

57
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,218
No neurological, muscular or
cardiovascular abnormalities.

58
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,780
The guy cares about the
environment, that makes him a nutcase?

59
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,291
He's a single guy in his 20s,

60
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,793
he cares about getting
his hybrid waxed by girls

61
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,039
who care about the environment.

62
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,089
See? Not a nutcase.

63
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,743
He's probably just faking
so he can sue the cops

64
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,877
and get a six-figure settlement.

65
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,245
If he was trying
to fake an illness,

66
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,501
why would he consent to be seen by
the best diagnostician in the country?

67
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,599
Now look who's trying
to get her hybrid waxed.

68
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,974
We need to do a
vestibular caloric test,

69
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,741
see if the balance problem
starts above or below the neck.

70
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,477
And when I say "we," I mean you.

71
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,143
You're the one with a
favor to repay, not them.

72
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,493
I'm going to be injecting
ice-water in your ear canal.

73
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,757
If the resulting eye
movements are at all erratic,

74
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,528
then the balance
problem's in your inner ear.

75
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,830
Those in every room?

76
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,098
I think so.

77
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,131
Can you get rid of them?
Preferably from every room?

78
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,303
They use over 30 pesticides
to grow commercial flowers.

79
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,022
You'd think the medical
industry would be a lot more...

80
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,275
Concerned with medicine?

81
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,873
Let's fix your body, then you
can go back to fixing the Earth.

82
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,194
This is gonna get a
little uncomfortable.

83
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,346
I just spent 14 hours
chained to a tire.

84
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,853
Most doctors would recommend...

85
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,686
Our planet's headed
for destruction.

86
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,624
Coastlines underwater,
a million species extinct.

87
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,460
Whoa! Feels like I'm
tumbling head over heels.

88
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,090
It's normal. Sometimes
this test causes vertigo

89
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,569
and nausea.

90
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,532
Cameron just brought me a case.

91
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,669
Cameron is happy in the ER.

92
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,737
There's no way she wants her
nose back on your grindstone.

93
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,579
Egg-white omelet, no
bacon, whole-wheat toast.

94
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,018
I say it's not my
grindstone she's after,

95
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,885
and not her nose
she wants on it.

96
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,390
She and Chase are
practically living together.

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,458
What did you just order?

98
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,895
An omelet.

99
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,230
Since when do you
pass on the swine?

100
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,527
And wheat toast? Might as
well eat a sheet of sandpaper.

101
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,973
Yes, but I don't like eating the
same thing two days in a row.

102
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,635
Your bro's nurse not
loving the love handles?

103
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,645
I'm just not in the
mood for bacon,

104
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,272
and you are obviously trying
to avoid talking about Kutner,

105
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,819
which is odd because you spent a
whole week obsessing about why...

106
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,945
He's no longer on my team.

107
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,580
I'm sorry he's no
longer on my team.

108
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,488
There's nothing
else to talk about.

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,424
You're wearing the watch
he gave you for Secret Santa.

110
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,795
Five functions,
including a stopwatch

111
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,562
to time how long it takes
you to ask me if I'm okay.

112
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,935
You gonna order?

113
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,406
Not hungry.

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,312
It's just weird. She's
brought cases before,

115
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,973
but he's never made
her run the tests.

116
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,108
Maybe he's looking for someone
to mother him after what happened.

117
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,562
The only kind of
mothering House wants

118
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,420
involves a bullwhip, leather
diapers and a credit card.

119
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,948
Mommy's home.

120
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,662
Test made the patient lose his
lunch, but his calorics are normal,

121
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,132
his inner ear is fine and
he still can't balance himself.

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,793
How many normal
test results do we need

123
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,997
to know the patient's
a granola-filled phony?

124
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,595
He's not lying
about his symptoms.

125
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,971
And you know this because...

126
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,033
She changed her shoes.

127
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,011
If he was faking, he'd have
vomited on the other side of the bed.

128
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,879
Sparring with the police and chaining
yourself up for days can cause stress.

129
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,645
Stress screws with
the heart and arteries.

130
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,187
Carotid atherosclerosis
could cause a loss of balance.

131
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,449
Wouldn't show up on CT or MRI.

132
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,459
It could also be our only
warning before a massive stroke.

133
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,086
Do a Holter and
a carotid doppler,

134
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,996
see if his heart skips for
more than the Spotted Owl.

135
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,560
Although I didn't
say "we," if I had...

136
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,881
Sorry if this is
screwing up the test.

137
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,478
Been hiccupping a lot
lately, but not as bad as this.

138
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,683
How much is a lot?
And how long is lately?

139
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,988
It's been on and
off for about a week.

140
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,028
Maybe a few hours a day.

141
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,825
Did you tell the doctors
in Philly about it?

142
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,065
They didn't seem to
think it was any big deal.

143
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,273
Hey, so we're still leaving
tomorrow, aren't we?

144
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,605
I'm not sure.

145
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,838
The referring doctors didn't
realize that his hiccups were...

146
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,175
Hiccups?

147
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,346
With this duration and
intensity, most likely pathological,

148
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,215
and it could mean it's serious.

149
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,720
Are you avoiding me?

150
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,915
No.

151
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,889
So, I shouldn't be
at all concerned

152
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,518
that you're treating another
doctor's patient for hiccups

153
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,587
instead of going on the
vacation I spent a week planning?

154
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,699
There is a reason I need to
stay with this case a while longer,

155
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,865
but I can't tell you what it is.

156
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,742
So, you admit you lied to me,
now you're asking me to trust you.

157
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,610
Yes.

158
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,680
Okay.

159
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,094
No sign of heart
or arterial problems,

160
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,259
but he's been hiccupping
on and off for over a week.

161
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,634
Nice. I'm hooked. You can
get back to your shift at the ER,

162
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,298
except, as far as the ER is
concerned, you're on vacation, right?

163
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,104
I postponed a trip because
I'm concerned about the patient.

164
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,321
Explains why you ditched Chase
and came to the differentials,

165
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,385
not why you ran the tests.

166
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,881
You told me to.

167
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,109
Well, I'm not your boss,

168
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,261
something you usually take
great pleasure in pointing out.

169
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,312
Hey, you don't still have
the hots for me, do you?

170
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,649
I care about the patient and I care
about the people who work on your team,

171
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,284
they've been
through a lot lately.

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,454
I just thought I... Was
Florence Nightingale

173
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,774
and you're gonna nurse us back
to spiritual and mental oneness.

174
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,518
That would make sense if we were
having this conversation a week ago.

175
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,312
Think what you want,
that I'm here to get a job,

176
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,305
that I'm here to wrap
you in swaddling clothes.

177
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,537
Problem is, I think neither.
Because neither makes sense.

178
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,312
The only thing
that does, doesn't.

179
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:24,916
Pathological hiccups
plus inability to balance, go.

180
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,985
What she said.

181
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,695
Brain would connect the two.

182
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,200
It could if Cameron hadn't
already CT'd his head.

183
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,236
Empty as her
boyfriend's calendar.

184
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,271
What does this have
to do with Chase?

185
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,771
Nothing. Not sure yet.

186
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,409
Patient is on a jihad
against commercial flowers,

187
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,773
he's picketed several nurseries.

188
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,039
Organophosphate poisoning
can cause both hiccups and...

189
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,876
No GI problems,
no hypersalivation.

190
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,212
It's possible it's not
connected to a protest.

191
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,048
MS wouldn't show on the
CT, and his name is Swenson.

192
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,953
Scandinavians have an
increased susceptibility to MS.

193
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,290
Better theory than,
"He's faking it."

194
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,491
The clogs have it. Do a
lumbar puncture to confirm MS.

195
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,233
I guess we'll just continue
to twiddle our thumbs.

196
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,961
God, I hope that's a euphemism.

197
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,448
How am I supposed
to do a lumbar puncture

198
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,134
on a patient with
intractable hiccups?

199
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,405
I'm trying to figure out what
that could be a euphemism for.

200
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,210
You'll find a way.

201
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,979
You're not worried House is gonna be
pissed you're helping me do the test?

202
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,320
He said find a way, and you did.

203
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,422
How do you think House is doing?

204
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,861
That why you're here?

205
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,459
Yeah.

206
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,091
No, it isn't.

207
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,296
Even if House was messed up by
Kutner's suicide, it wouldn't matter.

208
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,465
He already thinks life is
nasty, brutish and long,

209
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,009
and misery helps
his diagnostic skills.

210
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,341
All of which you know,
so, why are you here?

211
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,438
Which answer would you believe?

212
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,746
If you want Kutner's
place, it's fine by me.

213
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,787
I could use someone else with
the stones to stand up to House.

214
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,756
But you've got to know that's gonna
blow up your relationship with Chase.

215
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,621
All I did was postpone
a three-day trip.

216
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,629
With Chase, to be with House.

217
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,790
What are you doing?

218
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,028
Ordering IV chlorpromazine.

219
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,661
This could still
be neurological.

220
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,672
You can cloud his mental status.

221
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,037
You wanna get the needle in
his spine or you wanna talk?

222
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,316
You and House been talking
about filling Kutner's slot?

223
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,356
Yeah, we went straight from
the funeral to Human Resources.

224
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,369
You interested in
getting back on the team?

225
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,862
I'm interested in knowing
if Cameron's interested.

226
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,522
She's been running all
the tests for House's case.

227
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,828
Well, she hasn't
said anything to me.

228
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,702
But I guess the referring doctor might
have asked her to keep an eye on him.

229
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,004
Do you think Cameron's
in love with House?

230
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,806
That is a ridiculous question.
She's in love with you.

231
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,342
Are you in love with House?

232
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,049
That is an even more
ridiculous question.

233
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,421
Two questions, zero answers.

234
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,919
I think I can
extrapolate from there.

235
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,243
Dr. House?

236
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,244
Sorry, I'm just the
zone delivery guy.

237
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,751
I'm Doug Swenson's wife.

238
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,388
His history said the
environmental kamikaze was single.

239
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,052
He probably didn't
want me to worry.

240
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,721
He told me he was in jail with
some of the other protesters.

241
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,389
Yeah, well, no worries there.

242
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:56,930
He's in jail a lot. Not
so often in the hospital.

243
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,802
I searched his e-mail, and I
found the referral to you yesterday.

244
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:03,274
You must really love your
husband, and travel by rickshaw.

245
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,471
Only took you 18
hours to get here.

246
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,847
Who eats kale? It's so bland
it doesn't even taste like kale.

247
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,320
I had to find somebody to
take care of our 4-year-old son.

248
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,856
Doug's all right, isn't he?

249
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,984
I have no idea.

250
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,425
I know he's an idiot,

251
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,487
and now I've learned that
he's a liar, so we're making...

252
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,033
Who told you that I was in here?

253
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,434
The doctor in the office next to
yours said that you might be here.

254
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,045
I got it figured out.

255
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,877
That mean we don't
need to do the LP?

256
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,815
I was talking to her. You're
not even supposed to be here.

257
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,318
You want us to stop or not?

258
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,322
What? I don't care
what you do with him.

259
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,358
You're not doing a
favor for a doctor in Philly,

260
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,291
you're doing a favor for an
oncologist in North Jersey.

261
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,056
I'm spying on you for Wilson?

262
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,462
Spying, pre-emptive
grief counseling...

263
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,296
Wilson sees you 10 times
more than I do, he's a better liar,

264
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,030
and he wouldn't have to
cancel a vacation to do it.

265
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,405
Good points. Also
doesn't explain the diet.

266
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,977
What does any of this
have to do with my husband?

267
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,341
Nothing.

268
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,244
Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag,
or did you keep your maiden name?

269
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,581
He's married?
Yep. Got a kid, too.

270
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,620
Double threat, eco-freak
and deadbeat dad.

271
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,746
House!

272
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,256
Sorry, parentally challenged.

273
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,518
No, his neck.

274
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,924
It's torticollis, reaction
to the chlorpromazine.

275
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,794
That's not just a
spasm, it's swollen.

276
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,693
Crunchy.

277
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,073
It's definitely not MS.

278
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,051
Crunching sounds were caused
by an air leak between his lungs.

279
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,921
The leak in his mediastinum could've
been caused by prolonged hiccups.

280
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,379
More likely it was
the neck spasm.

281
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,757
Most likely it was
there all along.

282
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,993
We just didn't notice until the
other symptoms made it worse.

283
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,351
So, what causes loss of
balance, pathological hiccups,

284
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,355
and a hole in his
Gloria Steinem?

285
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,516
He was protesting
a lumber mill last fall.

286
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,526
Sarcoid's been
linked to pine forests.

287
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,357
No, his AC levels are normal.

288
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,294
Progressive systemic sclerosis?

289
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,241
Guy practically lives
in industrial waste sites.

290
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,464
If a solvent got absorbed through his
lungs, caused an autoimmune firestorm...

291
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,472
Start him on IV methylprednisolone
for systemic sclerosis.

292
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,269
Do a full work-up to confirm.

293
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,206
By myself? Without yourself.

294
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,747
Grab a bat. Grab some pine.

295
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,248
Time to bring
in the first string.

296
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,616
Why?

297
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,318
You obviously want to be
here. I can't figure out why.

298
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,090
So I want to see where you
go when you can't be here.

299
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,383
You know what
vacation means, right?

300
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,979
You here because of House,
Chase, or overtime issues?

301
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,857
He's very concerned.
Chase, not House.

302
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,004
If it's all right with you,

303
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,497
I'd rather communicate with
Chase by communicating with Chase.

304
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,294
Are you in love with House?

305
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,199
You are not concerned about me.

306
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,744
You're marking your territory.

307
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,973
You shouldn't be
involved with House,

308
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,607
neither should I,
neither should anyone.

309
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,185
You and Chase are good
together. Don't screw it up.

310
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,624
When are you gonna stop this?

311
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,164
How can you ask me to stop?

312
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,332
You're in a hospital.
You have a son.

313
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,336
The steroids ought to get
him breathing normally again.

314
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,670
But autoimmune
diseases are serious.

315
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,108
Might not be a bad idea to
take some time at home, rest up.

316
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,375
I can't just quit.

317
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,108
Do you hate us that much?

318
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,119
I love you, and I love our son.

319
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,387
But why should he matter
more than everyone else's?

320
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,124
He does.

321
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,285
Why?

322
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,288
Because he's biologically
connected to me?

323
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,629
There's no rational reason.

324
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,126
He's our son.

325
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,700
And he's going to need to drink
clean water and breathe clean air.

326
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,108
I'm doing this for him, too.

327
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,917
Come on in, House.

328
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,586
Because who else is it
going to be at 10:30 at night?

329
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,754
And, no, thanks, I already ate.

330
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,355
I didn't ask you to dinner.

331
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,797
But you were going to.

332
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,425
And when I explained
that I'd eaten hours ago,

333
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,097
you were going to move
on to your real entree,

334
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,003
rifling through my kitchen.

335
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,936
Hmm.

336
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,277
Inviting me to
search your kitchen.

337
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,009
Means you know
that I'd find nothing,

338
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,983
or you know that
I'd find something,

339
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,282
so you're hoping that I'm gonna assume
the former and I won't bother to look.

340
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:20,653
Or it means it's
late, I'm tired,

341
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,286
I know you're here to
advance some paranoid theory

342
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,196
based on a single egg-white
omelet, and I'd like to get it over with

343
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,493
so we can both go to sleep.

344
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,057
Your single-omelet theory

345
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,900
conveniently overlooks the
grassy knoll you had for lunch today,

346
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,236
a vegetable and
grain gag-a-thon.

347
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,678
The Warren Commission found
no evidence of a second lunch,

348
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,475
possibly because it was
stolen from the doctors' lounge.

349
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,516
You're not getting any fatter,

350
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,676
your medical records were clean.

351
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,117
You checked my...

352
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,418
You're alone
tonight, so it's Kutner.

353
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,756
How could Kutner
have any conceivable...

354
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,921
Your patients live,
your patients die,

355
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,193
you float above it all
like a medical colossus.

356
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,666
But a fellow doctor dies...

357
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,895
That's brilliant.

358
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,767
Kutner was a wake-up call
that if I didn't eat healthier,

359
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,864
I might kill myself.

360
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,909
Mortality is mortality.

361
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,906
And ice cream is ice cream.

362
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:20,612
Full-fat content.
Quadruple-fat content.

363
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,850
Stuff you haven't eaten just
proves you haven't eaten it.

364
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,953
You were hoping for
evidence of stuff I have eaten?

365
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,122
First door on the right.

366
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,367
Excruciating
pain in his left leg.

367
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,066
Acute onset, about
10 minutes ago.

368
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,904
What are you doing to him?

369
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,407
I assume they were
checking for vascular pulsation.

370
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,415
Either it's negative
or he's a big wuss.

371
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,212
It's not a tumor or an aneurysm.

372
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,451
Metabolic bone disease?

373
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,715
Bone density's normal.

374
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,950
But the bone
covering might not be.

375
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,550
If it's osteomyelitis, an infection
eating away at his periosteum...

376
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,426
Explains the pain. Odds
are it's a subclinical infection

377
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,417
that we made worse with
the steroids we gave him.

378
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,796
Start him on IV antibiotics, x-ray
his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.

379
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,168
Cameron's already done a
full set of lower body x-rays.

380
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,341
Infection obviously
flared, do them again.

381
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,940
Even if I had changed my diet,

382
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,472
what possible reason could
I have for hiding it from you?

383
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,160
Ankle, tibia, fibula,
all look normal.

384
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,856
No inflammation,
no signs of osteo.

385
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,158
<i>Hang in there,
we're almost done.</i>

386
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,905
You and your wife,
you talk about stuff?

387
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,373
Sex.

388
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,943
No. Anything else.

389
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,239
Money.

390
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,516
I'm gonna go way
out on a limb here.

391
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,108
Foreman not a Chatty Cathy?

392
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:04,055
Normally, it doesn't
matter. Last week, it did.

393
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,786
You want to date men, good
chance talking won't be...

394
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,133
His femur's fractured.

395
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,467
That's impossible. It's the
hardest bone in the body.

396
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,369
And he broke it lying in bed.

397
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,381
How can you have a broken
femur without so much as a bruise?

398
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,544
Whatever broke it
had to do it from within.

399
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,451
Osteogenesis imperfecta?

400
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,079
Brittle bones wouldn't
cause hiccups,

401
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,556
plus we'd have seen
abnormal coloring in the sclerae.

402
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,093
Which leaves cancer.

403
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,094
Since when does bone
cancer cause hiccups?

404
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,857
Which means it's a bone cancer.

405
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,899
Or it's not cancer.

406
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,294
House is right. It'd be hard to
find a guy outside Chernobyl

407
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,428
who'd been exposed
to more carcinogens,

408
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,973
pesticide plants,
nuclear waste sites.

409
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,508
Tell Chase to repair the break.

410
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,307
You two prep him for chemo.

411
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,252
You want to blast him with chemo for
a cancer we don't even know he has?

412
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:07,116
No. I want to blast him with chemo for
a cancer that explains the symptoms.

413
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,556
Intramedullary nail.

414
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,287
Hold on.

415
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,957
That your House imitation?
Some late-breaking epiphany?

416
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,230
Just need you to get a bone
biopsy before you insert the pin.

417
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,327
For a broken leg?

418
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,168
House is prepping him for chemo.

419
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,267
Thought it might be worth checking for
cancer before pumping him full of poison.

420
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,834
Does Cameron agree with House?

421
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,744
Cameron's not on
the case anymore.

422
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,375
Oh.

423
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,292
Still enjoying
your day off, I see.

424
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,849
Why are you prepping
him for chemo?

425
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,488
The more interesting
question is, why do you care?

426
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,122
You're not even
sure that it's...

427
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,463
What I mean is, why
do you care from here?

428
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,978
You can monitor the
patient from home.

429
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,413
What's the difference
between here and home?

430
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,372
You're not at my home.

431
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,672
This has nothing to do with...

432
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,208
Any other differences?

433
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,534
Hmm.

434
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,341
There's less medical
equipment, more training bras,

435
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,280
and more Vegemite sandwiches.

436
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,046
Actually, technically,
right now Chase is here,

437
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,996
but that's because I called
him and you didn't know that,

438
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,152
and it's irrelevant to my point,
which is you and Chase are over.

439
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,195
You are wrong.

440
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,255
You decided that his single drawer
of clothes is one drawer too many.

441
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,643
But you don't have
the guts to tell him,

442
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:34,038
so you're emotionally walking away
instead of actually walking away,

443
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,303
which is stupid because only
one of those is good for your heart.

444
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,811
He's gonna ask me to marry him.

445
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,216
I was looking for some
thick socks, found the ring.

446
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,692
And you want to say no.

447
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,733
So I circle right back to his
single drawer of clothes...

448
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,564
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want him to ask.

449
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,869
Not now.

450
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,103
Kutner... We're all
a little freaked out.

451
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,573
We go home, we just
want to hug someone.

452
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,117
We just want to know
everything's gonna be okay.

453
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,956
I don't want him to propose
just because he's scared.

454
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,054
Oh.

455
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,938
She's got a headache, fever,
she's completely exhausted.

456
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,771
Tell him about
your chest, honey.

457
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,573
Her breasts are really tender.

458
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,847
You guys have a hot tub?

459
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,009
No.

460
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,361
So you must go to the gym a lot?

461
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,614
Not in years.

462
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,384
But maybe when you travel
on business, you zip on down

463
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,222
to that complimentary hotel spa.

464
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,386
No.

465
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,862
Sorry, did you just say yes?

466
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,558
What the hell is wrong with her?

467
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Got a minute?

468
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,432
He doesn't. What's
wrong with her?

469
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,137
Sorry, I'm sure she's
got a medical crisis,

470
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,801
and I need more time to figure out
some leading questions for your wife.

471
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,146
What's going on with Cameron?

472
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,182
She doesn't want back on my team,
and she doesn't want to jump me.

473
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,544
Okay.

474
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,917
What?

475
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:34,183
You ask a question, I rule out two
possibilities, and you're satisfied?

476
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,357
That means you
don't want an answer,

477
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,160
you just wanted to know
there wasn't a particular answer.

478
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,310
Either you were worried that
she wanted back on my team

479
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,826
or you were worried
she wanted back on me.

480
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,872
This isn't a
medical crisis, is it?

481
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,707
Could be. A lot of STDs
hang in the balance.

482
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,116
I give up. Vinegar
compresses four times a day.

483
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,188
Any chance I could
just leave it at that?

484
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,020
No. Pseudomonas folliculitis.

485
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,326
It's a skin infection from crowded
and contaminated hot tubs,

486
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,799
which you obviously use,
but not with your husband.

487
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,463
Tried to help a sister out.

488
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,176
The nuclei were
all normal-sized,

489
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,341
bone cells are
well-differentiated.

490
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,384
No dysplasia means no cancer.

491
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,817
That's good, isn't it?

492
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:37,948
We hope so, although it also means we
still have no idea what caused the break.

493
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,655
How does it feel?

494
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,023
It hurts.

495
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,397
Is it supposed
to look like that?

496
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,730
No, but it's probably just
residual bleeding from the surgery.

497
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,429
We should be able to...

498
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,273
Need two units
of FFP, right away.

499
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,640
Oh, my God. What's happening?

500
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,804
He's bleeding out.

501
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,350
Means it's gotta be cancer.

502
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,718
It's gotta be, except it's not.
The biopsy was negative.

503
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,723
Biopsies can be
wrong, symptoms can't.

504
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,659
All signs point to cancer, but you
can't blast a cancer you can't find.

505
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:19,755
Sure you can. Prep him
for total-body irradiation.

506
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,993
You do realize that's insane.

507
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,229
Not unless you think the cancer's
cleverly hiding outside his body.

508
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,748
Steroids already weakened
his immune system.

509
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,503
That much radiation will kill
him before it kills the cancer.

510
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,634
And if he doesn't have
cancer, we could cause one,

511
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,473
or destroy his immune
system altogether.

512
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,056
The guy could die
from an infected toenail.

513
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,481
So you'd rather do nothing,
just let him die on his own?

514
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,176
I'd rather make
his cancer worse.

515
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,316
Give him insulin-like growth factor,
make any tumor or malignancy grow.

516
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,053
Grows big enough,
we can find it.

517
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,822
That's like pouring
gasoline on a fire.

518
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,261
At least total-body irradiation
is an actual treatment.

519
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,601
His idea is better. Pour away.

520
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,017
I've lost my mojo.

521
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,887
Have you retraced your steps?

522
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,868
Does your cleaning lady
check your pockets before...

523
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:25,023
I was clueless about Kutner,
I was wrong about Cameron,

524
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,858
Taub just came up with an idea that I
should have seen long before he did.

525
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,494
No one saw anything
coming with Kutner,

526
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,971
you hardly ever see
Cameron anymore,

527
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:38,067
and you hired Taub to come up with
ideas that you wouldn't have come up with.

528
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,645
And I have no idea
why you're eating carrots.

529
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,873
Good.

530
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,914
I'm losing my mind, all
you got to say is, "Good"?

531
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:48,817
House, a guy you worked with
for two years, who you mentored,

532
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,483
and, yes, possibly even cared
about, just blew his brains out.

533
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,825
You can't find the reason,
can't find the meaning in it,

534
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,260
because sometimes
there isn't any.

535
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,424
Sometimes this is all there is.

536
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,162
You should be losing it.

537
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,966
You'd be crazy not
to be off your game.

538
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,030
But your mojo's
right where you left it.

539
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,602
Just keep playing with it.

540
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,671
I gotta go. Help yourself.

541
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,750
I know this is a tough process.

542
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,413
At the first sign of any
tumors or masses we can...

543
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,355
Start saying prayers?

544
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,905
It's gonna be okay. Once we
can... No, it is not gonna be okay.

545
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,588
You're growing his cancer.

546
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,597
This isn't the doctors' fault.

547
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:38,028
I've exposed myself to a lot
of bad stuff. I knew the risks.

548
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,365
I want my life to
mean something,

549
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,309
and if that means
I'm destined to...

550
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,610
He's in V-tach, and no
pulse. Grab the paddles.

551
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:53,947
Oh, God.

552
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,823
Charging. Clear.

553
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,587
Charging. Clear.

554
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,265
I've been looking for you.

555
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,426
And I've been
thinking about you.

556
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,799
Just hadn't reached
the looking stage yet.

557
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,398
Which is the problem.

558
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,405
You asked for a
day, I gave you two.

559
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,281
You told me you had a secret
you couldn't share, I respected that.

560
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,648
Now I don't know what's worse,

561
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,812
blowing off our vacation
to hang around House,

562
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,355
or continuing to blow it off
when he won't hang around you.

563
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,167
If you think I'm the least
bit interested in House...

564
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,626
I don't know what
I'm supposed to think.

565
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,988
I know this looks bad and...

566
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't care how it
looks, I care what it is.

567
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,467
And you're not
telling me what it is.

568
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,835
I'm trying to trust you, but...

569
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,503
I just...

570
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,977
I need a little more time.

571
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,077
No.

572
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:09,518
This has nothing
to do with House.

573
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:14,862
Yeah, well, it has nothing to
do with me either, not anymore.

574
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,703
Let me know when I can
come pick up my things.

575
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,765
Nothing on the echo.
We drew a troponin level,

576
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,592
no signs of myocardial ischemia.

577
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,824
All the tests were normal.

578
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,202
Loss of balance, pathological
hiccups, air leak between the lungs,

579
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,364
broken femur, now
tachycardia. Go.

580
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,411
Come on, give me
something. Give me a bad idea,

581
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,379
maybe I can turn
it into a good one.

582
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:13,448
Fine. Open him up,
put in a defibrillator.

583
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,016
That's permanent and risky.

584
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,338
We don't even know what, if
anything, is wrong with his heart.

585
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,591
Redo all the tests.

586
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,361
In the meantime, open
him up, put in a defibrillator,

587
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,233
so he can live long enough
for you to finish the tests.

588
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:43,747
Balance organs, nerves,
lungs, bones, heart.

589
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,825
Things you use
to make bratwurst?

590
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,556
There's no sign of infection,

591
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,395
it's not a metabolic or
autoimmune disease.

592
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:57,095
It's definitely not
cancer. I think.

593
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,466
Definitely not cancer.

594
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,973
Aren't you gonna pick?

595
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,033
I'm thinking. Is
there a ticking clock?

596
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,776
You already put your money in.

597
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,112
You never do that
until you decide.

598
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,343
That's very observant of you.

599
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,911
Too bad you distracted me. Now
I'm thinking I might change my mind.

600
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,221
There's nothing
healthy in that machine.

601
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,058
No, there's not.

602
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:32,701
Gummi Bears. You
hate Gummi Bears.

603
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,198
People can change.

604
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,606
No.

605
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,440
And more importantly,
I hate them.

606
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,276
Oh, fine. Then I
won't offer you any.

607
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,275
You manipulative bitch.

608
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,548
You're not suddenly eating
healthy because you want to.

609
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,820
You're eating healthy because
you know I don't want to.

610
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:58,022
I've been mooching
food for 10 years,

611
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,032
so either something started
bothering you this week or you're...

612
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,570
Screwing with you.
It needed to be done.

613
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,137
After Amber died, I withdrew,
tried to change everything,

614
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,076
hoping I'd sort it out,
find some deeper truth.

615
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,737
It was a mistake.

616
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,009
I should have gone back
to normal, to here and now.

617
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,483
Because that's all we
can ever really count on.

618
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,380
Things need to get
back to normal in your life.

619
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,653
And what could be more
normal than me screwing with you,

620
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,388
and you figuring it out?

621
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,653
You manipulative bitch.

622
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,113
We need to put in a
cardioverter defibrillator.

623
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,210
It'll keep your heart beating
while we keep looking.

624
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,413
What does that mean?

625
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,458
It means, even if
we figure this out,

626
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,756
you'll have to stop protesting
anywhere not near a hospital.

627
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:09,799
Hi. Got a few questions.

628
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,267
We're about to start doing...

629
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,396
A hopefully pointless
medical procedure.

630
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,567
Your life and my mojo
hang in the balance.

631
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:22,410
Pesticides are evil, which means that
commercial flowers are doused in evil,

632
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,609
but plant life is
nature's answer to evil.

633
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,114
So you have a garden.

634
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,087
No. We live in an apartment.

635
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,352
A window box then?

636
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,552
No.

637
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,654
Potted plants?

638
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:38,973
Nothing. The
commercial growers...

639
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,795
Yeah, they're
evil. Yeah, got it.

640
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,926
House, I really don't
think we have time for this.

641
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,503
Your marriage sucks.

642
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,108
Thank you.

643
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,304
All marriages suck.
Your marriage sucks.

644
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,075
No. I love her.

645
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,174
He loves a tree in Oregon
more than he loves you,

646
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,753
but he can't have sex with it.

647
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,187
Unless it's that slutty
oak outside Portland.

648
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,190
You want to get to your point?

649
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,520
She's had enough.

650
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,618
She's gonna leave, maybe
she's just not putting out, whatever.

651
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,823
You gotta make it
right. Right away.

652
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,424
You gotta compromise
that precious flower principle.

653
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,931
Never.

654
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:22,565
Once.

655
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,381
Three weeks ago.
Our anniversary.

656
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,043
I missed the dinner
to be at that rally.

657
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:37,054
You planned it for months.
You were mad, really mad.

658
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:41,920
I bought you flowers.
I brought them home.

659
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,360
You were gone, so
was your suitcase.

660
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,859
I tossed them, bought
you the earrings.

661
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,229
Roses?

662
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,129
Yes.

663
00:37:55,206 --> 00:38:00,338
You have sporotrichosis. It's an
infection from the thorn of the rose,

664
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,348
which by any other name
is still a cheap marital aid.

665
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,974
The flowers are what gave me...

666
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,849
Lesion on your eighth cranial
nerve knocks out your balance,

667
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,913
another on your phrenic
nerve gives you serial hiccups.

668
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,254
We then spread it to your
bones and heart with steroids

669
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,226
and insulin-like growth factor.

670
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,319
Please tell us that
this is good news.

671
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,197
It's good news for him, it's
good news for future generations.

672
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,397
It's crappy news for
you. He's gonna be fine.

673
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,100
And he'll never
doubt himself again.

674
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,773
There you go.

675
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,619
Damn. I was hoping
to interrupt something.

676
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,457
Your favor's repaid,
patient's cured.

677
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,964
He's already packing for another
Earth Day extravaganza next week.

678
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,900
He almost died. He can't take a
few days at home with his family?

679
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:02,270
People only change after a trauma if
they wanted to change before the trauma.

680
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,276
Or if they've watched too
many After School Specials.

681
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,504
You talking about Chase?

682
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,944
I'm talking about you.

683
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:12,914
You lost husband number one, no
surprise that the death of a colleague

684
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:16,113
would make you question
another long-term lease.

685
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,485
You teaching commitment classes?

686
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,233
'Cause I thought you were
too busy with your lecture...

687
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,835
I'm sure that was
going to be hysterical.

688
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,169
Let me just give
you the Cliff Notes.

689
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,527
Don't try to dump him
by dumping cases on me.

690
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,657
I told you, I never
wanted to dump Chase.

691
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,133
Absolutely. You
wanted him to dump you.

692
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,933
It's totally different,
much less guilt.

693
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:37,169
Either way, you're out
of reasons to avoid him.

694
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,875
Kutner was a pretty
dumb one to begin with.

695
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,488
I should never have
postponed our vacation.

696
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,693
I should never have planned it.

697
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,499
I found the ring in your sock.

698
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,703
I didn't want you to propose out
of some sort of knee-jerk reaction

699
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,300
to what happened to Kutner.

700
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,459
Well, I guess you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

701
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:19,974
I'm not. I...

702
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,149
I don't care how it happens,
I just want it to happen.

703
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,660
Are you proposing to me?

704
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,763
I'm proposing that

705
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,431
you propose to me.

706
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:45,343
After I broke up with you? After
you ruined my planned proposal?

707
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,434
You expect me to...

708
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,207
I'm not expecting.

709
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,716
I'm hoping.

710
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,605
Yes.

711
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,372
Solved another case,

712
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,541
busted Wilson.

713
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:06,647
Looks like you're
not losing it after all.
