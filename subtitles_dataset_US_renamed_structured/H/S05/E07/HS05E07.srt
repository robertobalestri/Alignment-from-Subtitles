1
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,107
He's got a good pulse.

2
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,963
Maintain head stabilization
and flip him over.

3
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,763
On my count, guys. Ready? Go.

4
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,371
Sir, we're paramedics.

5
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,969
The mailman saw
you having a seizure.

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,378
We had to break down your door.

7
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,611
You know what your name is?

8
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:57,447
On my count,
one, two, three, up.

9
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,728
We're taking you
to the hospital.

10
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,803
I can't. No, I
can't. No, I can't...

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,536
Hey, buddy, buddy,
we're trying to help.

12
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,414
Sir. Stay out of my house.

13
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,947
You just had a seizure, you could
have a stroke, a bleed in your brain.

14
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,151
Leave me alone.

15
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,228
35-year-old male, crushing headache,
and three seizures in the last two days.

16
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,562
So it's a bleed, a clot, a
tumor, metabolic or infection.

17
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,363
Stick him in the
CT and... Can't.

18
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,595
I'm assuming he
has a giant head.

19
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,470
Severe agoraphobe. The
world scares the hell out of him.

20
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,907
So we can only test him with
whatever we can take to him.

21
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,468
Fun. The agoraphobia a symptom?

22
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,979
Only of being shot.

23
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,525
He and his girlfriend were mugged
seven years ago. It's when it started.

24
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,314
Anybody can hate
humanity after getting shot.

25
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,963
It takes a big man
to hate it beforehand.

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,354
How did you get this case,
if he didn't come to the ER?

27
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,858
I talked to him through his
door when he had flu last year.

28
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,791
I run the Community
Outreach Program now.

29
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,160
See? Perfectly
reasonable explanation.

30
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,893
She's definitely not here trying
to work her way back on the team

31
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,264
and steal your job or anything.

32
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,769
It's a legitimate question.
He agreed to meet with us.

33
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,896
But even if I can
get inside his house,

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,803
his brain is a black box.

35
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,405
We can pick this up in a minute.

36
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,741
What's this? Takeout menus.

37
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,359
But I'm hoping you'll come
up with a better answer

38
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,648
when everyone asks
what we're talking about.

39
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,555
Last night... Forget it.

40
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,023
I know this is awkward,
but we need to talk.

41
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,584
There's a reason that we've
evolved the feeling of awkwardness.

42
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,324
It tells us not to
talk about things.

43
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,923
I was emotional because of
the adoption falling through,

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,334
and you actually let your
human side show for a moment.

45
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,201
That is why we kissed.

46
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:29,175
I just want to say thank
you for not taking advantage.

47
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:34,643
You're welcome. Any time you
want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.

48
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,821
Portable equipment can't distinguish
a bleed or a tumor, can't see vasculitis.

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,515
What did Cuddy want?

50
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:47,057
I kind of hit that last night,
so now she's all on my jock.

51
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,687
Wow. She looks pretty
good for someone on roofies.

52
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,358
The only equipment we have is
a sonogram and a portable x-ray.

53
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,699
What part of "olivine, pyroxene
and amphibole" don't you understand?

54
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,467
Pyroxene? "Pyro" means "fire."

55
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,303
They're indicator minerals.

56
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,854
You can't see diamonds, so
you look for the indicator minerals.

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,280
I assume the diamond is the
tumor or bleed or whatever it is.

58
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,748
Provoke a seizure.

59
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,275
The indicator is the increased electrical
activity focused around the abnormality.

60
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,219
We do an EEG, see the focus,

61
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,452
see where the problem is,
which tells us what the problem is.

62
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:22,485
The Formster and the
Camster, kicking it old school.

63
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,396
Thank God she's not
trying to steal your job.

64
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,367
Go do it, and search
the home for toxins.

65
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,602
I agreed to talk,
not to let you in.

66
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,105
You could be very sick.

67
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,041
We need access.
I'm just not ready.

68
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,543
Why does he have
two locked doors?

69
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,409
He must use this
room as an airlock.

70
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,176
Deliveries in, garbage out,
he never has to go outside.

71
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,185
Just tell us when you
are. We're not going away.

72
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,892
Seriously? THIRTEEN:
You want her to admit

73
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,890
that all he has to do is ignore us
for a few minutes and we'll take off?

74
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,948
He was shot, girlfriend killed.

75
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,836
He probably has
post-traumatic stress disorder.

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,659
He doesn't believe in a just
universe, he doesn't trust anyone.

77
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,198
Give him some honesty.

78
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,845
I shouldn't have
implied we'd wait forever.

79
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,670
We've got a whole hospital full of
patients. We can give you a few minutes,

80
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,541
but eventually, if you don't let
us in we're going to have to leave.

81
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,604
Just one person comes in.

82
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,083
No, we've got to search
the whole house for toxins.

83
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,884
How about I examine you in one room,
and my colleagues will do the search?

84
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,860
I'm going to try to
provoke a seizure.

85
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,833
I need you to look
straight ahead, okay?

86
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,959
Yeah.

87
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,631
Are you all right?
Yeah, I just...

88
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,401
I haven't been in a room
with anyone for a while.

89
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,002
Okay, can you just
give me a second? Sure.

90
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,206
Okay.

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,580
You're the person I talked to
through the door last year, right?

92
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,916
Yeah. You were nice.

93
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:59,660
And smart. Kind of made
me expect someone older.

94
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,126
I'm not that young.

95
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:09,029
Must have been scary being
shot. Don't do that. Okay.

96
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,900
You don't know me.

97
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,208
I've got everything I want here.

98
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,073
I make a lot of money
writing tech manuals.

99
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,942
I get stuff
delivered. I work out.

100
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:25,413
I see anything I want over
the Web. I'm happy here.

101
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,918
You don't seem very
happy. Right now I'm not.

102
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,492
Go away.

103
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,301
Did you speak to Cuddy
last night? She's fine.

104
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,000
Why would it take anyone more than a
few hours to get over misplacing a baby?

105
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,473
You spoke to her?

106
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,146
Kind of hit that, so
she's all on my jock.

107
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,976
What?

108
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,486
Huh!

109
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,520
Everyone else
thought I was kidding.

110
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,789
You "hit"? Like making
out or full-on sex or...

111
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,831
I've got a chart laid out with all
the bases, I'll take you through it.

112
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,594
What are you going
to do? What can I do?

113
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,568
I'm gonna ignore her
for the rest of my life.

114
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,797
This mosquito bite
kept me awake...

115
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,271
Don't care about the bug bite.

116
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,736
She's your boss.

117
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,743
So now I have two
reasons to ignore her.

118
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,948
It was just a kiss.

119
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,280
There's a reason... Yes,
those large things in her bra.

120
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,617
You were hiding it from me.
Means it meant something to you.

121
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:38,489
Yeah, I fiendishly concealed
it within the phrase "I hit that."

122
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,117
Stop scratching,
you'll draw blood.

123
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,185
Finally, you said
something useful.

124
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,959
I'm just gonna break the
skin and let the poison out.

125
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:51,161
If you dated Cuddy,
there would...

126
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,832
Sorry, I get better reception
when you're not here.

127
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,253
What do you got? <i>TAUB:
His place is totally clean.</i>

128
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,805
No animals. No hidden drugs
or alcohol. No lead in the paint.

129
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,508
And since you're
not breathing hard,

130
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,519
I assume you're not holding Cameron
aloft in triumph, which means no seizures.

131
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:12,858
Hey, speaking of breathing hard...
Cameron, you engaged to Chase yet?

132
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,103
Sorry, we should have clarified.

133
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,405
We're calling about the patient,
not Dr. Cameron's love life.

134
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,522
We aren't engaged.

135
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,942
Moves things along much faster
if you just give him the answers.

136
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,477
Seizures can also
be induced through...

137
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,766
After six years?
A year-and-a-half.

138
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,635
Through sleep deprivation or...

139
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,697
Sleep deprivation
would take too long.

140
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,107
You living together? We
spend most nights together.

141
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,340
There's a bunch of drugs that
can lower a seizure threshold.

142
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,008
And cloud the diagnosis
with side effects.

143
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,880
His place or
yours? His, usually.

144
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,495
Interesting. You would
have said "interesting"

145
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,851
no matter what the answer.

146
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,832
And no matter what the answer,
it would have been interesting.

147
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,189
<i>No engagement,
commitment issues.</i>

148
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:50,026
His place, control issues. Not
sure whose, but, interesting.

149
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,962
Yeah, moves much
faster this way.

150
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,678
Where was the patient
when he had his first seizure?

151
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,171
In his entry hallway,
getting his mail.

152
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,673
And getting close
to the outdoors.

153
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,767
It spooked him, raised
his BP. Now use that fear.

154
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,970
Bring him outside.

155
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,476
He punched out a fireman.

156
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,037
<i>We're doctors, not bouncers.</i>

157
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,645
Okay. So bring
the outside to him.

158
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,345
Floor's genuine wood.

159
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,550
Why are they here?

160
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,994
They overheard me announce
the half-price bank foreclosure

161
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,589
in the ER waiting room.
Where is everybody?

162
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,966
Cameron's with the patient,
everybody else went home.

163
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:34,303
Because they don't need to be
here. Neither do you, and yet you are.

164
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,236
This way.

165
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,442
Moldings original? Original?
They were here before the house.

166
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,018
The shut-in is also original.

167
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,653
Come on, don't be shy.
House, get them out of here.

168
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,888
Easy for you to say, you're not going
to be making some serious capital gains.

169
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,293
This is cruel.

170
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,059
And leaving him
undiagnosed is what, altruistic?

171
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,635
Procedure worked. He's seizing.

172
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,728
What do you see?

173
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,137
Normal theta, normal delta.

174
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,401
This isn't a seizure.

175
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,001
It's something.

176
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,802
Mr. Nozick, are you okay?

177
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,711
My stomach. It's killing me.

178
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,942
See? It's something.

179
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,706
Partial small bowel obstruction.

180
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,428
Blockage explains the pain. What
explains the blockage plus seizures?

181
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,231
Atrial fibrillation
throwing emboli.

182
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,793
Crohn's causing an abscess.

183
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,533
It could be a million things.

184
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,303
There's no way to know unless
we get him in for an MRI on his head,

185
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,072
or exploratory surgery so
we can biopsy his bowels,

186
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,977
which he won't
let us do. Wouldn't.

187
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,082
Pain changes things.

188
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,680
House.

189
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,488
He told you to stay out of here.

190
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,459
He can chase me out once
he's done doubling up in agony.

191
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:06,122
Whatever your big problem is has
caused a complication we call "colon FOS."

192
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,261
"F-O", "full of," since we're in
mixed company, "S" is "stool."

193
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,602
Nothing is coming out, so the
pain's gonna get worse and worse.

194
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,801
So we need to stick a
pooper scooper in you.

195
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,741
We also need to take
a look at your bowel.

196
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,176
I made my wishes clear.

197
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,805
Uh-huh. And, see, if the
Crazy Fairy were here,

198
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,974
she could grant them.

199
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,584
I'm not insane. I feel
pain when I go outside,

200
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,317
so it's rational
to avoid that pain.

201
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,188
Except now you're
feeling pain inside.

202
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,988
Well, not as bad. Nowhere near.

203
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,538
We can give him
drugs for the blockage.

204
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,962
If it doesn't work

205
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,558
that blockage will rupture your intestines
and spew sewage throughout your body.

206
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,196
Whatever you're scared of out
there, aren't you more scared of death?

207
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,435
You, obviously,
can't stand people.

208
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,138
But for me, it's
worse. All right?

209
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,909
I'd rather die in here
than live out there.

210
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,686
If you don't mind floppy
hair and an annoying accent,

211
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,455
I know a surgeon who
will operate in your home.

212
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,657
Thank you.

213
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,360
With the risk of infection,
Chase won't actually...

214
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:22,375
He's not gonna do surgery
in some crazy dude's house.

215
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,308
You just said... What I said was

216
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,243
that Chase would put
him under at the house.

217
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,357
We take him to the hospital,
open him up, do our thing,

218
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,301
then slip him back into
his room for the post-op,

219
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,842
without him ever finding
out that we tricked him.

220
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,012
So, that was implied.

221
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,298
It's unethical. He'll be asleep.

222
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,382
He gets to make his own
calls, even if he's asleep.

223
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,017
Why are you siding with him?

224
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:45,494
Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes
broken people because her husband died,

225
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,675
and since Chase
isn't all that broken...

226
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,777
Hey, why don't we operate on
his infarcted leg while we're at it?

227
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,599
Who cares if he said no?

228
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,615
I was risking my life to
avoid becoming a cripple,

229
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,074
he's doing it to avoid
sunlight and fresh air.

230
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,173
We've got to make it look good.

231
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,087
I know I'm a pain in the ass.

232
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,624
I know it would have been
easy just to walk away,

233
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,360
but you're a good person.

234
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,166
Count down from 10.

235
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,880
Ten, nine,

236
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,211
eight...

237
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,217
Let's go.

238
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,464
How you doing? Better.

239
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,632
Great.

240
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,907
Everything else good?

241
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,043
Everything involving me
kissing House is good.

242
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,015
Oh, God, you dragged it
out of me, you're a genius.

243
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,347
It's no big deal.

244
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,855
I was feeling vulnerable, he's
a friend, and I leaned on him.

245
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,288
It's funny. I've leaned
on friends in the past.

246
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,921
Never leaned so far my
tongue fell into their mouths.

247
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,657
I don't think of House
that way. I never have.

248
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,035
Why not?

249
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,131
You know exactly
how it would go.

250
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,537
It would start off exciting,

251
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,068
we'd get caught up in the novelty
and the hostility and the forbiddenness,

252
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:44,311
and then we'd realize that
the flirty hostility is just hostility,

253
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,548
his inability to open
up is no longer exciting,

254
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,682
it's just frustrating, and
then it's the inevitable blow up

255
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,593
and the recriminations, and
we don't talk for two months.

256
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:03,092
Yeah. Well, it certainly proves you've
never thought about House that way.

257
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,304
I get your point.

258
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,413
I will be more careful with
my tongue in the future.

259
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,704
That's not my point.

260
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:16,779
Maybe novelty and hostility and
forbiddenness doesn't have to end bad.

261
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,585
Got to go.

262
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,727
What time you done?

263
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,938
Thought we could try that new
sushi place next to my house.

264
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,863
Why don't we stay
at my house tonight?

265
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,126
But we always stay at mine.

266
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,465
That's what I mean. We
used to split, what happened?

267
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,062
I don't know, I'm closer
to work. By five minutes.

268
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,836
And my house doesn't look like it
was decorated by a drunk rugby player.

269
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,969
Well, we can discuss
it. I hadn't really...

270
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,536
Why does it have to be a
discussion? Can't you just stay over?

271
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,250
You do know they page me when that
much surgical equipment is signed out.

272
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,054
He didn't consent.

273
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,199
He consented to the surgery.

274
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,567
You think he's going
to sue over where?

275
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,591
He won't even know where.

276
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,004
He'll wake up in his house, he won't
know a thing about what happened.

277
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,588
Until he catches a post-surgical
infection in his dirty apartment

278
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,725
and finds out we tricked him
and winds up owning the hospital.

279
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,933
Why aren't you arguing with her?

280
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,403
Because she's right.

281
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,051
I don't care where he gets
the post-op, just that he gets it.

282
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,075
Keep him here.

283
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,878
House?

284
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,148
You okay?

285
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,621
Yes, we don't need to talk.

286
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,021
Your hand.

287
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,719
That's weird. I usually don't
get the stigmata until Easter.

288
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,898
Please tell Dr. Chase the
patient's ready for him now.

289
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,914
Stewart, wake up.
It's Dr. Cameron.

290
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,119
If you can hear me, blink.

291
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,223
We were concerned for your safety,
so we brought you to the hospital.

292
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,132
No, it's okay.

293
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,567
No, it's okay. Why'd you...

294
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,981
I just wanted to
keep you informed.

295
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,650
I didn't want you to have a bad shock
while you're recovering from surgery.

296
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,151
I got to get out of
here. It's okay, Stewart.

297
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,009
Calm down. Calm down. Stewart.

298
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,056
Stewart, I'm going to sedate
you. I got to get out of here.

299
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,878
I'm gonna sedate you.

300
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,383
No!

301
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,649
Calm down. I need some help in
here. Damn it, somebody get in here.

302
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,392
What did you do?

303
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,567
Well done. Your patient called
his lawyer, threatened to sue us,

304
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,634
is now heading home
completely undiagnosed.

305
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,543
He'll soon be on his way back.

306
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,777
He's sick. He'll crash,
he'll lose consciousness,

307
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,818
and I'll declare an
emergency, bring him back in.

308
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,788
Not any more you won't. His lawyer
now holds his health care proxy.

309
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,289
The next time we
have an emergency,

310
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,986
Larry Ruseckas, Esquire,
will be calling the shots.

311
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,757
I made the right call. If he had
flipped out after major surgery,

312
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,956
it would have been worse.

313
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,432
The benefit of being boss
is that I don't have to argue.

314
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,934
You're all off the case.

315
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,075
What's going on
between you and Cuddy?

316
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,308
Bad loving gone bad.

317
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,894
Seriously, why didn't you argue with
her? She just threw us off the case.

318
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,819
Because ignoring
her is a lot easier.

319
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,684
Convince the patient
to let us back in again.

320
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,190
See if you can clear his
blockage with lactulose.

321
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,251
If this thing kills him before we can
diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.

322
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,124
Okay.

323
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,225
You're going to
keep working on this?

324
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,859
Yeah. I brought in the case.

325
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,030
There is no case. He's gone, you've
been tossed. This is totally nuts.

326
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,582
He's incredibly sick.
We don't know...

327
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,683
Fine, forget about the patient.

328
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,369
What is going on with you?

329
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,808
This is why we
left House's team.

330
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,903
To avoid this constant
flood of pure craziness.

331
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,574
That's why I left
House. You got fired.

332
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,887
I'm sorry. I know
I let you down.

333
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,503
But you know who
else I let down?

334
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,721
Pretty much everyone
who's important to me.

335
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,193
My boss, my old boss,

336
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,931
my boyfriend.

337
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,603
I did that for you.

338
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,807
I'm not gonna let
you down again.

339
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,522
It's like the red
badge of idiocy.

340
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,723
If the Confederacy
had mosquitoes,

341
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:00,164
we'd all have Southern accents,
and I'd be paying Foreman less.

342
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,592
She kicked you off the case.

343
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,894
This is what happens
when you don't address it.

344
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,770
She acts weird,
things get different.

345
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:13,040
You understand that
different implies difference?

346
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,104
She's tossed me a
million times before.

347
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,446
No, she always chastises you,

348
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,542
and you'd always come
running to me to complain,

349
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,450
so you're acting different, too.

350
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,423
You're scared. You are
scared to get involved.

351
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,088
How is that
scared? It's rational.

352
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,493
Emotionally mature people who
work together should not date.

353
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,864
Guaranteed break-up,
guaranteed ugliness.

354
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,962
Any relationship that doesn't
end in a break-up, ends in death.

355
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,836
Everything falls
apart in the end.

356
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,930
That's your worldview.

357
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,804
The corollary, which
you keep forgetting,

358
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:47,506
is that you have to grab
any chance for happiness.

359
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,106
Why does this matter
so much to you?

360
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,241
Cuddy and I are fine.

361
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,113
The only person getting
worked up here is you.

362
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,917
I don't want you to be
fine, I want you to be happy.

363
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,582
I think if you dated her...

364
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,253
Are you familiar with
the adverb "vicariously"?

365
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,591
If I wanted to ask her out...

366
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,686
You did ask her out.

367
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,165
Last year. Whatever
happened there?

368
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,828
I don't know, I
wasn't interested.

369
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:10,961
Wrong.

370
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,564
You were interested, but
Amber grabbed your genitals first.

371
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,600
And now you're single,
and it makes you miserable,

372
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,770
but you think it's too soon
for another relationship,

373
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,904
so you're gonna
make me miserable.

374
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,950
Please. Get a girlfriend
or a life or something.

375
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,083
For me.

376
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,913
Better or worse?

377
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,117
<i>Worse. Drugs aren't working.</i>

378
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,669
<i>I think we should do the surgery
in his house, like we planned.</i>

379
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,338
Well, then one of us
wasn't paying attention

380
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,558
because I thought that
surgery thing was just a trick.

381
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,576
We prepared the room. We hung the
drapes. It's probably 10 times as sterile

382
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,960
as any mobile operating
theater you'd find in a battlefield.

383
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,528
We still need Trapper John.

384
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,096
Chase doesn't want
anywhere near this surgery.

385
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,733
<i>Maybe you could talk to him.</i>

386
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,437
I can't understand
a word he says.

387
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,708
Taub, you doing anything later?

388
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,307
Blood in the field.

389
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,084
Not where I'm looking.

390
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,764
How am I supposed to
know where you're looking?

391
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,814
Here's a hint. It's
the bloody part.

392
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,902
The whole thing's bloody. It's
a guy with a hole in his body.

393
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,770
It's like you've never done
this before. Use the suction.

394
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,639
I will. And, in fact, I've
never done this before

395
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,326
because I went to med
school, not nurse school.

396
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,233
Hey, wanna see if your
client's actually made of money?

397
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,771
Cutting out the
last piece of bowel.

398
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,440
Suture.

399
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,475
Mucosa's pink. Flattened villi.

400
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,384
Intestinal atrophy.
It's Whipple's Disease.

401
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,048
Explains the seizure
and the stomach pain.

402
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:40,058
Little bleeder here. Cautery.

403
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,287
Hey, wait, the gas...

404
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,800
That always happens
during surgery.

405
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,935
It's the gas build-up in the
blockage, nothing to sue about.

406
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,793
Treat him for the
burns, put him on

407
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:02,141
antibiotics for the
Whipple's. He'll be fine.

408
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,650
Hey. That's nice of you.

409
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,760
Hi. Hi.

410
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,563
He doing good?

411
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,536
Burns are healing fine.
He's stable otherwise.

412
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,472
Good. So, I could stay at
your place tonight, if you like.

413
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,735
I can't.

414
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,009
Well, you're not gonna
sleep here again?

415
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,071
You might have noticed
the lack of nurses.

416
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:40,176
Because you're not on the case. You
can't really use that as an excuse for...

417
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,949
Dr. Cameron. Wait here.

418
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,619
Your stomach? My legs are numb.

419
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,289
I can't feel them at all.

420
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,262
New symptom, peripheral
neuropathy. Got worse on antibiotics.

421
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,034
<i>- It's not Whipple's.
- Porphyria.</i>

422
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,132
Liver's fine. Amyloidosis.

423
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,870
We'd have seen
it on the intestines.

424
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,175
What did we see
on the intestines?

425
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:11,240
<i>Pink mucosa, flattened villi. If it's
not Whipple's, it's gotta be celiac.</i>

426
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,343
Wheat allergy means
he's not absorbing nutrients.

427
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,581
Explains the seizures, the
stomach and now the nerves.

428
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,232
<i>We should run a
blood test for celiac.</i>

429
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:21,717
Not fast enough, not accurate
enough. Force feed him wheat.

430
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,195
<i>Then do an endoscopy
as it hits his duodenum.</i>

431
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,663
See if there's an
allergic reaction.

432
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,600
His guts just exploded. It might
be a tad painful to make him eat.

433
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,536
That's House's point. There's
nothing diagnostic about it.

434
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,005
He's trying to put the patient
in pain, force him to come in.

435
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,235
It is a valid test.

436
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,607
So is the blood test,
which is painless.

437
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,273
<i>Foreman, listen to that
little voice in your head</i>

438
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:46,183
that's coming from the
telephone. Force feed him.

439
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,710
Don't. You know House.
You know I'm right.

440
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,552
We'll do both tests.

441
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,431
I'm not here to play matchmaker.

442
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,503
Okay.

443
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,163
House basically...

444
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:11,639
Well, he accused me of
being interested in you.

445
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,308
He's just trying to
change the subject.

446
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,374
I know. But I do have...

447
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:24,353
I've always had

448
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,358
some feelings for you.

449
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,057
Are you saying you
want to date me?

450
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,325
No, I...

451
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,626
It wouldn't be fair to House,
and it's too soon after Amber.

452
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,973
But you thought you
should just say it?

453
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,009
Yeah, I thought you should know.

454
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,178
Let's have dinner
tomorrow night.

455
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,212
Okay.

456
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,713
Or maybe it'd be
better if we just had sex.

457
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,119
Pardon me?

458
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,661
In front of House's office.

459
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,254
I mean, I don't want
to take any chances.

460
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,993
I assume the point of
this is to make him jealous,

461
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,265
to make him realize that he
does want a relationship with me.

462
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,233
Yes.

463
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,106
You think it'll work?

464
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,701
You're an idiot.

465
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,373
Trust me, everybody will be
happier if House and I aren't dating.

466
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,186
You sure this is the best test?

467
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,922
No. But you've kind
of tied our hands.

468
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,022
As soon as this hits your intestines,
I'll look at it through an endoscope.

469
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,168
Stewart, I know you don't
want to talk about this,

470
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,837
but people who get
shot often get PTSD.

471
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,206
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

472
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,704
It's very treatable
with drugs and therapy.

473
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,477
It's not PTSD.

474
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:03,354
My girlfriend was with me
when I got shot, and she died.

475
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,589
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,289
But that's what I mean.
I lost someone myself.

477
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,799
I know it's traumatic.

478
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,634
No. What I'm
trying to say is that

479
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:25,240
I was like this before the
shooting, since I was a kid.

480
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,880
Everything was hard for me.

481
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,916
I didn't go out that
much, and when I did,

482
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,518
I had panic attacks,
like, physical pain.

483
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,429
You know, it was, like,
worse, it was like I was dying.

484
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,129
When I met Angela,

485
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,728
she was the only reason

486
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,207
that I ever wanted to go out.

487
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,737
But then she died, and...

488
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,289
Blood test will be done soon.

489
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,563
I'm guessing that's
a new technique.

490
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,697
Hey, do you remember
that idea that Cameron had

491
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,470
about trying to torture the
patient into admitting himself?

492
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,238
Pretty sure it was your idea.

493
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,744
You want me to
slow down the test?

494
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,483
Wow, everyone's got all
these great ideas today.

495
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,644
So you're thinking, "Patient won't
leave because leaving causes pain,

496
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,130
"so we gotta make
staying more painful."

497
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,349
That actually makes sense.

498
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,891
You'll increase his pain, but
not enough to make a difference.

499
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,958
He's on morphine.

500
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,323
He's on morphine now,

501
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,555
pretty soon, he'll
be on lessphine.

502
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:55,294
'Cause when you restock, you'll actually
be giving Cameron IV bags of saline.

503
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,844
And why do you
think I'll be doing this?

504
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,166
Same reason you did the surgery.

505
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,206
That was because
it was an emergency.

506
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:03,834
No, it was because your
marriage is falling apart.

507
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:09,137
When you confess adultery,
things tend to go bad.

508
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,912
When one part of
your life does a <i>Titanic,</i>

509
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,216
you make a life raft
out of whatever's left,

510
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,799
which makes your job more significant,
which is why you did the surgery,

511
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:21,385
why you pulled an all-nighter,
and why you'll do this.

512
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,593
She's having me
sleep on the couch,

513
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,222
just for a few nights.

514
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,894
I'm not doing this to save my
job. I'm doing this to save his life.

515
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,803
Right. That's what
we'll tell everyone.

516
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,463
Oh...

517
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,384
Have you considered
that it's not my place

518
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,987
you really wanna be
walking into right now?

519
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,759
Ric Ocasek will kill me if
I... Oh, you mean Cuddy.

520
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:10,667
Yeah, she's a little nuts, but
she's beautiful, smart, funny.

521
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,568
And most important,
she can stand you.

522
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,698
Yeah. I came here to have
you lecture me on Cuddy,

523
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,938
not because there's a killer mosquito
chasing me around my apartment.

524
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,138
House, there is no mosquito.

525
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,977
This is all about Cuddy.

526
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,575
She's "bugging" me. Poetic.

527
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,415
Have you seen this bug?

528
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,614
Have you seen this bite?

529
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,816
No, what I've seen is
a suppurating wound

530
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,860
that you've scratched and
mutilated into a gangrenous state.

531
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,792
Delusional parasitosis.

532
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,353
I am not imagining things.

533
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,424
House, you're a drug addict,
you're always imagining things.

534
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,993
You got bitten the
night you kissed her.

535
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,165
Your itching always gets
worse when you think about her.

536
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,833
You need to address this.

537
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,103
She's my boss.

538
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:55,739
No, you're not afraid of authority, you're
afraid she actually is right for you.

539
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,014
You're afraid to take a chance

540
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,607
because it's too big a chance.

541
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,150
If it doesn't work with her,

542
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,743
then maybe there's
no one out there.

543
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,852
I am not rationalizing.
I'm better off alone.

544
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,621
Also, have you seen
her ass recently?

545
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,787
You're not staying here.

546
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,490
Oh, come on.

547
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:16,331
No. You can go home, or...

548
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,395
You're going to Cuddy's,
you're gonna ring her doorbell,

549
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:24,375
and you're gonna ask her out
on a date, like regular people do.

550
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,934
At 3:00 in the morning?

551
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,071
When do regular people sleep?

552
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,578
Bye-bye.

553
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,753
Is he in enough
pain to come in yet?

554
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:37,881
No.

555
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,285
Antibody tests back?

556
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,417
Inconclusive.

557
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,894
Then why are you
here? I missed you.

558
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,397
Endoscopy? Inconclusive.

559
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,933
Well, then do it again.

560
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:54,228
I know it sucks, but I need
to test your stomach again.

561
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,276
It's really hurting.
I know, I'm sorry.

562
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,312
I'm gonna try to get you on your
back and have you open your mouth.

563
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,948
He's out.

564
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,116
Anything? No pulse.

565
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,415
Start CPR.

566
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,014
Get the paddles.
Get the paddles.

567
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,456
Who are you calling?

568
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,756
Pizza. You like anchovies?

569
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,389
I'm calling the lawyer. Genuine
emergency, he'll okay admission.

570
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,625
He's dying.

571
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,292
Exactly.

572
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,303
Hi, sorry to wake you. Your
introvert is having a heart attack.

573
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,204
House, if we don't restart his
heart... He can survive 15 minutes

574
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,505
on oxygen and CPR. We can
get him to the hospital in five.

575
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,707
Lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.

576
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,214
2123, Holden Green,
patient with PEA.

577
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,477
Clear. Wait.

578
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,546
I got a pulse.

579
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,251
Cancel the ambulance. He's
stable enough to stay here.

580
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,932
His heart's back to sinus
rhythm, but it's bradycardic.

581
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,094
Taub's putting in a
temporary pacemaker.

582
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,608
It'll keep his heart
beating for now.

583
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,367
Hey, Cameron, how would
you like your old job back?

584
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,568
I'm asking 'cause it's the
only way I can fire you.

585
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,340
Sorry, in ER we like to actually
resuscitate dying people,

586
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,643
not just let them flop
around. Could be lymphoma.

587
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,549
No, we'd have seen it on the
abdomen. It has to be a poison.

588
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,950
Organophosphates.

589
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,888
We checked the place over
and over. It's completely clean.

590
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:19,467
There were rose
petals in the front entry.

591
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,925
Unless he's eating
a bouquet a day,

592
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,153
he couldn't... How clean?

593
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,492
Very, he probably
has a little OCD.

594
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,170
How often do you wash your tub?

595
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,729
Every couple of days.

596
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,401
Bleach and ammonia? Yeah.

597
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:49,379
You know how kids play
toy soldiers in the bath?

598
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,949
He likes to re-enact the Battle of
Ypres three times a week with real gas.

599
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,994
Ammonia and bleach
makes chlorine gas.

600
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,225
Highly fat soluble. He lost
weight after the stomach pain,

601
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,198
explains why his symptoms
kept getting worse.

602
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,464
Put him on parenteral steroids
and sodium bicarbonate.

603
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,281
Even if you're right, that external
pacemaker's gonna fail eventually,

604
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,797
and I don't have the skills
to put in a permanent one.

605
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,675
Well, maybe the poison
hasn't completely shot his heart,

606
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,442
and you won't have to feel
guilty for the rest of your life.

607
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,562
How am I going to place the leads
in the exact spot on the right ventricle

608
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,317
without fluoroscopy? The Force?

609
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,358
Taub put in a temporary one.

610
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,451
You can do that playing
Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

611
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,189
Permanent pacemakers
need precision.

612
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,231
So we can use
the portable x-ray.

613
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,062
It's not real time. Sonogram.

614
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,466
And what happens
when I put him into V tach

615
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,197
because the sonogram
isn't precise enough?

616
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,499
He's dying.

617
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,235
Exactly why I don't want
to be the one to kill him.

618
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,774
Thanks.

619
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,376
You knew I'd have to say
no, but you came anyway.

620
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,848
You just wanted a
reason to be angry at me.

621
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,078
If there's something wrong
between us, then let's...

622
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,381
Forget it.

623
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,918
You know why we
spend nights at my house?

624
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,186
Because when we
spent them at yours,

625
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,490
I could tell you
didn't want me there.

626
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,062
Why would I keep inviting you
over if I didn't want you there?

627
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,038
You always kicked
me out every morning.

628
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:18,270
You never offered me a drawer, you
never cleared out your closet for me.

629
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,768
I was just a visitor.

630
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,049
How long have
you felt like this?

631
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,485
From the start.

632
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,730
I know it's hard for you
because you lost your husband,

633
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,762
but I can't keep
chasing you forever.

634
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,820
I just tried your
house, where are you?

635
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,224
Clubbing. Good or bad?

636
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,287
Bad. Vitals are dropping, the
abdominal pain keeps getting worse.

637
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,496
Means we were too
late with the treatment.

638
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,368
Tell the lawyer he's off
the clock, we're done.

639
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,100
You're giving up?

640
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,505
Call Taub.

641
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:28,036
Tell him to pick up some morphine.
No need for the patient to be in pain.

642
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:31,140
He's on morphine.
No, he's on saline.

643
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:34,709
I figured you'd put him on saline,
so I switched him back to morphine.

644
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,915
I love you. When you
reach puberty, give me a...

645
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,757
His abdominal pain, that
was on morphine? <i>Yes.</i>

646
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,170
<i>Is there something that causes abdominal
pain that doesn't respond to morphine?</i>

647
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,267
I was right. He
is being poisoned.

648
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,815
What's this density on his hip?

649
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,552
Just bone. Think less boney.

650
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,093
You think he's got
lead poisoning?

651
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:27,333
Explains the constipation, the
nerves, seizures. Hold him down.

652
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:35,336
You're not gonna feel a
thing, except excruciating pain.

653
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:54,697
Your mugger used hollow points,
which exploded and left fragments.

654
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,895
<i>Your doctors missed a couple
hiding behind your hipbone.</i>

655
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:02,202
<i>It's no biggie, except years
later, they started to dissolve,</i>

656
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:06,142
and then, biggie, you
started to dissolve.

657
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,578
I'll start him on chelation.
The agoraphobia, could it...

658
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,084
Nope. The lead wouldn't have
started to disintegrate till years after.

659
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,847
But it could have
exacerbated the fear.

660
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,387
I don't need to change.

661
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:21,483
I know you think that but your life
could be better, you'd have choices.

662
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,721
He's lying. About what?

663
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,597
About everything.
About his life.

664
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,633
He doesn't even think he's
happy here. He's miserable.

665
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,831
I've got everything
I need. Yeah?

666
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:38,172
Well, then why did Taub find
rose petals in your entry hallway?

667
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,702
Struck me as a little weird, thought
it might be medically relevant.

668
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,248
But it actually just told
me that you were pathetic.

669
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:49,515
The day you crashed in your
entryway was your girlfriend's birthday.

670
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:55,783
You weren't there for the mail, you
were trying to go lay flowers on her grave.

671
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,724
Yeah, he's got PTSD,
yeah, he's agoraphobic.

672
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,268
But he's also a coward.

673
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,930
If you want to change
your life, do something.

674
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,099
Don't believe your
own rationalizations.

675
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,904
Don't just lock yourself up
and pretend you're happy.

676
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,919
Hi. Hi.

677
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,627
You were right.

678
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,256
About my husband.
It affected me.

679
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,798
It still affects me.

680
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,574
If you're saying you'll
never be able to...

681
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,872
I cleaned out a drawer for you.

682
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,310
Like, a big one.
