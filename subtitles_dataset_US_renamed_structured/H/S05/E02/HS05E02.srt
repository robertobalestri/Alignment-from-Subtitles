1
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,103
<i>Bring it about six more feet.</i>

2
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,233
<i>Okay, go ahead
and start dropping it.</i>

3
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,215
Whoa. Whoa!

4
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,367
Class is over.

5
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,131
What's going on? Who are you?

6
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,504
I'm a doctor. Did you have a
corneal transplant five years ago?

7
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,667
Yes.

8
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,820
Every other patient who had a
transplanted organ from that donor

9
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,678
is either dead or
dying. You got a purse?

10
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,112
I feel fine.

11
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,619
I don't mean to scare
you, but so did the others.

12
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,389
One living, one almost
dead, four fully dead.

13
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,326
Nothing in common
except their donor.

14
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,524
Carl got a new heart
and lung, liver kills him.

15
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,534
Tibalt got a new
liver, lung killed him.

16
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,900
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

17
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,769
And Frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

18
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,071
he got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

19
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,633
All within eight
months of each other.

20
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,337
And in each case,
serious complications

21
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,971
came on suddenly
and without warning.

22
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,345
Which means arrhythmia,

23
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,543
massive pulmonary
embolus, or cerebral bleed.

24
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,586
What did Wilson do for me?

25
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,502
If the donor had an infection that
somehow slipped by screening,

26
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,550
it could lay dormant.

27
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,856
Five organs systems hit,

28
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,865
would need five infections for
it to somehow slip by screening.

29
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,993
Oh, sure, he made me
laugh on a rainy day,

30
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,060
made me see the
colors I never knew...

31
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,548
None of the donated
organs were hit.

32
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,516
Means whatever they got
came from the donor's blood.

33
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,718
That wouldn't help
us narrow down what...

34
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,109
It narrows down who. Corneal
transplants are bloodless.

35
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,304
Means Apple's gonna be fine.

36
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,371
You secure enough in that
theory to send her home?

37
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,860
Guess we could wait till we
figure out what's wrong with Frank.

38
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,446
On the other hand, Gilbert
Gottfried makes me laugh,

39
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,114
and how many colors
are there, really?

40
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,633
Once you've got
red, blue and green...

41
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,491
He paid for your lunch, liked monster
trucks and was your conscience.

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,619
Autoimmune disease.

43
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,755
ANA at autopsy of all
four victims were normal.

44
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,425
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

45
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,560
Antiphospholipid
antibodies normal.

46
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,659
Then that leaves cancer.

47
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,434
Cancers have names. They have a
progression. They affect specific organs.

48
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,739
Bone cancer can't turn into
liver cancer. Forget cancer.

49
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,710
It's cancer.

50
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,882
It's not cancer.

51
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,726
You're right, of course.
What was I thinking?

52
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,515
No single type of cancer blew
up three organs in the chest

53
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,364
while also herniating
the fighter's brain stem.

54
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,466
The fighter's irrelevant.
You don't like coincidences?

55
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,959
It'd be a coincidence if
six transplant recipients

56
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,237
had nothing else
wrong with them,

57
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,992
like being an idiot, which leads
to getting your head knocked off.

58
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,190
The others had cancer.

59
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:02,327
Four autopsies and about
1,000 lab tests say it's not cancer.

60
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,337
Redo the 1,000 tests
and the four autopsies.

61
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,482
Taub and Kutner, check out
the donor, find out which cancer...

62
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,170
He didn't die of cancer. His head got
chopped off in an industrial accident.

63
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,269
Find out which cancer
would have killed him.

64
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,157
Check the home and office
for carcinogens, toxins...

65
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,410
He's been dead for four years.

66
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,493
I assume his home has been
rented to someone else by now.

67
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,315
Find out which
cancer killed them.

68
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,287
Did I forget you?

69
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,989
You can check out
the patient's eye.

70
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,299
You can put this on Dr. O'Shea.

71
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,105
And some chips.

72
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,107
Forget your wallet, House? No.

73
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,448
I'll take care of it.

74
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,777
Check.

75
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,711
Why are you following me?

76
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,954
Word is you're
into monster trucks.

77
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,995
My kids like it. But not you?

78
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,464
Predator's okay, but I think the
California Crusher is over-rated.

79
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,968
Are you checking me out?

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,064
You're astute.

81
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,743
No.

82
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,091
How many pills
did you just take?

83
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,274
Vicodin, opioids, some B12.

84
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,250
Need a little kick
in the afternoon.

85
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,747
You got a problem with that?

86
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,114
I think I'm falling in love.

87
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,522
Her right eye's failing.

88
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,359
No, it's not.

89
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,171
Everyone else's
transplanted organs were fine.

90
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,195
Means her eye is fine.

91
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,303
We need to remove the eye.

92
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,026
It's her only working eye.

93
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,694
We could remove the other
one, but since it's not killing her,

94
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,703
I thought this way
was less insane.

95
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,204
Do you have some ethical
problem with what I'm doing

96
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,715
that you can express
in a unique way,

97
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,554
which might actually make
me think that I'm wrong,

98
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,978
even though I'll never admit it?

99
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,070
Yes.

100
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,406
You are funny.

101
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,112
The problem's not in
her eye. It's in her head.

102
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,384
You want to come over and watch
<i>Prescription Passion</i> at my place tonight?

103
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,890
You know I'm not gay, right?

104
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,483
Neither am I.

105
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,653
If you don't want to have
sex, that's cool with me.

106
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,162
I'm not coming
over to your home.

107
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,459
I'll grow on you.

108
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,837
"L-P-E..."

109
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,273
Do I have to be in the
same room with him?

110
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,039
Whatever he's got,
you've got. Fifth line.

111
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,170
Are you sure?

112
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,408
Pretty sure. Fifth line.

113
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,751
Am I going to die?

114
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,346
Could we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

115
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,187
Like, maybe, the fifth line.

116
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,619
"F-E-O-S-P."

117
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,532
Damn.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm sorry. We need
to remove your eye.

119
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,534
My eye?

120
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,541
A moment ago, you thought you
were dying. Blind is actually good news.

121
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,837
Unfortunately, he's wrong.

122
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,276
You just did the test...

123
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,643
But she didn't squint.

124
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,153
Which means the
eye thinks it's fine.

125
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,273
It was wrong.

126
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,260
I know. But the eye doesn't
think. The brain thinks.

127
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,776
Which means thinking's
wrong, the brain's wrong.

128
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,685
Which means it's
spread to the brain.

129
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,190
Which means it's too late
for us to remove the eye.

130
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,820
Which means we're gonna
have to remove your whole head.

131
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,558
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt.

132
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,769
Hallucination. That's
a brain thing, right?

133
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,509
Five hundred different
things can cause hallucination,

134
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,048
doesn't mean it's neurological.

135
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,552
It does if one of the other organ
recipients also had a brain issue.

136
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,086
Did he just drop his hands?

137
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,019
No. None of them
had brain issues.

138
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,489
If his pupils dilated, if
his pupils were fixed,

139
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,581
if there's a twitch...

140
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,718
He got hit in the head, he died.

141
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,592
No mystery, that was your point.

142
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,190
Yesterday. You live,
you learn. Who shot this?

143
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,394
The guy who runs
the gym has a camera.

144
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,528
Uploads the nasty stuff online.

145
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,330
Can't see the dead guy's face.

146
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,069
If I can't see his face,

147
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,941
can't see the twitch,
can't see the pupils...

148
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,056
We know the tennis
player had a heart problem.

149
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,016
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

150
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,075
and then somehow
tie both those things

151
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,262
to the construction
worker's liver,

152
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,085
and then possibly meander
over to Frank's pancreatic failure.

153
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,116
But nothing causes simultaneous
brain and heart problems.

154
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,388
Cancer made no sense.

155
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,555
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

156
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,962
That makes no sense.

157
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,502
I know. I was making a point.

158
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,268
Oh, good, I thought
you were an idiot.

159
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,534
Why are you talking?

160
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,638
Oh, what? The guy doing
manual labor can't have an opinion?

161
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,708
I might be a genius
who just happens to

162
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,777
have a passion for
fixing coffee machines.

163
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,214
No, I'm obviously
not, but that's rude

164
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,259
to make assumptions
about people.

165
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,054
Donor's history came up clean.

166
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,990
Did he just laugh?

167
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,499
No, no, I sneezed.

168
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,593
He's a genius coffee repairman.

169
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,161
A coffee repairman
who wears Argyle socks?

170
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,071
I thought I already
talked about not judging.

171
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,304
What kind of idiot wears Argyle
socks with construction boots?

172
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,546
I'm not an idiot. I'm just
not good at disguises.

173
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,447
Who is he?

174
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,356
He's apparently a very
bad private investigator.

175
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,291
Why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,795
Because I wanted to find
out what you guys found out

177
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,729
before I found out
what he found out,

178
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,290
so I can find out if I need
a private investigator.

179
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,331
So, new.

180
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,394
The donor has no history
of unusual infections,

181
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,600
no international travel
in the 12 months...

182
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,612
Well, seriously,
that's how I sneeze.

183
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,247
He was in Madrid
and the Bahamas.

184
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,808
Credit card receipts
showed no...

185
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:53,910
The girlfriend paid.

186
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,987
There is no girlfriend.

187
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,398
She was his
high-school sweetheart.

188
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,067
High-school sweetheart
is married to his best friend.

189
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,789
I know. She had a
kid four years ago.

190
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:02,988
Timing fits.

191
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,302
She's still pretty hot, though.

192
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,564
You find out anything medical?

193
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,396
Kid has a tummy ache.

194
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,699
Also, the dead guy
was exposed to mercury,

195
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,966
mold and anhydrous
perchloric acid

196
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,599
because their sex pad was next
to a garage that was demolished

197
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,610
after those toxins were found.

198
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,808
Oh, yeah, that will be $2,300.

199
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,642
I'll get you a check.

200
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,049
No, I don't take checks.

201
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,329
You think I'm gonna
stop payment?

202
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,377
Aren't you?

203
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,754
Of course I am!
$2,300? It's insane.

204
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,384
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing match

205
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,723
from four different angles.

206
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,424
30 percent of the crowd paid
by credit card. I got their names.

207
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,675
Four of them had
digital cameras,

208
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,692
which I composited like
NASA did for the pics of Mars.

209
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,670
You know, the
rovers and all that.

210
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,802
<i>Pupils were dilated.</i>

211
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,921
But he didn't drop his hands,

212
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,189
means he maintained
muscle tensity...

213
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,511
Say it.

214
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,479
You were right.

215
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,744
God, that was petty of me.

216
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,183
He maintained muscle tensity,

217
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,996
but was momentarily
distracted when he got hit.

218
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,260
That's a temporal lobe seizure.

219
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,154
Does that PI guy mean
we don't have to break

220
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,334
into people's homes anymore?

221
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,036
It's the whole reason you
went to medical school.

222
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,304
I'm not gonna take
that away from you.

223
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,352
He's better than we are.

224
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,453
He costs more.

225
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,930
I'm gonna biopsy the brain.

226
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,057
No.

227
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,132
Say it.

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,896
You were right. But, no.

229
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,930
Temporal lobe controls
speech, hearing, memory.

230
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,474
She loses those things,

231
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,501
she's gonna be a terrific
date, but beyond that...

232
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,688
We cut out a piece of it,
good chance she's a vegetable,

233
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,648
nothing to hear, nothing to
say, nothing to look back on.

234
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,614
You're right. She has
so much to live for.

235
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,644
Do we have another patient who is
almost finished with all their living?

236
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,419
So it's okay to stab his
brain because he's old?

237
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,223
No, it's okay to stab his brain
because he's dead if you don't.

238
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,923
Get the widow to say yes.

239
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,958
No.

240
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,764
The lung inflammation is a
complication of the pancreatic failure,

241
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,395
which is reversible.

242
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,303
This is actually
his best chance.

243
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,617
If we can find out
what's wrong...

244
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,576
How can a test that
will probably kill him...

245
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:57,667
I didn't say...

246
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,270
You said it was extremely risky.
What does "extremely" mean?

247
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,541
Please.

248
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,881
I'm sorry. I can't.

249
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,450
I have a husband.

250
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,013
I have a two-year-old
daughter. Her name is Julia.

251
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,649
You'd be saving her mother.

252
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,893
I think you're lying.

253
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,195
You haven't had one visitor, not
one phone call since you've been here.

254
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,894
Does she have a child?

255
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,133
No, but her life
is still worth...

256
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,368
More than my husband's?

257
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,308
I lied to save my
life. Wouldn't you?

258
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,073
Not at another human
being's expense.

259
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,671
No, you just rob me
of my only chance

260
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,107
so your husband can struggle
to breathe for a few more days.

261
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,494
Just shut up! I
don't want to hear...

262
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,628
Ladies... from you anymore.

263
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,796
You want to hate me... Shut up!

264
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,618
So you won't feel guilty. Frank!

265
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,123
Give me a scalpel. Frank!

266
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,632
He's coding.

267
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,044
Clear.

268
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,603
Clear.

269
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,114
Clear.

270
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,514
Frank! Clear.

271
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,179
Clear.

272
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,082
Clear.

273
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,563
Did you get the consent? No.

274
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,795
Tell Foreman to get it. Old
people are scared of black people.

275
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,700
It won't matter. Patient's dead.

276
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,569
Save the brain. I don't
need consent for an autopsy.

277
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,436
Well, at best, we're gonna
bat one for six on this one.

278
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,838
Thin slices through the parietal

279
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,466
and temporal lobes were clean.

280
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,636
Occipital and frontotemporal
regions were also...

281
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,044
Brain's clean. Moving on.

282
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,174
To where? We've gone from
making no sense to making less sense,

283
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,582
and then taking
a step backwards.

284
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,986
Each of these people were killed
by one thing that attacked one organ.

285
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,455
But never the same organ.

286
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,034
Could the donor have
had two things wrong?

287
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,890
Or six things wrong?

288
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,785
Metabolic diseases
specialize, everything

289
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:33,423
else specializes, but
cancer plays the field.

290
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,626
You're back to cancer?

291
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,670
Metastasis is just a fancy
word for "screws around."

292
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,797
Any type of
cancer? I don't know.

293
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,465
There would be
evidence of cancer.

294
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,101
There is. We just
haven't found it, yet.

295
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,010
You need it to be cancer so you
have an excuse to talk to Wilson.

296
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,571
Give me something else that
explains this constellation of patients,

297
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,759
then you can call me an ass.

298
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,783
I didn't call you an ass.

299
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,376
Perforated intestine.

300
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,615
If this thing started as normal
bacteria living in the intestines,

301
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,022
but got into a blood vessel

302
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,957
through a vascular
anomaly in the bowel wall,

303
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,122
then they would affect every
organ through the bloodstream.

304
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,325
Screws up everything.
For everyone.

305
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,866
Okay, it's a long shot.
It is possible I'm an ass.

306
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,066
Ironically, we need to do
a colonoscopy to confirm.

307
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,077
We checked Apple inside and
out when she came in. She's clean.

308
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,585
Anomaly would
have to be intermittent

309
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,057
or they all would
have died within a day.

310
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,710
If she starts getting abdominal
pains, shove a tube up her rear

311
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,218
before it can get away.

312
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,947
And test anyone else
with stomach pain.

313
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,113
Everyone else is dead.

314
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,212
Not everyone.

315
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,385
The one thing this donor gave to
each of these people was his DNA.

316
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,656
Anyone else have his DNA?

317
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,297
You want to do a colonoscopy
on a healthy four-year-old?

318
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,666
She has a tummy ache.

319
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,047
If Kutner's right, it's
not a tummy ache.

320
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:50,009
It's a fatal brain or heart or
lung or liver or pancreas ache.

321
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,154
I'm not gonna scare the
hell out of the poor kid's mom

322
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,080
because of a long-shot
corollary to a long-shot theory.

323
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:01,881
Fine. Tell her the truth. Then ask if
Daddy knows who the real daddy is.

324
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,529
Does she have to be awake?

325
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,767
We need her to
tell us when it hurts.

326
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,143
She'll get over it.

327
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,776
Your husband might not have.

328
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,384
What if a kid wants ice cream?

329
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,925
Sign outside says "closed."

330
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,291
Dr. O'Shea's not right for you.

331
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,556
What did you find out?

332
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,097
Why are you investigating him?

333
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,163
Because I need to know if
he lends money interest-free.

334
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,260
What did you find out?

335
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,374
I want some ice cream.

336
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,410
Not until you learn to read!

337
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,423
You're supposed
to trust friends.

338
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,780
I don't know the guy.
I've got no logical reason...

339
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,375
To be his friend? Have you
never seen an Afterschool Special?

340
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,148
That is part of the
pleasure of friendship.

341
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,212
Trusting without
absolute evidence,

342
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,918
and then being
rewarded for that trust.

343
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,460
You're taking pictures of a guy

344
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,167
who's having an affair
with his own sister

345
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,221
and you're lecturing me
about the rewards of trust?

346
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,892
There are two types
of people that hire me.

347
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,844
No, actually, there are three
types of people that hire me,

348
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,613
but the third type's irrelevant
to the point I want to make.

349
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,266
Do you have a special rate
plan for being a pain in the ass?

350
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,117
One type wants to find
out that they're right,

351
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,852
one type wants to find
out that they're wrong.

352
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,037
Which type am I?

353
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,340
You're the third type.

354
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,880
You lead with the
irrelevant types?

355
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,658
You're the type who doesn't
care if you're right or wrong

356
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,083
because they've hired me to
investigate the wrong person.

357
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,210
That's an actual type?

358
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,016
You want me to check out Wilson.

359
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:43,962
You want to find out if he's...

360
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,150
How do you know about Wilson?

361
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,126
What do I do for a living?

362
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,957
You've been checking me out?

363
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,855
Have I been paying for that?

364
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,490
So far you haven't
paid for anything.

365
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,328
You want to find
out if he's pining.

366
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,046
You want to find out if
there's something about him

367
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,748
that will tell you he's
going to come back.

368
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,934
Or something you can
use to make him come back.

369
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,311
Is there?

370
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,416
No. No, there's nothing. Sorry.

371
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,586
That will be $900.

372
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,592
I gotta go. I'll
get you a check.

373
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,973
Colonoscopy was clean.

374
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,640
Then that just leaves cancer.

375
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,593
The fact that the kid's
colonoscopy was negative

376
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,812
doesn't prove anything.

377
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,320
Yes, the fact that it
didn't prove anything

378
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,015
didn't prove anything.
Excellent point.

379
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,000
We don't know if the
kid inherited anything.

380
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,960
Even if she did, Kutner's theory
is that the thing's intermittent.

381
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,223
The opening would have to
be open shortly before death.

382
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,130
Unfortunately, we can't know
when shortly before death is

383
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,135
until shortly after death, and
that seems like an obstacle.

384
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,171
What if there was
a way around that?

385
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,367
Then we're kind of all
sweating over nothing.

386
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,433
Not around death, around
death as an obstacle.

387
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,444
We need to see
his colon at work.

388
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,877
You do know what
"death" means, right?

389
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,176
Without a living system,

390
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,427
there's not enough pressure
to get fluid all the way up.

391
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,819
Life, we can't create,
yet, but pressure's easy.

392
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,332
We use the same
high-pressure water jet

393
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,325
we use to test cardiac workload.

394
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,392
I mean, he's not gonna be
awake to tell us where it hurts, but...

395
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,524
That's not gonna... Do it.

396
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,212
It's kind of stuck.

397
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,446
It's more than stuck.

398
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,512
That bowel's been
dead for six hours.

399
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,820
No matter what you
shoot up there, it's closed.

400
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,935
This is nuts.

401
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,369
It's adjustable.

402
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,942
It's working.

403
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,242
Yeah. Wow.

404
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,676
Well, not much.
Increase the pressure.

405
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,181
The endoscope is bowing.
Push on his stomach.

406
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,392
Those are normal bodily fluids.

407
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,486
Yeah. Normal bodily sewage.

408
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:37,996
Put the pressure back on.

409
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,337
That's the end. No leaks.

410
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,168
Wait, what's that?

411
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,719
It's just dark because
I'm at the end.

412
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,074
What if you're not at the
end? What if it's a core lesion?

413
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,238
Maybe a little more pressure?

414
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,715
Not too much. If it
is the end and we...

415
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,216
<i>It's finally accelerating.</i>

416
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,386
<i>Apple's heart rate
has become irregular.</i>

417
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,258
Breathing is labored.

418
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,264
Colonoscopy's still
showing no leaks.

419
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,492
What if it is autoimmune?

420
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,469
What if we don't have
conversations we've already had?

421
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,199
Four out of the five didn't
linger. They got sick and died.

422
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,741
We don't have time to dismiss
things we've already dismissed.

423
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,367
Nothing fits.

424
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,174
See, that's an example of a
conversation we've already had.

425
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,215
She's sick, something fits.

426
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,281
MS?

427
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,510
No!

428
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,849
Okay, from now on,
no one says anything

429
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,683
unless no one
has said it before.

430
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,257
Where are you going?

431
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,359
You guys start
immunogels on her CSF

432
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,131
to look for hidden
protein markers,

433
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,448
then start sequencing her
genes. I'm going to start treatment.

434
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,940
Treatment for what? Cancer.

435
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,135
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.

436
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,078
It's something. Which means
we should treat her for something.

437
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,865
She's fine.

438
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:20,932
Where's her chart?

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,662
You rang emergency
to get her chart?

440
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,101
I know, that was bad of me.

441
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,314
But I'm pretty sure the chart's
supposed to be attached to the bed

442
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:30,207
so that gimp doctors don't have to
look all over the place while patients die.

443
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:40,309
Thank you so much. And some
peppermint tea when you get a chance?

444
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,157
I need you to sign something.

445
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,424
Consent to chemotherapy.

446
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,393
You found cancer?

447
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,593
No.

448
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,470
Then you have
tests indicating...

449
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,561
No.

450
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,697
Then why should I sign it?

451
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,332
That's a good question.

452
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,877
And deserves a
complicated answer.

453
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,847
Placebo effect.

454
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,179
People have
confidence in doctors,

455
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,652
they have confidence in
diagnoses, confidence in medicine.

456
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,952
Sometimes they get a little better
just because they think they will.

457
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,357
And that can make us think that
the wrong answer is the right answer,

458
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,759
which is very bad.

459
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:28,463
So, you do have proof that
it's cancer but you can't tell me

460
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,902
because it might affect the
way I react to the medicine?

461
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,203
If that were true, and it
would certainly make sense,

462
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,641
do you think I could
tell you that it's true?

463
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,181
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

464
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,690
20/200 vision.

465
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,559
Didn't you cover all this
personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?

466
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,790
You don't care who I used to be?

467
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,561
You're a post-corneal
transplant math teacher.

468
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,432
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

469
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,903
I was an architect.

470
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,039
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

471
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,605
The world was ugly.

472
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,981
You think the world would be
any different if your leg was fine?

473
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,552
No.

474
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,355
You think you'd be any
different if your leg was fine?

475
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,421
I mean, the doctors told me

476
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:35,093
that my life was going to be
so much better once I could see.

477
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,262
I would date, I would dance.

478
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:43,571
But the guys I hated dancing with
before, I hated dancing with after.

479
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,306
My parents were still
dead. I was still alone.

480
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,509
You're fun.

481
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,483
You don't seem
all that different.

482
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,857
I haven't given up.

483
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:05,695
Wilson's got a new job.
Hasn't started yet, but...

484
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,460
So, who are we following?

485
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,297
See that lady up there?

486
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,461
You point at the target?

487
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:14,337
No. I'm following the one halfway
in-between that point and that point.

488
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,844
Pretty. Who hired you?

489
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,882
No one. I just like her.

490
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,041
You're stalking her?

491
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,280
No, no, I followed her out
of that bookstore back there.

492
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,652
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

493
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,783
So what else can you tell
me that I might care about?

494
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,590
He attends this grief
counseling thing twice a week

495
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:39,962
where they go around the
room and cry about who's dead.

496
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,967
Cameron's been to
his house several times.

497
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:45,801
They just talk about death
and losing loved ones.

498
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,615
What... What are you...

499
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,181
If she turns her
head, she's gonna see

500
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,895
that we're walking
in the wrong direction.

501
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,858
No, no, she won't.
I'm very nondescript.

502
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,291
Well, I'm not.

503
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,420
Well, then, you stay
four feet behind me.

504
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,362
How do you know what
they're talking about?

505
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:16,562
I'm in the same grief counseling
group. I recently lost my mother.

506
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,569
You'd get laid more often if
you told them you lost a kid.

507
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,129
I didn't lose a kid.

508
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,936
You're a PI, you can't lie?

509
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,239
I can lie, I'm just
not all that good at it.

510
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,579
Dr. Cuddy's been over to Wilson's
twice and phoned a bunch of times.

511
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,777
Foreman called him.
And the rest of the time

512
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,945
Wilson's been reading
meditation books

513
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,956
and magazines
about restoring barns.

514
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,082
Are you following me?

515
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,251
No. No.

516
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,418
Are you lying?

517
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,722
No. Yes.

518
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,058
Lesson one, commit.

519
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,031
It's making me uncomfortable.

520
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,123
Sorry.

521
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,500
You're very pretty.

522
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,800
More uncomfortable.

523
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,598
She's not your type.

524
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,644
Your type is much
stupider than her.

525
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,709
What did Wilson say about me?

526
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,111
You've never come up.

527
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,413
In the grief counseling,
or in the other...

528
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,283
Anywhere. I got three bugs
in his home and one in his car.

529
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,414
If I didn't know you, I wouldn't
even know you existed.

530
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,082
Which is good news.

531
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,525
Only two things you ignore,
things that aren't important,

532
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,564
and things you wished weren't
important, and wishing never works.

533
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,005
She's better.

534
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,104
I could tell at once.

535
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,412
Vomiting is a side
effect of the chemo.

536
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,543
Her heart rate's
stabilized, breathing's good.

537
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,918
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

538
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,581
I guess it's working.

539
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,490
Can't believe it. It's cancer.

540
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,993
It's not cancer.

541
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,904
Labs show that our
patient is healthier.

542
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,105
She's gonna get sicker.
Then she's gonna die.

543
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,943
I brought Thai food.
What did you see in her?

544
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,178
Nothing. It's not cancer, all
the tests say it's not cancer.

545
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,719
They've always
said it's not cancer.

546
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,845
Treatment proves it's cancer.

547
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,685
Treatment proves
it could be cancer.

548
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,756
It's not cancer.

549
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,053
This was your diagnosis.

550
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,302
I never thought it was cancer.

551
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,555
You treated for cancer.

552
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,756
I thought that what she
had acted like cancer.

553
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,841
If it acts like cancer, maybe
it would respond like cancer.

554
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,595
It did. Because it's cancer.

555
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,604
We have to find something that
walks like cancer, talks like cancer,

556
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,402
tastes like cancer,
but isn't cancer.

557
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,137
No, we don't. Better is
better, who cares why?

558
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,736
I do. And so does Tetrault.

559
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:41,871
Who?

560
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,644
The dead tuba player. Tibalt.

561
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,619
The point is, he
died last, but he died,

562
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:49,967
which means she's
gonna die, too.

563
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,048
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

564
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,889
There's a cancer drug that's
used off-label for arthritis.

565
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,258
There's no record of arthritis.

566
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,194
Did you interview
all the tuba students?

567
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,174
If he had joint pain in his
hands, he couldn't have played.

568
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,496
Then it wasn't in his hands.

569
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,844
Then why do we care
about his students?

570
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,303
One of them is Canadian,
brought him methotrexate,

571
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,804
so he could hide his arthritis.

572
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,341
He already couldn't
afford his insurance.

573
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,003
And that little piece of
business cost me $700.

574
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,317
I'm gonna pass it on to the
patient with a steep mark-up.

575
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,281
This makes no sense.

576
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,372
I know.

577
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,720
She's dead, unless we can find
what's cancer, but not cancer.

578
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,094
Something's missing.

579
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,601
I need an epiphany.

580
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,006
What are you billing out at?
$300 an hour? Here's $400.

581
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,774
There are other oncologists.

582
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,315
Better oncologists.
But I need you.

583
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,253
Let me describe the
symptoms, problems, issues,

584
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,053
and you say whatever
you feel like saying

585
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,957
until something triggers
an idea in my head.

586
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,104
That's not the way it works.

587
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,892
You have a way of
thinking about things.

588
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,400
It's sloppy, it's undisciplined,
it's not very linear,

589
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,562
it complements mine, drives me
down avenues I wouldn't otherwise...

590
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,571
House, please go away.

591
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,800
Cancer, but not cancer,

592
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,173
responds to cancer
treatment, but there's no...

593
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,411
How are you?

594
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:31,521
Don't do this, please.
Please don't do this.

595
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,891
I'm trying to move on.

596
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:41,059
By hanging out with Cameron, and
talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me?

597
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,837
I paid a private
investigator to spy on you.

598
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:54,939
You didn't.

599
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,492
You want to move on from me,
you gotta deal with me, talk to me.

600
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,984
You had no right.

601
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,713
We're not friends anymore.
There's no trust to be breached.

602
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:05,349
I can have you followed, I can
call you names, tell your secrets.

603
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,728
Foreman did a CT.

604
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,129
Temporal and frontoparietal
regions, normal.

605
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,222
Occipital lobe, normal.

606
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,463
I have the right to walk
away from you, House.

607
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,504
There is a world beyond
you, you need to realize that.

608
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:24,270
And even if you
don't, I'm moving on.

609
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,535
The next time you
knock, I'm not answering.

610
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,881
Nothing yet. Keep talking.

611
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,829
I'm sorry.

612
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,229
You charge me for listening
in on my own conversations?

613
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,066
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

614
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,469
How many friends do you have?

615
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,801
Seventeen.

616
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,468
Seriously? You have a list?

617
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,875
No, I knew this conversation
was really about you,

618
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,856
so I just gave you an
answer so you could get back

619
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,371
to your train of thought.

620
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,543
Well done. I have one. Had one.

621
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,519
Friends are important,
you're gonna miss...

622
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,646
Shut up.

623
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,782
Friends allow you to not
sit in a room by yourself.

624
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,224
Are you charging me for this?

625
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,988
Are we friends? No.

626
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,290
Then, yes.

627
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,159
Do you want to be my friend?

628
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,358
No. You scare me a little.

629
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,376
He thinks if he's not a
friend, he can't talk to me.

630
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,562
We can talk, we can be
two human beings talking.

631
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,730
I'm with him. Sorry,
didn't mean to interrupt.

632
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,865
Yes, you did. I was in
the middle of a sentence.

633
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,967
Yes, I did. You were
repeating yourself.

634
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,534
I'm grateful. Make your point.

635
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,057
It's like that "cancer, but not
cancer" thing you were talking about.

636
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,414
Friends are friends,
customers are customers,

637
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,418
and everything else
is everything else.

638
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,147
If it's not, nothing is nothing.

639
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,150
And anything can be anything.

640
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,187
10:10, stop the clock.

641
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,324
What?

642
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,766
The world is not as
ugly as she thinks it is.

643
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,605
Cancer, but not cancer.

644
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,280
It doesn't make
any sense, unless...

645
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,548
Brain, but not brain.

646
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,916
Occipital lobe's normal,
but her eyes suck.

647
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,579
That lobe should
be compensating.

648
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,180
Since it's not,
that tells me that

649
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,691
something's in there
that shouldn't be in there.

650
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,627
Brain, but not brain.

651
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,856
Why are you in my office?

652
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,264
To find the anomaly, I need
to chop off the top of her head.

653
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,768
Pretty sure I need
your approval for that.

654
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,236
I'm going to trust
your first instinct.

655
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,706
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

656
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,709
I'm ordering her cancer
treatment to be continued.

657
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,714
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

658
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,013
Cancer stem cells are real.

659
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,609
They explain everything.

660
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,211
They're like
embryonic stem cells,

661
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,431
they can become
whatever they want.

662
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,981
The donor had them,
the recipients got them.

663
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,802
<i>They floated around,
they landed on an organ,</i>

664
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,318
<i>got bathed in cytomes,
partially differentiated.</i>

665
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,421
<i>And the key word
there is "partially."</i>

666
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,023
<i>In the tuba player, they
became lung, but not lung.</i>

667
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,433
<i>In the tennis player they
became heart, but not heart.</i>

668
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,334
<i>Stop me if you've
figured out the pattern.</i>

669
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,448
<i>They looked as if they belonged,</i>

670
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,683
<i>but they weren't
doing their jobs.</i>

671
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,903
<i>And when they were
really needed, boom.</i>

672
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,310
Chemo worked because the
cells were basically tumors,

673
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:15,745
chemo shrunk them.

674
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,347
You're still gonna
say no, aren't you?

675
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,647
You have no proof.

676
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,744
I have the brain scan.

677
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,289
The normal brain scan.

678
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,188
This is why I need
to take off her head.

679
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,850
To treat? Or to
prove you're right?

680
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,053
To treat.

681
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,993
Chemo's not killing anything,
it's just hiding the real problem.

682
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,259
She's gonna crash.

683
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,825
If we wait until she does
crash, it might be too late.

684
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,371
So, the next step is what?

685
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,431
I say no, and then you do
something to make her crash,

686
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,000
so that I'll think you've
proven your theory?

687
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,238
I would never do that.

688
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,405
No. You won't.

689
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,066
She's crashing.

690
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,806
<i>You might want to check her IV.</i>

691
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:03,707
<i>From here, it looks like
saline instead of chemo.</i>

692
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,183
Yeah, they look identical.

693
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,243
<i>Still, you should
probably check.</i>

694
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,921
You switched her meds?

695
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,017
<i>How could I? I had no access.</i>

696
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,693
Close her back up.

697
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,229
<i>Do the surgery.</i>

698
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,525
There's no reason.

699
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,122
<i>There's no reason not to.</i>

700
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,532
<i>The stupidly dangerous
part is already over with.</i>

701
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,331
We're ready with the neural net.

702
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,591
Is that someone's brain?

703
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,823
Except for the
part that isn't brain.

704
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,428
Hey, that's the patient I...

705
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:02,768
You said she'd be fine.

706
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,503
I'm a better liar than you are.

707
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,408
I swapped her meds.

708
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,721
I mean, she's got
a brain problem?

709
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,714
I could have killed her. Yeah.

710
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,784
The neural net will show us
how fast her neurons are firing.

711
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:18,915
If there's something in the
way, say brain that's not brain,

712
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,323
her normal neural impulses
will be sucked into a vortex,

713
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,022
because they're
unable to do their job.

714
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,416
The computer
will then process it,

715
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,933
give us a picture
of where to cut.

716
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,332
Cool.

717
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:31,861
Excuse me?

718
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,428
Sorry, I thought that's
what you wanted to hear.

719
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:38,442
You think all this is amazingly
cool and you have no one else,

720
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,638
so you're paying
a guy to listen.

721
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,307
Sorry, just trying to
save you some cash.

722
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,476
I'm on the clock?

723
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,591
Yeah, why wouldn't you be?

724
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,247
You think this is
interesting to me?

725
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,652
<i>House.</i>

726
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,157
I see it. Can you get it?

727
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,750
I think so.

728
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:58,160
Turns out you didn't kill her.

729
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,030
Cool. You owe me $5,000.

730
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,915
Why are you just
standing there, Dr. House?

731
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,180
How'd you know who it is?

732
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,453
I can smell you.

733
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,392
Yeah, like you're
a field of roses.

734
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,033
Peppermint tea.

735
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,504
You ever hear of the
boy who cried wolf?

736
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,632
Never really bought that.

737
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,542
I don't care how often a kid
cries he's being eaten by a wolf,

738
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,102
Mom's gonna come running.

739
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,177
The world is ugly.

740
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,316
People kill, they go hungry.

741
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,457
Just proving a point.

742
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,567
People are asses.

743
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,071
Why are you
telling me this stuff?

744
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,040
Because the world isn't
as ugly as you think it is.

745
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:20,078
Your transplanted cornea
is fine, your eye is fine,

746
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,171
but your brain
wasn't working right.

747
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,443
I'm gonna take the
gauze off your eyes now.

748
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,310
It's gonna be bright. I know.

749
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:31,049
The brain cells that
weren't brain cells

750
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:35,116
were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

751
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,288
After the transplant, you
could see, but not see.

752
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,662
I could see, I could read.

753
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:45,465
Yeah, but it was dull, or
foggy, or gray. I don't know.

754
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,505
What I do know is that
you were not seeing

755
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:49,973
what everyone else was seeing.

756
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,478
And now? Things are gonna be

757
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,645
beautiful?

758
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,117
Things will be what they are.

759
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,362
How do I look?

760
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,802
You look sad.

761
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:51,294
Hey.

762
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,229
Is there any way I could
put you on retainer?
