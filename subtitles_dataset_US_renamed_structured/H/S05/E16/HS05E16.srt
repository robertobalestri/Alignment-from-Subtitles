1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,836
I want to reassure you.

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,907
Your child can have a
completely normal life.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,472
How can a baby have
male and female DNA?

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,478
It's a condition called
genetic mosaicism.

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,783
The ambiguous genitalia
can be surgically repaired.

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,784
Repaired?

7
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,648
Made to look more typical.

8
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,794
More typical?

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,825
But you haven't even told
us if the baby's a boy or a girl.

10
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,800
That's a choice
you have to make.

11
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,105
Nice job, Jackson.

12
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,246
Take it.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,895
He had the shot.
He lost his nerve.

14
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,522
Honey, it's okay.
He's doing great.

15
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,964
Three.

16
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,685
No fear that time.

17
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,071
Melanie. What?

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,199
Oh, my God. Jackson!

19
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,944
Black heels or the boots?

20
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,290
You know I'm a
fan of those heels.

21
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,818
Boots it is.

22
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,962
For all we know, House knows
you're a fan of those heels.

23
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,544
You think House
is going to figure out

24
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,470
we faked our break-up
because of your shoes?

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,531
Go with the boots.

26
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,637
You gonna eat that?

27
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,413
Have at it.

28
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,752
Did you just ask my permission
before you took my food?

29
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,252
Yes, we can.

30
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,590
Adolescent genetic mosaic,
collapsed during a basketball game,

31
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,491
presenting with
persistent pelvic pain.

32
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,652
Fun.

33
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,273
The parents haven't told their son
that he could have been their daughter.

34
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,766
They want assurance
that you won't either.

35
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,597
Less fun. But still.

36
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,034
That was easy.

37
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,875
Our new patient.
Part girl, part boy,

38
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,812
all Thirteen's dream date.

39
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,690
Severe pelvic pain started during a
basketball game. Could be dehydration.

40
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,693
ER gave him fluids
when he came in.

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,004
Still, if it was chronic...

42
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,173
We got a kid who could mate
with himself, and we're thinking

43
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,274
he didn't have enough to drink?

44
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,199
There are dozens
of intersex disorders.

45
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:58,068
Persistent pelvic pain could mean
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, PMDS.

46
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,730
Those conditions
occur in intersex kids

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,333
who are chromosomally
XX or XY, not XX and XY.

48
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,855
Parents recently started him on
testosterone, maybe there's something...

49
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,371
Vitamins wouldn't
cause pelvic pain.

50
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,741
There's a note in here.

51
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,947
We're supposed to refer to his
testosterone shots as vitamins.

52
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,387
His parents aren't just liars.

53
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,049
They want us to be liars, too.

54
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,527
I won't do it. You
guys will, though.

55
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,064
He's a kid. Parents don't
think he's ready to deal with it.

56
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,363
My dad was the same way about
me maybe having Huntington's. It's...

57
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,494
Well, if that was
your experience,

58
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,936
it must surely apply
in this situation.

59
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,807
Pain could be caused by a blind
uterus hidden in his abdomen.

60
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,037
He needs an MRI.

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,477
Right. Boy with girl genes.

62
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,573
I'm sure you're the first doctor
brilliant enough to check for a uterus.

63
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,762
He could have complications
from the surgeries on his penis.

64
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,084
That can cause pelvic pain.

65
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,816
Way to multi-task.

66
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,222
Impress your boss
and humiliate your ex.

67
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,483
MRI is a waste of time.

68
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,255
But to continue the humiliation,

69
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,388
go put a camera up his penis.

70
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,268
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

71
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,133
What do you think is
wrong with our son?

72
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,002
These people were
just coming to tell you.

73
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,509
This is better.

74
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,773
Don't have to worry about
them losing their way.

75
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,840
We think that he has a blind
uterus. He should have an MRI.

76
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,812
Did you send them a text?

77
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,117
Over the past 13 years,
we've educated ourselves.

78
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,184
Who needs med school
when you've got Wi-Fi?

79
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,128
Go schedule their son for an
MRI with contrast right away.

80
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,528
Thank you. Thanks.

81
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,397
You just said an MRI
was a waste of time.

82
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,495
So is arguing with them.

83
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,333
Contrast's in.

84
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,711
Jackson, we're going to
get started, so try to lie still.

85
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:54,016
How long do you think the post-break-up
awkwardness is going to last?

86
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,114
Foreman and I are
both professionals.

87
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,159
Stomach and liver are clear.

88
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:04,028
If by "professional" you mean he's a
T-1000 built by Cyberdyne Systems.

89
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,894
I never understood
what you saw in him.

90
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,935
He's not really your type, huh?

91
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,697
Moving down through
the pelvic floor.

92
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,763
Here's my impression of Foreman
on the happiest day of his life.

93
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,236
Now, the saddest
day of his life.

94
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,276
We just broke up. I'm not
quite ready to mock him yet.

95
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,778
House was a jerk
to split you two up,

96
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,188
but bottom line,
he did you a favor.

97
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,290
Area around the
intestinal tract is clear.

98
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,886
No blind uterus.

99
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,540
I think there's something
wrong with House.

100
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,404
Who's he making miserable now?

101
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,738
Actually, no one.

102
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:54,440
He okayed an MRI just because the
parents wanted to look for a blind uterus.

103
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,142
There was no fighting, no
arguing, he just went along.

104
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,775
It's a valid medical theory.

105
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,684
He doesn't think it is.

106
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,247
House decided to
humor these parents.

107
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,919
Maybe he had a
great cup of coffee,

108
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,963
or a tremendous bowel movement.

109
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,828
Bottom line is, your
boss is in a good mood.

110
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,425
Stop analyzing it
and just enjoy it.

111
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,812
We're going to use this scope
to fill your bladder with saline,

112
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,541
then examine your urethra
for any narrow spots.

113
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,107
Why would there
be a narrow spot?

114
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,811
Sometimes it just happens.

115
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,854
Can my parents come in?

116
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,084
Sure.

117
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,189
I thought it'd be awkward
for you having them here.

118
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,424
I have this feeling they've
seen me naked before.

119
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,860
Now, take a breath,
just try to relax.

120
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,302
Mom.

121
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,003
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

122
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,144
Hey, remember those sprints
they made you run in practice?

123
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,349
Those were so hard,
but you pulled through.

124
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,389
You can do this, too.

125
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,687
I'm to the bladder.
Start the saline.

126
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,632
I'm going to look around
and pull back on the scope.

127
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,132
Feels tight. THIRTEEN:
That pressure's normal.

128
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,735
Just try to hold on for
a few more minutes.

129
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,677
It's not down there.

130
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,576
It's my chest.

131
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,879
I can't breathe.
Can't... Can't breathe.

132
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,818
Is he okay?

133
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,256
Muffled heart sounds.

134
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,827
Jugular's distended.
Pericardial effusion.

135
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:48,971
We need a 10
gauge and a syringe.

136
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,088
What's happening?

137
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,307
His heart is filling
with exudate.

138
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,459
If we don't drain
it, it'll stop beating.

139
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,104
We drained the fluid
from his pericardial space.

140
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,734
His heart rate is
back to normal.

141
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,472
Pelvis plus heart

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,344
doesn't fit with any of the
syndromes associated with mosaicism.

143
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,179
It could be drugs,
toxins, an infection.

144
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,708
You're okay with this?

145
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,810
With what?

146
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,949
That we're considering a diagnosis
unrelated to this kid being a she-male.

147
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,493
Assuming a coincidence like
that would usually torture you,

148
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,994
but you're completely unfazed.

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,158
Completely unfazed? You think
I'm totally lacking in any fazing?

150
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,797
The idea that I'm anything less than
half-fazed, I actually find offensive.

151
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,168
It greatly fazes me.

152
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,536
He started testosterone...

153
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,006
Vitamins.

154
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,408
A few months ago. That can
cause autoimmune diseases

155
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,813
like polyarteritis and SLE, which can
cause pericardial effusion and pelvic pain.

156
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,544
So, it is related.

157
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,984
Now I'm unfazed.

158
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,580
Start him on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune,

159
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,092
finasteride to
block the vitamins.

160
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,797
You slept with House.

161
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,295
He asked permission
before taking my bagel,

162
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,964
took the case without a fight,

163
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
honored the parents'
request for an MRI.

164
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,373
Yes, those were my
terms for sleeping with him.

165
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,004
He's in a good mood.

166
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,481
Sex with me would explain that,

167
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:21,283
but it doesn't explain why I'm not
curled up in a ball, weeping in shame.

168
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,220
I did not have sex with House.

169
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,087
If you two aren't keeping
something from me,

170
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,684
that means he's keeping
something from both of us.

171
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,696
That can't be good. Or
he's just in a good mood.

172
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,493
This is not a crisis.

173
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,058
Maybe you can get back some
of that money he owes you.

174
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,299
Hmm.

175
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,905
Testosterone blocker?

176
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,746
Does that mean if Jackson has
SLE, or whatever that other thing was,

177
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,308
that he'd have to
go off the hormones?

178
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,717
Probably.

179
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,846
Then Jackson will
stop developing,

180
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,914
he'll never go through puberty.

181
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,222
Maybe this isn't
what's wrong with him,

182
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,955
maybe the testosterone
didn't cause it.

183
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,122
Yeah. But if it is, then
he'll never be a man.

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,196
Did we make the wrong choice?

185
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,140
You'll need to tell him the
testosterone blocker is something else.

186
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,244
Or maybe this is a good
opportunity to tell him the truth.

187
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,755
It might make it
simpler for all of you.

188
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:35,588
You want us to tell a sick adolescent
boy that he's really not an adolescent boy?

189
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,961
That doesn't seem simpler to me.

190
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,594
No. Just

191
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,836
give him the meds.

192
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:54,307
So, you have pain in one
arm and both your legs.

193
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,248
Does it hurt right now?

194
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,375
No.

195
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,848
It's when I, like, put
pressure on them.

196
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,820
See, it hurts when I do this.

197
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,823
Ow!

198
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,993
And this.

199
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,322
Ow!

200
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,928
And this.

201
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,796
Ow!

202
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,168
What about this?

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,106
Ow!

204
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,411
Did you give House the
moron with the broken finger?

205
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,212
They've been in Room
2 about 10 minutes.

206
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,812
The patient should've been screaming
for another doctor seven minutes ago.

207
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,517
Thanks, bro.

208
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,633
If I have this IV, why
do I need a shot, too?

209
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,347
Just some extra
medicine, just to be safe.

210
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,310
I hear you're quite
the basketball player.

211
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,377
What position? Point guard.

212
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,548
Small forward. How's
your crossover dribble?

213
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,718
It's okay. I'm not really
that into basketball.

214
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,628
Gonna feel a little pinch, okay?

215
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,992
So, if you're not that into
it, why'd you join the team?

216
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,567
My mom kind of made me do it.

217
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,369
My parents were the same way,

218
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,603
always pushing
me to try new things.

219
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,874
It was more like what
she didn't want me to try.

220
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,910
I wanted to take dance,
but she flipped out,

221
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,148
and made me choose
between basketball and hockey.

222
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,422
What does your dad say?

223
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,256
He seemed okay with it, then
he just caved in to my mom.

224
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,690
Your palm is red.

225
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,563
What does that mean?

226
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,131
That we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

227
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,145
You were right, he
is in a good mood.

228
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,814
Bummer it didn't work
out with you and Thirteen.

229
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,914
It happens.

230
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,687
You guys seemed happy together.

231
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,889
It's probably for the best, you
know, the bisexual thing and all.

232
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,987
That was never an issue.

233
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,556
No, it never is. Until it is.

234
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,398
This is Thirteen. Before
you guys got together,

235
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,133
she was hooking up with
a different girl every night.

236
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,801
Long term, you really think
you could compete with that?

237
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,344
House, wake up. We have to talk.

238
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,083
Stop pretending to be
asleep, we're not leaving.

239
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,414
House.

240
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,350
What's going on?

241
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,420
House?

242
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,721
He's not breathing.
Can you get a pulse?

243
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:57,957
Barely. Call a code.

244
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,842
Get an Ambu bag
from the nurse's station.

245
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,977
Heart's still working, means
synapses are still firing.

246
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,470
We just need to get a
message through to him.

247
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,079
You stopped breathing.

248
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,639
What the hell is going on?

249
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,492
I think my penis stopped
breathing. Do you know CPR?

250
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,120
Looks like your brain is okay.

251
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,290
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

252
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:36,666
I'm fine, other than the fact
that my nurple is now purple.

253
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,468
No wonder you broke up with him.

254
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,803
I'm surprised yours
are still attached.

255
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,968
By the way, I could
see that from here.

256
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,103
I assume those are
our patient's lab results.

257
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,841
The patient can wait.
You could have died.

258
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,407
The only reason you'd ignore a
near-death experience is you don't care,

259
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,316
or you already know
why it happened.

260
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,981
It's called Vicodin.
I took too many.

261
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,991
Can I please get some
information about our patient?

262
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,358
The patient's palms are red. Lab test
confirmed liver and kidney dysfunction.

263
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,228
I don't remember you
taking any Vicodin today.

264
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,390
I don't remember
hiring my mother.

265
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,900
And what causes the enzymes in

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,061
little Boy George's existing
heart problem and pelvic pain?

267
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,662
You didn't take any
yesterday at breakfast, either.

268
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,651
I don't remember having
breakfast with my mother.

269
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,974
Amyloidosis with
systemic involvement.

270
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,240
Protein levels are normal.
This kid's depressed.

271
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,281
If he's self-medicating
with drugs and alcohol,

272
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,577
that'd explain his symptoms.

273
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,345
Search the school.
Search the home.

274
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,148
Seriously? Or are
you just deflecting?

275
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,586
Both.

276
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,917
Where are you going? Nowhere.

277
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,554
I'm staying right here, so
we can properly discuss this.

278
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,201
He's on heroin. How can you...

279
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,898
Number one, he's happy,
which means he's high.

280
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:49,739
Number two, when he moved his bad
leg, he didn't use his hands to support it.

281
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,973
Whatever he's taking,
it's stronger than Vicodin.

282
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,511
What are we gonna do?

283
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,218
You really think House
took too many Vicodin?

284
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,349
Guy pops them like candy. I'm
surprised it hasn't happened before.

285
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,623
Do you miss sleeping with women?

286
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,855
Excuse me?

287
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,227
Simple question.

288
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes. It's a simple answer.

289
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,062
I'll check under the bed.

290
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,808
I also miss sleeping
with other men,

291
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,573
and I'm sure you miss
sleeping with other women.

292
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,810
Monogamy is like saying
you're never going to have

293
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,818
any other ice cream
flavor besides Rocky Road.

294
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,515
So, you're saying if you don't
have pink bubblegum for a while,

295
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,854
that one day you're gonna
chase down the ice cream truck?

296
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,020
No, Rocky Road is great.

297
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,893
It's a very delicious
and complicated flavor.

298
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,433
I also know that if I
have other flavors,

299
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:53,564
then Rocky Road is gonna be left in
the freezer where anyone can just dip in.

300
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,006
Can we please drop the metaphor?

301
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,503
Why is this coming up now?

302
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,350
Kutner said the
silver lining of our

303
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,117
break-up was I wouldn't
be dumped for a girl.

304
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,031
There's nothing in here, either.

305
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,231
Seems like you're wrong about
this kid having drug or alcohol...

306
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,224
When did he bring that up?

307
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,690
Earlier today, right before...

308
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,284
This morning, Taub
called you a robot.

309
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,454
Hmm.

310
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,062
Either it's a big coincidence

311
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,601
or they're jerking us
around, they know.

312
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,467
And if they know, House knows.

313
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,468
This is bad.

314
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,976
No, this is good.

315
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,174
House only has two ways
to handle us still going out.

316
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,147
He jerks us around
or he fires us.

317
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,448
He chose option A. This is good.

318
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,021
But this is bad.

319
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:55,327
"I stand alone, my soul and me,
beneath the mask that others see"

320
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,904
His chest is still rising.

321
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,534
He's just screwing with me
'cause Cuddy made me baby-sit.

322
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,672
"A pain that tears and
bites and will not bend

323
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,180
"Only when I sleep will it end."

324
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,184
Downer. And
medically irrelevant.

325
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,519
You sure his chest is moving?

326
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,614
House.

327
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:22,184
If he's faking, you think he's going to
come clean because you said his name?

328
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:26,426
Back off. Only Thirteen gets
to grab my nipples this time.

329
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,127
You know, recreating the moment

330
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,194
when you made us crap our
pants isn't actually all that funny.

331
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,297
That is sweet that you're
worried about House.

332
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,505
Unless the next stanza reads,

333
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:44,812
"Hoping to fry my brain to death I
smoked some primo crystal meth,"

334
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,977
I'm not interested.

335
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,021
You can't deny that
this kid may be suicidal.

336
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,579
We're not here to make him
happy, we're here to diagnose him.

337
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,885
It's an infection.

338
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,655
Swab of the kid's water
bottle turned up toxoplasmosis.

339
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,061
I'll start him on pyrimethamine.

340
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,540
I had no idea he felt this way.

341
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,774
Is there a therapist here
that you can recommend?

342
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,576
It might help more
if you talked to him.

343
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,274
He's not ready.

344
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,115
If telling him the truth would
help him stop feeling like this.

345
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,519
If I knew that it'd make
him less confused,

346
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,148
I'd tell him right now.

347
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,558
But if she's wrong, we'd
only make things worse.

348
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,364
He obviously
senses he's different.

349
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,460
He's looking for answers.

350
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,196
Every teenager feels different.

351
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:42,241
He's sick. This isn't the
time to spring this on him.

352
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,106
Okay.

353
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,879
When you give
Jackson the antibiotics,

354
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,079
will you please re-start
the testosterone?

355
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,382
Sure.

356
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,586
I get House wanting to jerk me
and Thirteen around, but you guys?

357
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,961
Told you they
were still together.

358
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,158
How'd he know?

359
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,793
He noticed you smell like
Thirteen's soap every morning.

360
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:10,926
You figured it out?

361
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,733
Yes, I'm a little slow.

362
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,367
Maybe someone should let me
know when I should be insulted.

363
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,035
Then House doesn't know.

364
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,669
Probably does now
that you felt her up

365
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,941
during that last differential.

366
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,745
You noticed this,
but House didn't?

367
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes, I get it. He's
generally smarter than me.

368
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,014
Can we please move on?

369
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,334
He's not generally
smarter than you,

370
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,260
he's always smarter than you.

371
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,590
Unless...

372
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,635
Hello?

373
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,068
House is on heroin.

374
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,274
Well, that's certainly
an interesting notion.

375
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,744
It's why his lungs stopped,
it's why he okayed the MRI,

376
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,250
it's why he missed things
he wouldn't ordinarily miss.

377
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,044
We'll run some tests,
and I'll let you know.

378
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,418
<i>He's there, isn't he?</i>

379
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,014
Well, that would certainly explain
the inappropriate responses.

380
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,286
I got to go. Okay.

381
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,186
Sorry. Consult.

382
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,195
When did you order these?

383
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,699
When you were in the bathroom.

384
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,464
I thought a celebration
was in order.

385
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,999
To cheating death.

386
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,215
You off bourbon? Can I
get you something else?

387
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,410
I came here expecting a burger.

388
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,386
Figured I'd have to endure
a little lecture on moderation.

389
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,945
You never listen, so why...

390
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,218
But instead, I get a drink.

391
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,327
A nice little serving of
respiratory depressant

392
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,454
on the day that my
lungs stopped working.

393
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,192
You seem fine now.

394
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,858
You don't believe
that I OD'd on Vicodin.

395
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,664
You figure I'm on
something stronger.

396
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,547
And because you can
never, ever assume anything

397
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,816
but the most screwed-up
scenario as far as I'm concerned...

398
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,468
Funny how I'm usually right.

399
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,738
You think that I'm on heroin.

400
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,412
This is your version of a tox
screen. Because if I am on heroin,

401
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,417
I can't drink that without risking
another bout of not breathing.

402
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,718
Well?

403
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,869
Good night.

404
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,170
Another shot?

405
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,838
I'm afraid so.

406
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,126
That looks like the
vitamins my parents give me.

407
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,675
Same red top.

408
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,795
These aren't vitamins.

409
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,457
What is it?

410
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,832
I can't tell you that. You
should ask your parents.

411
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,534
You idiot.

412
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,483
Okay, I admit
it. I have bulimia.

413
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,020
I look good though, don't I?

414
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,147
Heroin. Heroin!

415
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,623
House, of all the stupid...

416
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,092
I'm not on heroin.

417
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,629
I just caught you with your
fingers down your throat.

418
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,391
I'm on methadone.

419
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,998
Stupid product,
heroin without the high.

420
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,733
Yeah, and twice
the risk of death.

421
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,240
But no risk of arrest.

422
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,605
You nearly died.

423
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,473
Today was a fluke, I nodded off.

424
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,809
Right, you're safe as long
as you never sleep again.

425
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,180
Mis-time your dose, you
die, couple of drinks, you die,

426
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,082
mix it with the
wrong drugs, you die.

427
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,745
You want to detox from Vicodin,

428
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,756
pick something
that won't kill you.

429
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,519
I'm not detoxing.

430
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,789
If you're looking for something
to help with your pain.

431
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,765
It doesn't help my
pain. It eliminates it.

432
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,441
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

433
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,353
She completely
disregarded our instructions.

434
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,791
He asked a question.
I was tired of lying.

435
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,329
I didn't tell him anything
about his genetic condition.

436
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:33,127
I want her removed
from our son's case.

437
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:37,835
I'm sorry for the position Dr. Hadley
put you in, but I can't do that.

438
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,567
She's a valuable part of
Dr. House's diagnostic team.

439
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,802
If he stays on the
case, so does she.

440
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,105
We have to deal with Jackson.

441
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,942
These questions
aren't going to go away.

442
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,073
He's not ready for this.

443
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,120
Let's hope you're wrong.

444
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,762
I'm sorry. I'll stay
away from their son.

445
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,797
No, you won't.

446
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,061
In about 15 minutes, you're the
only person that kid's gonna trust.

447
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,695
If he needs a hand to hold,
make sure yours is available.

448
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,337
So, what, am I a boy or a girl?

449
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:28,314
Some of your cells are
male, and some are female.

450
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,321
So, basically, I'm a freak.

451
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,119
No, no, buddy.

452
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,787
You're just a little different.

453
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:43,864
You've known this since I was
born and you never told me?

454
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,871
We didn't want
you to be confused.

455
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,270
So, you lied to me.

456
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,832
Oh, please, sweetie, we
were just trying to protect you.

457
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,172
Don't.

458
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,310
Just leave me alone.

459
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,115
Get out.

460
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,852
Let's go.

461
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,127
You still breathing in there?

462
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,968
Because if not, I'm
sending in janitorial.

463
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,307
I'm not breathing, but
it's strictly voluntary.

464
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,188
You should've seen the guy
who was in here before me.

465
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,238
I know about the methadone.

466
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,717
It's legal. I have
a prescription.

467
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,254
Whatever doctor you
conned into writing it

468
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,867
clearly had no idea about your
addiction issues, your lack of...

469
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:42,658
He knows I'm in pain. What I
put in my body is my business.

470
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,425
If you keep taking
this, you could die.

471
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,796
If he'd said that if I keep
doing this, you could die,

472
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,528
then it'd be your business.

473
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,929
I can't sit by and
watch you kill yourself.

474
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,567
As long as you're in my
hospital, you can't do methadone.

475
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,583
I'll send someone for my stuff.

476
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,055
That's it? You're quitting?

477
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,424
You're choosing
methadone over this job?

478
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,060
I'm choosing lack
of pain over this job.

479
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,967
Eventually you have to
talk to your parents again.

480
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,545
No, I don't.

481
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:49,261
I have this one friend on
my basketball team, Will.

482
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:53,763
We hang out a
lot. I really like him.

483
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,597
Now I'm worried that I,

484
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,137
you know, like him.

485
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,542
Maybe I'm supposed to.

486
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,977
Because if I'm really a girl...

487
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,285
Do you feel like a girl?

488
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:18,347
I like dancing more
than basketball.

489
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,721
Is that what that means?

490
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,027
Jackson,

491
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:34,299
as hard as it is right now,
at least it's out in the open.

492
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,569
You don't have to
hide behind a mask.

493
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,014
I found the poem you
wrote in your room.

494
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,716
No matter how bad things get,

495
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,192
killing yourself is
never the answer.

496
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,833
This was an English assignment.

497
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,706
We were supposed to write a poem

498
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,833
in the style of Sylvia Plath.

499
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,515
You don't feel this way?

500
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,279
I'm sad sometimes.

501
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,556
But I don't want to die.

502
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,688
At least, I didn't.

503
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,369
Are these antibiotics supposed
to make you nauseous?

504
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,237
Yeah, they can.

505
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,810
We're on our own. Is he okay?

506
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,252
He's fine. He's just not here.

507
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,846
Did he quit? Did
she suspend him?

508
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,788
She didn't say. Just
told me I was in charge

509
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,486
until further notice.

510
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,959
So, if we add bloody vomit

511
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,620
to our patient's
list of symptoms...

512
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,495
Surgeon reports the bleeding
was caused by a gastric fistula

513
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,056
caused by necrotizing
pancreatitis.

514
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,414
She must have
told you something.

515
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,012
Nothing that would
help us with this patient.

516
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,164
Heart, liver, kidneys
and pancreas.

517
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,175
Obviously, whatever this kid's
got, it's something systemic.

518
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,402
Zollinger-Ellison.

519
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,275
Or systemic scleroderma.

520
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,313
Zollinger-Ellison fits better.

521
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,406
Why?

522
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,712
Can we at least call House?

523
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,913
We can, I have,
he's not answering.

524
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,921
Put the patient on
proton pump inhibitors.

525
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:08,154
If he gets better, it's Zollinger-Ellison.
If not, it's scleroderma.

526
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,862
Zollinger-Ellison
doesn't fit better.

527
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,430
You don't want it
to be scleroderma

528
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,267
because that means
he's going to die.

529
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:21,431
Patients die all the time.

530
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,533
Not the ones whose
families you've ruined.

531
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,101
I don't think that, you do.

532
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,309
It's not your fault.

533
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,441
He was no more confused
than any other teenager,

534
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,418
then I started a fire
and threw gas on it.

535
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,749
You were trying to help.

536
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,658
Hi, is House here?

537
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,221
He's getting dressed.

538
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,768
I'll be back around
10:00 tonight.

539
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,135
Go on in.

540
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,297
Okay.

541
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,267
Who is she?

542
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,972
I hired her to watch me sleep,

543
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,412
make sure I don't
stop breathing.

544
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,383
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.

545
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,112
She's not a nurse.

546
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:12,081
You hired a hooker to watch
you sleep? That just can't...

547
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,992
Surprisingly,
hookers are cheaper.

548
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,259
They don't sue for sexual
harassment. Which one?

549
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,632
You shaved!

550
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,771
The red one then.

551
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,931
You have two ties?

552
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,975
Meeting at St.
Sebastian's today.

553
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,566
I'm going to try
and talk them into

554
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,475
starting up a
diagnostics department.

555
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,207
That sounds great.

556
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:40,009
I just came by to check up on
you, see how you were doing.

557
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:42,785
I'm fine.

558
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,023
I guess you are.

559
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,222
He hasn't responded
to the medication at all?

560
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,854
I'm afraid not.

561
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,798
So, that means he's
got the other thing?

562
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,737
I'm so sorry. We'll start
him on anti-inflammatories.

563
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,207
If we're lucky, that will
slow down the progression.

564
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,816
My son has a death sentence,

565
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,754
and I can't go in there and
be with him because of you.

566
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,051
I'm sorry.

567
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,991
You find a homework assignment
and decide he's suicidal,

568
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,359
make it your own
personal mission.

569
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,488
I let my feelings...

570
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,033
Oh, don't you dare apologize.

571
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,590
Like it could absolve you

572
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,228
of what you've done
to me, my family.

573
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,805
He was fine.

574
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,171
I understand why you're angry.

575
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,233
But this isn't where
you belong right now.

576
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,676
He won't let us in the room.

577
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,441
He's a teenager,
you're his mother.

578
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,745
This is not the time
to start listening to him.

579
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,375
Go be with him.

580
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,560
Thank you.

581
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,923
I didn't do it for you.

582
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,834
We made a mistake.

583
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,102
No, we didn't.

584
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,471
The methadone is good for him.

585
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,637
The methadone is gonna kill him.

586
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,112
He shaved. He was wearing a tie.

587
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,047
He has a meeting
at St. Sebastian.

588
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,414
If he buys a new pair of shoes,

589
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,850
should we let him smoke crack?

590
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,820
Cuddy, he's happy.

591
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,449
House doesn't do
happy, pain or no pain.

592
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,553
Okay, maybe.

593
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,391
But he's our friend,

594
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,766
and this is his one
chance to not be miserable.

595
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,154
The heels, very nice.

596
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,563
No reason not to wear
them now that House is gone.

597
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,963
You okay?

598
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,899
Yeah. Just tired.

599
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,560
Got some good news.

600
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,572
The patient's scleroderma is
responding to the anti-inflammatory meds.

601
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,199
His AST level has dropped a bit.

602
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,573
So, he's dying slightly
less quickly than we thought.

603
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,704
That's great news.

604
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,573
I'm not okay.

605
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,012
Next time, just say that.

606
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,582
What's his AST?

607
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,855
185, I think.

608
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,020
That's a pretty fast drop.

609
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,839
Are we sure it's from
the anti-inflammatories?

610
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,575
What else could it be from? He's
been off the antibiotics for a while.

611
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,710
Proton pump
inhibitors wouldn't...

612
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:43,793
He's back on testosterone.

613
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,546
Testosterone wouldn't
help his liver function.

614
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,170
But it could improve
his kidney function,

615
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,367
which would also lower his AST.

616
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,342
But not in kidneys
damaged by scleroderma.

617
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,004
Which means it's
not scleroderma.

618
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,378
I have an interview
in two hours.

619
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,882
Wow.

620
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,721
Hand over my letter
of recommendation.

621
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,226
Sorry, I haven't done it yet.

622
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,395
You have no right to sabotage...

623
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,295
I was busy with this.

624
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,631
It's a list of requirements
for your methadone treatment.

625
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:23,038
Weekly drug tests, supervised doses
administered on a precise schedule,

626
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,577
by me or one of the nurses.

627
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,975
Seems weird,
getting my meds here,

628
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,480
when I'm working somewhere else.

629
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,708
Yes.

630
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,252
I'm offering you your job back.

631
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,156
I want a raise.

632
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,248
No.

633
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,523
And a bigger office,
but in the same spot.

634
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,858
No.

635
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,165
We both know this
is where you belong.

636
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,065
Okay.

637
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,965
Welcome back.

638
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,683
Thank you.

639
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,978
You're welcome.

640
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,959
You okay?

641
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,933
I have issues with
authority. You?

642
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,993
We thought you were gone.

643
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,162
Cuddy missed me.

644
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,865
And what happened to your cane?

645
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,534
She asked to borrow
it for some reason.

646
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,442
Patient dead, or do I
need to do anything?

647
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,638
He's got scleroderma.

648
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,510
It's not scleroderma.

649
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:41,643
Wow, two days and you've
already got two separate theories.

650
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,950
You're back. Good.

651
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,388
We noticed a drop in AST levels.

652
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,834
It's not from the
anti-inflammatory.

653
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,836
It's because his kidneys got
better from the testosterone.

654
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,022
Which rules out scleroderma.

655
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,124
When did you two
come up with this?

656
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,895
We ran into each
other in the lobby.

657
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,402
So, what'd we miss?

658
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,564
When I say "we," I mean
you, since I wasn't here.

659
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,574
We've ruled out
Zollinger-Ellison.

660
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,802
That was a dumb idea.

661
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,742
Why? Because it was wrong.

662
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:11,749
Also Toxoplasmosis, dehydration,
SLE, various intersex disorders.

663
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,148
Oh, crap.

664
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,814
Does this kid like
energy drinks?

665
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,121
I saw some empty bottles
in the team's locker room.

666
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,593
But energy drinks
don't explain...

667
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,685
Nice work.

668
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,560
So, we're okay?

669
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,528
Why wouldn't we be?

670
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,926
Nice heels.

671
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,612
This is all your parents' fault.

672
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,874
Excuse me?

673
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:47,043
You chug a lot of energy drinks
before, during and after practice?

674
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,086
Your son came in here
with simple dehydration.

675
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,123
That's why he collapsed
during the game.

676
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,352
The ER treated him for
that. It didn't help the pain.

677
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,258
That's where the
energy drinks came in.

678
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,539
They put a strain
on his kidneys,

679
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,590
so he needed more time to
rebound from the initial dehydration.

680
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,792
Then why isn't he better?

681
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,598
That's where your
idiocy came in.

682
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,604
Before we could give
him another glass of water,

683
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,901
you two insisted I do an MRI.

684
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,435
So, I go down a blind alley,
looking for a blind uterus,

685
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,707
and my team injects
him with contrast material.

686
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,948
<i>If his kidneys had been healthy,</i>

687
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,485
<i>he would've filtered out the
contrast in a couple of hours.</i>

688
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,953
<i>Since they weren't, it
went around and around,</i>

689
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,775
<i>eventually getting absorbed by
his heart, his liver and his pancreas,</i>

690
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,884
<i>getting in trouble
everywhere it went.</i>

691
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,927
Your son was fine
when he got here.

692
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:36,491
It was your freaked-out
over-protectiveness that nearly killed him.

693
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,830
Nearly?

694
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:43,468
He's young. A few weeks
of dialysis, he should be fine.

695
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,347
You gave birth to
a freak of nature,

696
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,752
doesn't mean it's a good
idea to treat him like one.

697
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,496
How are you feeling?

698
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,128
A little bit better.

699
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,766
I saw you talking to your
parents earlier, that's good.

700
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,276
My mom asked if I wanted
to take dance lessons.

701
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,835
That's great.

702
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,542
I'm actually worried I
might miss basketball.

703
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,174
I was starting to get good.

704
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,877
No reason you can't do both.

705
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,469
Starting tomorrow, you'll
come to my office for your fix.

706
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,808
I'm done with the methadone.

707
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,475
I screwed up.

708
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,881
The kid's parents
wanted that MRI.

709
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,148
I knew he didn't
need it. I did it anyway.

710
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,484
That's what got him sick.

711
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,156
You just solved a case
that no one else could solve.

712
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,161
I created a case.

713
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:15,428
I played nice because I was in a
good mood because it didn't hurt.

714
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,764
You don't need your
pain to be a good doctor.

715
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,064
I'm not interested in good.

716
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,867
You're afraid to be happy.

717
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,237
Why do you care if I'm happy?

718
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:34,880
You're afraid of change. The
one thing you have is your intellect.

719
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,150
You think if that's
compromised, you have nothing.

720
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,195
Just take it.

721
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,696
No.

722
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,389
Don't do this.

723
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,597
It's already done.

724
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,601
This is the only me you get.
