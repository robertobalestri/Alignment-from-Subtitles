1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,566
We're starting a fund.
Then you don't need me.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,642
The man's injured,
can't work. His fault.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,105
We're family, we
depend on each other.

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,346
We're not family,
we're co-workers.

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,512
He's not even that anymore.

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,283
I can't believe
you just said that.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,053
Can't come between a
man and his beer money.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,718
See the big heavy machinery?

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,786
I'm sorry, but he
should give. You gave.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,556
Go back to work.

11
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,629
Paolo is the one who
got you off the night shift.

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,605
It's not like I asked him.

13
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,477
Also covered for you
Labor Day weekend.

14
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,940
But, hey, it's America, if
you don't want to contribute...

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,948
If you don't want to...

16
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,437
Oh, gosh.

17
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,913
Get an ambulance.

18
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,125
Morning. Don't want to hear it.

19
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,165
So, I take it you did
not ask Cuddy out.

20
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,231
Yeah.

21
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,409
"Yeah" I didn't or "Yeah" I did?

22
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,699
Whichever one means you almost
had me convinced it was a good idea.

23
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,102
Oh.

24
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,378
Nothing to say? No.

25
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,504
"No" you don't or
"No" you don't don't.

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,048
Whichever one means no.

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,010
Is this some kind
of a reverse... No.

28
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:34,915
House?

29
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,162
Sixteen-year-old girl
with fluid in her lungs.

30
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,397
No previous trauma,
lung or cardiac issues.

31
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,701
Gram stain was negative,
no bacteria, no pneumonia.

32
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,767
She's a factory worker, means she probably
works close to a lot of recent immigrants.

33
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,981
Thank God some of those offshore
sweatshop jobs are coming back to America.

34
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,880
She's an emancipated minor.

35
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,350
In a factory?

36
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,955
Either an Olympic
gymnast who busted her leg,

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,390
a child star who blew all
her sequel money on drugs,

38
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,155
or she's just a lying runaway.

39
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,753
Her parents died
last year. No relatives.

40
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,595
To avoid foster care, she got
a GED and got emancipated.

41
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,544
Could have picked up a
parasite from a co-worker.

42
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,231
She'd be having GI problems.
Pregnancy's more likely.

43
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,399
Sparks a fluid overload, hits the
lungs, causes the pulmonary edema.

44
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,154
Her history says she's
not sexually active.

45
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,508
And our history says
she could be lying.

46
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,570
But not every
teenager is having sex.

47
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,479
But every teenager is stupid.

48
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,415
Teenagers on their
own are stupider.

49
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,010
The girl's holding down
a job, makes her rent.

50
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,488
On the one hand, Kutner's right,

51
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,651
maybe she's a sweet young thing who's
not a screw-up lying through her teeth.

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,696
On the two hand, pregnancy
test only takes five minutes,

53
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,129
and we no longer kill rabbits,

54
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,600
so, in conclusion, shut
up, do the test. What else?

55
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,897
Drugs could damage the heart.

56
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,147
Pressure imbalance allows
fluid to build up in the lungs.

57
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,264
Tox screen's clean.

58
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,776
For drugs used recently, not
for drugs used before recently.

59
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,608
Sixteen doesn't automatically
mean a risky lifestyle.

60
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,223
Didn't we just have
this conversation?

61
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:12,083
Kutner trusts her, someone else
doesn't. So, in conclusion, shut up,

62
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,485
check her home and
work for toxins or drugs.

63
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,182
Kutner and Foreman, do an echo,

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,952
find the extent of
the heart damage.

65
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,825
Kutner can do the
echo on his own.

66
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,963
Yes, but he'll be very lonely,

67
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,868
so I have to ask why.

68
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,411
I've been asked to
help run a clinical trial.

69
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,738
That okay with you?

70
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,151
Good for your career, great for
your street cred. What's in it for me?

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,247
You have four doctors and
never more than one case.

72
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,223
Means I have time to
work on other things,

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,694
and they all have more chances
to step up, stand on their own.

74
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,857
And if there is an
emergency with Annie,

75
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,094
should she wait until you
finish grooming lab rats?

76
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,500
If there's a problem
with Sophia,

77
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,004
or any other patient,
you know I'll be there.

78
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,596
Your patient is my priority.

79
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,671
No.

80
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,972
What? You want a reason?

81
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,218
Clinical trials take time,
your time is my time.

82
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,530
I told you, I don't do drugs.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,228
Still a good idea
to check your heart.

84
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,294
Something else
could've damaged it.

85
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,396
You find it hard,
being all on your own?

86
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,168
Having to do
everything without...

87
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,504
Drugs to ease my pain?

88
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,239
That's not... A
teenager on her own,

89
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,837
I wouldn't trust me either.

90
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,905
I meant it must be hard.

91
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,414
No one there to back you up.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,154
I know you're trying to be nice,
but I'm not into the whole pity thing.

93
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,658
I was actually doing
the "I get it" thing.

94
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,251
I lost my parents
when I was six.

95
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:06,192
It doesn't go away, but it
gets easier. You learn to deal.

96
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,900
I still get nervous when
there's a knock on the door.

97
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:17,240
Always think it's the state
trooper with more bad news.

98
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,715
You already got the worst news
and survived. That's sort of the upside.

99
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,845
Your heart's healthy.

100
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,188
Isn't that good news?

101
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,420
For your heart, yeah, but it also
means we still don't know what's wrong.

102
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,027
Check book balanced,
place spotless,

103
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,036
looks like she builds
her own furniture.

104
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,096
If you're this grown-up at
16, what happens at 30?

105
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,971
You turn back into
a kid, like Kutner.

106
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,271
Kutner's not that bad.

107
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,747
He needs everything to be nice,
wants to see the best in everyone.

108
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,682
Kitchen's clear. Yeah,
friendly is a dangerous thing.

109
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,583
There is such a
thing as too trusting.

110
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,714
Corollary is there's such a
thing as not trusting enough.

111
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,486
Too much, you get hurt.
Not enough, you don't live.

112
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,087
So, the object in life is to
get hurt just the right amount?

113
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,692
Excuse me if I don't go out of my
way to take relationship advice from you.

114
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,102
And trust should be earned.

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,277
Bong means nothing,
drugs are irrelevant.

116
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,610
Relevant if she's taking them.

117
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,709
Even if she is, irrelevant.
Echo showed no heart damage.

118
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,822
Would that be the echo that
Foreman chose not to run with you

119
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,485
after I dashed his new
drug discovery dreams?

120
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,771
You mad at me because you
think Kutner screwed up the echo?

121
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,922
I didn't screw up the echo.

122
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,397
I know. No structural
heart damage.

123
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,900
So, if it's not the
heart... It's the heart.

124
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,459
Didn't you just say it's not?

125
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,630
Not all heart damage
has to be structural.

126
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,303
Drugs could have caused
intermittent tachycardia.

127
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,585
Irregular heartbeat would
account for the pulmonary edema.

128
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,703
Edema was acute,
vasculitis makes more sense.

129
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,022
There's no sign
in her blood work,

130
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,726
and if she had vasculitis, she'd
be too weak to work in the factory.

131
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,910
She builds her own furniture,
you think she skips work

132
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,080
'cause she's feeling a little
weak? She needs steroids.

133
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,123
Steroids could cause
an irregular heartbeat,

134
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,853
making her current
one irregular-er.

135
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,190
Foreman, start her
on beta-blockers.

136
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,994
Rest of you, do anything that
isn't starting her on beta-blockers.

137
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,006
Start her on the treatment.
Page me if you need me.

138
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,347
Irregular heartbeat causes blood to back
up behind the heart and into the lungs.

139
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,385
The beta-blockers keep
this from happening.

140
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,181
I thought the test
showed my heart was fine.

141
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,518
It's tricky. An arrhythmia
can come and go.

142
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,284
So, you don't
believe me or the test.

143
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,629
You guys are more
cynical than I am.

144
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,998
We found the bong
in your apartment.

145
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,359
You went into my apartment?

146
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,960
Extended drug use can damage...

147
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,405
The bong belongs to
my ex. It's why he's ex.

148
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,339
That doesn't mean
you didn't use it.

149
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,103
No.

150
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,840
You have no reason to trust me.

151
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,843
You have to do your treatment.

152
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,119
The other possibility
is you have vasculitis.

153
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,658
The treatment
for that is steroids.

154
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,160
If you've been using drugs, if
they've damaged your heart,

155
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,890
and I start you on
steroids, they could kill you.

156
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,559
I haven't used drugs.

157
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,408
I'll get the steroids.

158
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,318
Why are you here?

159
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,378
I owe clinic hours.
No, you don't.

160
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,349
I'm here because House
doesn't want me to be here.

161
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,950
I'm guessing he said
no to the clinical trials.

162
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,758
He didn't need to say no,
he just wanted to say no.

163
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,390
House did something
solely out of self-interest?

164
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,798
Freaky.

165
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,336
Don't suppose you
want to override... No.

166
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,663
What do you think
this is going to prove?

167
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,641
Does it matter? Just figured you
could use some help down here.

168
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,440
And you spending two hours
wiping noses will annoy House.

169
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,606
If that is your
dream, God bless.

170
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,345
If you want to prove you can
do his job and something more...

171
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,959
His puke is red.
That's blood, right?

172
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,392
That hurt?

173
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,932
How about that?

174
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,169
Four days he's been like
this. It's just getting worse.

175
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,672
Maybe he just needs to poop.

176
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,640
Evan. What?

177
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,734
Worked last time I
had a stomach ache.

178
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,403
That's actually a smart idea,

179
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,141
which is why that's the first
thing the other doctors checked.

180
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,842
His insides are clear.

181
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,579
Anyone else sick
at day-care? No.

182
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,314
How about his
friends? No. No one.

183
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,652
What's happening
to him? Not sure yet.

184
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,888
Don't worry, I've got an idea.

185
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,625
You can make him better, right?

186
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,059
That's my plan.

187
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,829
You need to make him better.

188
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,008
Stay the hell away from me.

189
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,475
Just calm down.

190
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,544
What happened?

191
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,102
I adjusted her IV,
and she went crazy.

192
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,648
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

193
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,314
Sophia, it's okay, we're here to
help you. Just stay away from me!

194
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,716
Don't touch me!

195
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:31,720
I said don't... Get
your hands off of me.

196
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,815
Get your hands...

197
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,327
Beta-blockers don't
cause psychotic breaks.

198
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,586
She's not on beta-blockers.

199
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,651
<i>We started her on
haloperidol, she's stable.</i>

200
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,440
Lab tests show the delirium wasn't
caused by a metabolic problem.

201
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,721
Means we still don't
know what caused it.

202
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,941
Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman.

203
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,209
I didn't switch her meds.

204
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,808
But your decision
to stick it to the man

205
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,081
clearly inspired Oliver Twist.

206
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,214
I treated her based on the
symptoms she presented.

207
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,554
You treated her based on
empathetic orphan syndrome,

208
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,490
and almost killed
her in the process.

209
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,496
She wasn't on steroids long
enough for it to cause the delirium.

210
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,998
It's a new symptom. One
that rules out vasculitis.

211
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,298
And arrhythmia. The psychotic
break caused a surge of adrenaline,

212
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:20,204
but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's
not the problem. We're both wrong.

213
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,201
So, what causes lung
issues and delirium

214
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,510
and is not based on wishful
thinking that she's safe and happy?

215
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,677
Prinzmetal angina.

216
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,291
Silent and unhappy is better
than vocal and unhelpful.

217
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,369
If you'd run the echo
that you didn't run

218
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,504
before giving her the
beta-blockers that you didn't give her,

219
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,839
if you'd listened to
what Kutner said,

220
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,174
you'd know it's not
a heart problem.

221
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,343
I'm not talking about her
heart, I'm talking about her head.

222
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,801
Prinzmetal angina
doesn't affect...

223
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,963
No reason it couldn't cause
an artery in the brain to spasm.

224
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,473
Leads to the delirium
and the pulmonary edema.

225
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,540
Foreman, give her Ergonovine
to cause vasospasms

226
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,640
and run an fMRI to see
which artery's dancing.

227
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,981
And when I say
Foreman, I mean Foreman.

228
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,351
I want his signature on the
paperwork. I want videotape.

229
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,790
I want photographs of him with
the patient and today's newspaper.

230
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,419
Set her up. When you're ready...

231
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,691
House wants you...

232
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,565
To do the procedure. When you
get everything set up, page me.

233
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,438
That's really a camera?
Pretty cool, huh?

234
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,006
This can go places
the other scopes can't.

235
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,882
Jonah, I need you
to swallow this pill.

236
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,548
Don't wanna. It
doesn't hurt, promise.

237
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,623
Jonah, please, this will
help make you better.

238
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,865
I don't want to be mean, but if you
don't do this, we'll have to make you.

239
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,704
It's a power pill. It's not just a
camera, it makes your muscles grow.

240
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:05,268
Like the vitamins we take, except
this was made with a secret formula.

241
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,082
You did great, sweetheart.
You're very brave.

242
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:24,119
Jonah's lucky. I was pretty cruel to
my little brother when I was your age.

243
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,665
Why?

244
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,294
I guess I thought it's what big
brothers did. Obviously, I was wrong.

245
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,897
Is he a doctor, too?

246
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,299
No.

247
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,870
Does the pill tickle, sweetie?

248
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,916
He can't feel it. What's
funny? Your brother?

249
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,648
What's happening? I don't know.

250
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,859
How are you guys getting along?

251
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,891
And you suddenly care why?

252
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,458
House was asking
questions last week.

253
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,662
I assume Foreman needs us,

254
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,262
and he's worried that if we're
sniping, we might be distracted.

255
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,672
That's kind of
insulting, isn't it? Very.

256
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,209
You're obviously fine.

257
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,044
I need a differential for
uncontrollable giggling.

258
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,912
He's four, they laugh.

259
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,290
Yeah, nothing like
diarrhea and bloody

260
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,781
vomit to put you in the
mood to goof around.

261
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,551
I've looked down one
end and up the other.

262
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,389
All the tests came back
clean. Can't figure this out.

263
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,022
You can't? Don't you work with three
other doctors and a grouchy gimp?

264
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,933
This isn't House's case.

265
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,601
Just so you know, whatever you're
trying to prove, it won't be enough.

266
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,205
Gotta go.

267
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,980
Sorry.

268
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,753
You didn't miss
much. No spasms yet.

269
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,853
Nothing in the anterior or
posterior cerebral arteries.

270
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,388
<i>How much longer?</i>
Just a few more minutes.

271
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,144
Were your foster homes all around
here, or did you have to change schools?

272
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,536
Is chatting about lousy foster
parents supposed to relax me?

273
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,268
Left middle cerebral
artery looks good.

274
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,900
My foster parents were great.

275
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,105
I think most foster parents do it
because they want to do something decent.

276
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,842
Which is why you
didn't get emancipated.

277
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,943
Nothing around the vertebral
artery. No sign of spasms.

278
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,317
But that's odd.

279
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,950
How'd you find out
about your parents?

280
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,084
Told you. State trooper.

281
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,058
Look at that.

282
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,427
Arteries are fine. You can stop.

283
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,262
Not that.

284
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,963
I forget. Did he come to your
house, or call you down to the station?

285
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,837
Came to my house. I cried
into the guy's shirt for an hour.

286
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,540
Wow.

287
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,912
FMRIs tell us where
the blood flow is.

288
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,540
You were using
your limbic region.

289
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,414
Lights up when we
use our imagination,

290
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:00,644
doesn't light up when
we're telling the truth.

291
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,752
Your parents aren't
dead, are they?

292
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,956
I risked my job, put you
on a different treatment.

293
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,222
I didn't lie about the drugs.

294
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,472
Then why lie about your parents?

295
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,624
Because I wish they were dead.

296
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,269
I got emancipated
because my dad raped me,

297
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,136
and my mom pretended
it didn't happen.

298
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,942
No signs of spasm,
impeded blood flow,

299
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,249
or brain dysfunction.
It's not Prinzmetal's.

300
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,654
All the fMRI showed is
House was right. She was lying.

301
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,487
Only relevant if it could cause
pulmonary edema and delirium.

302
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,225
We find out our patient's been
raped, and that's your response?

303
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,823
Is she a psych patient?

304
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,164
Rape could mean STD.

305
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,171
Thank goodness, one of
you doesn't have a heart.

306
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,003
Maybe if we all stop wringing
our hands, we could solve this thing

307
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,010
and let her live to have
a few more nightmares.

308
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,173
Gonococcal endocarditis would explain
the pulmonary edema, the delirium.

309
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,739
No sign in her blood work.

310
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,213
Could be lying about the rape.

311
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,717
Yesterday, you were all BFF,
now you think she's pathological.

312
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,352
Yesterday, I had no
reason to doubt her.

313
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,971
If she'd been honest with
us from the beginning...

314
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:19,591
She lied about dead parents
because it's better than rapist parents.

315
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,156
You find that unsympathetic?

316
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,792
That's it. What's it?

317
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,838
Her whole life's a mess.
What rhymes with mess?

318
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,770
It's not stress. She has none
of the usual manifestations.

319
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,573
No hormone
imbalance, no cardiac...

320
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,957
Yeah, she's drowning in her
own lungs, and she's delirious.

321
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,643
She's a picture of
emotional health.

322
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,982
Severe emotional stress can lead to
asymmetric function of the mid-brain.

323
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,418
Explains the delirium.

324
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,924
Interruption in the brain-heart
coupling could cause pulmonary edema.

325
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,962
Even if House is wrong, the
treatment's basically anti-anxiety meds.

326
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,826
Hard to argue with.

327
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,866
Yes, I agree, it does
explain everything.

328
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,260
Thirteen, load her up on diazepam.
Foreman, make sure she does it.

329
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,966
Thirteen, make
sure he makes sure.

330
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,708
I went to Cuddy's house.

331
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,873
But I didn't go in.

332
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:16,451
Went home without ringing either
her metaphorical or actual bell.

333
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,251
Huh.

334
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,794
You're processing.

335
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,352
I'm scrubbing.

336
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,493
"Huh" means processing.

337
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,897
"Huh" means acknowledging.

338
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,062
If you prefer, I could
say "hah" or "hmm" or...

339
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,231
No insights? No opinions?

340
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,703
You're disappointed.
You made a decision.

341
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,678
I can't tell you
what's right for you.

342
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,909
Seriously? Because
last week you could.

343
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,542
Last year, you could. Seems
to come pretty easy to you.

344
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,951
Do you want me to tell
you what you should do?

345
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,087
I want you to stop thinking

346
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,388
that acting inscrutable makes
you anything other than annoying.

347
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,560
Interesting.

348
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,100
Holding things in
can give you cancer.

349
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,904
Kid's in day-care,
could be meningitis.

350
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,669
No fever, no stiffness, no rash.

351
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,903
You check his thyroid?

352
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,207
TSH, T3, T4 were within range.

353
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,577
Ruled out all the
usual suspects.

354
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,945
Nothing's usual
for a 4-year-old.

355
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,126
And as fun as this is, it
feels like we're your goomah.

356
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,709
Your feelings are hurt?

357
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,430
Either you can handle both
these cases or you can't.

358
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,252
If you can't, it's
dangerous and stupid.

359
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,020
On the other hand, stomach
cancer, leiomyosarcoma.

360
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,688
Long shot. Altered mental status
means porphyria's more likely.

361
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,359
No abdominal pain. Cancer
explains the lethargy, the GI symptoms.

362
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,833
Neither is perfect.

363
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,900
Then we test for both.

364
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,099
And by "we" you mean
the collective, not you?

365
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,369
Thanks.

366
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:50,007
Severe stress scrambles the way the brain
communicates with the rest of the body.

367
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,607
I have a problem with my brain?

368
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,382
Not exactly. The problem would
be with your body chemistry.

369
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,854
Where's Dr. Kutner?

370
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,948
There's four of
us, it's my turn.

371
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,659
I'm sorry I lied
about my parents.

372
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,299
You did what you thought you
had to do to protect yourself.

373
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,400
If we're right, we should see a
change in your lungs pretty fast.

374
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,168
Then we can figure out
how to manage your stress.

375
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:19,337
It might help to turn him in,
file a police report. Get closure.

376
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,640
Won't help.

377
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,673
Not addressing what
happened won't make it go away.

378
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,687
Yeah? What do I have
to do to make it go away?

379
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,824
I didn't mean that. I
just mean that you...

380
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,554
I addressed it. I
got away from him.

381
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,189
Reporting it just labels
me "girl raped by dad."

382
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,927
It doesn't have to define you.

383
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,662
It's how you see me.

384
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,338
It's why you're treating
me with tranquillizers.

385
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,839
Not anymore.

386
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,703
Stress wouldn't
change your urine color.

387
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,046
Labs show the brown urine
was caused by shredded red cells.

388
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,355
So, what messes with her
lungs, her mental status,

389
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,827
and runs her blood
through a wood chipper?

390
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,735
Factory lunch rooms
aren't the cleanest places.

391
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,959
Could have picked up E. coli.

392
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,364
Or Shigella, from the restroom.

393
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,344
Either would account for
the red cells, the delirium.

394
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,702
But not the original lung symptoms.
Legionnaire's could and cause delirium.

395
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:20,967
No, her sodium's normal.

396
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,134
What did her
furniture look like?

397
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,880
You said it was
homemade. Old boxes, what?

398
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,316
It was wood, nailed together.

399
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,717
The wood have
little dents or holes?

400
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,154
I didn't see any on the
bookshelves, but they were painted.

401
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,455
The desk did. Looked like
she'd stapled stuff all over it.

402
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,519
Holes means that it
was pressure treated.

403
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:47,499
Sawing or burning it releases
arsenic into the air and into her lungs.

404
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,795
Tests didn't show...

405
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,133
'Cause it found a cloak
of invisibility hiding...

406
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,991
Arsenic gets absorbed
in the internal organs

407
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,662
so it doesn't show
up on the blood test.

408
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,199
Test her hair. If it's positive,
chelate it out of her blood.

409
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,449
<i>No cancer, no porphyria.</i>

410
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,784
You paged me with
negative test results?

411
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,916
Yes, because it
means we're done.

412
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,469
Since we still don't
know what's wrong,

413
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,689
this kid has a real problem.

414
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,162
Talk to House? Not his case.

415
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:26,002
There's a point when
Cameron and I aren't enough.

416
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,403
We're not there.

417
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,476
We need to run some more tests.

418
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,506
A week ago, he was a happy
little boy, playing with his brother,

419
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,575
and now he can
barely lift his head.

420
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:40,962
We'll figure this
out. I just need...

421
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,217
Mom. Help.

422
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,124
We need a crash cart.

423
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,391
What's going on?
He's in cardiac arrest.

424
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,759
Get them out of here.

425
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,870
Clear. Nothing. Go again.

426
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,380
Clear. He's back.

427
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,710
Foreman, we're there.

428
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,661
Chelation's complete.
You're arsenic-free.

429
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,429
So, I can get out of here?

430
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,966
In the morning.

431
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:38,510
That's it? No advice? No,
"Be careful out there, kiddo"?

432
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,878
You want my advice?

433
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,042
Want is one thing,
expect is another.

434
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,713
I wish I could tell
you what to do.

435
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,521
But you're strong. You've
made good choices. You'll be fine.

436
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,558
Thanks.

437
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,476
Need four milligrams
of Lorazepam.

438
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,358
After the seizure,
we ran a new MRI.

439
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:31,295
This is Sophia's brain three
days ago, this is her brain today.

440
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,026
Lesions.

441
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,331
Magical lesions, which
appear out of nowhere.

442
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,232
She was cured, then she wasn't.

443
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,070
Lesions grew
too fast for cancer.

444
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,770
Could be infection, MRSA.

445
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,176
WBC count would
be through the roof.

446
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,646
Put the arsenic back.

447
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,708
You wanna treat a patient nearly poisoned
to death by giving her more poison?

448
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,880
Just because we call something a
poison doesn't mean it's bad for you.

449
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,081
It was killing her.

450
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,388
But since she's still dying, the
arsenic, obviously, wasn't killing her.

451
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:04,897
And since she's now getting worse, the
arsenic was obviously fighting the killer.

452
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,456
It's a hero. We should
be organizing a parade.

453
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,227
So, what does arsenic treat?

454
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,103
Syphilis. Before penicillin,
the treatment was arsenic.

455
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,302
We already ruled out STDs,
and even if we were wrong,

456
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,278
that much arsenic in her system
would have wiped out the syphilis.

457
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,110
Acute promyelocytic leukemia
is still treated with arsenic.

458
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:28,120
APL explains the lesions and why they
appeared after we took the arsenic out.

459
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,588
So, put the arsenic back.

460
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:34,093
We still have a problem. Arsenic
slows leukemia, but it can't cure it.

461
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,856
If she wants to see 17, she's gonna
need a bone marrow transplant.

462
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,831
The best match would
be a sibling or a parent.

463
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:44,859
Biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's
dying, and load her up with arsenic.

464
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,464
Keep her alive till you
can convince her that

465
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,940
rapist marrow and
rapist-enabling marrow

466
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,204
work just as well as
the unleaded stuff.

467
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,215
We need to talk.

468
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,809
This about the case you
didn't want me to know about?

469
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,582
Cuddy? Foreman.

470
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,867
You didn't flinch when
you found out about

471
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,089
a 16-year-old who could
be dying in the next few days.

472
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,858
Means you're here about someone
even younger, dying even faster.

473
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,765
He needs you. But he has you.

474
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,369
This boy is going to die. You
selfish enough to let it happen?

475
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,345
Pot calling a kettle a
pot? You're a hypocrite.

476
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,746
If our job is to find out what's
killing patients, you'd help this kid.

477
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,218
But you'd rather play mind games to prove
you're the only one with magical powers.

478
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,482
You wanted something
all your own, now you got it.

479
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,291
Your disengagement won't work.

480
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,520
I can see that.

481
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,271
You think that when you
tell me what I should do,

482
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,558
my instincts are to push back,

483
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,895
so that by not telling me
what you think I should do,

484
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,325
I'll do what you
think I should do.

485
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,562
I sound convoluted.

486
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,503
Disengagement is
neither artful, nor effective.

487
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:56,269
So, my not doing anything
isn't causing you to do anything.

488
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,775
Right.

489
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,436
I'm okay with that.

490
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,945
No, you're not.

491
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,506
You are designed to have
opinions and to force them on people.

492
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,576
I'm starting to sound desperate.

493
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,755
Don't screw with my stuff.

494
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,954
I just need a donor with the same
blood type or something, right?

495
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,933
Actually, bone marrow's
a little more complex.

496
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,935
The best donors
are immediate family.

497
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,833
But those donor banks
have thousands of names.

498
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,432
Your parents' similar DNA

499
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,478
gives you a much
better chance... No.

500
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,044
If I do this,

501
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,677
I'll owe my life to them.

502
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,714
It would mean everything else
that happened was somehow okay.

503
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,283
They don't deserve that.

504
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,394
They're not in my life.

505
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,828
If that means I'm
dead, then I'm dead.

506
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,104
I have Huntington's disease.

507
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,506
I'm dying.

508
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,838
I don't know when it will happen,
but it'll be sooner than I ever planned,

509
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,383
and I'd do anything to stop it.

510
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,312
Because the only way
to make anything right,

511
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,515
the only way to
make your life matter,

512
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,550
is to live as long and as
well as you possibly can.

513
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,660
Have you ever been raped?

514
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,034
No.

515
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,872
Don't try to walk in my shoes,
and I won't try to walk in yours.

516
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,113
You had no right.

517
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,430
To try to convince her
to do the right thing?

518
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,454
To lie to her.

519
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,267
It's a true story. Who
cares if it's not my story?

520
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,226
It's my life. It's her life.

521
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,660
The point wasn't I'm dying,
the point was she should live.

522
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,991
You should have told her.

523
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:01,033
Instead you tell her to call the
cops, give her stats on DNA markers.

524
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,331
Everything's by the book,
nothing is ever personal.

525
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,133
Trying to sleep here.

526
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,041
Biopsy confirmed APL. She
needs a bone marrow transplant.

527
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,639
Run the donor
banks. I'm going home.

528
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,479
We need to track
down her parents.

529
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,217
I assume she's already
said no to that idea

530
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,381
or there'd be no need to screw
up your courage before saying it.

531
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,200
Children who've been through
trauma can't think clearly.

532
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,202
Children who've been
through trauma and are dying...

533
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,104
Guess I'm the only one who
cares about patient rights.

534
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,656
What she wants could kill her,
what she needs could save her.

535
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,517
Our job is to find
out what's killing

536
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,692
patients, not treat
them for chronic idiocy.

537
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,169
Idiocy is what's killing her.

538
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,069
And since we can't
cure that, I'm going home.

539
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,906
We could save this patient, but all
you care about is getting your answer.

540
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,012
Your point being?

541
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,817
Taub and Kutner can check the
donor banks. I'm gonna find her parents.

542
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,455
Can't see why you're surprised.

543
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,268
You push against House,
he's going to push back.

544
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,852
Against me, I get, but
his ego's killing my patient.

545
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,557
You liked this case because
he wasn't looming over you,

546
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,757
the decisions were yours.

547
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,131
Only difference now is
he decided not to loom.

548
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,670
Doesn't change the fact
that your patient's dying.

549
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,632
What are we missing?
What's not in the file?

550
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,801
The mother. Overburdened,
at the end of her rope.

551
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,573
Makes her kid sick, so someone
else will take care of him,

552
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,772
sympathize with her.

553
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,372
Munchausen by proxy?

554
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,488
She brought him to the clinic, was
with him when he went into cardiac arrest.

555
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,986
The brother would have
noticed, said something.

556
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,114
Evan's even more
protective than she is.

557
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,919
Then maybe it's the brother.

558
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,051
He's eight. Could be jealous.

559
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,325
He's the opposite of jealous. He
includes Jonah in everything he does.

560
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,163
Makes sure he eats,
brushes his teeth...

561
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,771
You think we gave him an idea?

562
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,810
Either that or he's
off to kill House.

563
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,082
Mr. Valez? Yeah?

564
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,023
I'm Dr. Remy Hadley from
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

565
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,357
We're treating your
daughter, Sophia, for leukemia

566
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,331
and we need to test both you and
your wife for bone marrow donation.

567
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,594
I'm sorry, you said you're
from Princeton-Plainsboro?

568
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,330
I know this is unexpected,
but time is short and...

569
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,064
What's going on? This
doctor says you have leukemia.

570
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,277
I don't have leukemia.

571
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,178
Sophia Valez? Yeah?

572
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:35,114
Sophia Isabel Valez? Yeah.

573
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,984
Do you know something I don't?

574
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,324
Just that liars lie.

575
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,093
You stole her identity.

576
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,069
To protect myself.

577
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,803
So they can't find me.

578
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:57,138
We can protect you, but
we need to find your parents.

579
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,370
Why?

580
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,841
You have my blood, you don't
need my name to find a donor.

581
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,849
You're a minor, you, obviously,
forged the emancipation papers.

582
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:09,479
Even if we had a donor, we'd still
need your parents' consent to treat you.

583
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,285
Can't you just pretend
you didn't go to that house,

584
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,626
that you didn't find that girl?

585
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:23,225
Calling your parents doesn't
mean a family reunion.

586
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,237
You don't even have to see them.

587
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:36,881
When I get sick enough,
it'll be an emergency.

588
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,982
You'll have to give me a
transplant, even without consent.

589
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,164
An iron overdose?

590
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,099
From his vitamins.

591
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,157
If I'm right, we can
treat him tonight.

592
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,503
He'll be back to his
old self in the morning.

593
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:08,975
But they're children's
vitamins, I only give him one.

594
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,944
I know.

595
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,056
I thought more would
make him strong.

596
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,289
I didn't mean to make him sick.

597
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,193
He's gonna be okay.

598
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,896
He's gonna hate me.

599
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,235
That's the great
thing about brothers.

600
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,537
You can make mistakes,
and they'll still love you.

601
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,467
Donor list turned
up a partial match.

602
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:04,730
So treat her.

603
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,237
It's only a three out of six.

604
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,397
So don't treat her.

605
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,340
She may not last the week.
Partial's better than nothing.

606
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,967
So treat her. She'll reject it,

607
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,309
then she'll be too weak to try
again when a better match turns up.

608
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,214
It's my turn now, right?
If a better match turns up.

609
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,411
Well, when you
decide, get back to me.

610
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,721
She's scared.

611
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,821
Not scared enough.

612
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,457
Tell her the thing about
emotional reactions is

613
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,433
they're definitionally
irrational or stupid.

614
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,428
You might want to phrase
that in your own words.

615
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,269
She wants to deny her parents
the satisfaction of saving her life.

616
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,242
That's your rational explanation
of her emotional response.

617
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,211
That was her explanation.

618
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:51,846
That makes sense.

619
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,394
How long did it take
her to come up with that?

620
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,148
It was her immediate reaction.

621
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,683
That doesn't make sense.

622
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,055
The fact that it makes
sense doesn't make sense?

623
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,821
Emotional is immediate.

624
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:06,160
She went to rational first, means
there was no emotional to process.

625
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,757
You're saying she's
lying about being raped?

626
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,994
Wouldn't be her first.

627
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:13,061
She lied about one trauma
to cover a worse trauma.

628
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,875
So, what's worse than rape?

629
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,177
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

630
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,348
What did you do?

631
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,919
I don't... Something
happened, but it wasn't rape.

632
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,926
Believe whatever you want.

633
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,094
You're scared and stubborn,

634
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,139
and you don't like people
feeling sorry for you. Why not?

635
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,040
I don't want pity, I
just want to be normal.

636
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,444
But you know you're not.

637
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,308
You need people to see how independent
you are, how well you're coping,

638
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,547
so they won't see
the lost, hurt little girl.

639
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,321
Because that's not what you see.

640
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,764
You see someone who
did something terrible,

641
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,737
who deserves to suffer,
who doesn't deserve to live.

642
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,875
What did you do?

643
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,714
Eventually, we'll find your
parents, if only to deliver the body.

644
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,985
And they won't care.

645
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,687
You're an idiot.

646
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,829
You'd rather die than face
your parents because of what?

647
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,232
You broke their Fabergé egg?

648
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,202
I killed their son.

649
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,071
I killed my brother.

650
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,473
I was supposed to watch him.

651
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,782
He was in the bath.

652
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,857
I could hear him laughing.

653
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,365
Every time they'd look at
me, it's like I killed him again.

654
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,578
If you don't take your
parents' bone marrow,

655
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,313
you'll be killing
their other child.

656
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,154
If they don't hate you
now, they will then.

657
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,996
I don't care.

658
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,634
Sure you do.

659
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,802
You want someone to tell you that it was
just an accident, that it's not that bad.

660
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:07,209
Well, it is that bad,
and you know it.

661
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,345
There's nothing you
can do to change that,

662
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,617
but there is one thing you
can do to not make it worse.

663
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,771
If you're here to celebrate the kid's
bone marrow transplant working,

664
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,204
you missed cake.

665
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,208
I want to do clinical trials.

666
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,477
Already had this conversation.

667
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,809
I've proved I can work
two cases at once.

668
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,344
I can do this, and I'm doing it.

669
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,313
Okay.

670
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,847
Okay? Just like that?

671
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:34,222
Can I give my
reasons later, or never?

672
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,988
Three days ago you said no.

673
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,359
Three days ago, you
asked me. Now you told me.

674
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,233
Can't say no if
it's not a question.

675
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:14,164
Nice thing you did for Foreman.

676
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,200
He speaks.

677
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,194
He deflects.

678
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,600
I almost cost a
4-year-old his life.

679
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,702
You knew Foreman
would figure it out.

680
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,878
Did I?

681
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,483
You just needed
to prove it to him.

682
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,217
You're an ass, but a noble one.

683
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,488
I sound clever.

684
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,754
Thank you.

685
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,058
Your little game didn't work.

686
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,257
I'm not Foreman,
and you're not me.

687
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,633
You want to talk about her?

688
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,235
Nope.

689
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,474
All right.

690
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,707
You're gonna be okay, House.

691
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,183
Good to know.
