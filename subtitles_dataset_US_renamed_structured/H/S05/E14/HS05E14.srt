1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:03,935
The trick to onions,

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,099
cut them in half lengthwise,
but leave the roots on,

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,235
then make your vertical slices.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,972
I need a dozen. Think
you can handle this?

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,516
A dozen is 12, right?

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:23,048
Next, we add mustard greens,
spicy and they pack a nice punch.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:27,288
Plus, they're really good for
you, improve mental function,

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,457
protect against rheumatoid arthritis,
even inhibit certain types of cancer.

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,632
Are you going to chop those
onions or give them a Thai massage?

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,536
Well, I guess a happy
ending is out of the question.

11
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:43,236
I don't recall adding "making
snide remarks" to your list of duties.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,211
Just taking initiative.

13
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,908
Secret ingredient:
Porcini mushrooms.

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,974
You want to reconstitute
them in a bowl of water.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,986
You also want to
hire an assistant

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,113
who can stay focused
for longer than 30 seconds.

17
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,158
Why don't I hear you
chopping? Just give me a second.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,661
You're kidding
me, right? So sorry.

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,072
Are you okay? You
want to sit down?

20
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,759
My lips are blue. Cyanosis.

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,894
Pain in my back and chest.
Spontaneous pneumothorax.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,666
What are you talking
about? I'm a doctor.

23
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,866
You are? And I need a doctor.

24
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,652
You drool.

25
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,387
Shut up.

26
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,951
I know gas is expensive, but
I could have given you a ride.

27
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,348
Elevator's broken.

28
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,859
It was fine when I
came up from Admitting.

29
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,385
Dana Miller, the cancer researcher,
spontaneous pneumothorax.

30
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,761
Awfully thin file.

31
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,424
She just got admitted.

32
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,263
Lots of things can
cause pneumothorax.

33
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,013
Why don't we let eight or 10 other
doctors rule out the boring stuff?

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,164
We want to take this case.

35
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,367
She's maybe five or 10 years
away from curing retinoblastoma.

36
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,536
Which would make this
case attractive to anyone

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,375
who has some vested interest
in people curing the incurable.

38
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,279
She hasn't suffered from COPD,

39
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,374
she doesn't smoke, she
hasn't been scuba diving.

40
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,750
O2 sats are low, even
after chest tube insertion.

41
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,415
Pneumothorax could be
secondary to a bunch of things,

42
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,253
cystic fibrosis, lung cancer...

43
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,054
Or to be slightly
more optimistic,

44
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,254
late-onset asthma triggered
by an unknown allergen.

45
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,328
We have a case?

46
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,887
Did you just get to work?

47
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,865
Am I in trouble?

48
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,561
Did you take the elevators up?

49
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,932
Yes.

50
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,834
So, steroids for asthma?

51
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,367
Yeah. Do a CT looking
for hyperinflation to confirm.

52
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,677
And I thought my hospital was
high-tech. Have to wait all day for a CT.

53
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,551
Dr. House gets a few perks.

54
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,556
He has his own scanner?

55
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,855
No, just very loose interpretations
of hospital procedure.

56
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,758
I appreciate the
extra effort, but...

57
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:25,162
Our gift to society, we want to get
you back to work as soon as possible.

58
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:29,465
Well, I'm not working,
at least, not as a doctor.

59
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,236
I quit. I left eight months ago.

60
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,633
You mean like a sabbatical?

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,305
I had a uterine myoma, benign,

62
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,406
but it ruptured, and I
needed emergency surgery.

63
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:47,147
I was lying there on the table thinking, "I
can't die now, I haven't been happy yet."

64
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,889
Couldn't you just buy an overpriced
German sports car, or have an affair?

65
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,986
My sports car is doing
what I want when I want.

66
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,137
Right now, I'm learning
how to run a kitchen

67
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,022
from one of the best
chefs in New York.

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,729
You're washing pots
and smashing garlic.

69
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,738
Smashing garlic makes me happy.

70
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,242
Before that, it was eight years
studying, 12 years in that lab.

71
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,745
It was always what I was supposed
to do, never what I wanted to do.

72
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,016
Come here. Look
at this. Come here.

73
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:36,765
Adorable. Elevators keep crashing.
Is Mercury in retrograde or what?

74
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:41,138
Elevators can be capricious, sometimes
it just seems like they're out to get you.

75
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,701
She keeps playing with the
blanket. Why would she do that?

76
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,942
Why do you think the elevators
would be out to get me?

77
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,107
I don't know.

78
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,620
Maybe they wanted to take time off
to spend with their little dumbwaiter,

79
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,065
but then they had to leave it
at home with an elevator sitter

80
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,821
because you drove the
replacement elevator to quitting

81
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,624
because you're incapable of
listening to anybody but me.

82
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,998
It's just a theory. You're
wrong. I don't even listen to you.

83
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,468
Either do your job or go
home. Leave me out of it.

84
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,768
I am going to do my job. It
doesn't mean I have to do it happily,

85
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,550
doesn't mean I have to
do it without resentment,

86
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,285
and it definitely doesn't
mean I have to do it

87
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,302
without seeking vengeance on
the person making me be here.

88
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,872
Congratulations. You've officially
dragged me down to your level.

89
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,178
Okay.

90
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,871
Hey, Blue.

91
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,512
It's not asthma,
lung volume's normal.

92
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,115
She did have a uterine myoma
removed eight months ago.

93
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,526
Central line IV could've made a hole
near the lung that slowly expanded.

94
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,794
No pleural thickening.
I can't believe she quit.

95
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,062
People have a right to be happy.

96
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:19,163
I saw a four-year-old with
retinoblastoma on my oncology rotation.

97
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,141
The cancer had eaten through
her eye and into her brain.

98
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,699
Horrible diseases exist.

99
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,474
It doesn't mean people should
give up recreational anything.

100
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,677
Why not? Big picture. I don't care if
Jonas Salk's life is a miserable shell,

101
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,082
I just want him to cure polio.

102
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,212
You can't live
your life big picture.

103
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,432
You've got to look out for yourself
and the people you care about.

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,633
Well, then, why
are you a doctor?

105
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,252
Why aren't you sitting by a pool
in Fiji knocking back Mai Tais?

106
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,455
People act in their
own self-interests.

107
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,725
You're all here because
you're happy to be here,

108
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,375
or at least because
it's your best option.

109
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,910
I'm here because I
want to help people.

110
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,894
No, you're here because it
makes you feel good to help people,

111
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,684
Taub and Foreman are here because
they've got no other viable choices,

112
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,076
and Thirteen is desperate to
make her life matter before it's over.

113
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,779
So, you're happy to be here?

114
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,680
Does it show?

115
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,618
Are those increased
interstitial markings?

116
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,316
It could be pulmonary fibrosis.

117
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,687
Do a biopsy.

118
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,120
Foreman.

119
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,800
"You've got to look out for
the people you care about."

120
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,480
That wouldn't have anything to do
with you screwing over your clinical trial

121
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,837
by slipping Thirteen
the real drug, would it?

122
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,738
You said that would be stupid.

123
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,746
Does she know? Because
Jonas Salk would not approve.

124
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,608
There's nothing to know.

125
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,317
Got it?

126
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,963
Good? Yeah.

127
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,433
You okay? Just a headache.

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,334
I took some ibuprofen, but...
Where's the pain, front or back?

129
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:00,340
Front. Why are there never any
interesting pictures on these cards?

130
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,705
They should make
a dirty version.

131
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,937
Sharp pain or more
of a throbbing...

132
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,141
Relax. This is not a side-effect.
People get headaches.

133
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,376
True, but I can get you an MRI.

134
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,476
If I'm on the drug,
it's been weeks.

135
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,351
It's not like something's
gonna suddenly crop up now.

136
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,386
Okay, first card.

137
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,294
Train, duck...

138
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,895
You can't remember? Piano.

139
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,769
We need a biopsy to confirm...

140
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,435
You need an open-lung biopsy
to confirm pulmonary fibrosis.

141
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,809
That's invasive surgery. I'd
be out of commission for weeks.

142
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,348
No offense, but
you're not working.

143
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,060
What does it matter if you
spend a little time in bed?

144
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,383
Not working doesn't mean
I don't have places to go.

145
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,549
I've got my book group, piano lessons,
cooking classes. They make me happy.

146
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,253
A warm apple fritter makes me
happy, it doesn't fulfill me as a person.

147
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,420
And working here does?

148
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,973
If it didn't, I'd have found a way
to go back to tucking tummies.

149
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:02,731
Good for you. If your job fulfills
you and makes you happy, that's rare.

150
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,293
I didn't say I was happy.

151
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,834
I loved being a plastic
surgeon, the money, the lifestyle.

152
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,276
And in a lot of
ways, this job stinks.

153
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,043
I'm making five bucks,
I'm always annoyed, but...

154
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,608
You can look yourself
in the mirror and think,

155
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,620
"I did something
worthwhile today."

156
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,081
Exactly.

157
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,250
That's important.

158
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,759
And I do miss that,

159
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,388
but it just wasn't
enough anymore.

160
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,503
That doesn't feel right. Sit up.

161
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,440
It's weird.

162
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,373
What is it, ascites?

163
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,019
Your belly's full of blood.

164
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,088
First her lung deflates,
like me after a cold shower,

165
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,996
now her liver starts to
bleed, like me after a...

166
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,437
You okay?

167
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,301
Great.

168
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,938
Just practicing my
clown college audition.

169
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,036
Someone set a trip wire.

170
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,191
We were with the
patient the whole time.

171
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,740
We were in the GRC.

172
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,846
Lung, liver. Go.

173
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,959
Shouldn't you be obsessing
over who did this to you?

174
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,515
Nope. Anybody bother MRling
our patient's liver for tumors?

175
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,789
No tumors, no cysts,
no clear etiology.

176
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,855
If you're not obsessing, you
must have already figured it out.

177
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,801
Yes. So I'm obsessing about
why you're not obsessing

178
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,930
about why our patient's
liver suddenly sprang a leak.

179
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,407
There's a tiny spot on the
caudate lobe. Could be a granuloma.

180
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,770
Erodes into the hepatic
artery, causes the bleed.

181
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,336
What caused the granuloma?

182
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,007
Blastomycosis.

183
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,880
Could've been
asymptomatic for months.

184
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:02,582
It hits her lungs, we give her steroids,
it blossoms and attacks her liver.

185
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,353
Get a piece of her lung,
stick it under a black light.

186
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:09,886
If it glows, the sick children who
need her soufflés can breathe easier.

187
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,861
Foreman.

188
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,231
Again?

189
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,996
You have a problem.

190
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,073
I told you. I didn't...

191
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,938
Then you really have a problem.

192
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,871
When she turned her
head to look at the MRI,

193
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,346
I think she's losing
her peripheral vision.

194
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,508
Because she turned her head?

195
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,812
I'm happy for you.

196
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,387
A love so deep you're ready
to chuck your medical license

197
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,586
to give her powerful, unproven
drugs with dangerous side effects.

198
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,686
I don't want to make any
assumptions about your feelings for me,

199
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,697
but I do have a
birthday coming up.

200
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,845
I hear Cuddy's SEAL
training finally came in handy.

201
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:04,373
Should I be investing in
a flak jacket? You're safe.

202
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,013
No carpet bombing, no burning
of Dresden to teach her a lesson?

203
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,334
Well, since you're incapable
of taking the high road,

204
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,728
I assume there's some deeper,
more long-term strategy in effect.

205
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,631
Cuddy's not playing games,
she's not looking for leverage.

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,465
She wants pure,
unadulterated vengeance.

207
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,028
And your countermove
is to let her have it?

208
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,574
The only time to strike back
is when I want something.

209
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,509
All I want now is to get
things back to normal,

210
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,170
which I can't get by escalating.

211
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:38,480
The only way to win this war is to
lose it. Let her punch herself out.

212
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,952
Yeah, that makes sense, too.

213
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,113
Too?

214
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,489
I was thinking you actually feel guilty
about taking her away from her baby,

215
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,289
but your explanation
is good, too.

216
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,093
It's completely inconsistent
with your character, but whatever.

217
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,761
Oh, thank you, Rationalization
Man, you have saved the village.

218
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,495
You wanna eat?

219
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,062
You forgot your file.

220
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,602
Dana Miller? The
cancer researcher?

221
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,873
Not anymore.

222
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,890
Dr. Miller, I doubt if
you'll remember me...

223
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,425
James Wilson, right?

224
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,984
Chicago, at the
adenocarcinoma conference?

225
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,256
Impressive.

226
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,692
You want some
cortisone for that itch?

227
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:30,635
Liver failure, itching is one
of the lovely side effects.

228
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,903
Why did you quit?

229
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,008
Well, the worst thing is,
now, every time I get sick,

230
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,443
I have to listen to a
dozen people judge me.

231
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,413
Do you want me
to congratulate you?

232
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,379
I've got four kids in Pede-Onc
right now who are going to die.

233
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,444
Three of them within a year,
the other in a few days, probably.

234
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,183
Breakthroughs will happen.

235
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,953
With or without me,
someone will find the answer.

236
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,220
Maybe.

237
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,530
I'm in the trenches. I'm
doing triage as best I can.

238
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,661
You had the chance
to end the war.

239
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,666
How is someone like me
supposed to keep fighting

240
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,904
when someone like
you just walked away?

241
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,841
When I left my job, a lot of
people were furious with me.

242
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,216
It was easier to be angry than
to admit they weren't happy.

243
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,949
That they were stuck in a
rut somewhere in their lives,

244
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,457
unable to move forward.

245
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,658
What's your rut?

246
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,466
Okay, you're freaking me out.

247
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,109
Do you think we
should have kids?

248
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,545
We've had this conversation.

249
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,681
Ten years ago. Things change.

250
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,488
On our third date, I told you
that I didn't want to have kids,

251
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,461
and you said that you
were okay with that.

252
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,761
I said it because I wanted to sleep
with you. And then I fell in love with you,

253
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,099
and I realized that I
really could be okay with it.

254
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,002
It wasn't like I had this
burning desire to have children.

255
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,566
God, have you been resenting
me all this time? Is that why...

256
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,477
No, of course not.

257
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,775
I'm just revisiting.

258
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:35,421
This isn't a whim for me. It's
not a decision that I made lightly.

259
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,691
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like?

260
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,095
All the time.

261
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,665
But just not enough to
make me want to do it.

262
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,567
I like our life.

263
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,434
Are you okay?

264
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,509
Can I turn the TV back on?

265
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,731
Look straight ahead.

266
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,834
Why didn't we do
this test this morning?

267
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,600
Do you see that? No.

268
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,736
Damn. I'm losing
my peripheral vision?

269
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,213
I am on the drug.

270
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,749
Does this mean you have to
tell them and take me off it?

271
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,926
No and yes.

272
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,455
As far as they're concerned,
you're on the placebo.

273
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,434
I found out last week. The
trial was getting positive results,

274
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,865
so I switched you.

275
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,605
So my headaches...

276
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,117
I'll stop taking the drug and
everything should be fine.

277
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,052
Specimen's negative
for blastomycosis.

278
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,389
That's it?

279
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,422
I'll go give House the test
results. You can tell the patient.

280
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,293
Hey.

281
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,039
We have been
dating for two weeks.

282
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:32,635
You just broke trial protocol
and risked your entire career

283
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,739
to give me a drug we're
not even sure will help me.

284
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,886
I don't think I'm
ready for that.

285
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,091
Dr. Miller?

286
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,292
I'm sorry. The test was negative.
So, I'm gonna take you off...

287
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,331
What happened to your head?

288
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,271
I don't know, I was sleeping.

289
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,172
It's so itchy.

290
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,268
You were scratching
it in your sleep.

291
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,208
You scratched right
through your skull. What?

292
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,275
This is brain matter. Oh, God.

293
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,219
Need some help in here.

294
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,926
I did a free flap closure
to avoid any scarring.

295
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,518
She was lucky, the scratching
didn't cause any brain damage.

296
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:26,293
But the first thing she said when
we woke her up was, "It still itches."

297
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,927
Itch receptors are only in
the top two layers of skin,

298
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,597
which means she's not actually
itchy, she just thinks she is.

299
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,815
So the problem's in her brain.

300
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,365
Thank God we have you
here to interpret that for us.

301
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,842
Sorry. I have a headache.

302
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,192
It could be psychogenic.

303
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,048
She made a big, sudden change in her life,
could be the result of a mental imbalance.

304
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,609
She wants to do what she wants
to do, what's crazy about that?

305
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,399
Why do you have to quit to do
it? If I want to do something, I do it.

306
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,619
If you can figure out a
balance, there's no burn out.

307
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,183
Thanks for the lesson, Deepak,

308
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,923
but the itching started
yesterday, not eight months ago.

309
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,090
Meningitis, encephalitis.

310
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,225
Those are diffuse
processes, this is localized.

311
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,067
Could be plaques, MS would
explain the itching, possibly the lungs.

312
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,264
So would a brain tumor.

313
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,308
Well, how about we stop
guessing and MRI her head instead?

314
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,433
You want to talk about your
headaches? Not particularly.

315
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,698
You went off the drug, but the
headaches are worse. You need an MRI.

316
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:42,935
The patient needs an MRI.

317
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,103
If she had gangrene, would
you be amputating my leg?

318
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,138
These pills have codeine in them?
You're taking twice the indicated amount.

319
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,185
I've only been off
the drug for 24 hours.

320
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,483
So I think the bigger issue here is
that I've been off you for 24 hours.

321
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,080
You have worsening headaches,
loss of peripheral vision,

322
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,093
and a long history of pretending
bad things aren't happening.

323
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,789
You really think this is
just about my hurt feelings?

324
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,576
I don't remember demoting
you. Brought you something.

325
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,307
Latest issue of <i>Parent</i> magazine.
Really interesting column.

326
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,646
Apparently, working moms are
actually more engaged and attentive

327
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,881
than stay-at-home moms.
Something about personal fulfillment.

328
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,446
That's just a rationalization by working
moms who justify not being with their kids,

329
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,858
which is fine, if that's what
they want. It's not what I want.

330
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,623
And this is <i>Nurses Quarterly.</i>

331
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,823
The point is... You're
only here to get back at me

332
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,197
by dumping dirty mop
water on my carpet.

333
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,930
Just get it over with so
I can get back to work.

334
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,591
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,627
I figured

336
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,790
<i>only one of us needed
to go out on a limb.</i>

337
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,931
<i>I thought I could help you.</i>

338
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,736
It's hard to have a conversation
when I'm trying not to move.

339
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh, God.

340
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,145
Patient's MRI was negative,
no tumors, no lesions.

341
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,589
Where's your cane?
Where are your co-workers?

342
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,956
I paged them. It could
still be psychogenic.

343
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,258
Technically, it can't still be that
because it never could be that.

344
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,765
She scratched through her
skull while she was sleeping.

345
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,960
Unless she was having
a dream about fleas...

346
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,435
Oh, hey, funny
you should drop by.

347
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,699
We were just talking
about this patient of ours.

348
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,351
Tell him the part about where two
of her doctors don't show up for...

349
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,536
Where are you going?

350
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,273
Polyneuropathy. If it's not
in the brain, it's in the nerves.

351
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,023
Explains the itching,
the lungs, the liver.

352
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,949
Shock the affected area,
re-boot the nerves, she'll be fine.

353
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,044
Foreman.

354
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,782
How bad is she?

355
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,330
She's got a tumor
in her optic chiasm.

356
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,066
You don't need your
coat to treat a tumor.

357
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,796
I'm going to the drug company.

358
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,067
To tell them that you
compromised their trial, your ethics,

359
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,040
and the patient's health.
That's a great idea.

360
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,907
They have records on
hundreds of patients.

361
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,104
I can ask them for access,

362
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,080
find out if other patients developed
tumors and how they were treated.

363
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,707
This drug inhibits cell death.

364
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,823
I think I can take a wild
guess on how I treat that.

365
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:44,256
Stop taking it? Yeah,
she tried that yesterday.

366
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,521
Oh, my God. It's been a whole day
and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

367
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,920
If you get on that elevator

368
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,341
and it's only 'cause you're worried
about getting to sleep tonight...

369
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,526
I want to be able to tell her

370
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,728
this happened to other
people, and they're fine now.

371
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,293
So tell her.

372
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,862
I'm not going to lie to
her. A little late for that.

373
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,506
You need to wait.

374
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,502
Because if this thing
doesn't go away,

375
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,413
she's going to need you to
still have a medical license.

376
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:17,790
So I spoke with House.
He thinks we should just...

377
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,485
My leg is bleeding.
What happened?

378
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,394
I was going for the phone
and I fell over the table.

379
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,891
I can't see.

380
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,698
What do you mean?

381
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,667
I can't see anything.

382
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,393
You gonna tip housekeeping?
Get it from Cuddy.

383
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:59,061
Don't tell me. She burned
your apartment to the ground.

384
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:02,533
The warmth would have
been nice. No heat, no power.

385
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,562
Apparently, Mrs. House called the
utilities and told them we were moving.

386
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,006
You have 17 messages.

387
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,876
And your non-involvement
strategy doesn't seem to be working.

388
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,481
Hang up. He's here.

389
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,599
We've been paging you all night.

390
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,219
By all means, let's discuss the
failed attempts to contact me,

391
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,387
not the reason behind them.

392
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,240
The patient started
experiencing spinal shocks

393
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,496
before the machine was
turned on. L'Hermitte's sign.

394
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,901
Shocks without shock,
an itch that won't stop.

395
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,371
She needs Dr. Seuss.

396
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,170
L'Hermitte's sign could mean
Behcet's, B12 deficiency...

397
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,972
No sores, no anemia.

398
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,841
Where's Foreman? TAUB: No idea.

399
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,006
Could be another
demyelinating disease.

400
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,744
Why are you asking about
Foreman and not Thirteen?

401
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:55,379
Because both questions are
bound to have the same answer.

402
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:59,755
Ebony and Ivory are joined near
the hip. Forget the brain, look lower.

403
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,158
A spinal tumor wouldn't
explain the liver or the lungs.

404
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,129
But an aggressive
spinal hemangioma could.

405
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,531
Go find it.

406
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,949
You didn't answer the door.

407
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,577
Probably because I didn't
want to talk to anyone.

408
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,589
You can leave your
stolen key on your way out.

409
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,421
I was looking for
Foreman. I figured...

410
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,760
You can't see.

411
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,358
Where is he? On his
way to the drug company.

412
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,395
Tell him to come back.
I'll dial. If they can help...

413
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,204
What, you think that drug
company has a magic tumor wand

414
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,474
that no one else knows about?
You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice.

415
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:02,787
He asked for my advice before
he switched you off the placebo.

416
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,689
I told him to do
it if he loved you.

417
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,552
He only thinks he loves me.

418
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,754
It's the same thing.
Yes, he's an idiot.

419
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,110
You didn't ask him to do anything,
you're pissed off that he did.

420
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,332
So let him torch his
career to pay for his sins,

421
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,905
unless you actually feel
something for the idiot,

422
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,241
in which case, you might
want to tell him to turn around.

423
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,593
<i>You're hurting him.</i>

424
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,092
Good, after all the
stunts he's pulled on me.

425
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,135
You're physically hurting him.

426
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,067
That's the point.

427
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,661
What's the point?

428
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:55,230
What do you think you're
going to accomplish?

429
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,401
House shouldn't be allowed
to make people miserable

430
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,240
without paying for it.
You're not miserable.

431
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,836
You're telling me how I feel?

432
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:04,509
You're here because you like
this, you like working with him.

433
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,452
Wow, if only I'd known I was having fun, I
wouldn't have canceled the bouncy house.

434
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,513
Fire him. And go be
home with your new baby.

435
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,726
I like what he does
for this hospital.

436
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,786
What he does is who he is.

437
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,832
And the same goes for you.

438
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,040
Slow down.

439
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,875
Unless you want to radiate
her heart instead of her brain.

440
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,381
Of course, then your problems
would actually all go away.

441
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:40,283
Thanks. I'm not beating myself
up enough already over this.

442
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,482
Entering the left
common carotid.

443
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,356
You broke the rules,
your girlfriend went blind...

444
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,988
You gotta be ready for losing
to be one of the possibilities.

445
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,588
You're at the
carotid bifurcation.

446
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,691
I knew that giving her the drug
would be bad for me if I got caught.

447
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,601
I never thought it
would be bad for her.

448
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,866
Nobody else was
having adverse reactions.

449
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,135
You did it because you love her,

450
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,542
and, ironically, you never
took her into consideration.

451
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,216
I can't wait to see what you
get her for your anniversary.

452
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,679
Catheter's adjacent to the
optic chiasm. We're in position.

453
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,665
Nukie-nukie.

454
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,576
What's going on
with everyone today?

455
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,113
It involves House,
Foreman, and Thirteen,

456
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,116
which means it's either dumb,
dangerous, or tragic, or a combination.

457
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,084
I'm embracing my ignorance.

458
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,611
House was right about the
hemangioma, looks fixable.

459
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,792
What's that?

460
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,762
Hemangiomas travel solo.
This thing's brought a friend.

461
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,732
Masses in her lungs and
spine. One in her pericardium.

462
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,995
They're everywhere.

463
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,935
Classic mesothelioma.

464
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,670
It metastasized outward
to the spine and muscles.

465
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,043
The irony of it. Maybe
she wouldn't be sick at all

466
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,675
if some other lazy cancer
researcher hadn't gone home early.

467
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,446
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?

468
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:22,687
Shouldn't you be saying,

469
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,155
"Those weren't there when
we scanned her two days ago"?

470
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,284
Mesothelioma shouldn't
grow this fast. Good rephrasing.

471
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,797
Have Wilson do a
biopsy to confirm.

472
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:32,922
No.

473
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,299
Something weird is going on,

474
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,427
and it involves our
colleagues, we should know.

475
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,747
You want us to treat the
patient? Tell us what's going on.

476
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:44,402
Actually, all he needs us to do is
tell Wilson to do something. So...

477
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,112
You always blab to
watch people react,

478
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,482
so not blabbing means you don't
want us to react, which can't be good.

479
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,488
Is Thirteen's headache
not just a headache?

480
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,150
If I check with Admitting,
am I going to find her name?

481
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,051
Little pinch.

482
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,437
I'm sorry about the other
day. I unloaded on you and...

483
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,905
You're not sorry.

484
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,543
You feel bad because
mesothelioma means I'm dying.

485
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,843
You're a good person. I
appreciate the sentiment.

486
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,042
I'm not apologizing
because you're dying.

487
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:29,077
I'm apologizing because
you were right. I am stuck.

488
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,150
My girlfriend died.

489
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,195
She was the only person
I've loved for a long time and...

490
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,398
I'm still living in her apartment.
I'm surrounded by her things.

491
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,492
I've left it all
exactly where it was.

492
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,571
I don't know how
to get un-stuck.

493
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,568
The only wrong
thing is to do nothing.

494
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,113
Yeah.

495
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,123
All right.

496
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,697
That's not supposed to happen.

497
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,670
Have you thought about going to the
drug company, see if they can help?

498
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:27,804
I thought about it.

499
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,508
We need to give it more
time, it's been half a day.

500
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,845
This thing keeps growing,

501
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,751
there's other stuff in your
brain you might need later on.

502
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,621
If I were any other patient, you'd
both be in the lounge eating donuts.

503
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,421
You're not any
other patient. Right.

504
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,326
Any other patient,
you don't feel guilty.

505
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,830
But you don't get to torch
your career to pay for your sins.

506
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,963
House told you to
say that, didn't he?

507
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:55,098
Does that make it any less true?

508
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,368
You think he's right?

509
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,841
Who cares?

510
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,877
You're a hypocrite.

511
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,356
You don't ask her if she
wants to be on the drug,

512
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,125
but when there's a chance
you could help her get better,

513
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,345
suddenly you're letting
her call the shots?

514
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,920
That's not being noble,
that's saving your own ass.

515
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,660
I'd feel worse if he
destroyed his career.

516
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,797
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.

517
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,857
So what causes
masses that do bleed?

518
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,902
AVM secondary
to schistosomiasis.

519
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,013
She'd be crawling with
worms, we would've noticed it.

520
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,801
Gorham's Disease
and Kasabach-Merritt

521
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,775
can both cause
super-aggressive vascular tumors.

522
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,710
Patient's heart just stopped.

523
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,779
So what causes that?

524
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,009
Cardiac tamponade.

525
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,250
She's bleeding into her pericardium,
smothering her heart. Syringe.

526
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,226
BP is going back up. It's
working. No, it's not. Look.

527
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,308
<i>We're transfusing platelets, FFP,
everything to try to keep her stable.</i>

528
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,155
But we can barely keep
up with the blood loss.

529
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,191
At this rate, she could be
dead by the end of the day.

530
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,208
We need to resect the vascular
tumors, stop the bleeding.

531
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,278
Too late. No surgeon's
going to touch her now.

532
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:20,523
So we give up? Just let
her bleed out? Don't be silly.

533
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,687
Do you know what that would do
to our malpractice insurance rates?

534
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:27,358
We go on the offensive, cut off
the invading army's supply line.

535
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,458
You're talking
about embolization?

536
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,494
Cut off the arteries that feed blood
to the tumors, they wither and die.

537
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,507
Start with the
ones in her lungs,

538
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,919
'cause if they get any bigger, she's
gonna have a hard time breathing,

539
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,935
so she'll have a hard
time telling us she's dead.

540
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,571
You can't kill the tumors
without also killing healthy tissue.

541
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,639
If we wipe out
three-quarters of her lungs...

542
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,083
Let's hope that running
marathons wasn't on her happy list.

543
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,253
I found this.

544
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,430
In the coat closet
where I hid it.

545
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:13,068
I thought I'd never see
you again, Little Little Greg.

546
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,773
Yeah, you heard me right.

547
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,751
You are who you are.

548
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,391
It's annoying, but
that's not your fault.

549
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,258
It isn't about you.

550
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,297
I'm sorry.

551
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,600
Because you were doing this job
perfectly until the baby came along.

552
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,899
What?

553
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,901
I'm apologizing. Can't you
just accept my... I accept.

554
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,242
Are we gonna have to do
this dance again in 28 days?

555
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,679
What the hell is wrong with you?

556
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,685
Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're
practically weeping on my shoulder.

557
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:57,883
I can only assume that what I'm
hearing is your Aunt Flow telling me...

558
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,557
When I was being a jerk,
you suddenly act human,

559
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,364
but when I act human,
you turn back into a jerk.

560
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,530
Guess our cycles
aren't matched up yet.

561
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,140
This is your way of saying
you accept my apology, isn't it?

562
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,304
Nope. This is my way of saying
you were doing a crappy job before,

563
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,543
you'll do a slightly crappier
job now, everything keeps going.

564
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,346
Nature of life,
nature of parenthood.

565
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,088
Or this whole
thing is just an act.

566
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:36,560
And you've gone back to the
part you think you need to play.

567
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,658
You should go talk to Wilson.

568
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,428
Rationalization Man
needs a faithful sidekick.

569
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,368
Now Rational Man
needs to go save a life.

570
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,940
House, if you're looking
for returnable bottles,

571
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,919
Kutner's already cleaned
it out. Damn! Oh, well,

572
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:06,648
it means the only thing I'm
gonna get out of this is a diagnosis.

573
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,457
So the nurses gave her
pads instead of tampons,

574
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,739
is that diagnostically relevant?

575
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,164
The fact that the nurses
had to give her anything is.

576
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,258
It means she's
bleeding from her uterus.

577
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,304
Women do that. It's perfectly
natural, not scary at all.

578
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,772
She's menstruating and
she's bleeding everywhere.

579
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:26,073
There's about a three- or
four-in-28 chance it's a coincidence.

580
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,547
Which leaves a much bigger chance that
the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis.

581
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,552
She had a myoma eight months ago.
The surgeons cut through her uterine wall.

582
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,053
<i>Every cut of the scalpel</i>

583
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,558
<i>could have sent endometrial cells
spilling out into her bloodstream.</i>

584
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,268
<i>Some of them took up
residence in her lungs,</i>

585
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,056
<i>some in her liver,
some in her spine.</i>

586
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,324
And like all horny little cells,

587
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,696
they went forth and multiplied
until they reached a critical mass.

588
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,633
<i>In the days leading
up to her next period,</i>

589
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,729
<i>when her uterus is supposed
to swell, everything swelled.</i>

590
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,775
<i>Then when her uterus was
supposed to bleed, everything bled.</i>

591
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,310
Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period.
Granted, it's the worst period ever.

592
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,716
Although, frankly, not by all that
much. Cut out the masses, she'll be fine.

593
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,756
Can't do surgery until her cycle's
over and she stops bleeding.

594
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,814
Let's hope she can
hold out until then.

595
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:16,555
In the meantime, get her a pint of cookie
dough ice cream and a DVD of <i>Beaches.</i>

596
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,952
I'm sorry.

597
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,427
Foreman?

598
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,961
I can see you.

599
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,047
How you feeling?

600
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,217
Relative to the last
few days? Awesome.

601
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,553
You almost died.

602
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:25,197
For the second time
in eight months. I know.

603
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,132
How do you feel about
your life choices this time?

604
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,329
I didn't lie there
thinking, "What if"?

605
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:39,869
I always worry on my deathbed I'll think,
"I didn't do anything really important."

606
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,937
You're gonna spend one day
of your life on your deathbed.

607
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,246
The other 25,000 are the ones
we should be worrying about.

608
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,213
Go to bed happy tonight.

609
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:19,005
Dr. Schmidt, it's Eric Foreman.

610
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,352
Actually, the trial
isn't going too well.

611
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,663
You told them, didn't you?

612
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,642
You really had no choice,
on account of being an idiot.

613
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,575
They gonna pull the drug?

614
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,645
I broke protocol.

615
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,684
Her results are no longer
admissible to the trial.

616
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,416
They don't have to do anything.

617
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,001
If anyone else gets a tumor,
they'll put a warning on the label.

618
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,085
You're gonna keep your license?

619
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,654
They'll come after me if I attempt
to participate in any more trials.

620
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,157
That's very decent of them.

621
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,939
Well, good for me.
See you tomorrow.

622
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:20,340
And the next day.
And the next day.

623
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,781
That wasn't your locker, was it?

624
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:29,014
It's a locker room. How
else are they gonna learn?

625
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,271
Do you think you can't
be happy without a kid?

626
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,103
I don't know.

627
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,172
I know I can't be
happy without you.

628
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,076
You snore.

629
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,477
Shut up.
