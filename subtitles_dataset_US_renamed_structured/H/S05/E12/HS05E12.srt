1
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,266
Damn it, Zach. This is the
last time I'm turning around.

2
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,863
The next time you forget something,
you're gonna be on your own.

3
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,568
I can't play without a stick.

4
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,473
Then I guess you won't play.

5
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,240
I don't care. I suck anyway.

6
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,372
Don't say that.

7
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,558
I'm the worst guy
on the whole team.

8
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,608
No, you're not.
Then who's worse?

9
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,654
Don't worry about anyone
else, just do your best.

10
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,211
See? You can't name anyone.

11
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,916
Zach, stop it.

12
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,458
Then name someone.

13
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,723
You can't, can you?

14
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,835
Donny, Mark, Navid...

15
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,567
You really think I'm
better than those guys?

16
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:45,662
Yes.

17
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,043
Hurry up and get your stick.

18
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,496
Zach, get back in the car.

19
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,866
I need an ambulance
at 860 Oakwood Avenue.

20
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,936
Why is Dad's car on?

21
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,870
Get back in the car, Zach!

22
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,840
Come on.

23
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,687
Don't do this to me,
Jeff. Don't do this!

24
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:57,403
I'm sorry. I just... I couldn't
take the pain any more.

25
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,142
Either I need a new watch or Mowgli
is cutting into your beauty sleep.

26
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,356
I was up all night
looking at finance reports,

27
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,792
and Rachel is doing
great, thanks for asking.

28
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,558
Proving that you're a better foster
mom than a homeless drug addict.

29
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,599
Departmental budgets
are due this week.

30
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,099
I'm gonna need an extension.

31
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,411
I've got some
time next decade...

32
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,461
Cameron already turned yours in.

33
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,096
That's nice of her.

34
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,268
Two questions, why did she,
and why are you telling me?

35
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,505
Same answer. Now
you owe her a favor.

36
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,557
I'm gonna need an
extension. I've got some time...

37
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,380
House, I've got a DYFS
home visit on Friday.

38
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,386
And I've got a
W-H-O-R-E visit on...

39
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,049
Mama's busy. You two are gonna
have to go play outside for a while.

40
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,997
32-year-old male with
chronic pain all over.

41
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,966
This is the favor?

42
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,402
I was expecting something involving
whipped cream and tongue depressors.

43
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,135
He's seen seven different specialists over
three years, no diagnosis and no relief.

44
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,542
Oh, I am fascinated already.
It's like I'm treating myself.

45
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,705
He gets cured, and I get
to learn a valuable lesson

46
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,078
about the milk of
human kindness.

47
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,226
If I thought you learned
lessons, I never would have quit.

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,741
So you're wasting
a favor because...

49
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,583
I think you can help this guy.

50
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,015
Drug-seeking patients...

51
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,821
Don't attempt suicide with
medicine cabinets full of narcotics.

52
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,384
Sounds like fibromyalgia.

53
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,896
Sounds like you
don't work for House.

54
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,209
A diagnosis that provides
neither an explanation nor a cure

55
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,861
is, by definition,
not a diagnosis.

56
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,336
The American College of
Rheumatology would disagree.

57
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,997
There're specific
diagnostic criteria...

58
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,192
Which this guy doesn't meet.

59
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,675
Putting pressure on his pain
helps, doesn't make it worse.

60
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,235
He's got abdominal pain, severe
headaches, muscle cramps that come and go.

61
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,542
And he tried to off himself.

62
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,992
He's, obviously, mentally ill.
The pain's probably psychological.

63
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,542
It's not a sign of mental
illness to wanna be pain-free.

64
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,572
It is if your solution
is sucking on a

65
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,886
tailpipe. Sane people
don't attempt suicide.

66
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,289
Not ever?

67
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,427
So, if you were being burnt at the
stake and someone handed you a gun...

68
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,794
I'd shoot the guys
with the torches.

69
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,810
Not one doctor this guy's
seen in the past three years

70
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,779
has been able to find a
single thing wrong with him.

71
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,803
What does that tell you?

72
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,362
It means they're idiots.

73
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,305
It means we got to
start from the beginning.

74
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,367
And do a pain profile to
rule out psychosomatic pain.

75
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:23,179
Search the home. Go home.
Get a refill. And a donut.

76
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,045
I'll help with the home.

77
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,043
"Choose the
statement in each group

78
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,629
"that best describes how you've
been feeling lately, including today."

79
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,539
I'm not depressed. I
know what I did was stupid.

80
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,938
"I usually sleep well. I have
some trouble with sleep.

81
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,448
"I have a lot of
trouble with sleep."

82
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,847
I have a lot of trouble.

83
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,251
It's up and down.

84
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,756
Between the pain and the meds,
his sleep pattern's pretty erratic.

85
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,656
"He's a calm person. He's
more nervous than most people.

86
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,353
"He's so nervous
he's miserable."

87
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,328
He's definitely calm.

88
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:12,332
Sometimes calmer
the worse the pain gets.

89
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,628
I think talking, interacting with
other people, actually makes it worse.

90
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,797
Interesting.

91
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,534
Why, does that mean something?

92
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,599
No, it's just...

93
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,443
We've seen that
in other patients.

94
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,025
<i>"He can do chores
around the house.</i>

95
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,508
"With help he can do chores.
He no longer can do chores."

96
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,951
He helps all the time.

97
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:39,722
He's really strong. He used to
play hockey. He was really good, too.

98
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:46,125
"I believe there's hope. Hoping for
things to get better is a struggle for me.

99
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,169
"Most of the time I feel
completely hopeless."

100
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,899
He still laughs, all the time.

101
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:58,776
<i>He was always optimistic.
Still is. It's just, it's harder now.</i>

102
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:04,407
I guess I pray for
strength more than hope.

103
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,556
There's nothing in there but a
pharmacy's worth of pain meds.

104
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,390
This guy makes House
look like a Christian Scientist.

105
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,398
He's also more compliant
than House. Kept all the inserts.

106
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:22,061
Had daily pill dispensers to
make sure he didn't mix them up.

107
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,867
Guess if you're gonna go out in a
car, this ain't a bad one to choose.

108
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,773
If I ever did it, it definitely
wouldn't be like that.

109
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,542
Don't worry, I'm not
making any plans.

110
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,909
I certainly wouldn't know.

111
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,073
Ever since we kissed,
you've been avoiding me.

112
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,448
No, I haven't. I've
just been busy.

113
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,283
Metal polish could cause nerve
damage, if he inhaled enough of it.

114
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,846
And judging by the shine on
that car, he used a fair amount.

115
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,519
And judging by the fact that he
owns a body shop, and one of these,

116
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,426
I'd say he knew not to inhale.

117
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,856
Busy tonight? We
could get some dinner.

118
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,730
I don't think so.

119
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,966
So, making out, okay,
meals, too intimate?

120
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,406
I don't wanna kiss
you again, either.

121
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,908
Why? Because we work together?

122
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,071
No. Because I like you.

123
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,940
That makes a lot of sense.

124
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,110
What doesn't make sense is
me getting involved with anyone.

125
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,747
I thought you'd gotten past that.
That's why you agreed to the drug trial.

126
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,133
You can't give up
on life because...

127
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,889
I'm not giving up on life,
I'm just giving up on you.

128
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,292
I finally feel like I have a grip
on things, I can handle this.

129
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,132
What I can't handle is dragging
anyone else down with me.

130
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,538
Does this look
like quail to you?

131
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,003
You think he's had food poisoning
every day for the last three years?

132
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,676
Wild quail can be toxic,
cause rhabdomyolysis,

133
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,413
which would explain his pain
as well as the elevated CK levels.

134
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,819
So would the carbon monoxide
he sucked out of his car.

135
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,325
It's not a toxic reaction, it's
a psychosomatic reaction.

136
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,851
The pain profile showed an excessive
concern about his physical health,

137
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,569
difficulty sleeping,
getting out of bed...

138
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,360
He's not in pain
because he's depressed,

139
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,060
he's depressed
because he's in pain.

140
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,468
Not according to the pain profile
you ordered. It's not a diet issue.

141
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,666
We should start him on antidepressants,
for his sake as well as his family's.

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,106
We're not diagnosing his family.

143
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,303
We're not
diagnosing you, either.

144
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,906
It's rhabdo.

145
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,678
Push IV fluids, check his
urine, do a muscle biopsy.

146
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,379
What muscle? He
says it hurts all over.

147
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,354
Then she'll biopsy all over.

148
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,548
Where are you going?

149
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,685
If Cuddy can come in
late, I can leave early.

150
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,821
If you need anything while I'm
gone, just ask Cameron to do it.

151
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,699
So if he just stops eating
quail, the pain will go away?

152
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,601
If we're right, it's
definitely treatable.

153
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,409
My arm, it's starting to...

154
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,087
- He needs more medicine.
- BP's down.

155
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,755
We need to get him in
Trendelenburg position.

156
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,839
- Jeff, can you hear me?
- He's arresting.

157
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,679
We need a crash cart in here!

158
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,277
He's not answering
his cell, either.

159
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,785
V-Q scan showed a
pulmonary embolism.

160
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,617
Means the pain's
not psychosomatic.

161
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,623
Also means it's
not rhabdomyolysis.

162
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,024
Up till now his heart and lungs were
the only places he didn't have pain.

163
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,561
Means it's getting worse.

164
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:42,098
You gotta let the phone ring more than
four times when you're calling a cripple.

165
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,399
<i>Chronic pain and
pulmonary embolism, go.</i>

166
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,115
How'd you know he had
a... <i>Call after midnight,</i>

167
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,871
it's gotta be a heart problem. Heart
only would be consistent with rhabdo,

168
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,538
which means Thirteen and
Foreman would be singing in the rain,

169
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,123
<i>which means it has
to be lungs as well.</i>

170
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,548
Hypercoagulable state
could cause pain and a PE.

171
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,950
You think the blood clot was caused
by a clotting problem. That's helpful.

172
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,147
What if it's a cancer
syndrome, like Trousseau's?

173
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,386
Explains blood clots, multi-focal
pain, lack of obvious physical signs...

174
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,223
And why he's gone three
years without anyone seeing it.

175
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,128
Check his chest, abdomen,
and pelvis for tumors.

176
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,399
Why did he think only you
two would be singing in the rain?

177
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,499
Bone windows are normal.

178
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,160
Checking for cancerous
masses in the lungs.

179
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,334
So, who do you know
who committed suicide?

180
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,468
Hemingway, Goebbels,
Romeo and Juliet...

181
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,512
Your mom, dad?

182
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,444
Saying I wouldn't do it
under any circumstances

183
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,278
means my whole
family was suicidal?

184
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,649
No. But categorically insisting
there are no circumstances

185
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,655
means you've got baggage,
personal betrayal, abandonment...

186
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,317
Just because you grew up
in a Charles Dickens novel...

187
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,155
It's people like
me who don't do it.

188
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,663
When your life sucks from the
beginning, nowhere to go but up.

189
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,700
Thorax is clear, no
tumors in the lungs.

190
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,258
The only betrayal comes
from father of the year in there.

191
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:00,000
He has a wife, a kid, people
who count on him to have a pulse.

192
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,132
Okay.

193
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,137
Switching to high-res
cuts of the abdomen.

194
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,202
My parents live very
happily in Queens.

195
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,341
They never attempted, thought about,
or attempted to think about committing...

196
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,440
What?

197
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,077
There, along his diaphragm.

198
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,590
That's not cancer.

199
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,390
No hurry. I already bathed once
this week. I wouldn't want to look elitist.

200
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,868
Can't do anything till
I write up an estimate.

201
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:36,340
Fine. Pad it all you want.
Here's a check for the deductible.

202
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,354
Don't touch the piano,
and lock up when you leave.

203
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,405
Sorry, deductible
doesn't apply here.

204
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,216
I'm no architect, but I'm
pretty sure the master bedroom

205
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,096
is part of the home, which
means the home warranty...

206
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,351
Doesn't cover negligence.

207
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:54,190
This pipe goes through the ceiling,
over that wall and into your shower.

208
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,252
It didn't burst, it
was pulled apart.

209
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,824
Yeah, 'cause I'm clearly a guy who
likes to knock out a few naked pull-ups

210
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,095
before I greet the day.

211
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,500
You hang laundry in there?

212
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,231
I'm about to hang
a plumber in there.

213
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,207
Look, there's no rust,
there's no corrosion.

214
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,387
I don't know how it happened,
but I know what happened,

215
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,902
and it's not covered.

216
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,774
So, whenever you're ready to spend
the $2,200, give somebody else a call.

217
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,798
I promise, I'm only holding your
hand to check for choreiform movement.

218
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,595
I'm getting absolutely
no intimacy from it.

219
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,932
I told you, it has
nothing to do with you.

220
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,268
I know. That's the problem.

221
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,604
There's 80 reasons we shouldn't
date. But you can't shut everyone out.

222
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,610
You're gonna need help, support.

223
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,704
Look at our patient. Thirty-two
years old, not dead yet,

224
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,545
and already he's
traumatized his wife, his son...

225
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,484
And I'll bet they're cherishing
every traumatic minute he has left,

226
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,330
wouldn't trade him for the
healthiest guy in the world.

227
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,792
True. And they're stuck suffering
with him, hating every day,

228
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,988
only their pain has
no prospect of relief.

229
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,155
This a bad time?

230
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,254
No. Yes.

231
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,776
No trace of cancer
in the patient.

232
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,598
But we did find
edema in his intestines,

233
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,347
air in the intestinal blood vessels,
and House won't answer his phone.

234
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,068
His intestine must be damaged,
the air's leaking into his body.

235
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,440
If there's a blockage in the
superior mesenteric artery,

236
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,221
it could be choking off
blood flow to his intestine.

237
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,441
Blockages all over his
body would explain his pain,

238
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,107
why the cramps come and go.

239
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,310
Do an angioplasty on
the superior mesenteric,

240
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,183
and find the other blockages,
before he has another cardiac arrest.

241
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,552
I'll help.

242
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,699
Good thing we don't
have a suicidal patient

243
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,036
with a horrific,
undiagnosed pain disorder.

244
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,008
We did, till we diagnosed it.

245
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,774
We found intestinal edema and air in
the blood vessels. The pain was vascular.

246
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,281
If it was vascular, we
would've seen uneven pulses.

247
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,183
His blood pressure was uneven.
Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angio.

248
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,050
He'd have hemorrhages
in his fingers.

249
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,056
There's air in the intestine, it has
to have come from somewhere.

250
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,394
Yes, it does.

251
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,577
After we thread the catheter
through his groin and into position,

252
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,212
the blood will start
flowing freely again.

253
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,137
Will that take away the pain?

254
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,768
It will be completely ineffective,
and the pain will completely go away.

255
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,868
Cancel the angio. He
has air in his blood vessels.

256
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,456
If we don't open the
artery to his intestine...

257
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,210
Where can air come from?

258
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,216
Hmm.

259
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,044
Air can either come from a breach
of the lumen in the small intestine,

260
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:39,684
or, in rare instances,
air can come from the air.

261
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,525
Teeth marks.

262
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,322
I'm guessing from when
he blew into his IV tube.

263
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,890
Air bubble caused the
PE and cardiac arrest.

264
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,597
You tried to finish the job
that you started at home.

265
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,233
Jeff, why? You said that...

266
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,799
I lied.

267
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,471
I want to die.

268
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,814
Please just let me die.

269
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,617
No.

270
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,980
He's in a hyperbaric chamber.

271
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,316
A dose of high pressure ought
to chase the air out of his blood.

272
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,684
Is anyone keeping an eye on him?

273
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,507
You know, because the
whole idea of suicide watch

274
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,105
was specifically created
for suicidal patients.

275
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,726
I realize how you might have thought
the name was just a coincidence...

276
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,027
Are there any
visuals in this room

277
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,011
that are key to us learning our
lesson? Because the telephone...

278
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,321
I'm inconveniencing you
because you inconvenienced me.

279
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,870
When was the last
time you showered?

280
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,193
Scent of a man.

281
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,289
I realize you haven't
experienced it sober.

282
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,097
If anyone should be able to
handle a depressed pain patient...

283
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,568
He insisted he was no longer...

284
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,196
Apparently, he lied.

285
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,332
Didn't think I'd have to remind
you of that remote possibility.

286
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,845
I have a DYFS inspection in less
than 24 hours, so if you can't control...

287
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,209
Non-motor seizures.

288
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,182
Sorry, I was thinking about the
patient. What were you saying?

289
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,082
Go on. The pain
started in his abdomen,

290
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,521
near his intestine. The first
symptom's got to be key.

291
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,183
He's had multiple EEGs,

292
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,956
all of them cleaner and squeakier
than Cuddy's rubber nipples.

293
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,828
What about a glycogen-storage
disease, like McArdle's.

294
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,858
Explains the pain, plus there's plenty of
muscle cells in the wall of the intestine.

295
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,936
Fourteen is right. Go run
an ischemic forearm test.

296
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,768
Take the garbage
out on your way out.

297
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,212
If you want a man to take your
crap, you have to marry him first.

298
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,650
Or employ him.

299
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,385
Good girl.

300
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,857
I don't think I'm ready
to run a decathlon yet.

301
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,126
If we can get you managing your
life a bit better, that'll be plenty.

302
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,030
Dr. Hadley,
whenever you're ready.

303
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,157
Janice.

304
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,066
You look better.

305
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,073
Yeah, they said my basal
ganglian volume's improved.

306
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,041
All I know is, for the
first time in two years,

307
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,307
I can drink a cup of water
without spilling it all over myself.

308
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,711
Thank you for getting
me back in the study.

309
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,579
I haven't even
seen you in weeks,

310
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,554
I didn't even know our appointments
were back-to-back again.

311
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,591
Well, they weren't. Mine
got switched this morning.

312
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,691
We're gonna take
your blood repeatedly.

313
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,722
If the increased strain makes your arm
hurt more, you have a muscle abnormality.

314
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,260
If you're right about this McArdle's
disease, can you take away the pain?

315
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:42,138
With gene replacement therapy,
with lifestyle changes, we can reduce it.

316
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,676
Keep squeezing the ball.

317
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,789
How long does he have to... Maybe
you and Zach should eat something.

318
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,890
Honey, don't worry about us.

319
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,439
I'm not.

320
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,953
Please, get out of here.
These tests are all I can handle.

321
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,470
They're trying to help you.

322
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,689
They can't.

323
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,357
Then how about helping
them? You know, by not being...

324
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,196
An ass? You have no
idea what I'm going through.

325
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,930
I know it's better than
what you tried to go through.

326
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,601
Sure, no baggage at all.

327
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,734
Where's the pain worst
right now? In my left arm.

328
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,472
Does it hurt more? Couldn't.

329
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,823
And lactate level's steady.
It's not any kind of glycogen...

330
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:26,512
Oh, God! Pain jumped to my
leg. This never happened before.

331
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,313
Your chest, your abdomen,
you feel anything there?

332
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:32,951
My leg feels like
it's being sawed off.

333
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,998
Nice. What?

334
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,830
Switching Janice's appointment
time, so I can see the skies brighten

335
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,813
like a Lifetime TV movie.
I don't know what you're...

336
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,830
Sticking your most improved
study participant in my face.

337
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,069
Is that your way of
getting into my pants?

338
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,607
I don't make the schedule, and if I did,
I wouldn't use it as a social lubricant.

339
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,243
And this is the first I've heard
of Janice improving at all.

340
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,844
So, hey, thanks
for the good news.

341
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,028
Pain started in his abdomen.

342
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,657
Now it's hopped from his left arm to
his left leg, skipping the trunk entirely.

343
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,997
I need the name of a good
lawyer. We're getting sued?

344
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,627
Probably. That's
Cuddy's problem.

345
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,502
Hopping pain. Means it's
something in his brain, not his body.

346
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:24,669
Except the pain's in two places that
connect two separate regions of the brain,

347
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,178
which means you're
not using yours.

348
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,772
Come on, you're from
one of the Twelve Tribes,

349
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,477
you must know a ton of shysters.

350
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,694
What type of lawyer do you need?

351
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,358
I'll bring it up at the next world
domination subcommittee meeting.

352
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,119
I didn't say I needed a lawyer, I
said I needed the name of a lawyer.

353
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,252
Pain hopped to another limb on
the same side, it's gotta be central...

354
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,773
Could still be peripheral. If
multiple areas of disc disease...

355
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:48,529
Were consistent with a
completely spotless MRI.

356
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,628
Who represented the hospital
when you set that patient on fire?

357
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,070
Chris Carrick.

358
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,663
Chris.

359
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,538
That doesn't sound
like a very good lawyer.

360
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,738
If we can't even resolve body versus
brain, we're never gonna diagnose the guy.

361
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,012
What was the name of the firm?

362
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,070
Caddell and Carrick.

363
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,208
It's not like we can chop off his
head to see if the pain goes away.

364
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,219
Why not?

365
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,035
Need to cut off a guy's head.

366
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,371
Gotta figure out if his pain's
coming from his brain or his body.

367
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,170
Stiff shot of Lidocaine
below the brain stem

368
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,153
should numb him all the
way down to his tippy-toes.

369
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,510
And hearing me say "no" over
the phone wasn't good enough?

370
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,347
I'm inconveniencing you
because you inconvenienced me.

371
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,462
You know that foster care
official is coming in the morning...

372
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,250
If they weren't there'd
be no inconvenience.

373
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,291
Do not try and force me to
choose between my child and this...

374
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,019
I'm forcing you to do your job.

375
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,759
If you can't also... Fine.

376
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,355
You want to separate a
patient's central nervous system

377
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,900
from the rest of his body.

378
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,663
If the pain stays,
it's in his brain.

379
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,947
If it vanishes... What about
options three, four and five?

380
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,236
His respiratory system
freezes, or he dies of infection,

381
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,709
or he leaks CNS fluid like a fire hydrant,
which would make him wish he were dead.

382
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,076
Scratch option five,
he's already there.

383
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,339
You preach objectivity, but as
soon as a patient comes in, in pain,

384
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,928
all you want to do is
look under the hood.

385
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,996
You don't care if there's a
one-in-three chance you'll kill him.

386
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,889
If I don't diagnose him, there's a
one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.

387
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,362
I gotta go.

388
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,558
Do whatever it is
you think is right.

389
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,053
Tammy. You said you
were gonna be a little late.

390
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,391
DYFS is gonna be here in an
hour, and this place is a disaster.

391
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,501
Never mind.

392
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,297
This should numb everything
from your shoulders down.

393
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,640
Any pain that's
peripheral should be gone.

394
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,349
What are you doing here?
Just stretching my leg. Carry on.

395
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,148
Bad pain day today?

396
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:25,350
About to get better.

397
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,325
Don't worry, he's
making yours a double.

398
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,764
I remember when the drugs
still made things tolerable,

399
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,665
when I still thought
I had good days left.

400
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,101
Turns out you have
to live to find out.

401
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,695
You don't have a family, do you?

402
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,604
Left them all back on Krypton.

403
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,939
You're alone. That's why
you can handle your pain.

404
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,915
No need to put up a front, to be
what anyone else wants you to be.

405
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,786
You're having more bad
days lately, aren't you?

406
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,380
Yes.

407
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:02,053
Take a look at your future. Let's
hope the drugs work this time.

408
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,470
I really wasn't
expecting you till later.

409
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:20,570
Had a cancellation, so I thought
I'd knock you off the docket.

410
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,958
Well, I'm sorry this place is such a mess,
it's been a bit of a difficult work week.

411
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,315
Any guns in the house? No.

412
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,814
Pets? Besides the ants? No.

413
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,765
Nice bag. Pricey way
to ditch the diapers.

414
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,998
That's not what I
usually... I sort of panicked.

415
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,539
Mr. Carlton, if you'll just
give me a minute to explain...

416
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,598
Everything looks fine.

417
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:50,938
Really?

418
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,501
Dr. Cuddy, you've
got sufficient income,

419
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,674
a high degree of personal
and professional stability,

420
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,912
and you care enough to be
embarrassed by what a mess this place is.

421
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,749
Believe me, that puts
you head and shoulders

422
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,289
above most of the
foster moms I visit.

423
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,520
See you next year, if you
haven't adopted her by then.

424
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,934
My legs, they're
different, better.

425
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,529
No pain at all? No, but less.

426
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,472
Four out of 10, maybe five.

427
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,875
Can't be.

428
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,708
If whatever's causing the
pain's in your brain, it's still a 10.

429
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,545
In your periphery, a zero.

430
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:36,020
It is. Some of the pain
is gone, but not all of it.

431
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,219
What does this mean?

432
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:47,160
Maybe Taub was right,
it's psychosomatic after all.

433
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,996
Which one of you is House?

434
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,196
The big black guy.

435
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,245
Chris Carrick. Next time you use
my name in a threatening e-mail,

436
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,804
it won't be just a
bill, it'll be a lawsuit.

437
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,953
Can you blame me? Last time
that happened, the guy shot me.

438
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,654
What if the spinal block triggered
some sort of placebo effect?

439
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,061
Guy's taken the finest
opiates Blue Cross can buy,

440
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,623
how come they didn't
trigger a placebo effect?

441
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,439
What happened? LYNNE: He just
started screaming. Do something!

442
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,250
Please, God, do not let
it be what his father has.

443
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,718
I think he's faking.

444
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,099
How dare you? What
makes you think...

445
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,653
House, the kid's
in excruciating...

446
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,462
Where is it? Where's what?

447
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,674
His idiot son
distracted the orderlies

448
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,110
so that Daddy Deathwish here
could down a bottle of isopropyl.

449
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,206
Put him on dialysis or in
half an hour he'll be a corpse.

450
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,986
You're hurting me.
Remember the feeling.

451
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,717
Maybe next time you wanna help
Pops, you'll do a better acting job.

452
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,849
You can't help him.

453
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,918
Zach, why did you do this?

454
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:26,523
Because he's not Dad any more.

455
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,533
He just wants it
to be over with.

456
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,795
Please, please,
just let him die.

457
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:00,261
<i>Fabry disease might be able to
cause central and peripheral pain.</i>

458
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,994
No angiokeratomata.

459
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,365
Lightning pain from syphilis.

460
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,233
All the syph tests
were negative.

461
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,330
Why aren't you
guys still talking?

462
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,485
Because we ran out of ideas.

463
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,909
Nothing explains this.

464
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,411
Something has to.

465
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:21,453
Unless nothing does.

466
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,783
So now you think it's...

467
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,221
Mine's a more interesting
version of nothing.

468
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,850
It used to be something.
We can't find anything

469
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:32,796
because whatever injury caused the
original pain healed a long time ago.

470
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,198
The only thing
left is the drugs.

471
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,032
Opioid-induced pain.

472
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,597
Pain and the drugs that treat pain
work by changing brain chemistry.

473
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,442
Sometimes to the point where pain
receptors read painkillers as killer pain.

474
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,609
Take him off the drugs.

475
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,482
We can't cure him, so
we're gonna torture him?

476
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,147
Torture is the cure. Eventually
his body will recalibrate itself.

477
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,314
Assuming you're right.

478
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,585
Yes, I find it confusing
to assume otherwise.

479
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,890
How would you like
to stop taking Vicodin?

480
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,623
Good thing I'm not the patient.

481
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,097
It's open.

482
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,137
Thank you. Is it too big?

483
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,909
She'll grow into
it. Put it there.

484
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,448
I take it the home
inspection was pushed back?

485
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,852
I passed.

486
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,890
You do realize
that's a good thing?

487
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,394
This place was a disaster.

488
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,296
I had to stash a dirty
diaper in my briefcase.

489
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,027
So you buy another briefcase.

490
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,865
I let House supervise himself.
That's like handing a 12-year-old

491
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,802
the keys to the liquor
cabinet and the car.

492
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,465
You passed the inspection.

493
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,135
The patient lived. The
car is still in the driveway.

494
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,340
And the next time my nanny gets sick?
When House wants to saw someone in half?

495
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,940
Did I mention you
passed the inspection?

496
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,377
I passed by their meager
standard, I failed by mine.

497
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,248
Why do women always do that?

498
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,227
Fail? Create
ridiculous standards

499
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,424
that no human could meet.
With your careers, with your kids.

500
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,727
You gotta be more like us men.

501
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,668
Be lazy? Blame others?

502
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:22,401
Get help. Most men in your position
have a deputy and two assistants at work,

503
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:27,674
and a wife and two nannies at home.
You're not Superwoman, don't be a martyr.

504
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,752
We'll be injecting
you with naloxone,

505
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,379
which will knock the opioids
out of your pain receptors.

506
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,015
If we're right, your system will
recalibrate within a few hours,

507
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,690
and most of the pain
will be gone. Hours?

508
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,749
I need those drugs.

509
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,070
Not if they're
causing your pain.

510
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,926
Then knock me out,
sedate me while you...

511
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,795
That takes drugs, too. We need to
clear everything out of your system.

512
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,391
Please, I'll try anything else.

513
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,096
That's what we're
trying to stop.

514
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,620
So it's not your parents, then it's
your wife, someone you were close...

515
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,342
A colleague. We were
residents together.

516
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:08,086
I should've done more to stop it. He
had the mother of all God complexes.

517
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,988
So busy treating everyone's
problems, he was blind to his own.

518
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:16,358
Helped himself to a vial of
insulin. It's a miracle he survived.

519
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,899
His friends and family almost
didn't. He was a selfish ass.

520
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,105
It'll be over soon.

521
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,705
This is lunacy. You're
torturing this guy on a hunch.

522
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,418
It's the only hunch we've got.

523
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:45,112
If I really wanted to torture
him, I'd manipulate a clinical trial

524
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,216
in the hopes that
he'd sleep with you.

525
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:51,259
Are you suggesting I got Thirteen in
that trial because of some personal...

526
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,163
I think you got her in because
of your usual messiah complex.

527
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,112
I think you messed with
the appointment schedule

528
00:33:56,167 --> 00:34:01,003
because of your I-like-to-have-sex
complex. I checked the logs.

529
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,108
You moved your most
promising patient right before her.

530
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,374
False hope being
quite the aphrodisiac.

531
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,006
How's it false if the
trials are showing results?

532
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,780
If it were that promising, you
wouldn't have to change the schedule.

533
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,288
But, hey, hope springs eternal.

534
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,029
This was a cooking accident?

535
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,933
First time making
Cherries Jubilee.

536
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,061
Awfully big fire.

537
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:35,733
If you ask me, some of the
portions in that recipe were off.

538
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:40,802
I sure hope it happens to be
covered, under, say, section three,

539
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,577
subsection 2.2, paragraph
one. "Accidental fire damage."

540
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:50,384
In which case you'd have to replace the
entire water line to fix the sagging pipe.

541
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,479
I guess so.

542
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,321
I'd hate to have your next-door
neighbors end up with no hot water.

543
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,091
Lucky the fire skipped
your pipes entirely.

544
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,748
It's not working.

545
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,615
I know. I've started him
back on the pain meds.

546
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,859
Which means you can leave.

547
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,365
My son was right.

548
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,402
I've tried for so long
to protect him from...

549
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,603
But I'm the one
who's been selfish.

550
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,271
This is no way for him to live.

551
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,952
Until we get an
answer, it's the only way.

552
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,911
There is no answer.

553
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,002
There's always an answer.

554
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,846
Then what is it? He's
been here for four days.

555
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,512
Three suicide attempts.
You don't have an answer.

556
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,228
When I saw you,
when I saw the cane,

557
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:07,390
I thought, "Thank God, a
doctor who will understand."

558
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,195
Because I sure as hell don't.

559
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,997
My husband thinks it's over.

560
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:18,372
So look me in the eye, tell
me you'd want to live like that.

561
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,373
Then stabilize him,

562
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,109
get him in decent enough
shape for the drive home,

563
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,192
so he can finally...

564
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,195
Okay.

565
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:55,138
There's gotta be something we can
do. We can't just let the patient leave.

566
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,806
We didn't, House did.

567
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,926
<i>Because he realized
there's nothing he could do.</i>

568
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,011
<i>There's always something we
can do, something else we can try.</i>

569
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,127
You're insane. You
know that, right?

570
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,132
Because I have principles?

571
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,065
Because you paid
more to bribe me

572
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,434
to lie on your claim than
the entire cost of the repair.

573
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,439
I don't care if I pay,

574
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,184
as long as the people
who pocketed my premiums

575
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,575
for the last nine
years also pay.

576
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,480
I didn't break the pipe.

577
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,612
Whatever.

578
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,546
You wanna stick it to
the man, that's fine by me.

579
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,221
You happy? No. But I'm right.

580
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,371
Lock up on your way out,
and don't touch the piano.

581
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,111
Testicles. What do
they make you think of?

582
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:13,681
STDs, testosterone issues,
that summer on Fire Island.

583
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:18,458
Oh, so close. The
correct answer is epilepsy.

584
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,626
Epilepsy doesn't
cause chronic pain.

585
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,031
It does if it spreads to the
sensory region of the brain,

586
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,592
then rewires the pain neurons.

587
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,365
Would've shown up on an EEG.

588
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,066
Not if the seizures are in a
place you can't see on an EEG,

589
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,540
a place too deep in the brain,

590
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:34,238
like the area that controls
the muscles supporting the...

591
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,914
Testicles.

592
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,382
Feels like you got kicked
in the nads, doesn't it?

593
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:54,556
The abdominal pain, how it all started.
It wasn't the stomach. It was lower, right?

594
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,367
It's everywhere.

595
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,697
But when it first started.

596
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,261
It started in the
stomach, cramps.

597
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:05,072
Like bad gas or a
permeating pain?

598
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,880
Like your kidneys were being
pulled out through your scrotum?

599
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,781
Why?

600
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,912
Because epilepsy is treatable.

601
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,983
Looks like we shot the
guys with the torches.

602
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,224
Yeah. Pays to hang around.

603
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,059
That selfish ass
with the God complex

604
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,661
who almost made the
stupidest decision of his life,

605
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,541
it wasn't your colleague,
was it? It was you.

606
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,702
No.

607
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,181
See you tomorrow.

608
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,956
You're here early.

609
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,865
I'm feeling better.

610
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,767
What's wrong?
IV's leaking a little.

611
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,140
It's no big deal.

612
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,179
I'll be right back.

613
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,372
Foreman.

614
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,182
You busy tonight?

615
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,912
No.

616
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,557
Rita, the spike on Dr. Hadley's IV
bag wasn't pushed in all the way.

617
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,032
I don't want any dosing errors.

618
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,195
Sorry. It won't happen again.

619
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,094
Stinks, doesn't it?

620
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,195
What?

621
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,674
The medication. When we switch out
the bags you can smell it. It's disgusting.

622
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,211
I didn't smell anything.

623
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,810
She must be on
the placebo, then.

624
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,168
You offered to do House's budget
because you wanted him to owe you,

625
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,900
wanted him to take
that case. Why?

626
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,602
I thought it would help House,
seeing someone worse off than him,

627
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,440
possibly curing a guy with
even less to look forward to.

628
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,013
Can I ask you something?

629
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,886
How would you like my job?
