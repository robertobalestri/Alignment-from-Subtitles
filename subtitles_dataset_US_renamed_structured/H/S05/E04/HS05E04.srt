1
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,137
Do you see them anywhere?

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:09,108
Why don't we go back to their
house, wait for them there?

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,668
Yeah, because they'll
probably answer the door

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,577
the 16th time I knock.

5
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,923
There they are.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,655
Hi. I'm sorry I
followed you here.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,250
I just really wish you could give
me a few minutes of your time.

8
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,270
I know you never agreed
to make it an open adoption,

9
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,217
but I just figured maybe
you never had a choice.

10
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,105
I mean, it's China, right?

11
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,040
What did he say?

12
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,348
He wants you to
leave them alone.

13
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,717
Please.

14
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,960
I just want 10 minutes.

15
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,121
Learn what you're like,
tell you about my life.

16
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,172
He said they have no daughter.

17
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,810
I am sorry you wasted a trip.

18
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,439
I know that's them.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,319
How does that work?

20
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,486
How do I pray?

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,052
You make a wish
and lift the Buddha.

22
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,538
I wish they could understand
how badly I need this.

23
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,847
Now make the wish again.

24
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,218
If you cannot lift the Buddha
this time, your wish will be granted.

25
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,364
Are you okay?

26
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,176
Picked Cameron's pocket down
in the ER. Came up with a doozy.

27
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,808
Your mother called. Twice.

28
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,446
But she's still healthy. This
25-year-old woman, on the other hand...

29
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,581
Her messages
sounded kind of urgent.

30
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,252
Well, that's the way women sound
when their spouse of 50 years dies.

31
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,265
Your dad died? Are you...

32
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,995
Yep, fine. Our patient,

33
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,834
who's been known to take a
few drinks on non-occasions,

34
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,069
vomits blood and
collapses on a trip to China.

35
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,576
Chinese surgeons
cut out a foot of bowel,

36
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,670
but the pain is worse
now than it was before.

37
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,305
House, call your mom.

38
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,872
What are you, my mom?

39
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,846
We can continue this
differential in five minutes.

40
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,788
Are those bags under your
eyes? You were up all night.

41
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:43,983
You told her, didn't you?

42
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,791
I don't know what your daddy issues
are, but don't deflect them on me.

43
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,922
Told his wife he's been
getting some strange.

44
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,489
She kicked his adulterous
tuchus to the curb.

45
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,567
Seriously? You told her?

46
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,863
Yes, I told her,

47
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,802
but, no, she did not
kick me to the curb.

48
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,930
We stayed up late talking.

49
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,216
We're going to continue talking.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,005
Much like House should be
doing with his mother right now.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,011
Anybody read Chinese?

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,377
Otherwise, we have no idea
what these doctors did to her.

53
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,509
Kutner, you're sort of
Asian, right? Get it translated.

54
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,349
What about Meckel's
diverticulum?

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,131
If the surgeons didn't
remove the diverticulum,

56
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,317
it could cause pain, bleeding.

57
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,120
Too high up for a colonoscopy.

58
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,889
CT could miss it.
Ultrasound's fastest.

59
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,573
And since I'm the fastest
with the ultrasound...

60
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,157
House. Let me do the ultrasound.

61
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,777
You need to deal with
your dad and stop...

62
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,828
I'm not deflecting because
I'm avoiding something deep.

63
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,806
I'm deflecting because I'm
avoiding something shallow.

64
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,174
Seriously, I'm fine. I
didn't even like the man.

65
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,773
No Meckel's.

66
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,842
You there for the rice or
the re-education camps?

67
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,445
I was there to track down
my biological parents.

68
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:52,015
Like a salmon returning to
the stream where it was born.

69
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,425
Did you become whole again
or did you get eaten by bears?

70
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,588
They denied my existence.

71
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,591
Four parents and not one of them

72
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,136
taught you to cover your mouth.

73
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,605
My God, it looks like
they cut you in half.

74
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,437
Doctor, we're
her parents, I'm...

75
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,908
I'm just a technician.

76
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,954
Her doctors will be by later,
you can schmooze then.

77
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,039
Can you let them know that
we went by her apartment,

78
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,607
collected all her medications...

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,249
I'm a technician and a doctor.

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,652
You went through my apartment?

81
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,782
We found alcohol.
We thought you'd quit.

82
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,290
Did her drinking cause this? No.

83
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,830
Can you tell her it did?

84
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,572
Licorice root.

85
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,034
No, thanks, I'm good.

86
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,909
I threw it to you for a reason.

87
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,491
It's what the Chinese
doctors gave her.

88
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,746
It contains glycyrrhizin.

89
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,616
They were treating her for SARS?

90
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:58,148
Not very effectively. But
SARS explains the cough,

91
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,491
causes hypoperfusion, which
explains the ischemic bowel. It's perfect.

92
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,393
Lung involvement
isn't very severe.

93
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,297
Okay, well, so call it ARS.

94
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,528
Start her on ribavirin
and interferon.

95
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,876
I'm sorry about your father.

96
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,969
I'm not.

97
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,408
Are we done emoting now?

98
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,951
If there's anything
I can do, just...

99
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,284
You know, you're right. I don't
think I can sleep alone tonight.

100
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,820
Tell me that is liquid Vicodin.

101
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,384
We're giving IG
shots to everyone

102
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,362
who came in contact
with your patient.

103
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,398
Shockingly, none of the nurses

104
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,366
volunteered to administer yours.

105
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,567
It goes better in
a large muscle.

106
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,904
Drop your pants.

107
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,875
You know, I usually pay
tens of dollars to hear that.

108
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,178
The funeral's tomorrow.

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,514
My mom called you?

110
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,488
There is a 3:40
flight out of Newark.

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,185
If you leave now, you
can be in Lexington tonight.

112
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,251
Your mother wants
you to deliver a eulogy.

113
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,457
Eulogy, from the
Greek for "good word."

114
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,758
Now if she'd asked me to deliver
a bastardogy, I'd be happy to...

115
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,566
Then be a grownup.
Call your mother back

116
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,937
and tell her you're
sick with grief,

117
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,498
but you're too busy to be there.

118
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,009
She knows when I'm lying.

119
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,568
Then start writing.

120
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,012
I yanked my brother
and sister out of college?

121
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,055
Can you please tell
them I'm not dying?

122
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,617
You have SARS.
I'm wearing a mask.

123
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,324
It's a big deal. Cut
them some slack.

124
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,127
But I am going
to be okay, right?

125
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,293
That's what all
this stuff is for.

126
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,812
We're gonna need the
names and numbers

127
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,236
of everyone you
came in contact with

128
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,968
here and in China.
Flight numbers, dates.

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,477
That doctor that I coughed all
over, is he gonna be all right?

130
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,035
So far, he's fine.

131
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,958
It's back. This is where
the pain all started.

132
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,354
She's tachycardiac.
Get a crash cart in here!

133
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,859
What's going on?

134
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,666
I need to know what's
going on. That's my daughter.

135
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,103
Her liver's failing.
It's not SARS.

136
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,264
I am not doing
this because I care.

137
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,002
Cuddy drugged me. She...

138
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,145
My mom didn't call
Cuddy. She called you.

139
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,781
I knew you couldn't stay away.

140
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,017
I knew you loved me too much.

141
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,616
I'm doing this for your mom.

142
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,524
I'm not doing this at all.

143
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,905
If there was
something to be done,

144
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,194
I would have done it in
the year he spent dying.

145
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,399
You took my Vicodin?

146
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,603
I'm in pain.

147
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:39,972
One?

148
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,184
So the Vicodin is my leash.
One will take the edge off,

149
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,430
but it won't give
me enough relief

150
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,480
for an escape
back to Plainsboro.

151
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,120
Where's my phone?

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,633
It's the team, it's
their ring tone.

153
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,006
Forget it. The patient's
blood is on your hands.

154
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,645
<i>House? You there?</i>

155
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,527
I'm being held against
my will. Call the police.

156
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,383
Nicole had a clot
in the hepatic vein.

157
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,046
Chase sucked it
out, saved her liver.

158
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,058
No signs of a tumor or venous
malformations, nothing that could cause...

159
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,669
She's an addict. Drugs
and alcohol wouldn't...

160
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,161
She's a smoker.

161
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,561
Combine smoking with any
one of a dozen genetic disorders

162
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,928
and she's a clotting machine.

163
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,518
Multiple blood clots
would tie together

164
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,296
bowel ischemia,
lungs and the liver.

165
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,303
<i>We need to pinpoint
which defect she has</i>

166
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>so we can start her on
the right anti-coagulant.</i>

167
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,506
Draw blood.

168
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,372
Let's find out which genetic
gift her genetic parents gave her.

169
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,535
Thanks for calling.

170
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,141
My ring tone for you is
<i>Dancing Queen</i> by Abba.

171
00:10:58,925 --> 00:10:59,984
Nicole?

172
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,592
I need to pee. Pull
over at the next stop.

173
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,195
I'll just pee on the floor.

174
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:19,172
You bought used floor
mats? That is brilliant.

175
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,241
There's a rest
stop in five miles.

176
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,095
Cane. The
restroom's right there.

177
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,725
You can make it on your own.

178
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,031
I suppose I could
talk about the summer

179
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,042
he decided he
wasn't speaking to me.

180
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,738
Two months. Not one word.

181
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,281
Anything he wanted
to say, he typed up

182
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,840
and slipped under
my bedroom door.

183
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,046
You don't want to say anything,
don't say anything, but go.

184
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,646
Tell your mom
you're sad. For her.

185
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,692
Just by being
there I'd be lying.

186
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:09,559
She wants to think, for a moment,
that she had a happy family.

187
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,428
So give her a gift. Lie.

188
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,401
Give me my cane, I'll
go to the damn funeral.

189
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,718
I said I'd go to the
funeral. I didn't say when.

190
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,393
We have these two
categories, inside and outside.

191
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,904
Patients stay inside,
then, when they're better,

192
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,735
we let them go outside.

193
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,901
Thanks, but they don't
let you smoke inside.

194
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,638
So why don't you go back there

195
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,112
and give me five
minutes outside?

196
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,956
Make a fist.

197
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,698
Such a beautiful day, we thought
we'd do all our doctoring outside.

198
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,432
People stare at me any
time I'm out with my family.

199
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,737
It's like a puzzle. Which one
of these things doesn't belong?

200
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,606
Belonging is overrated.

201
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,313
I was adopted by a white
family when I was nine.

202
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,077
I like being different. The view's
better from the outside looking in.

203
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,782
Must be easier to be different
when you're a success.

204
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,526
Is that a problem?

205
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,031
This is why we prefer inside.

206
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,041
You actually keep a flashlight

207
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,273
that doesn't need
batteries in the trunk?

208
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,545
Next to the jacket,
emergency water,

209
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,415
nail clippers,
toothbrush, space blanket.

210
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,717
When things go
wrong, I like to be ready.

211
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,422
Will you please hold the
flashlight for a minute?

212
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,134
You know, those
aren't just my car keys.

213
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,302
My house keys are on there, too.

214
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,107
Amber gave me that key chain.

215
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,703
No, she didn't.

216
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,249
Not unless your pet
name for her was "Volvo."

217
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,651
A man who would lie about a
gift from his dead girlfriend...

218
00:14:55,728 --> 00:15:00,257
Is probably responding to a
childish, pointless act of petulance.

219
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,064
The struggle to resist one's
captors is never pointless.

220
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,733
Well, I hate to break it to you,
Che, but simple delay won't work.

221
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,404
Your mother will hold
the funeral till we get there.

222
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:18,312
My father was a punctual
man, beholden to time.

223
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,149
Two minutes late for
dinner, you didn't eat.

224
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,782
My mother would never disrespect
him by starting the funeral late.

225
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,487
Yeah, you clearly have
no issues to work through.

226
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,662
Come on, forget the
keys. Call a locksmith.

227
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,496
We'll go inside and
play Guess that Smell

228
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,695
with the truckers
while we're waiting.

229
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,397
Join me on the dark side.

230
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,335
Dark side's done, House.

231
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,105
I'm delivering you to
your mother, and that's it.

232
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,539
I've moved on.

233
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,029
What do you think
House would send?

234
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:58,252
The Gentle Comfort arrangement
or the Warm Thoughts bouquet?

235
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,722
I mean, if he wasn't an ass.

236
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,764
Send one of those giant
cookies shaped like a coffin.

237
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,493
His mom would
believe it was from him.

238
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,502
I didn't tell you so you
could send anything.

239
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,879
Just wanted you
to know the extent

240
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,134
to which the man is
disconnected from the human race.

241
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,573
Took a six pack of
FFP to stop the oozing.

242
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,870
She's bleeding and clotting?

243
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,969
Plus schistocytes on
her smear means it's DIC,

244
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,189
which means she's got cancer.

245
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,579
She's young. It
could be leukemia.

246
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,639
Normal WBC
makes that less likely.

247
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,275
Belly pain points
toward a GI tumor.

248
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,495
House already did an ultrasound.

249
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,250
He wasn't looking for
a tumor. Go run a CT.

250
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,257
I don't buy it.

251
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,953
CT can find small intestinal
cancers that an ultrasound...

252
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,392
I don't buy House.

253
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,324
When my father died, I wound up
killing a patient. And I hated the man.

254
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:45,232
Whatever House says or doesn't
say, I'm sure the guy's a mess.

255
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,839
So he was a bastard.
He was still your father.

256
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:53,209
You're biologically programmed
to have feelings for him.

257
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,941
No, I'm not.

258
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,142
Feelings aren't rational.

259
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,684
I know you have
trouble with anything

260
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,720
that can't be
quantified and counted.

261
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,051
He's not my biological father.

262
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,286
I figured it out when I was 12.

263
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,421
Of course.

264
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,692
You're a brilliant,
socially-isolated 12-year-old,

265
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,461
and you create a
parallel universe

266
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,162
in which your life doesn't suck.

267
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,760
I looked at the facts.

268
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:22,465
First of all, he was deployed
on training exercises off Okinawa

269
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,271
during the time I
had to be conceived.

270
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,041
And since you're 150 years
old, air travel was impossible.

271
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,050
His second toe was
longer than his big toe.

272
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,415
Mine isn't.

273
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,614
This is sad. You don't believe
your mother screwed around.

274
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,055
I have a distinctive red
birthmark on my scalp

275
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,753
that matches a certain
friend of the family.

276
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,024
If you believed this story, you wouldn't
be telling me about his birthmarks,

277
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,964
you'd be telling me about the
genetic testing you had done.

278
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,111
And since you haven't mentioned
it, obviously, you didn't do it,

279
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,764
because you don't want to...
House, what are you doing?

280
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,966
Get your... Get off
the... There's a cop.

281
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,007
Uh-oh!

282
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,079
<i>Nicole, lie still. This will
only take a few seconds.</i>

283
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,783
One-millimeter cut
through upper abdomen.

284
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,655
She was adopted when the parents
thought they couldn't have kids.

285
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,921
Then they had three more.

286
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,088
She took the message
as, "Thanks for playing,

287
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,825
"but we have our
real children now."

288
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,231
And the real children probably
think they were accidents

289
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,495
while she was hand-picked.

290
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,469
Everybody's got
problems with their parents.

291
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,506
She's an addict.
Something went wrong.

292
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,441
And it has to be the
parents? Magnifying pancreas.

293
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,068
I'm not saying the
parents screwed up.

294
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,911
You're saying you like her, so you
don't want her faults to be her fault.

295
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,976
But they're someone's fault, and
the only other people you know are...

296
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,348
I think we may need
to call House again.

297
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,228
You lost track of your speed?

298
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:54,492
I think that was Hitler's
excuse, "Lost track of the Jews."

299
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,035
No one held him responsible.

300
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,331
I'm not playing, House.

301
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,837
You were protecting me.

302
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,840
Anybody in their right mind
would have ratted me out.

303
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,206
I'm just trying to
speed things along.

304
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,211
You are going to this funeral.

305
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,049
Make it fast. I don't want to
miss the anal cavity search.

306
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,116
Looks like a mass
in the pancreas.

307
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,956
<i>Not to me. This is radio.</i>

308
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,690
And I want a full play-by-play.

309
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,459
It's fluid-filled.

310
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,742
Could you get out
of the car, please, sir?

311
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,326
Officer, if you want to give
me a ticket, I totally understand.

312
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,893
Just get out of the car, sir.

313
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,768
Cyst? <i>FOREMAN: Large cyst.</i>

314
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,238
Something going on there?

315
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,741
Wilson's getting
arrested. How large?

316
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,335
SUV-sized or midrange-sedan?

317
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,005
Seriously? What did you do?

318
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,276
I'm obviously joking.

319
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,750
If Wilson was getting
handcuffed on the hood of his car,

320
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,616
would I be carrying
on a differential?

321
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,588
Diameter's at least
eight centimeters.

322
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,381
Is it in the tail or the head?

323
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,585
<i>The head.</i>

324
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,185
You, too, sir, out of the car.

325
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,356
We've got a construction site.

326
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,525
A steamroller is plowing...

327
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,966
Out, now.

328
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,637
No cane.

329
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:24,147
James Evan Wilson. There's a
warrant for your arrest in Louisiana.

330
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,334
What are the traits
of a steamroller?

331
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,893
Powerful. Maybe
pancreatic cancer.

332
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,871
Great idea. Except
the only symptom

333
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,465
it matches up with is
being steamroller-ish.

334
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,203
You don't think House
is onto something?

335
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,177
I think he thought
he had an idea.

336
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,307
I also think his metaphors are tough
enough to decipher after he's said them.

337
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,907
We need to be
focusing on the medicine.

338
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,145
No answer.

339
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,745
There's not going to be an
answer. They've been arrested.

340
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,914
He was joking.

341
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,924
He reacted to the
size and location.

342
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,654
That's what we should be
focusing on, not playing Madlibs

343
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,186
while our patient's exploding "noun"
destroys her life-sustaining "noun."

344
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,789
I'll try to get
Wilson on the line.

345
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,496
What if it's not how a steamroller
works, but what it does?

346
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,003
Clears things.

347
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,734
It's a waste of time.

348
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,583
I need that phone call.

349
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,683
I'm a doctor.

350
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,155
When someone tries to call
you three times, it's code for

351
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,624
"Pick up the damn phone
before someone dies."

352
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,957
I'm sure there's
other smart doctors.

353
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,462
You'd be surprised.

354
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,466
You told me you'd
taken care of this.

355
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,933
I did.

356
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,095
The first words
you ever said to me.

357
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,139
I took care of it.

358
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,140
You must have
screwed up somehow.

359
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:55,010
Sir? Not to hurry you, but
we need to be at a funeral in...

360
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,209
Nobody is going anywhere
or taking any phone calls

361
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,344
till I hear back from Louisiana.

362
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,445
It's a really old warrant.

363
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,841
Isn't there a statute of
limitations on this kind of thing?

364
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,689
It's suspended when
you flee the state.

365
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,322
I didn't flee the
state, I left the state,

366
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,059
because I don't
live in the state.

367
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:17,194
And the charges
were just so minor...

368
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,263
"Vandalism, destruction
of property, assault..."

369
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,673
There is a simple explanation.

370
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,007
There was a medical
convention in New Orleans.

371
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,944
You don't need to explain to me.

372
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,213
I was fresh out of med school.

373
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,876
I didn't know anybody
at the convention.

374
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,920
You heard the man, Wilson.
You don't have to explain.

375
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,955
I am not going to
sit here wasting time

376
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,684
just so you can avoid
your father's funeral.

377
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,586
He's my father.

378
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,029
I have the right to
avoid his funeral.

379
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,066
Not if your mother's
alive, you don't.

380
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,431
Okay. Explain.

381
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,405
Did House react to
the eight centimeters?

382
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,443
He whistled. It's huge.
Anyone would think so.

383
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,569
House doesn't whistle
because he's impressed.

384
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,511
Means he wasn't expecting it.

385
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,879
Means he changed
his mind at that point.

386
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,578
A single super-sized cyst
ruled out a diffuse process,

387
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,245
like scleroderma or lupus.

388
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,065
Rule out diffuse process,
you're stuck with single process,

389
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,717
affecting just the pancreas.

390
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,759
Gallstones or
pancreatic divisum.

391
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,871
Whatever he asked next
would have narrowed that down.

392
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,090
He asked about location.

393
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,131
Heads, it's gallstones.
Tails, it's divisum.

394
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,394
It's at the head.
She's got gallstones.

395
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,402
The steamroller means
potholes, means...

396
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,835
Relax. We got it.

397
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,566
You figured out
she's got gallstones?

398
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,909
I was at the hotel bar,
trying to unwind with a drink.

399
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,211
There was this guy
who kept playing

400
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:40,776
Billy Joel's <i>Leave a Tender
Moment Alone</i> on the jukebox.

401
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,617
<i>Leave a Tender
Moment</i> is a good song.

402
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,623
It's a great song.
He was out of line.

403
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,182
Not as good as <i>Scenes
from an Italian Restaurant</i> or...

404
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:51,196
So I asked the
man to stop. Politely.

405
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,232
Yeah, you yelled politely.

406
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,461
I was polite the
first couple of times.

407
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,062
But courtesy made no
impression on this ass.

408
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:04,167
So I threw a bottle
into the mirror,

409
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,111
which successfully
conveyed my message.

410
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,978
And smashed a
10-foot antique mirror.

411
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,349
And set an example for two other
patrons, who threw shot glasses...

412
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,888
I had nothing to
do with that fight.

413
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,981
The assault charge
was totally bogus.

414
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,458
And I paid for the mirror.

415
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,017
I think I have the picture.

416
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,490
I assume you're the guy
who was playing the song.

417
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,966
No, I was the guy
who bailed him out.

418
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,663
That's how we
met. I was in jail.

419
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,935
This guy was a total stranger
to you, and you bailed him out?

420
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,976
It was a boring convention.

421
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,601
I had to have
somebody to drink with.

422
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,272
And there's the foundation
of our entire friendship.

423
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,146
If you hadn't been bored one
weekend, it wouldn't even exist.

424
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,186
Hey, with 3,000 people
at that convention,

425
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,431
you were the one I thought
wasn't boring. That says something.

426
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,117
It also says something
that you lied to me

427
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,367
about getting the
charges dropped.

428
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,758
I got a lawyer, he cut a
deal. You didn't call the guy?

429
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,319
You have to show up at the
arraignment. Everybody knows that.

430
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,230
Everybody with your
misdemeanor experience.

431
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,325
You can go.

432
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,460
What?

433
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,266
He's a fugitive from justice.

434
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,637
That whole story was
lies. He stabbed a man.

435
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:12,405
Louisiana doesn't want
to pay to get you back.

436
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:15,607
Forget Louisiana. He
was driving recklessly

437
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,980
through your comatose village.

438
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,178
What, do they put lead
in the jelly donuts here?

439
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,118
Stop acting like such an ingrate

440
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,418
and go pay your
respects to your father.

441
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,757
CT confirmed gallstones.

442
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:33,561
Normally not dangerous, almost
everyone has them, but sometimes...

443
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,861
They kill you?

444
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,528
Yup. Unless I take them out.

445
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,231
We do it laparoscopically.

446
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,367
Um...

447
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,936
How long has her
urine been brown?

448
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,810
Kidneys were
fine this afternoon.

449
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,509
They're not now.

450
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,749
It's not the gallstones.

451
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,888
Well, of course
it's not gallstones.

452
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,220
Who thought it was gallstones?

453
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,590
You said "steamroller."

454
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,458
I also said "construction site."

455
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,397
Gallstones could
cause a pancreatic cyst.

456
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,367
Just turn around. The thing
is two hours over already,

457
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,475
and that's the third time
we've passed that colonial

458
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,699
with the cross
burning out front.

459
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,263
I'm not lost.

460
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,652
I'm not talking about
what caused the cyst.

461
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,508
I'm talking about
what the cyst caused.

462
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,602
<i>Everything.</i>

463
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,443
Cysts are symptoms,
not diagnoses.

464
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,212
Unless it's a multiple cyst with
connections to other organs.

465
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,480
Like a steamroller.

466
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,579
That's a long road
down to the kidneys.

467
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:32,181
How do we prove it?
Won't be visible on a scan,

468
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,623
Chase isn't gonna
go groping around

469
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,024
when she's got kidney failure.

470
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,187
Bubbles.

471
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,305
Is that your new stripper name?

472
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,329
Yes.

473
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,264
And also, we inject bubbles into
the cyst and follow where they drift.

474
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,345
If they end up in her other organs, we
know you're right, cut it out, she's fine.

475
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,361
Bubbles is right. Go echo.

476
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,874
I'm not lost.

477
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,557
Nicole, you gotta stay still.

478
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,096
I'm nervous.

479
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,099
You're not nervous.
It's the DTs, isn't it?

480
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,602
I haven't had a
drink since I got here.

481
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,936
Good heavens. We
haven't missed it after all.

482
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,171
It's like the end of
<i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

483
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,518
I'm so glad you're here.

484
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:45,062
It's a load off of my
mind just to see you.

485
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,359
Thank you, James.

486
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,334
Mom, how could
you delay the funeral?

487
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,736
Honey, your dad is dead.
He's not going to care.

488
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,637
Do you know what
you're going to say?

489
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,835
I don't know. Just
let the minister,

490
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,811
or one of his buddies
from the Corps...

491
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,141
You're talking.

492
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,239
I don't care that
you didn't like him.

493
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,080
He was your father
and he loved you.

494
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,383
The war is over, Greg.

495
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,752
Please do this for me.

496
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,886
Stop looking so worried.

497
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,927
I know he's gonna make me proud.

498
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,969
I'm sure you know
him better than I do.

499
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,170
Her liver's been compromised.

500
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,871
And the DTs will
cause her muscles

501
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,244
to continue to twitch,
even under sedation.

502
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,215
We need to paralyze
her to do this procedure.

503
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,944
I wanted to stop.

504
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,111
A phenobarbital coma
will not only allow us

505
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,678
to inject the cyst,
it'll treat the DTs.

506
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,190
When she wakes up,
she won't be in withdrawal.

507
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,989
We've seen her through
withdrawal before.

508
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,121
We've seen her
through everything.

509
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,394
We've been supportive,
we've been combative.

510
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,544
We've picked her up from
bars in the middle of the night,

511
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,764
we've let her spend
the night in jail.

512
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,307
I used to say it would be
okay, that I'd get it together.

513
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,006
I don't say that anymore.

514
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,342
Let's make you healthy.

515
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,352
Then we'll worry about
making you sober.

516
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,787
The Lord is my
shepherd, I shall not want.

517
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,849
I am not talking.

518
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,988
We were strangers. We shared
some geography 30 years ago.

519
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,533
Right. He had no
influence on you at all.

520
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,136
The father who was
compulsive about punctuality.

521
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:34,867
His issue, which I
deliberately made not my issue.

522
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,636
Thereby making it your issue.

523
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,939
Compulsively showing
up four hours late,

524
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,537
ignoring discipline,
ignoring rules...

525
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,377
Oh, God. He's here.

526
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,746
Who's here?

527
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,882
The one you're
pretending is your father?

528
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,281
Nice pick, he looks
like Sean Connery.

529
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:56,624
So, back when you were devising
this fantasy, did you tell your father?

530
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,926
"Dad, I refuse to
recognize your existence

531
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,195
"because I've chosen
James Bond as my dad?"

532
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,630
I used different words.

533
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,000
What?

534
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,335
Hearing your own
son hates you so much

535
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,244
he's replaced you in his mind?

536
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,338
That's gotta suck.
How did he take it?

537
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,282
I already told you.

538
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,582
He didn't speak to
me for a summer.

539
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,754
It means more to
me than I can say

540
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,732
to have all of you here today.

541
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:41,999
And now our son, Gregory,
would like to say a few words.

542
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,339
Greg?

543
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,295
There's a lot of
people here today,

544
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,268
including some from the Corps.

545
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,001
And I notice that
every one of them

546
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,803
is either my father's
rank or higher,

547
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,908
and that doesn't surprise me,

548
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:28,016
because if the test of a man is how
he treats those he has power over,

549
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,250
it was a test my father failed.

550
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,926
This man you're
eager to pay homage to,

551
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,692
he was incapable of admitting
any point of view but his own.

552
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,706
He punished failure, and he did
not accept anything less than...

553
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,815
He loved doing what he did.

554
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,148
He saw his work as some kind of

555
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,851
sacred calling,

556
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,088
more important than
any personal relationship.

557
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,863
Maybe if he'd been a better
father, I'd be a better son.

558
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:28,437
But I am what I am because
of him. For better or for worse.

559
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,309
And I just... I just wish...

560
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,048
Put it back.

561
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,456
Well, he's not gonna miss it.

562
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,724
I'm done enabling. You can't
even let them put him in the ground

563
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,890
without making it
serve your agenda.

564
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,843
You really wanna do
this in front of everybody?

565
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,699
You wanna punish me or them?

566
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,879
How can I still feel surprise?

567
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:45,015
You would take even this, a moment of
real human grief, and turn it into a farce.

568
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,686
Oh, cut the crap.
You enjoy what I do.

569
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,195
I never had to force you, you
like coming along for the ride.

570
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,323
Yes, that's why I'm
cheering you on now.

571
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,698
This is about you needing
to be prepared for the worst.

572
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,703
So you become an oncologist.

573
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,467
No surprises there, the
worst happens all the time.

574
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,566
But Amber, she was
young and healthy.

575
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,008
Her death came out of nowhere.

576
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,601
Don't bring Amber into this.

577
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,169
And you weren't ready.

578
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,147
That makes you
angry. The world sucks,

579
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,726
and you didn't have
time to brace yourself.

580
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,981
What happened out
there is your show.

581
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,453
You're scared to death of
losing anyone that matters,

582
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,499
so you dump the person
who matters the most to you.

583
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,992
I'm not scared to death,
I'm moving forward.

584
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,824
Because no one can take away
from you what you no longer have.

585
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,960
Your father's
death is about you.

586
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,500
Amber's death is about you.

587
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,745
I can't imagine why someone
wouldn't want to be your friend.

588
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:34,035
Admit it. You're angry and
you're scared of losing me.

589
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,040
I'm not angry, I'm
not scared. Admit it.

590
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,939
I'm not afraid. Admit it!

591
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,274
I've lost people. It
happens. Admit it. Admit it!

592
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,041
What are you, five?
Stop repeating...

593
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,140
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.

594
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,117
Come on, admit it! Admit it!

595
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,883
Still not boring.

596
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,363
Did you know I was
going to do that?

597
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,192
Because I didn't know
I was going to do that.

598
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,600
I know you have
trouble losing people.

599
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,531
In New Orleans,
I saw you carrying

600
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,768
this express package
around the conference,

601
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,011
and you wouldn't let it go,
but you wouldn't open it,

602
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,139
so I peeked at
the return address.

603
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,842
Diamond, Fairbarren.

604
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,384
Divorce attorneys.

605
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,114
Your first wife had just
served you with papers.

606
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,656
Did you know that
when you bailed me out?

607
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:27,955
Were you doing
something nice for me?

608
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,018
What did I say
about being boring?

609
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,364
We owe your mom an apology.

610
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,329
Hello. It's House.

611
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,735
<i>How'd the bubble test go?</i>

612
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,706
The problem wasn't the cyst. It's
advanced dilated cardiomyopathy.

613
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:43,985
We did a three-dimensional echo,

614
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,375
showed a mass
in the left atrium.

615
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,173
<i>Looks like an atrial myxoma.</i>

616
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,807
But the ultrasound images are
a little grainy, so it's hard to tell.

617
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,145
House?

618
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,742
The images aren't grainy.

619
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,252
They sure look grainy.

620
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,880
I've seen pictures of
you where you looked tall.

621
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,424
It's an iron overload,

622
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,531
creates speckles on the
image, makes it look grainy.

623
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,495
<i>Also makes her pancreas fail,
her blood clot, her intestines...</i>

624
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,258
Atrial myxoma is more likely.

625
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,890
MRI for a better view.

626
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,443
<i>Then call me back and
tell me you're embarrassed</i>

627
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,959
because my eyesight
is better 500 miles away.

628
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,935
<i>I need a phone number.</i>

629
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,775
I'm a doctor in New Jersey,
treating one of your clients.

630
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,375
Young woman looking
for her biological parents.

631
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,148
You know, you could
just wait for the MRI

632
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,088
to have your
curiosity satisfied.

633
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:35,958
What person who is nothing
like me are you saying that to?

634
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,123
Did the parents look tan?

635
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,597
<i>The disease she has is genetic,</i>

636
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,224
<i>which means they
should have it, too.</i>

637
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,201
They don't look more
tan than anyone else.

638
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,396
Discolored teeth?

639
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,133
They're farmers. Their village
doesn't even have a dentist.

640
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,300
Right. Thanks.

641
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,039
But if it matters, I'm not
convinced they were her parents.

642
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,136
Why not?

643
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,738
<i>Because they said
they had no daughter.</i>

644
00:36:56,815 --> 00:37:00,217
The man was adamant, and the
woman seemed confused and frightened.

645
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,514
Thank you.

646
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,919
Differential.

647
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,926
Say you're a middle-aged
Chinese woman.

648
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,825
Fine. Say it.

649
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,921
I'm a middle-aged Chinese woman.

650
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,490
Girl comes to you, says that
she's your long-lost daughter.

651
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,002
Why would you be frightened?

652
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:24,236
I'm frightened because she's a
threat, maybe she knows something.

653
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,971
She hasn't seen you
since she was an infant.

654
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,570
Maybe an inheritance issue.

655
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,012
They're peasants.

656
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,877
Her very presence
is a threat. She...

657
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,388
What year was she born?

658
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,684
'83.

659
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,419
She's not supposed to be alive.

660
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,388
China introduced the
One Child Policy in 1979.

661
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,762
Say they didn't want a girl.

662
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,266
They tried to kill her.

663
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,666
But maybe the baby doesn't die,

664
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,931
maybe the father
panics, or regrets it,

665
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,235
takes the baby to an orphanage,

666
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,672
maybe he doesn't tell his wife.

667
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,301
Who freaks out like she's
seen a ghost 25 years later

668
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,811
when the girl shows up.

669
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,405
But why does attempted
murder from 25 years ago

670
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,211
suddenly become
relevant to her health now?

671
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,411
Maybe they gave
her something toxic.

672
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,215
It would have to be fat soluble.

673
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,521
This is fun, isn't it?

674
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,095
Let me see the MRI.

675
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,227
We don't have one.

676
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,396
She started vomiting as
soon as we started the scan.

677
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,841
Then let her vomit through the
MRI. That's what nurses are for.

678
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,141
Her parents tried to kill her.

679
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:38,674
I don't know how, but I know it
caused her to get sick 25 years later

680
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,276
trying to lift a
Buddha. Explain.

681
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,716
I already had this conversation
with Wilson. Just go with it.

682
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,985
Poison?

683
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,235
Buddha wouldn't make it worse.

684
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,057
Maybe the weight
stressed her back, which...

685
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,030
Makes sense if she's never
lifted anything in her life.

686
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:56,261
She actually didn't get sick till
she tried lifting it that second time.

687
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,098
I'm guessing the weight changed.

688
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,939
Anyone have Taub's pager number?

689
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,374
What's up?

690
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,036
Maybe give him a call.

691
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,343
If he tosses that switch
on the MRI, she's dead.

692
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,974
X-ray her brain.

693
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,748
Pins.

694
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,380
Push them through the
soft fontanel of an infant,

695
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:22,325
you skewer the brain, and
the hair hides the entry wounds.

696
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,691
It's the perfect crime.

697
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,239
She's had them in
her all these years.

698
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:26,629
What changed at the temple?

699
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,724
Same thing that
changed in the MRI.

700
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,099
<i>Shockingly, not all
religious leaders are honest.</i>

701
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,729
<i>I'm guessing these particular
monks are bilking the faithful</i>

702
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,774
<i>by pushing a magnet
up Buddha's butt.</i>

703
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,151
<i>There's another
one under the table</i>

704
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,667
<i>that'll repel or attract,
depending on how you shift it.</i>

705
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,406
<i>When she picked up that magnet,</i>

706
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,742
<i>it moved one of the pins deeper</i>

707
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,874
<i>into the sympathetic
nervous center of her brain.</i>

708
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,440
<i>This sent a signal
through the nerves</i>

709
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,918
<i>to the blood vessels
in her small intestines</i>

710
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,516
that caused the symptoms in China
and in the giant magnet we call an MRI.

711
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,082
She's lucky.

712
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,488
We're all screwed up by our
parents, she's got documentation.

713
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,038
The pins will be removed
surgically, and she'll be fine.

714
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,973
We'll wake her from the
coma after the operation.

715
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,567
Is there any way
you could not tell her?

716
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,904
Please. She's fragile.

717
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,980
She desperately wanted to
know her biological parents.

718
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,646
For her to find out that
they wanted her dead,

719
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,314
I don't know what
that'll do to her.

720
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,757
She may not be as
fragile as you think.

721
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,157
We know our daughter.

722
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,526
See this pin here?

723
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,863
It's been pressing directly
on her addiction center.

724
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,995
It's not her fault, and it's
definitely not your fault.

725
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,766
She's not who you think she is.

726
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,218
I hear your patient's
going to be all right.

727
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:08,089
Is that why you're here? A
colleague checking up on a patient?

728
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,394
Something going on?

729
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,529
I'm celebrating.

730
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,078
My mom hated him, too.

731
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,649
Your DNA test showed
no match? That's incredible.

732
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,019
At the age of 12, you
actually figured out

733
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:33,115
your father wasn't
your birth father?

734
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,050
That's what you
wanted, wasn't it?

735
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,723
Why should it depress you?

736
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,059
It doesn't depress me.

737
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,534
It doesn't make any difference
at all. That's what depresses me.

738
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:53,476
Well, I guess nobody gets to
choose who their parents are.

739
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:59,677
I'm not even sure anymore we
get to choose who our friends are.

740
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,021
I spoke with Cuddy. She
hasn't filled my position yet.

741
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,659
If you're coming back just
because you're attracted

742
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,165
to the shine of my neediness,

743
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,935
I'd be okay with that.

744
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,807
I'm coming back
because you were right.

745
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,640
That strange, annoying
trip we just took

746
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,013
was the most fun I've
had since Amber died.

747
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,188
You hungry?

748
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,294
Wilson.

749
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,528
Yeah?

750
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:54,972
My dad's dead.

751
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,539
Yeah. My sympathies.
