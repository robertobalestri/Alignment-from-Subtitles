1
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,884
Bye.

2
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,931
I want to be alone with my wife.

3
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,645
I'm a selfish SOB.

4
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,949
I never got you to Rio.

5
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,514
There was always

6
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,289
one more problem at the stores.

7
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,989
You deserved better than that.

8
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,031
I love you.

9
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,630
I always have.

10
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,202
I'm ready.

11
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,073
It's okay.

12
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,178
I know...

13
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,746
Somebody

14
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,381
help her.

15
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,247
Help her!

16
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,426
Fifty-four-year-old woman
with acute respiratory failure.

17
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,948
No anaphylaxis, lung
issues or tracheal lesions.

18
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,958
Tox screen was clean for
coke and amphetamines.

19
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,728
I will give you 30 reasons, one for
each pound that caused the apnea,

20
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,893
which inflamed the epiglottis.

21
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,427
Why's our rainbow coalition
missing Brown and Bi?

22
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,905
Thirteen's with the patient,
and Kutner's dog's sick.

23
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,203
He should be in by lunch.

24
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,972
No apnea because no sleeping
problems when she's sleeping.

25
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,445
She's spent the last six months

26
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,553
caring for her husband
who's dying of heart failure.

27
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,982
Reason 31, whatever
whacked the husband's heart

28
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,815
is also whacking her airway.

29
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,254
And, oh, good, I thought maybe Kutner
was home nursing the rib you broke

30
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,292
when you elbowed your way
in for credit on the last patient.

31
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,189
I contributed. And the patient's
illness wasn't caused by her husband,

32
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,754
unless lung cancer
is contagious.

33
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,265
Interesting.

34
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,562
Not about the patient,
that was kind of dull.

35
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,696
I thought maybe you were lying to
cover for Kutner, which sounds noble,

36
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,969
except you're doing it
out of guilt, instead of love.

37
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,772
She visited her sister in
Hawaii about six months ago,

38
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,121
just before her
husband got sick.

39
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,808
Could've picked up melioidosis
from one of the islands.

40
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,406
Would have jumped
to the husband,

41
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,952
finished off him and his
lame immune system.

42
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,351
No tumors, no
drugs, no bacteria...

43
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,413
Leaves viral. Varicella zoster.

44
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,482
Start her on IV
fluids and acyclovir.

45
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,356
Can't. She's demanding
to be released

46
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,771
so she can get
home to her husband.

47
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,991
How sweet. They
can die together,

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,226
instead of separately,
40 years apart.

49
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,668
She claims he got stronger as
soon as she stopped breathing.

50
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,102
The mind can heal the body.

51
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,573
Seeing his wife in distress might
have actually slowed down his death.

52
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,439
Or he just had an
adrenaline surge

53
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,741
when he saw his chance
to hit the singles market.

54
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,644
Send her home. We don't need to.

55
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,482
I had an idea, all by myself.

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,718
Eddie?

57
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,887
Found him
loitering in the lobby.

58
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,453
You're still with me.

59
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,294
Where the hell
else am I gonna go?

60
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,596
And now, with your permission,

61
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,727
we'd like to try to
make you better.

62
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,909
The pageant starts in an
hour. You have to do something.

63
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,573
There's something
wrong inside her head.

64
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,345
It's like she has no idea
what's going on around her.

65
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,150
I thought she was
just flirting with me.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,222
I could fix it, but it's
gonna cost you $3.75.

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,622
Well, I'm not just gonna
give you my coffee.

68
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,856
Think of it as Costa
Rican sober juice.

69
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,166
She's drunk?

70
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,798
That little minty scent hiding
beneath the rose petal perfume,

71
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,774
and the cherry
blossom moisturizer,

72
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,868
and the morning dew hairspray...

73
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,809
You sneak into Mommy's bathroom

74
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,473
and gulp some of her mouthwash?

75
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,545
Gotta be perfect.

76
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,483
You spit it out?

77
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,044
Mommy doesn't.

78
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,217
Treatment worked.

79
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,470
Charlotte's breathing's back to
normal. She's being discharged.

80
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,362
She can resume her vigil over her
husband. He's started fading again.

81
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,921
Win some, lose some.

82
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,662
And, strictly speaking, since
he's not my patient, win some.

83
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,294
Oh, look at the time.

84
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,965
It's half past Taub
was lying about Kutner.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,509
He probably went
to a comic book fest,

86
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,754
spent the night at some Wonder
Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll...

87
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,940
Find out what, or
who, he's doing.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,120
Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to
write it under "Reason for Termination."

89
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,080
Is that Kutner? Charlotte.

90
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,489
O2 sat and S-T are
normal. It's not her airway.

91
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,419
You're okay.

92
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,792
Yeah, don't worry
about me, she's in pain.

93
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,722
Pulse is rapid and
regular, no fluid in her lungs.

94
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,062
What's happening?

95
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:08,993
I don't know.

96
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,869
Kutner. It's Foreman and 13.

97
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,309
Where are you going?

98
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,403
House didn't ask us to
find out where he wasn't.

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,711
If you wanna climb a
fifth-floor fire escape...

100
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,273
This might be faster.

101
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,949
Kutner!

102
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,317
Man-boy heaven.

103
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,828
Surprised he ever leaves.

104
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,406
There's nothing on his
calendar. His pager's still here.

105
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,570
Oh, God.

106
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,918
Need an ambulance at
410 Willis, apartment 5C.

107
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,302
Twenty-eight-year-old male, single
gunshot wound to the right temple.

108
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,726
No pulse.

109
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,234
Alert Princeton-Plainsboro,
have a trauma unit ready.

110
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,260
His pupils are dilated,
his head's swollen.

111
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,393
Still no pulse. Come on, Kutner!

112
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,130
Let me try.

113
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,943
He's cold.

114
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,275
Eric.

115
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,683
He didn't say
anything to any of you?

116
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,690
Family problems? Bad
relationship? Financial pressures?

117
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,701
His parents were shot
right in front of him.

118
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,604
Parents are ancient history.

119
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,072
Not to someone
who actually cares.

120
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:33,144
He didn't slit his wrists and
peacefully drift away, he shot himself.

121
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,750
He didn't leave a
note, that means panic.

122
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,319
Which could've been pre-empted if
the idiots who worked alongside him

123
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,254
for 80 hours a week
had seen this coming.

124
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,655
You're blaming us?

125
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,383
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

126
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,487
We would've helped him if
he'd reached out to us. He didn't.

127
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,029
We should've picked
up on something.

128
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,658
This isn't our fault.

129
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,100
Something like 25%
of suicidal people

130
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,105
show no outward
signs of depression.

131
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,631
No, 25% of suicidal
people have friends

132
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,787
who didn't notice anything
and don't want to feel guilty.

133
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:08,543
Killing yourself also
kills all other options.

134
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,880
Makes Kutner an idiot.

135
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,045
So pity, yes, but guilt, no.

136
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,850
If that's what you
want to tell yourself.

137
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,016
We still have a patient.

138
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:22,152
Actually, two. One worsening,
one who should be worsening.

139
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,788
You can't be in denial about
Kutner and the husband.

140
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,857
It is possible Eddie's
body is willing itself to live.

141
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,959
Well, call the tabloids.

142
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,803
Tell them you just witnessed the miracle
of slightly increased kidney function.

143
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,668
Maybe we should pass
this file off to another doctor.

144
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,976
And the next one, too?
And the one after that?

145
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,145
How many files till it's
okay that Kutner's dead?

146
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,819
Cardiac enzymes means
she didn't have a heart attack.

147
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,954
No vision problems means
no mitochondrial disease.

148
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,226
Could be a metabolic
disorder. Acidosis.

149
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,995
Blood pH was normal.

150
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,969
Polyserositis would inflame the
membranes near her epiglottis

151
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,496
and the heart's pericardium,
causing the chest pain.

152
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,470
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,305
I've hired a grief counselor,
who I'm sure none of you will see.

154
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,826
And I'm offering time off, which
I'm sure none of you will take.

155
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,876
But just know it's available.

156
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,751
Polyserositis fits. Start
her on indomethacin.

157
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,542
If you'd rather not
deal with this case...

158
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,662
I'm fine, despite
what Wilson will say.

159
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,966
He hasn't come to you?

160
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,439
Pretty sure he has
Mah-jongg Tuesday mornings.

161
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,033
I assume he thinks that I
will work through this better

162
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,740
if I don't have to keep flicking
his wings off my shoulder.

163
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,081
You didn't even have an inkling?

164
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,112
I know his fantasy football team
cratered, figured he'd gotten over it.

165
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,653
Well...

166
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,762
Sorry for your loss.

167
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,600
Thanks. It's not my loss.

168
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,295
Then I'm sorry
you don't think it is.

169
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,350
Patient's membranes aren't
going to heal themselves.

170
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,581
Taub went to run the treatment.

171
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,788
We'd like to go see
Kutner's parents.

172
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,854
I'll join you.

173
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,700
Polyserositis damages the protective
covering around tissue and organs.

174
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,436
The indomethacin is simply an
anti-inflammatory, but it should fix it.

175
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,444
Just make the pain stop.

176
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,842
Charlotte.

177
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,282
Close your eyes.

178
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,481
Now.

179
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,251
Pretend you finally
made it down to Rio.

180
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,091
You're on the balcony of

181
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,968
some fancy hotel.

182
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,965
You never talk like this.

183
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,531
Yeah, just shut up
and let me do this.

184
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,307
And you're on that balcony, and
you are watching the Mardi Gras.

185
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,471
It's called Carnival.

186
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,177
And I don't want
to go without you.

187
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,119
I want you to.

188
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,956
And I want it to be everything
you've ever dreamed of.

189
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:46,593
Sorry to interrupt, but I'd
like to run one more test.

190
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,798
On you.

191
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,034
This is the first day
we got him. He was six.

192
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,179
Sweetest little
boy you ever met.

193
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,139
Must have been scary,

194
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,844
going through a trauma, and then
being handed off to a new family.

195
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,321
We kept telling him to
call us Richard and Julia,

196
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,586
but it was always
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner.

197
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,388
Then, on his ninth birthday,
we gave him a chemistry set.

198
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,723
Lawrence always
loved blowing things up.

199
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,368
And he said, "Thanks,
Mom. Thanks, Dad."

200
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,376
That's who we were from then on.

201
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,047
He was pretty special.
We were lucky to have him.

202
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,346
You spent the
most time with him.

203
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,222
He spoke so
highly of all of you.

204
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,020
Do you have any idea...

205
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,559
I wish we did.

206
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,265
We all... HOUSE:
It was his name.

207
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,030
He was conflicted.
Didn't know where he fit in.

208
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:02,107
Being ripped out of his
world and stuck into yours.

209
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,700
We encouraged him to
hold on to his heritage.

210
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,372
It's hard to still be
Lawrence Choudhary

211
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,482
when everyone sees
you as Lawrence Kutner.

212
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,950
It was his idea
to take our name.

213
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,917
You should have said no. House.

214
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,457
All his Anglo name gave him was the
illusion that he was someone he wasn't.

215
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,719
You were being
emotional, not rational.

216
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,422
You didn't understand him.

217
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,986
We loved that boy,
you son of a bitch.

218
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,794
You wanted to make him
happy by shutting out his pain.

219
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,028
When he looked happy, you
assumed the pain had gone,

220
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,299
but it just got buried deeper,

221
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,870
leaving him tormented about who
he was, until finally he put a bullet...

222
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,137
House.

223
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,475
Go back to the hospital.

224
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,427
I'm sorry about your son.

225
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,177
Indomethacin had no effect, she's
still in pain. Rules out polyserositis.

226
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,686
I ran a hormone panel on Eddie.

227
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,484
His prolactin's above normal.

228
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,252
Means he's actually improving.

229
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,154
Body chemistry changes
for all sorts of reasons.

230
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,288
Stress, fear, why not love?

231
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,300
Maybe he's going into
some sort of remission.

232
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,496
You haven't asked if I learned
anything relevant from the Kutners.

233
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,435
If you had, I'm sure
you'd have mentioned it.

234
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,270
Or you're just afraid
there is something relevant,

235
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,606
which would mean you
could have saved him.

236
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,805
I don't buy that suicide
is always a cry for help.

237
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,973
Sometimes you
just don't want help.

238
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,217
Good thing you got some,

239
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,018
or you'd have tried
again and gotten it right.

240
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,650
She doesn't have Wegener's.

241
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,519
Kidney function's normal.

242
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,622
It's not byssinosis, it's
not mitral valve stenosis.

243
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,292
Nothing fits.

244
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,637
If it doesn't fit any diagnosis,

245
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,071
that just leaves one diagnosis.

246
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,146
I'm Dr. House.

247
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,683
You have hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

248
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,615
His heart is too weak,
yours is too strong.

249
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,210
Good news is it's fixable.

250
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,188
We induce a massive heart
attack and kill off the extra muscle.

251
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,747
You want to give
me a heart attack?

252
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,157
It's only dangerous if
your heart is normal-sized.

253
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,957
But since all the...
Are you serious?

254
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,357
No.

255
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,667
This is actually very annoying,
and I'm getting really bored

256
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,669
of lying to patients
to scare them

257
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,796
into telling me the
truth. She's faking.

258
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,863
And, yes, if she keeps faking,

259
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,341
I'm going to eventually do
something that will kill her.

260
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,607
How could she be...
The windpipe thing?

261
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,739
That was real. The
treatment made her better.

262
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,793
But good for her was bad
for you, which was bad for her,

263
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,184
so she made herself
bad. It's all so simple.

264
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,054
She figured that the sicker she
was, the longer you'd hang on.

265
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:06,819
Charlotte?

266
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,692
We haven't been
this close for years.

267
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,827
I wanted to hang on to that.

268
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,500
Oh, please.

269
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,402
People hate reruns.

270
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,671
It's my leg. I
swear, this is real.

271
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,873
Do you pinky swear or you
just plain swear, because...

272
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,847
How can she fake that?

273
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,053
She can't.

274
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:45,030
So, what can shred an epiglottis
and make muscle disappear?

275
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,827
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner.

276
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,099
They caused Kutner's
death, why not Charlotte's?

277
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,834
Mourning period's over.
Foreman's sense of irony is back.

278
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,206
I was wrong about
the ethnic reason.

279
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,211
Step one, change your name back.

280
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,681
Step two, if step one
fails, move to Bangalore.

281
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,652
Step 14, if step 13
doesn't work, kill yourself.

282
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,120
So, what now? You gonna
insult your way through his rolodex

283
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,500
till you find someone
with an answer?

284
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:15,052
I've been polite to the friends I've
called, all of whom were useless.

285
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,873
They weren't useless, they just
didn't know anything more than we did.

286
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,092
Tomato, tomato.

287
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,363
MS. Weakens myelin sheath,
compromises nerve conduction.

288
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,496
I'm talking about Charlotte,
the one who's still alive.

289
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,735
You two, stick her in
an MRI, confirm MS,

290
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,640
and you, run the echo on Eddie

291
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,287
that you're planning
to do behind my back

292
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,143
to see if his heart's improving.

293
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,848
Did you let me hire a pervert?

294
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,115
Well, it'd be
hypocritical of me not to.

295
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,249
Kutner's police background
check from when he started.

296
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,316
He was charged with
indecent exposure.

297
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,862
Kutner streaked at the
Penn-Dartmouth football game.

298
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,195
Precisely the kind of thing
you'd expect him to do.

299
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,631
It's okay.

300
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,697
You should be upset.

301
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,568
He thought like you,
pushed boundaries like you.

302
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,437
If he thought like me,

303
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,270
he'd have known
that living in misery

304
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,709
sucks marginally
less than dying in it.

305
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,283
Just a few more minutes,
then we'll get you back to Eddie.

306
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,489
What's it like, 30 years
with the same man?

307
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:21,350
Great for me, good
for him, I hope.

308
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,654
What, you don't
think he loves you?

309
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,165
I think he always
loved me, in his way.

310
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,032
<i>Just not in a "spend time
with me" or "show emotion"</i>

311
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,436
<i>or "any affection
for me" sort of way.</i>

312
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,606
Why did you stay?

313
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,971
I didn't need him to feel about
me the way I did about him.

314
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,583
<i>Love doesn't...</i>

315
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,250
Charlotte?

316
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,793
I've heard stories
of cancer patients

317
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,593
going into
spontaneous remission.

318
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,932
You think this might
be that sort of thing?

319
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,833
It's unlikely, but
you never know.

320
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,566
If I just had a little more
time to be with Charlotte.

321
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,131
Try and do better by her.

322
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,238
Yeah, maybe.

323
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,903
You don't think I mean it.

324
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,440
I think you mean it now.

325
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,451
I think it's much easier to mean
it than to do anything about it.

326
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,326
Chamber walls are
barely moving. I'm sorry.

327
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,846
He needs a friend.

328
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,310
I can't deal with
this and House.

329
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,149
You need a friend, too.

330
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,985
You couldn't give
a crap what I need,

331
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,890
you just want someone
to take care of him.

332
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,826
He told Kutner's
parents it was their fault.

333
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,065
Ruptured spleen.
Means it's not MS.

334
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,142
What are you doing here?

335
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,876
<i>Waiting for you to fix her spleen, so
we can biopsy it for rheumatoid arthritis.</i>

336
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,417
I'll do it. Go home.

337
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,850
<i>She's not your patient.</i>

338
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,445
And Kutner wasn't my friend.

339
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,257
<i>Kutner wanted to
die, Charlotte doesn't,</i>

340
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:37,057
<i>so in a contest for my
concern and interests, she wins.</i>

341
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,257
Okay, either you're a
cold-hearted bastard,

342
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,357
or you're too
miserable to face it.

343
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,095
Go home and cry.

344
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,201
It's not rheumatoid
arthritis, her liver's scarred.

345
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,105
Whatever she's
got, it's spreading.

346
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,092
For the record,

347
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,962
I'm uncomfortable violating
a dead colleague's dignity.

348
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,400
It's only violating if
we find something.

349
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,707
Good to see you.

350
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,845
What are we looking for?

351
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,079
He was hiding.

352
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,777
Why?

353
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,047
Shame? Fear? Are you okay?

354
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,351
It's okay not to be okay.

355
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,261
"Colonial Warrior
Blaster. Number 101."

356
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,993
He spent months
tracking this down.

357
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,867
He had passions.

358
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,065
He was obviously in pain.

359
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,375
Does it really matter why?

360
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,777
He hung the bad with the good.

361
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,145
His loss beside a reminder
of what he'd gained.

362
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,551
Means he was
open about the pain.

363
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:14,252
Should mean that if it got
worse, he had no reason to hide it.

364
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,432
Here's how we're
gonna handle this, House.

365
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,732
We're going to leave here and
go to the closest bar and drink,

366
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:29,002
tell stories about the time
Kutner almost blew up an OR,

367
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,009
and pass out in our own sick.

368
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,170
Sound like a plan?

369
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,826
What am I missing?

370
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,210
You've got that look.

371
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,311
You figured this out.

372
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,860
You're not here because
you care about Kutner.

373
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,819
You're here because
it's a mystery.

374
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,616
You're here for the puzzle.

375
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,185
What if I didn't miss anything
because there's nothing to miss?

376
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,222
He didn't kill himself.

377
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,667
He was murdered.

378
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,355
Epiglottis, muscle,
spleen, and now her liver,

379
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,918
which is operating at
20% and deteriorating fast.

380
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,430
Autoimmune hepatitis?
Did you page Foreman?

381
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,727
He took up Cuddy's
offer of time off.

382
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,063
Normal thyroid
means no hepatitis.

383
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,470
Could be amyloidosis. Amyloid
build-up hits the organs, tissue...

384
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,250
Her muscles wouldn't
have atrophied.

385
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,867
You run the echo on the husband?

386
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:14,380
Heart's still failing. The
improvement was only temporary.

387
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,937
I prefer the less subtle answer.

388
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,540
"You were right, House."

389
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:21,481
So, less time proving
why hubby isn't dead,

390
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,216
more time proving why Kutner is.

391
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,417
Motives for murder.

392
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,963
House, it was a suicide.

393
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,498
The police have
already investigated.

394
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,659
They investigated what they
saw, not what they didn't saw.

395
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:40,604
Talk to friends, classmates,
pizza delivery guy. Draft Foreman.

396
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,783
He can make calls
through his tears.

397
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:42,831
No.

398
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,900
Is that, "No, I'm not
calling my boyfriend

399
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,822
"who apparently called my boss
instead of me to say he wasn't coming in"?

400
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,607
'Cause it's really not fair to have
that much subtext in one syllable.

401
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,811
We all want to know
why Kutner did it,

402
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,855
but we're not gonna
waste time chasing ghosts.

403
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,187
You're not remotely curious?

404
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,558
Only why a man who
embraces the rational

405
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,598
is suddenly pursuing
the irrational.

406
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:12,464
She could have Alpha
1-antitrypsin deficiency.

407
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,439
Run her AAT proteins.

408
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,142
I'd like to be with Eddie.

409
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,944
It's too soon
after your surgery.

410
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:28,886
You can ask if someone gets
your organs if you die, right?

411
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,547
Even if the donor bank
turned them down?

412
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,183
Individual donors can
bypass the registry,

413
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,387
but there are a
lot of other factors.

414
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,995
Blood type... I've
given him blood.

415
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,862
It's not just... Please.

416
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:46,238
If I go before him, I want
you to give him my heart.

417
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,967
This isn't over yet.

418
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,409
For me.

419
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,739
But it is for him, isn't it?

420
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,011
Yes.

421
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,685
Remy Hadley. I
also answer to 13.

422
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,386
I sometimes sleep with you.

423
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,227
I know I should have called.

424
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,965
I just need some time.

425
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,397
Alone?

426
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,836
I've worked through a
lot of bad stuff in my life,

427
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,005
always done it solo.

428
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,581
So I should go?

429
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,545
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,278
Okay.

431
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,563
IT's been trying to close
out Kutner's email account.

432
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:55,005
Apparently, someone's
still logged on to it.

433
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:58,339
Wasn't hard to figure out
that his password was "Kutner."

434
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,802
He did what they
tell you not to.

435
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,314
He wasn't murdered.
But his parents were.

436
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,326
And the guy who killed
them is coming up for parole.

437
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,081
He's coming up for parole,
he's not out on parole.

438
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,918
Kutner testified at
every one of his hearings.

439
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,955
Guy wouldn't be the first
to see the clock ticking...

440
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,790
He was killed by his own gun.

441
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,421
Which he bought years ago,
obviously for self-defense.

442
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,796
In the temple, cops
found residue. Right.

443
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,997
A murderer would never try to make
it look like suicide, that'd be unethical.

444
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,436
You haven't asked
about my patient.

445
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,706
You're waiting on
AAT protein results.

446
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,282
Means you checked up
to see that I'm still on it.

447
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,113
You want to transfer the case,

448
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,951
but you won't because you think it's
the only thing that's holding me together.

449
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,546
Well, relax.

450
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,124
Either I'm right or I'm wrong.

451
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,625
We'll know soon enough.

452
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,662
Find what's
killing your patient,

453
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,192
and then I'll find
you another patient.

454
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,481
What happened?
Nurses found her like this.

455
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,168
She broke into the cart,
injected whatever she could grab.

456
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,710
Dumb way to look
worse for Eddie.

457
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,438
She wasn't trying to look worse.

458
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,508
She was trying to kill herself.

459
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:14,976
<i>She's stable,</i>

460
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,148
<i>but whatever was left of
her liver is definitely shot now,</i>

461
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,158
<i>and there's no change in Eddie.</i>

462
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,423
<i>So, thanks to her idiotic move,</i>

463
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,397
she's dead in 24 hours if
she doesn't get a new liver.

464
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,798
It was selfless. She loves him.

465
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,903
How does that disagree
with what I just said?

466
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,904
Test was negative
for AAT deficiency.

467
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,408
Myelofibrosis fits, but
testing takes at least 48 hours.

468
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,740
We should try a partial
donation from a live donor.

469
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,722
Damage is too severe.
She needs a whole new liver.

470
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:44,410
No diagnosis, no
liver. No liver, no living.

471
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,248
What do you know?

472
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,620
It is myelofibrosis.

473
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,550
Says so right here.

474
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,885
Who wants to tell Cuddy?

475
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,198
How many times have you
lied to the transplant committee?

476
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,251
Just twice.

477
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,853
How many times has it worked?

478
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,989
I don't quite see
how that's relevant.

479
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,571
Cheese it, it's the coppers.

480
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,836
We're not just gonna leave them
to die while you fixate on Kutner.

481
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,570
Technically, he's
not our patient,

482
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,272
so I'm really only
leaving her to die.

483
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,178
We've already explored
the usual options,

484
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,547
shouldn't we at least
explore unusual ones?

485
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:22,281
Absolutely. Don't worry, this
is why God gave me two ears.

486
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:25,950
Kutner would say we should
just come clean with Cuddy.

487
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,456
Wow, if only he
were here to say that.

488
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,862
I'm sure Cuddy would
be bound to fall for the old,

489
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,527
"Hey, the dead guy won't
mind that we're wasting..."

490
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,272
I need an incurable romantic
to talk to an incurable romantic.

491
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,507
Kutner wasn't murdered.

492
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,244
You deduce that by removing your
sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?

493
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,584
Suicide means you could have
helped him, murder lets you off the hook.

494
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,718
Needs a liver. Has a liver.

495
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,888
He can make a partial donation.

496
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,456
The faster he agrees, the
faster she gets to not die.

497
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,345
Partial won't be enough,
she needs a whole liver.

498
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,237
And he'd never
survive the procedure.

499
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,173
Nice symmetry, huh?

500
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,239
He dies on the table, you
give her his whole liver.

501
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,215
If he's gonna do this,
he's gonna do this for love.

502
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,185
Thought he should talk to
someone who spoke the language.

503
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,854
You want me to die on the table?

504
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,825
We don't want you to.

505
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,361
Your wife needs you to.

506
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,557
My heart?

507
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,757
Is still dying.

508
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,925
You have a couple days at most.

509
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,264
But this could buy us
enough time to save her.

510
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,100
When can I say goodbye?

511
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,371
You can't.

512
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:53,075
If she knew what we were
planning, would she be okay?

513
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,776
She'll resent me.

514
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,850
She'll be alive.
Nothing else matters.

515
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,908
You can't do the transplant.

516
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:27,173
Only if he said no, but your
urgent hovering means he said yes.

517
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,238
His fingers have nodules. I think
his doctors misdiagnosed him.

518
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,080
Or you sprinkled too much
wishful thinking in your tea.

519
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,815
Obese man with lung cancer. Two
easy explanations for his heart failure.

520
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,221
Nodules could mean something
else, something curable.

521
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,554
Go back to the ER.

522
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,685
My thanks to you
and your cold feet.

523
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,253
What's going on? I'm giving
you a shot at a cool result.

524
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,370
Better yet, a chance to
prove other doctors idiotic.

525
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,596
Except you're wrong.

526
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,280
You figure that out by
taking off your sunglasses

527
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,705
to the strains of a Who song?

528
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,038
The guy who killed
Kutner's parents

529
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,474
died of an aneurysm
two months ago.

530
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,604
Kutner hid from everyone.

531
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,275
You didn't get a chance
to save him. No one did.

532
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:08,278
Run the test. Find out if you
have a chance to save Eddie.

533
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,154
Bad news.

534
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,163
Love can't save you.

535
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,031
On the other hand,

536
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,037
mold can.

537
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,076
Your heart failure was
caused by a fungal infection

538
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,578
called cardiac blastomycosis.

539
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,308
Started as nodules
in your lungs,

540
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,409
which every doc, except
one, mistook for cancer.

541
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,147
It's very rare, very curable.

542
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,813
I'm starting you
on itraconazole.

543
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,290
But how come I was getting
better without the medicine?

544
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,294
Your emotional state
bumps your catecholamines,

545
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,681
which help raise
your prolactin...

546
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:51,992
My emotional state?

547
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,296
Three months of treatment, you'll
be back to your buff, chiseled self.

548
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,261
I don't want the treatment.

549
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,269
Do the transplant.

550
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:07,335
You'd be trading the
certainty that you'll live

551
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,275
for the uncertainty
that she'll live.

552
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,742
I was ready to die anyway.

553
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,021
Now you get to be
nicer to your next wife.

554
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,751
If you won't do it, release me.

555
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:28,229
And when I get hit by a car
and show up in your morgue,

556
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,866
you can give her my liver then.

557
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,375
You're basically asking
us to commit murder.

558
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,178
I was yesterday, too.

559
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,547
There's a difference when he has
20 years to live instead of two days.

560
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,644
Not really, not legally.

561
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,951
That's your way of
convincing us to do this,

562
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,650
by saying it's no more immoral?

563
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,989
The idiot is gonna do
this with or without us.

564
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,722
This way, we can
protect the organ.

565
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,263
We should be protecting him.

566
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,300
So we strap him to the
bed, wait till his wife dies?

567
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,130
I'm not doing this.

568
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,300
I will.

569
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,908
We've already had
one pointless death.

570
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,219
Eddie? What's going on?

571
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
I don't know. He just
came and got me.

572
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,089
Your husband has
a curable disease,

573
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,458
but he wants to die so
he can give you his liver.

574
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,840
Are you okay with that, or would
you rather he take the treatment?

575
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,355
You son of a bitch.

576
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,627
Eddie, don't.

577
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,168
You have to let me do this.

578
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,897
Charlotte, can you hear me?

579
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,637
She spiked a fever. LP shows
her white cells through the roof.

580
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,938
She's infected everywhere.

581
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,206
I should fire you.

582
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,179
I just did what
you failed to do.

583
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,307
Convince Eddie to
live and let his wife die.

584
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,375
Infection means
we have a new clue.

585
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,579
And a full two or three
hours to figure it out.

586
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,622
Sarcoidosis. Hits the
spleen and the liver.

587
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,713
She'd have lung issues.

588
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,190
Scleroderma inflames the tissue.

589
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,727
No skin or GI problems.

590
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,123
What is she hiding?

591
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,255
You don't know that...

592
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,129
Either we have all the
clues and we're idiots

593
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,963
or we don't have all the clues.

594
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,436
Possible exposure.
People, places.

595
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,800
Both.

596
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,611
Bad lie.

597
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,847
Did you really think
the beaches in Hawaii

598
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,146
were just like the
beaches in Rio?

599
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,187
The disease-bearing sand
flies are completely different.

600
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,688
She's never been to Rio.

601
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,053
Who'd you go with?

602
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,590
Why are you doing this?

603
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,693
I don't actually need
to know who it was,

604
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,492
I just need to
know that you went,

605
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:43,001
so we can know that you
have visceral leishmaniasis.

606
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:47,335
But since Lancelot there
was ready to die for you,

607
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,772
he might want
the answer to both.

608
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,718
Last year.

609
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,213
It was nobody you knew.

610
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,560
Rio was supposed to be ours.

611
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,721
I got tired of waiting.

612
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,225
I'm so sorry.

613
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,438
Start her on antimony.

614
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,080
Have Cuddy find her a liver.

615
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,619
They were all ready to die.

616
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,059
But for guilt, not love.

617
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,618
You can't feel that
much guilt without love.

618
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,233
New York Mercy's medevacing
a liver. It should be here...

619
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,435
Tell them to turn around.
Charlotte's treatment isn't taking.

620
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,369
We diagnosed it too late.

621
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,184
Everyone's heading
over to Kutner's funeral.

622
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,619
You're welcome to ride with me.

623
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,084
I'm going to stay
with Charlotte.

624
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,429
She bought you some
time to save Eddie,

625
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,328
it'll give her death
some meaning.

626
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,230
No, it won't.

627
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,909
I was wrong about
you. No, you weren't.

628
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,537
You're in pain.

629
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,313
And you're romanticizing. Again.

630
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,182
You worked with him
every day for two years,

631
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,515
and you never saw this coming.

632
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,078
No one saw it coming.

633
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,386
But you see everything coming.

634
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,221
This has never been
about what you missed,

635
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,091
this is about why you missed it.

636
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:55,566
You're terrified that you're
losing your gift, losing who you are.

637
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,431
And I'm terrified of
what you'd do then.

638
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,908
Unless you feel there's
more to do here to cure me,

639
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,500
don't you have
the funeral to go to?

640
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,842
<i>I'm taking a ride</i>

641
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,818
<i>Off to one side</i>

642
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:51,321
<i>It is a personal thing</i>

643
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:55,493
<i>Where? When I can't stand</i>

644
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,592
<i>Up in this cage
I'm not regretting</i>

645
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:08,400
<i>I don't need a better thing</i>

646
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,802
<i>I'll settle for less</i>

647
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,717
<i>It's another thing for me</i>

648
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,386
<i>I just have to wander</i>

649
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:29,823
<i>Through this world alone</i>

650
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:56,084
<i>Stop before you fall</i>

651
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:02,093
<i>Into the hole that
I have dug here</i>

652
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,492
<i>Rest even as you</i>

653
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:13,964
<i>Are starting to feel
the way I used to</i>

654
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,572
<i>I don't need a better thing</i>

655
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,310
<i>Just to sound confused</i>

656
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,953
<i>Don't talk about everyone</i>

657
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:39,688
<i>I am not amused by you</i>

658
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,926
<i>'Cause I'm gonna lose you</i>

659
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,606
<i>Yes, I'm gonna lose you</i>

660
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:57,311
<i>If I'm gonna lose you</i>

661
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,923
<i>'Cause I'm gonna lose you</i>

662
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,696
<i>Yes, I'm gonna lose you</i>

663
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:20,697
<i>If I'm gonna lose you</i>

664
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:28,470
<i>I'll lose you now for good</i>
