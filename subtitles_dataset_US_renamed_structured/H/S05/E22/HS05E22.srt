1
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:38,501
145 pounds. Johnson, Miller.

2
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,630
House.

3
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,103
House.

4
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,004
I know you're not asleep.

5
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,843
That insight would be
a lot more impressive

6
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,612
if you weren't just a product
of my exhausted brain.

7
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,218
Aren't you curious
about why I'm here?

8
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,594
Curious why no French
maid's outfit, no spanky pants...

9
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,099
I'm a hallucination,
not a fantasy.

10
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,505
It's insomnia. Four nights
without REM sleep can cause...

11
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,666
That might explain
why you're hallucinating,

12
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,473
doesn't explain why you're
hallucinating Wilson's dead girlfriend.

13
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,742
Probably because of my secret
and very unconscious desire

14
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,015
to get Wilson into my bedroom.

15
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,115
Or maybe guilt
over Kutner's suicide

16
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,611
reminds you of how
guilty you felt about me.

17
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,318
Who cares why you're here? A
decent night's sleep and you won't be.

18
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,000
Guess I'll be around
a few more hours.

19
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,016
Need some coffee?

20
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,884
Addictive substances are no
substitute for nature's healing balm.

21
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,183
Let's make this
fast. I need to sleep.

22
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,852
Deaf 14-year-old started
hearing imaginary explosions.

23
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:54,158
Exploding head syndrome. Cool.
Obviously his brain knows how to hear.

24
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,829
Patient went deaf at age
four, complication of meningitis.

25
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,168
So, why no cochlear implant?

26
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,404
Usual suspects are insomnia,
which he doesn't have,

27
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,789
migraines, which he doesn't get,

28
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,313
and head trauma, which
didn't show up on the CT.

29
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,177
Damn imaginary pen.

30
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,579
Mom's signature's on
everything. Did Dad die?

31
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,713
No, I doubt it. He was a sperm donor.
Medical records couldn't be cleaner.

32
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,552
So, we're left with
temporal lobe seizure.

33
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,648
Wrong.

34
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,160
Someone at the wrestling meet
would have noticed a seizure.

35
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,493
Could have just looked
like a bad shot to the leg.

36
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,261
Put him in the seizure lab, see if
his head blows up all over again.

37
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,428
You're gonna ignore
your own subconscious?

38
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,165
Gonna be the limp
leading the blind.

39
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,775
I need a scrip
for sleeping pills.

40
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,339
My neighbor's dog has
been keeping me awake,

41
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,357
and it seems strangely
invulnerable to poison.

42
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,190
Why is the soon-to-be-
second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?

43
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,093
I'll take that as a
"Congratulations."

44
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,029
We're discussing a case.

45
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,561
Why did he close that file?

46
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,403
Wedding in two weeks?
I'd say you were pregnant,

47
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,964
but I don't think Chase's body is
mature enough to produce sperm.

48
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,804
It's a small ceremony, why wait?

49
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,871
Nighty-night.

50
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,916
Drugs with no lecture?
He wants you out.

51
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,378
Interesting case?

52
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,388
Possible prostate
cancer came into the ER.

53
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,923
Pencil cup.

54
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,660
No wonder his prostate is enlarged.
It's full of pool cues and cigars.

55
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,914
Chase's best man doesn't get
here till the day of the wedding,

56
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,737
so I asked Wilson to
throw his bachelor party.

57
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,174
No retired ministers
available to plan it?

58
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,768
Chase doesn't want
some big, raucous party.

59
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,144
So she says.

60
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:51,241
Luckily, there are people in this
world ready to stand up for what's right.

61
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,980
No, no, no. I
don't want you to...

62
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:58,718
Listen, of the two things I do well,
bachelor parties rank towards the top.

63
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,260
I get to help, right?

64
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,131
Starting five hertz.

65
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,837
House made it through
that entire differential

66
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,433
without mocking our patient
for not having a cochlear implant.

67
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,281
The patient doesn't want an implant
because he's comfortable with who he is.

68
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,782
It's admirable.

69
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,149
He's deaf, that's not an
identity, it's a disability.

70
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,346
It's also a culture.

71
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,652
The deaf have their own
schools, their own language.

72
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,192
Still no spiking.

73
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,488
Going to 20.

74
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,999
Anything I can simulate with a
$3 pair of ear plugs is not a culture.

75
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,967
No sign of seizure. Temporal
lobe activity is still clean.

76
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,530
Doctors. Doctors, he
can't see. One of his eyes.

77
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,772
"The limp leading the blind."

78
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,671
Is that supposed
to mean something?

79
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,544
I didn't think so.

80
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,518
So, exploding head
syndrome plus vision loss.

81
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,885
Subclavian steal
syndrome. Vascular defect

82
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,152
coupled with constant arm movement
could siphon blood flow from the brain.

83
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,402
We should do an
angio, check his...

84
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,224
Knock yourselves out.

85
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,367
How did I know he
was gonna go blind?

86
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,567
Don't get cute, Gazoo. You're in
my mind, you're obviously there.

87
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,510
C-reactive protein.

88
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,708
I noticed in his file it
was slightly elevated.

89
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,379
I figured the stress of the seizure lab
would drive the inflammation even higher

90
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,786
and lead to optic neuritis.

91
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,415
That's a lot clearer than
"the limp leading the blind."

92
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,256
It was just a glimmer. I
couldn't put it into words.

93
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,091
It was a long shot.

94
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,431
I don't even remember
the C-reactive protein level.

95
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,469
Obviously you do,
you just don't know it.

96
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,765
How high is K2?

97
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,306
I don't know. Me neither.

98
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,774
But I read a book
about it years ago.

99
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,277
A fierce, sexy Sherpa on
the cover, bending over to...

100
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,905
28,251 feet.

101
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,743
Cool.

102
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,978
An all-access pass
to my own brain.

103
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,951
Go play the kid some music.

104
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,049
Why?

105
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,959
Another long shot.

106
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:20,397
We're using iodine dye to track
the blood flow in your neck and arm.

107
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,119
House, what are you doing?

108
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,652
What's it look like I'm
doing? Fighting the power.

109
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,672
Feel that? How cool is that?

110
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,675
Apparently your mom doesn't
care what you're missing.

111
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,307
You're an ass.

112
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:16,346
He says he feels the vibrations
in his abdomen, but not his hand.

113
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,651
What does that mean?

114
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,656
It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.

115
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,875
Thought you were
gonna get some sleep.

116
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,313
The case got interesting.

117
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,090
It's like the zoo.

118
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,595
Except you can bang on the
glass as much as you want.

119
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,263
How'd you know
about the neuropathy?

120
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,457
Good question.

121
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,830
Enough with the riddles.

122
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,264
Tell me about it.

123
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,029
Think wrestling record.

124
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,372
Juggling.

125
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,543
No, pins, three pins.

126
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,623
Patient was pinned
in his last three

127
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,013
matches. Leading up
to that he was 15-and-0.

128
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,383
I figured his balance was
off from diminished sensation.

129
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,718
Could be increased
ICP from a brain tumor.

130
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,621
That we missed on the head CT?

131
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,057
Cutting weight for wrestling
could've led to rhabdomyolysis.

132
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,189
Patient went up a weight
class three months ago.

133
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,926
Foreman's right.

134
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,869
Actually, increased
ICP could make sense.

135
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,938
You just said...

136
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,565
I was processing.

137
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,408
It also puts a new
symptom on the table.

138
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,407
His deafness.

139
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:56,252
What if it was caused by NF2 cancer,
instead of his childhood meningitis?

140
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,086
So, meningitis
was a coincidence.

141
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,492
Or a by-product of the cancer
suppressing his immune system.

142
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,653
MRI his head.

143
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,789
If you're right about NF2, his
deafness may be reversible.

144
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,419
I'll set it up and
talk to the patient.

145
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,494
You two doing anything?

146
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,647
Do you know what a
"Broken Cowboy" is?

147
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,985
It was on House's
list of requirements.

148
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,152
I have three theories.

149
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,921
Why is House so into
this bachelor party?

150
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,123
He needs to have a reason
to be into a bachelor party?

151
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,292
He needs a reason
to be into anything.

152
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,959
Give me your wallet.

153
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,871
House could be trying to tempt
Chase into cheating, break them up.

154
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,339
You think House is into Cameron?

155
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,842
I think House is into
Cameron being into him.

156
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,881
Marrying Chase would
shatter that fantasy.

157
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,114
If Chase cheats, they shouldn't
be getting married in the first place.

158
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,985
So, you're okay with House getting Chase
smashed enough to make a stupid mistake?

159
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,547
Being drunk doesn't change
who you are, it just reveals it.

160
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,222
You think she can do
the Broken Cowboy?

161
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,732
God, I hope so.

162
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,736
NF2 is an extremely slow-growing
cancer, which makes it very treatable.

163
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,582
If we're right, taking
out the tumor means

164
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,505
there's a chance you'll
regain your hearing.

165
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,585
No, they said you have to.

166
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,913
What's wrong?

167
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,151
He wants you to treat the
cancer, but leave him deaf.

168
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,426
Sorry. It doesn't
work like that.

169
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,889
But why?

170
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:47,966
I don't know.

171
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,191
Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP,
but no masses on or around the nerves.

172
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,890
It's not cancer.

173
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,594
Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth
ventricle, could still indicate a tumor.

174
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,101
We brought pictures.

175
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,364
The fact that you sent
me on a scouting mission...

176
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,872
No skirts.

177
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,407
You're not on the guest list.

178
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,474
Bachelor parties are an ancient
and sacred male rite of passage.

179
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,276
The ventricle bowing is most likely
a pre-existing anatomical anomaly,

180
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,374
not the indication of a tumor.

181
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,291
No way to know for sure
without a brain biopsy.

182
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,813
If I get drunk enough, there's a chance I
might make out with one of the strippers.

183
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,448
Or become one.

184
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,949
Sold. Sold.

185
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,929
We can't just drill into our
patient's brain on a hunch.

186
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,431
God, not her. God, not her.

187
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,978
She's the one that got
me hooked in with Madoff.

188
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,595
Taub's right. It's not cancer.

189
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,710
Yeah, by all means,

190
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,264
abandon a great diagnostic
theory because it's difficult to prove.

191
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,744
Do a biopsy. We need to take a
better look at his fourth ventricle.

192
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,007
Or an older look.

193
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,083
The mom is never gonna let us
touch his brain without some evidence.

194
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,176
Patient broke his nose years
ago. Hospital could've done an MRI.

195
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,850
Okay.

196
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,861
The main reason my third wife and I
eloped was to avoid House's bachelor party.

197
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,866
Have you seen <i>Caligula?</i>

198
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:41,839
My patient's brain now versus
three years ago. See any difference?

199
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,716
Is he telling you
to avoid the party?

200
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,647
I took an oath to do no harm.

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,348
Sure, don't come,

202
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,750
if you want your wedding
vows to be meaningless.

203
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,819
This should be interesting.

204
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:00,064
You are going to commit to
that one special woman forever,

205
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,361
which is beautiful.

206
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,402
But if your commitment
the day after the wedding

207
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,147
is the same as your
commitment the day before,

208
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,799
then the wedding meant nothing.

209
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:11,811
So, and I see no logical way around
this, if you want your marriage to matter,

210
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:16,043
you have to be a wanton, trolling,
muck-covered pig the day before.

211
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,884
You're evil. See you.

212
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,554
The wall of the fourth ventricle
changed, it isn't bowed in the older scan.

213
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,648
Evidence of NF2, right?

214
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,261
You'd need to do a
brain biopsy to confirm.

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,661
I'm not going to the bachelor party.
Every time I go to one of your parties,

216
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:43,267
I end up embarrassing myself in
some new and unexpected way.

217
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,770
That whole thing with the
duck was hardly unexpected.

218
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,745
I'm not going.

219
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,848
Okay.

220
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,940
It's not okay.

221
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,731
Do you know who we need?

222
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,092
That stripper you got for
Wilson's bachelor party.

223
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,494
You could do body
shots right off her.

224
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:08,023
Why go back to that well? In the
nine years since Wilson's party,

225
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,901
a whole new generation of hot girls
have been abused by their stepfathers.

226
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,734
She loved cats.

227
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,241
Why would you remember
that a stripper loved cats?

228
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,547
Chase has a cat, they'll bond.

229
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,116
<i>House, you entertaining
yourself up there?</i>

230
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,458
<i>Just rehearsing for the revival
of</i> Evita. <i>What did you find?</i>

231
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,459
<i>Biopsy shows nerve
inflammation consistent</i>

232
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,859
<i>with increased
intracranial pressure.</i>

233
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,228
<i>Something's wrong,
but it's not cancer.</i>

234
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,768
He's gonna go through life deaf.

235
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,135
He's okay with that.

236
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,640
He has no idea
what he's missing.

237
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:53,577
His mom's a moron. He's gonna pay
for her stupidity for the rest of his life?

238
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,215
Are we okay with that?

239
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:06,157
<i>Why are you closing? You're
supposed to put in a cochlear implant.</i>

240
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,557
<i>That wasn't in the paperwork.</i>

241
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,564
<i>Really? Well, someone must
have screwed up. I'll go track it down.</i>

242
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,930
<i>I'll wait. That's a great idea.</i>

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,131
<i>Let the kid spend more time under
anesthesia with his skull cracked open.</i>

244
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,569
<i>I'll wait.</i>

245
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,270
<i>I've been known to lie
to serve my own agenda.</i>

246
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,177
<i>An implant does absolutely
nothing to help me diagnose him.</i>

247
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,850
Let's get an
implant tray in here.

248
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,942
Just try to relax.

249
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,121
Her son didn't want the implant.

250
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,458
If he still doesn't want it, after
having time to adjust, I'll take it out.

251
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,124
I'll blind him, too, if he wants
to experience that culture.

252
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,928
Remove it now.

253
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,799
Kid just had brain
surgery. He's not stable.

254
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:28,565
Ms. Miller, I'm not trying to
minimize Dr. House's wrongdoing,

255
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,718
but the best thing
for your son...

256
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,869
Why is she sitting?

257
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:36,211
She's not yelling, not
threatening, not pacing, just sitting.

258
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,182
Understand, Dr. House?

259
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,518
House, focus.

260
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,490
I need you to say you
accept the arrangement.

261
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,289
No problem. You're not mad.

262
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,931
I'm mad.

263
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,057
Not mad enough.

264
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,229
You wanted your son to hear.

265
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,065
You just didn't have the guts
to make him get the implant.

266
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,902
Once my son is stable, I
want that thing out of his head.

267
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,042
Why did you do this?

268
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,644
Because he is ignorant and
he's being raised by an idiot.

269
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,714
Not good enough,
you always have...

270
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,727
My patient is opting
into a handicap.

271
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,593
He's an insult to all the
other gimps out there.

272
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,428
Okay.

273
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,835
But I'm still putting Foreman
in charge of the case.

274
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,670
That's the arrangement?

275
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,936
Okay.

276
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,581
You're okay with
Foreman in charge?

277
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,952
Who you calling?

278
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,253
Oh, right, you don't
want to look like a lunatic.

279
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,225
Yeah, about that.

280
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,819
You think we did
the wrong thing?

281
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:01,061
I'm not sure. I'm not
even sure why we did it.

282
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,398
That argument you made to
Cuddy sounded pretty good.

283
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,028
To you, maybe.

284
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:16,142
Huh. I figured by now you'd be at the
board in your monocle and jodhpurs.

285
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,049
Yeah, you did something stupid.
Quick, better mock someone.

286
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,882
Why did you do it?

287
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,653
Why did I give a human
being the power of hearing?

288
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,454
You can ask God the same question,
he'll give you the same answer.

289
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,762
Patient has a fever now, too.

290
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,492
Probably just a post-op
complication. Arnold-Chiari?

291
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,793
Not without muscle weakness.

292
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,129
Pseudotumor Cerebri?

293
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,499
We checked his eyes before
the surgery. No papilledema.

294
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,660
Candy?

295
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,039
I'm pretty sure Wilson's stripper's
name was something sweet.

296
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,477
Maybe his fever is more
than a post-op reaction.

297
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,243
His girlfriend was sick a few months
ago, maybe her flu was really Epstein-Barr.

298
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,593
Lolly? THIRTEEN: They swap spit,

299
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,643
virus travels to his
brain, leads to meningitis,

300
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,330
leads to increased
intracranial pressure.

301
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,323
I agree. Taffy?

302
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,516
I agree.

303
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,491
Go ahead, start him on
ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.

304
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,996
Keep making decisions like that,

305
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,965
it really bolsters the
illusion that you're in charge.

306
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,970
Why aren't you in my office?

307
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,134
Because I know what
the word "my" means.

308
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,374
I did something insane, and
you're not all over me analyzing why.

309
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,817
It was nice.

310
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,942
I gave that idiot an
implant to prove to him

311
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,889
what an idiot he's
been. How is that nice?

312
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,892
You didn't do it to solve the
case, you didn't do it to save his life,

313
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,395
you did it to make his life
better. It was a caring act.

314
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:43,561
Which you did in a way that was
immoral and illegal, but baby steps.

315
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,128
Doesn't sound like us.

316
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,334
You can't make me
go to the bachelor party.

317
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,432
I know.

318
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,776
And you're okay with that?

319
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,541
What choice do I have?

320
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,056
Seth!

321
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,223
Please, God...

322
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,099
Seth.

323
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,237
Yes.

324
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,180
Seth.

325
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:02,881
Oh!

326
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,081
I think he just wet the bed.

327
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,662
Kid's dehydrated but stable.

328
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,068
Thankfully the fountain of whizz
seems to have stopped for the moment.

329
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,300
Not before hosing
Epstein-Barr off the table.

330
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,603
Now, eat up.

331
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:35,676
We're gonna pick out the ice
cream flavors for the bachelor party.

332
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,143
Could be a systemic
autoimmune disease.

333
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,579
This tastes like vodka.

334
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,259
Well, it would be stupid if it tasted
like bourbon. That's the brown one.

335
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,419
It is vodka?

336
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:53,432
Flash frozen in a secret process.
Guy figured it out in his basement.

337
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,036
Limoncello. Genius.

338
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:03,439
Symptoms came on too hard and
too fast. Sarcoidosis is progressive.

339
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,642
Remember, in med school,
when Donovan gave grand rounds,

340
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,683
there was that guy
who was peeing liters.

341
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,345
Glomerulonephritis. Wrestler, steroids
could have damaged the kidneys.

342
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,915
The scotch is nice.

343
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,651
His urine would've been brown.

344
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,661
Donovan ruled out osmotic
diuresis, kidney disease...

345
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,456
Pheochromocytoma?

346
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,624
No hypertension, plasma
metanephrine is normal.

347
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,792
Devic's?

348
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,631
It happened at night.
That was the clue.

349
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:35,232
Night, recumbent body
position, changes in BP...

350
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,436
It's his heart.

351
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:45,109
Run a 12-lead EKG,
watch him for four hours.

352
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,549
Foreman concurs.

353
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:55,854
What the hell just happened?
Everything started to fade away.

354
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,888
You're getting better at focusing,
ignoring everything that doesn't matter.

355
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Uh-oh!

356
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,969
He looks pissed. I
think he might hit us.

357
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,041
Is your eyesight
better than mine?

358
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,407
We need to talk about
the bachelor party.

359
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,473
Excellent topic choice.

360
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,642
I mean, surgery is so boring, and
my lying to you is just so yesterday.

361
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,118
It's my fault for letting you
talk me into the implant.

362
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,485
Cameron is not gonna
be happy about this party.

363
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,887
But, you, on the other hand...

364
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,552
Plan on spending the rest
of my life with Cameron.

365
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,221
So, I need to
cancel the fart band?

366
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,958
So, I need you to kidnap me.

367
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,093
Spoken like a true Aussie.

368
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:41,433
By the way, if you know where I can get
me the sheet music to <i>Waltzing Matilda...</i>

369
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:49,347
Hey! Want some ice cream?
We're having a sundae bar.

370
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,578
Sweet.

371
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,121
That's her name!

372
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,349
Sundae or Bar?

373
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,620
Karamel.

374
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:01,886
With a "K."

375
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,992
Bathroom?

376
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,993
Down the hall, two
doors, on your right.

377
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,466
Thanks.

378
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:51,133
Do I sound like her?

379
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,147
It takes time.

380
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,717
You still haven't slept?

381
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,529
And then I have
a clever response.

382
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,863
EKG, normal sinus, normal
intervals. His heart's fine.

383
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,799
His heart's not fine.

384
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:21,067
The heart was fine during this
test. The arrhythmia's hiding.

385
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,132
Or we were wrong
about the heart.

386
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,285
Could be the thyroid.

387
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,211
Hashimoto's would explain the
kid's urine and brain pressure.

388
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,279
Treadmill.

389
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,373
Or the arrhythmia is hiding.

390
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,984
We need to stress him.
Put the patient on a treadmill.

391
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,611
The patient just
had brain surgery.

392
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,054
A stress test could cause
a brain bleed and kill him.

393
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,582
I value your opinion. I
value rejecting your opinion.

394
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,156
You're not doing this. You
haven't been sleeping...

395
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,391
Cuddy doesn't actually
want you in charge.

396
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:50,266
She just wants to avoid a lawsuit
and to win an NAACP award.

397
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,772
And if I let you risk our patient's life
testing an organ we already tested,

398
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,434
we accomplish neither.
Run a thyroid panel.

399
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,244
How do we get him into the stress
lab without Foreman's sign off?

400
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,483
We could kill
Foreman. Is she new?

401
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,120
Focus. The lab simulates
stress. What if it's not simulated?

402
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,664
We could tell him his
girlfriend dumped him.

403
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:23,293
It's a tough sell since she never leaves
the room for more than five minutes.

404
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,132
We could kill her.

405
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:29,266
Or asthma meds. Force
the heart to beat faster.

406
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,506
Revealing the arrhythmia.

407
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,735
Nice idea.

408
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,812
It was yours.

409
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,049
I just left the room
for a few minutes.

410
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,720
He ripped out his implant.
So much for improving his life.

411
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,457
Actually, I think
we just saved it.

412
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,867
Look at that. Arrhythmia.

413
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,874
You were right about the heart.
I should have listened to you.

414
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,542
The correct phrasing would
be, "I should always listen to you."

415
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:15,054
He's got problems everywhere.
What goes everywhere?

416
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,184
Blood. Could be thrombocythemia.

417
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,200
Excess platelets lead to
clotting throughout the body.

418
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,435
Not with a normal
platelet count.

419
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,091
So the clotting doesn't
start in the blood,

420
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,771
it starts in the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism.

421
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,095
We should do a V/Q scan,
see if his lungs are clear.

422
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,471
Go.

423
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,954
Are you sure I did
this at Wilson's party?

424
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,223
Last time, you used grain
alcohol instead of the sambuca.

425
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,095
And it worked?

426
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,338
Well, it explains my lack of
eyebrows by the end of the evening.

427
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,743
By the power of Grayskull, I...

428
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,587
This is why we're rehearsing.

429
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,934
Ever wonder what's happening
every time our patient gets sicker?

430
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:37,802
Not right now.

431
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,770
First symptom, wrestling.

432
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,272
Then, under the lights
of the seizure lab...

433
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,286
Are you going somewhere
with this? Because this feels...

434
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,108
Just keep doing what
you're doing. It helps.

435
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,208
Then, under the stress of
blindness, then, post-op fever.

436
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,513
What do all the symptoms
have in common?

437
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,150
Heat.

438
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:05,287
See, if you hadn't been here, that
would've just popped into my head,

439
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,856
which actually would
have been way cooler.

440
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,528
Foreman, kid's got Uhthoff
phenomenon, which means it's MS.

441
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,237
Start him on
double-dose interferon.

442
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,776
Let's get our drink on.

443
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:21,211
Not before I've added chemical
burns to this guy's cause of death.

444
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,513
Patient's responding
to interferon.

445
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,246
Looks like I can retire
as department figurehead.

446
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,648
Dr. Robert Chase?

447
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,247
We're with the Department
of Citizenship and Immigration.

448
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,553
Did you recently apply
for a marriage license?

449
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,184
Ah... Yes.

450
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,526
According to our records,
your work permit has expired.

451
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,997
If you could come with us?

452
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,843
I'm his fiancée. I can
come along and clear this...

453
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,268
I'm sorry, ma'am. Illegals only.

454
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:50,270
I'm sure it's a mistake. I'll call you
as soon as I know what's going on.

455
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,746
Don't let House get
him in too much trouble.

456
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:24,639
Allow me to welcome you
to the best night of your life.

457
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:43,223
Now, a few ground rules for
the evening. Safety is job one.

458
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:47,597
We have now gone 18 days
without an injury in the workplace.

459
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:52,969
Yes, these girls are all working their
way through law school, don't test them.

460
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,300
House!

461
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,271
I knew you couldn't stay away.

462
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,746
This is my apartment!
You can't do this.

463
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,786
Clearly reality begs to differ.

464
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,314
Where's my furniture?

465
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,756
Out back somewhere.

466
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,020
James!

467
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,192
Karamel?

468
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,425
Hey.

469
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,331
How's your wife?

470
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,034
We got divorced.

471
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,974
How's your cat? Dead.

472
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,211
How about we go have a drink?

473
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,817
This way. Okay.

474
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,886
You're okay with this?

475
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,588
I paid 50 bucks for this.

476
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,995
You guys are great
together. Trust is everything.

477
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,933
I'm gonna get some
air. Keep it real.

478
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,183
You should be out there, enjoying
the lap dances of your labors.

479
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,254
I kind of like it in here.

480
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,358
Me, too.

481
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,263
To us, figuring out MS.

482
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:09,440
And the blindness and neuropathy,
and arrhythmia, and anything else we did.

483
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,445
What exactly did my team do?

484
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:21,147
Looked good in their lab
coats, except for Taub.

485
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:26,720
Some people just work
better alone, so to speak.

486
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
One more drink.

487
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,393
No. I can't. I
gotta take a break.

488
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,755
Meet Karamel.

489
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,936
Maybe one more drink.

490
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:55,580
What's that taste?
Is that strawberry?

491
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,324
House, you in there?

492
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,695
Use the other bathroom. It's
in the kitchen, looks like a sink.

493
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:11,998
Chase went into anaphylactic shock from
the stripper's body butter or something.

494
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,499
Is he okay?

495
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,007
One of the residents had
an EpiPen, so he's fine.

496
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,135
But we're taking him to
the hospital to be safe.

497
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,174
Okay.

498
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,046
I knew that Chase was
allergic to strawberries, didn't I?

499
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,454
That's why you wanted
Karamel at this party.

500
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:41,022
I suggested Karamel 'cause
she was great at Wilson's party.

501
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:45,001
I knew about her body butter, I
knew about his strawberry allergy.

502
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,898
I tried to kill Chase?

503
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,035
Why would I do that?
I don't want Cameron.

504
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,078
You're not a big fan of other
people's happiness either.

505
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,052
Hello.

506
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,521
You confirm? Thanks.

507
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,695
That kid we saved, he's dying.

508
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,436
It's not MS.

509
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,596
We were wrong.

510
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,310
Thank God you're
okay. What happened?

511
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,481
There was a girl...

512
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,880
Long story.

513
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,944
Your patient's lung failure rules
out MS. We put him on a ventilator.

514
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,422
Enlarged lymphs could...

515
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,584
Are any of you sober?

516
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,559
Turn around, you need
to go to the hospital.

517
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,927
I need to sleep.

518
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,840
I'm you. You can't
just shut a door.

519
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,604
You tried to kill Chase.

520
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,476
I need to push you back
down, you're dangerous.

521
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,775
It's the hospital.

522
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,013
I'm not answering.

523
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,525
Hello.

524
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,390
I'm here with your team,

525
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:21,296
trying to sober them up so they
can help treat your dying patient.

526
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,698
Foreman's dying patient.

527
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:27,763
What causes lung failure plus
your patient's previous symptoms?

528
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,273
Eosinophilic pneumonitis.

529
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,504
White blood cells accumulate, clog up
the lungs, lead to heart problems. It fits.

530
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,311
House, are you there?

531
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,951
It's not eosinophilic
pneumonitis.

532
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,185
<i>I gotta crash.</i>

533
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,084
House, don't hang
up. We need your help.

534
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,178
<i>I can't.</i>

535
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,119
We can solve this.

536
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:49,693
Good night.

537
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,726
Eosinophilic pneumonitis
could actually make sense.

538
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:58,361
No, House ruled it out because it
would affect the larynx. Patient would be

539
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,695
hoarse.

540
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,003
Which we wouldn't notice in
a deaf kid who rarely speaks.

541
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,976
Wait. Everyone's
getting breath mints.

542
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,045
We need to hear Seth speak.

543
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,683
That means taking out the
tube. Isn't that dangerous?

544
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,800
It's the safest way to
confirm what's wrong with him.

545
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,020
I need him to breathe
out once I pull on the tube.

546
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,355
Okay.

547
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,873
Say "ah."

548
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,656
I'm sorry, we were wrong.

549
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,852
I need to suction out your
throat before we re-intubate.

550
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,294
Your son smoke?

551
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,830
I don't think so.

552
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,271
Tobacco stains on his teeth.

553
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,940
He says he used to chew
tobacco to cut weight for wrestling.

554
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,210
Used to?

555
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,515
Chewing tobacco wouldn't
explain his symptoms.

556
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,353
But not chewing tobacco might.

557
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,848
Taub was right.
It's sarcoidosis.

558
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:32,563
The tobacco releases toxins, those
toxins suppressed his immune system.

559
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,565
Once he quit chewing,

560
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:38,091
the absence of those toxins kicked
a dormant condition into hyper-drive.

561
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,235
Is it treatable?

562
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,067
Usually responds to
corticosteroids and methotrexate.

563
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,544
I'll start the meds.

564
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,821
I need sleeping pills.

565
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:01,158
I was gonna hit up Wilson, but
he's not answering his phone.

566
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,228
He must have
left it in his pants,

567
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,425
which he wasn't wearing when the police
found him trying to walk home, oddly,

568
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,592
from his own apartment.

569
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,100
Pills.

570
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,773
Your patient is doing
fine, thanks to your team.

571
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,981
It wasn't eosinophilic
pneumonitis, was it?

572
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,712
Sarcoidosis.

573
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:28,809
Good.

574
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,185
House, please, talk to me.

575
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,995
I haven't slept through the
night since Kutner killed himself.

576
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,620
The wrestling
might have to wait.

577
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,027
I'm gonna tell your doctors
to repair your implant.

578
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:19,166
I know. And then you ripped it out rather
than live with it for a few days even.

579
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,239
I'm your mother.
This is my call.

580
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:29,409
I don't know if I'm making the
right one, but it's mine to make.

581
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,184
Sleep well?
