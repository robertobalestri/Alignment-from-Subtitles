1
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,119
It's way too fast.

2
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,217
It felt good.

3
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,286
If we can clear the
stage, quickly please.

4
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,729
Maury, it's too fast.

5
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,821
It's exactly the same.

6
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,992
Then slow it down.

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,295
Everything all right, Jeremy?

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,769
Sure. Ready whenever you are.

9
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,066
From the allegro please.

10
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,173
What's his problem?

11
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,737
His back's not 100%.

12
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,544
He can't talk to the
conductor like that.

13
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,914
No, he can't.

14
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,343
She could.

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,554
You okay with the lift?

16
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,823
I'll be fine unless you
mess up the timing.

17
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,462
My timing is perfect.

18
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,870
Was last night.

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,705
Moment of truth.

20
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,534
Damn it.

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,536
Penelope, are you all right?

22
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,379
She can't breathe.
Call the doctor!

23
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,764
Are you gonna ignore
me all day again?

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,132
I help you.

25
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,898
You tried to kill Chase.

26
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,440
Doing what you
wanted, that's all, boss.

27
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:57,977
I exist.

28
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,069
No, you don't.

29
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,015
I acknowledge my subconscious
exists. Now go away.

30
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,784
Saying it is one thing.
Living it is another.

31
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:14,121
You're not rational.
Not completely.

32
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,161
Put the phone on the receiver,

33
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,644
send the hookers
home and get dressed.

34
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,466
We've got a case. I'm
taking a personal day.

35
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,302
21-year-old star of the New
York Ballet collapsed on stage.

36
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,865
I love ballet. But as
someone may have mentioned,

37
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,774
I'm taking a personal day.

38
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,245
Cuddy said get your
ass in or you're fired.

39
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,804
She's not going to fire me.

40
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,373
She's not going to fire
you? If you don't go to work?

41
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,112
Okay. How long, do you figure,

42
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,382
till I just disappear?

43
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,990
Hold on.

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,722
No tumors or
punctures in the lungs,

45
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,129
no bruising, no sign
of trauma, no STDs.

46
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,397
And supplemental oxygen's only
gotten her saturation level to 60.

47
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,528
Lungs keep collapsing
despite a chest tube.

48
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,832
ER ruled out the obvious,

49
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,783
white count and temp are
normal, so no pneumonia.

50
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,352
The coffee's burnt, Thirteen's
wearing cherry-flavored lip gloss.

51
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,971
Foreman's staring at
you. Any of that helpful?

52
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,241
House.

53
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,341
STD? We just said
the tests were negative.

54
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,477
You think we should... No.

55
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,750
She's a dancer. What
about dehydration?

56
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,087
What about a
pulmonary contusion?

57
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,353
CT showed no
inflammation on the lungs.

58
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,419
What about dehydration?

59
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,361
BUN and creatinine are
elevated but within range.

60
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,132
Hey. I'm just the
irrational part of your brain,

61
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,537
but elevated means high, right?

62
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,234
Dehydration could
hide an infection.

63
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,276
Dehydration could
hide an infection.

64
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,507
Go treat her for the obvious.

65
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,915
IV fluids and antibiotics
for pneumonia.

66
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,247
We're like Magic and Kareem.

67
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,321
Mr. Pietramala, you
have kidney cancer.

68
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,423
Wow. Is that a bad one? I
mean, they're all bad, but...

69
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,764
The door was
closed for a reason.

70
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,862
Well, now it's open for a
reason. We need to talk.

71
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,204
He just told me I
have kidney cancer.

72
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,574
Then you'll obviously
need a moment to process.

73
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,942
House.

74
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,711
I'm hallucinating.

75
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,554
I'm... I'll be right back.

76
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,593
I need you to sit in on my differentials,
double-check everything I do.

77
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,961
You can't treat patients...

78
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,499
It's gotta be sleep apnea.

79
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,710
I get a good night's sleep,
and I still feel exhausted.

80
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,465
Lack of delta sleep can
lead to hallucinations.

81
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,733
Do you have any other
neurological symptoms?

82
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,899
Don't think so.

83
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,067
Aphasia? No.

84
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,269
Memory loss? No.

85
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,936
Irritability? Yeah, that one.

86
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,322
Don't deflect. He
cares about you.

87
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,424
You shouldn't be practicing.
You care about him. Tell him...

88
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,110
At least until... Enough.

89
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,153
Don't give me the look. I
told you I was hallucinating.

90
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,253
Who were you talking to?

91
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,295
Someone who's not actually
here, beyond that seems irrelevant.

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,921
Your mind made a
choice. It means something.

93
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,364
You know he's just
gonna keep asking.

94
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,457
Kutner.

95
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,738
Good choice. He feels bad.

96
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,933
You gonna help me or not?

97
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,438
Yeah.

98
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,816
I could eat from this
place seven days a week.

99
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,614
We practically do.

100
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,153
You can order tomorrow night.

101
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,048
Do you want some
wine? No, thanks.

102
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,656
I have my husband's sperm.

103
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,791
Your dead husband's?

104
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,858
We froze it when
he got diagnosed.

105
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,838
And you kept it? All this time?

106
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,173
I used to think, if I
didn't find anyone...

107
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,336
You found someone.

108
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,435
I know.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
But...

110
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,275
What if it goes wrong?

111
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,581
What if I turn out to
be a radical anarchist

112
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,884
with a secret family,
and that I age backwards?

113
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,828
Nobody plans on
getting divorced.

114
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:12,093
I didn't plan on my
husband dying. But he did.

115
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,669
So, you're saying
you want a pre-nup?

116
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,336
In liquid form?

117
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,708
What if it's not sleep apnea?

118
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,013
Trauma from your
motorcycle accident?

119
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,815
Vicodin abuse? You
need to be admitted.

120
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,719
I know you're wrong
about sleep apnea,

121
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,020
which means you know
you're wrong about sleep apnea.

122
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,083
You're scared. Tell
him you're scared.

123
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,094
I can't sleep with you here.

124
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,439
Did it work?

125
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,213
Do you see someone
standing beside me?

126
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,982
No.

127
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,078
Then no.

128
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,284
So what's next on your
list of things it's not?

129
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,453
Patient's not responding to
the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.

130
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,258
So run a test to
confirm it's pneumonia.

131
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,799
We can't do a bronc because
her lungs are still collapsed.

132
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,959
Transtracheal aspiration.

133
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,798
That's basically waterboarding.

134
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,031
It is pretty radical.

135
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,438
It's a great idea.

136
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,945
Regular radical, me radical
or me-out-of-my-mind radical?

137
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,948
Somewhere between
regular and you.

138
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,382
So what's the problem?

139
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,474
Everything okay?

140
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,354
No. Our patient can't breathe.

141
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,016
Either do the test or
come up with a better one.

142
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,461
So we're down to
infection, trauma,

143
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,504
MS, schizophrenia, or pills.

144
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,671
Schizophrenia usually
manifests younger.

145
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,504
That's why it's
further down the list.

146
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,602
I can confirm an infection
with a simple blood test.

147
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,273
An infection can
be treated, cured.

148
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,876
Means you've still got a job,
means you've still got a life.

149
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,955
Doesn't make it a better
idea, just a nicer one.

150
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,354
This the rational you talking?

151
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,551
Can't do this on my own.

152
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,634
When we inject the water it's
gonna feel like you're drowning.

153
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,136
But it'll be over
in a few seconds.

154
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,297
And then it'll be better?

155
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,396
A little.

156
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,498
Hold her shoulders
down a little.

157
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,713
Ready?

158
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,084
You're doing great.
Here comes the liquid.

159
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,398
Taub. I slipped.

160
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,061
Oh, no. What?

161
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,536
Her skin came off.

162
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,953
Her skin's sloughing
off faster than

163
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,079
we can replace it
with the artificial skin.

164
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,265
Could be autoimmune.

165
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,417
ANA was negative.

166
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,051
Focus on the lungs.

167
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,653
You want us to ignore the fact
that she's lost 80% of her skin?

168
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,859
We know it's not lung
cancer. Could be a liver tumor.

169
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,233
Eats through to the lungs.
Get an ultrasound of her liver.

170
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,135
If you find masses,
get a biopsy.

171
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,798
We can't just ignore the skin.

172
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,274
It's obviously the
most significant

173
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,970
and dangerous symptom right now.

174
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,878
I don't think it is a symptom.
I think we caused it.

175
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,245
By doing what?

176
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,477
I prescribed antibiotics.

177
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:55,784
Toxic epidermal necrolysis?
That's a one-in-a-million reaction.

178
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,950
Yeah, well, maybe
this is the one.

179
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,789
Get swabs of her
old skin to confirm.

180
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,237
Where the hell were you?

181
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,646
I do have a practice.

182
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:26,277
Ballerina has toxic
epidermal necrolysis.

183
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,877
Are you sure?

184
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,183
About to be.

185
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,348
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,914
I feel guilty.

187
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,068
You didn't do anything wrong.

188
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,788
You prescribed antibiotics.

189
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,872
Any other doctor would have
done the exact same thing.

190
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,025
"Any other doctor"?
Words can hurt, you know.

191
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,379
I have no reason to feel guilty.

192
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,634
It doesn't make any sense.

193
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,782
Unless there's something wrong

194
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,900
in the limbic area of my brain.

195
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,238
Guilt as a symptom?

196
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,404
It's consistent with MS.

197
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,917
And since the blood tests were
negative, I have to apologize.

198
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,863
If I feel better, then you're
right. I'm just feeling an emotion.

199
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,325
If I feel nothing, means
my limbic brain is shot.

200
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,070
I'm Dr. House.

201
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,310
Anyone explain
to you your status?

202
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,949
They found a mass
in my liver, cancer.

203
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,952
They said they
think they can treat it.

204
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,045
And that the skin
is starting to take.

205
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,022
I'll be able to dance again.

206
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,686
She's half-dead and she's
wondering if she'll ever plié again.

207
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,730
Healthy priorities.
Let the mocking begin.

208
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,090
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:55,607
I treated you for infection before
confirming that you had one.

210
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,440
That's why you lost your skin.

211
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:03,482
I know you're in pain. I know
that I caused it. I'm sorry.

212
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,719
Very nice.

213
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,956
Thank you.

214
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,265
Nothing.

215
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,905
Maybe you didn't mean it.

216
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,740
I meant it.

217
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,956
Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm...
- Couldn't.

218
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,212
The artificial skin was
too thin, she'd bleed out.

219
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,411
Why were you
talking to the patient?

220
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,579
I think skinless women are hot.

221
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,714
Do a transjugular liver biopsy.

222
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,157
If she bleeds, at least
it stays in her veins.

223
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,521
Did you just check
with Wilson again?

224
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,621
No.

225
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,139
I felt nothing. It's MS.

226
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,817
Apologies aren't supposed
to make you feel better,

227
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,585
they're supposed to make
the other person feel better.

228
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,941
In order to make
you feel better.

229
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,946
Fine. You want to
do an LP to confirm

230
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,948
or is guilt enough to
start filling prescriptions?

231
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,983
Last mass, about a
centimeter to your right.

232
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,083
Problem?

233
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,322
Short burst of flutter.
We're almost done.

234
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,331
Entering the right hepatic vein.

235
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,698
Cameron kept her
dead husband's sperm.

236
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,170
She doesn't like yours?

237
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,232
She likes his better.

238
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,569
Or at least she
wants to hang on to it

239
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,138
in case mine is
unfaithful or something.

240
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,680
Wow.

241
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,123
Advancing two centimeters.

242
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,988
You gotta let her do it.

243
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,824
If you don't, you'll be
stuck with her forever.

244
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,091
I want to be stuck
with her forever.

245
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,965
She married a dying
guy. She has issues.

246
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:07,530
You cannot leave her.
Ever. For any reason.

247
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,318
Because then you're not
just the guy who left her,

248
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,868
you're the guy
who killed her kids.

249
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,042
That's not a good
rhythm. Get out.

250
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,584
Narrow complex tachycardia.
She's gonna crash.

251
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,557
Liver biopsy was
negative for cancer.

252
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,491
But the procedure
sent her heart into A-Fib.

253
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,605
We don't know it was the biopsy
that caused the heart problem.

254
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,757
Maybe the heart caused
the lungs to collapse.

255
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,560
Why is Wilson here?

256
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,778
You were looking for cancer.
I thought it'd be helpful if...

257
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,293
We didn't find cancer. Yes,

258
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,372
which you reported to
me five seconds ago.

259
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,949
I thought I'd let him
finish his hors d'oeuvre

260
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,965
before getting the
bouncer to take care of him.

261
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,475
Until we can regulate the heart,

262
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,921
we can't get any
meaningful pictures,

263
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,038
so we can't tell...

264
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,809
Metoprolol can
correct irregular heart.

265
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,713
Tried it. Didn't work.

266
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,308
Is Cuddy making him oversee...

267
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,648
No.

268
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,553
Heart's too irregular for
MRI, other scans wouldn't...

269
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,456
Then you're making
him oversee your choices.

270
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,654
You don't trust yourself. Why?

271
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,097
Wilson, get out.

272
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,191
Are you sure?

273
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,499
Do I need your approval
to throw you out?

274
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,475
You happy now?

275
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,892
There's only one time her heart's going
to be perfectly still for our pictures

276
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,350
and that's when she's dead.

277
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,750
If it's not MS,
severe mental illness

278
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,620
and Vicodin are all that's left.

279
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,422
Mental illness means you
can no longer practice medicine.

280
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:42,094
Vicodin means detox, which
means pain. For the rest of your life.

281
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,831
Which means you can no
longer practice medicine.

282
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,476
Are you saying
we should kill her?

283
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,573
No.

284
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,685
If we stopped her heart, we could
get our pictures and then restart it.

285
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,953
What if we can't restart it?

286
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,619
Then she stays dead.

287
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,095
We restart hearts all the time.

288
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,224
It'll take four minutes for
us to MRI her entire heart.

289
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,599
And we only have three minutes
until there's brain damage.

290
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,037
You sure about this?

291
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,131
Yeah.

292
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,738
Gonna stop her
heart so I can MRI it.

293
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:33,047
I think it was her idea. The pneumonia
was her idea, almost killed the patient.

294
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,119
"Her"?

295
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,245
Oops.

296
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,521
Kutner was secretly a woman,
that's why he killed himself.

297
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,596
It's Amber.

298
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,792
Your subconscious
picked my dead girlfriend?

299
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,871
Yeah, the irrational
part of my brain

300
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,248
works like the
rational part of yours.

301
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,272
How about that?

302
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,832
It raises questions.

303
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,070
It answers questions.

304
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,237
Who cares?

305
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,577
I've got competing ideas.
They can't both be right.

306
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,446
Everybody gets competing
ideas. Everybody has doubts.

307
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,214
So is it regular radical, me radical
or me-out-of-my-mind radical?

308
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,222
It's on the upper
end of you radical.

309
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,349
Do you have any alternative?

310
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,122
Nothing that anyone in
my head has come up with.

311
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,458
Then you're as
safe as you can be.

312
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,554
Great.

313
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,798
You get the LP results back?

314
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,497
Yeah.

315
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,096
It's a big shock.
You don't have MS.

316
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,268
But while I had your blood
sample, I checked Vicodin levels.

317
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,436
Way too high.

318
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,705
I need the pills.

319
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,247
Not an argument. He
knows that's not an argument.

320
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,646
It could still be schizophrenia.

321
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,344
House, if you're
on anti-psych meds,

322
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,696
you're not going to
be able to practice...

323
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,086
I know.

324
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,022
You'd prefer electroshock
therapy to rehab?

325
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,355
I'd prefer something
that could actually work.

326
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,519
You're rationalizing.

327
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,892
No kidding.

328
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,763
I know that you're afraid of
the pain, but electroshock...

329
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,793
Don't give me the cancer
voice, that overly earnest tone.

330
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,274
Heart attack, stroke,
seizure, death or worse.

331
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,866
Worse? Double death?

332
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,377
You live but you damage
the only thing you care about:

333
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,175
your rational mind.

334
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,378
I'll make some calls.

335
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,223
I'll actually be dead?

336
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,198
Just your heart. And
just for a little while.

337
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,564
Hopefully.

338
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,111
I had an idea.

339
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,991
Stop having ideas.

340
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,287
Insulin shock.

341
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,525
Yes, that's marginally
less dangerous than ECT,

342
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,861
puts you in a coma,
could cause... It could work.

343
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,128
If you had psychosis,
which you don't.

344
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,931
I have no diarrhea, no
sweating, no vomiting,

345
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,233
none of the symptoms
of Vicodin overdose.

346
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,639
Yeah, except the "I
see dead people" thing.

347
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,644
I've been popping
pills for years.

348
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,079
I've only been seeing things
for days. Something changed.

349
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,378
Vicodin addiction
is still more likely.

350
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,578
So we're no longer
dealing in absolutes.

351
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,348
<i>House, I'll be up
in five minutes,</i>

352
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,390
then we can talk about how you'd
rather be in a coma than in rehab.

353
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:28,895
Actually, if you could be up
here in two, that'd be really helpful.

354
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,088
Why?

355
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,892
Because I'm about to put
myself into insulin shock.

356
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,560
Left atrium is fine.

357
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,432
Left coronary artery also fine.

358
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,267
We're almost at three
minutes. Keep going.

359
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,116
Chordae tendineae
clear. Right atrium is fine.

360
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,718
I gotta start her back
up. We have some time.

361
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,768
We're over. Right
coronary artery is fine.

362
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,221
The three-minute
threshold is a guideline.

363
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,043
She might have
less. We have to stop.

364
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,015
What's that by the aorta?

365
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,760
I don't see anything.
I'm restarting her heart.

366
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,616
That's a shadow!
Two centimeters...

367
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,025
You're only scared because
you know this is going to work.

368
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,467
We're over three minutes.

369
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,413
I need glucose in here!

370
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,636
You could have died.

371
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,750
It worked. Where are my pants?

372
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,663
Are you sure?

373
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,098
She's been everywhere
I've been for days.

374
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,068
She's not here. Ergo...

375
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,536
This was not the
next rational step.

376
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,665
Now who's being biased?

377
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,266
You wanted me to detox
as much as I wanted...

378
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,469
I forgot how to do my zipper.

379
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,538
Any other neurological deficits?

380
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:07,053
You don't seem to annoy me as
much as usual. Not sure that's a deficit.

381
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,089
And I'm all better.

382
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,752
Is she really gone? Absolutely.

383
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:19,595
I can feel myself repressing
all kinds of icky things.

384
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,327
I check out, don't I?

385
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,333
Damn.

386
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,991
He didn't see anything. He
saw an artifact on the monitor.

387
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,314
It was a shadow on her heart.

388
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,613
She'd already been technically
dead for three minutes.

389
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,589
I thought keeping her alive took
precedence over prolonging the photo op.

390
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:45,657
Any brain damage?

391
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,924
No, all tests indicate that...

392
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,258
Obviously you had more time.

393
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,388
Best of luck.

394
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,859
I assume we can't kill her
again, take more pictures.

395
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,013
You don't want to
check with Wilson?

396
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,061
Good one.

397
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,970
It's something, a lesion.

398
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,702
Tumor, scar tissue.

399
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,471
Could be an abscess. Infection.

400
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,171
Explains why it's
invisible in the blood.

401
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,679
It's doing its damage behind
closed doors. Sealed off.

402
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,841
See, the problem
with speculation is

403
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,819
you make a "spec" out of you
and some guy named "Lation,"

404
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,298
which really doesn't
affect me at all.

405
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,484
We have to guess.
It's all we've got.

406
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,602
We can't do a biopsy. Last
time we went into her heart

407
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,618
she had a major cardiac event.

408
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,864
Which just leaves...

409
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,938
What are you looking for?

410
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,030
I don't know yet.

411
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:41,406
Picture doesn't change. She lies
there in pain, he sits there worried.

412
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,481
Nothing changes.

413
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,526
I just had an
epiphany. All by myself.

414
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,186
Popped into my
head out of nothing.

415
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,559
Care to share?

416
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,927
He's too devoted.

417
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,400
Too devoted? You
think he feels guilty?

418
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,560
Right, I'm being cynical.

419
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,147
People can care because they
care, and not because they cheated.

420
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,107
Theoretically true, but
gonorrhea fits better.

421
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,370
No. No STDs. We tested her.

422
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,672
You tested her blood.

423
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,270
That is the test.

424
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,338
That's not where her problem is.

425
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,179
Gonorrhea
disseminated to her heart.

426
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,949
If it got walled off in an
abscess, it'd be invisible.

427
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,957
And would look like a shadow.

428
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,256
No need to test her again. But
we can check Prince Charming.

429
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,559
Once you confirm, cut the
abscess out of her heart.

430
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,871
Here are your onion
rings, extra well done.

431
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,371
Thank you, Molly.

432
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,738
And another beer when you
get a chance. I'm celebrating.

433
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,936
Alone?

434
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,205
Thank goodness.

435
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,710
Don't tell me, I was right.

436
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,052
Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.

437
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,613
And everyone's a winner.

438
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,817
He's not too happy about it.

439
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,418
He insists he's never cheated,
must have gotten it from her.

440
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,587
Don't think so.

441
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,686
Timing would fit.

442
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,561
He's got no symptoms
and she's dying.

443
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,464
Lying would fit, too.

444
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,526
<i>He's not hanging out
in her room anymore.</i>

445
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,868
What does it matter?
You were right.

446
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,272
<i>We're prepping her for surgery.</i>

447
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,543
I saw guilt in him.

448
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:29,317
If he's not actually guilty,
I wasn't right, I was lucky.

449
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,582
House, you made a brilliant
deduction about her heart.

450
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,821
And if I was just lucky...

451
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,106
<i>Enjoy yourself</i>

452
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,405
<i>It's later than you think</i>

453
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,281
<i>Enjoy yourself</i>

454
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,049
<i>While you're still in the pink.</i>

455
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,153
<i>The years go by</i>

456
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,590
<i>As quickly as a wink</i>

457
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,730
<i>Enjoy yourself</i>

458
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,672
Wilson, come get me.

459
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,173
<i>It's later than you think</i>

460
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,193
I know a nice
facility outside Philly.

461
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,888
I went to undergrad
with one of the directors.

462
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,995
Thanks.

463
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,248
How many shirts do I need?

464
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,648
They said three.
They have laundry.

465
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,552
Like living with Mom
again. Delightful.

466
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,056
It's probably Foreman.

467
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,323
He's unavailable.

468
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,126
Tell him the infection's
made her septic.

469
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,176
We can't remove the
abscess until we get her BP up,

470
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,877
and it's not responding
to fluids, it's not...

471
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,494
He's off the case.

472
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,037
Patient okay?

473
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,131
Yeah.

474
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,609
He's lying.

475
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,211
Why don't I feel scared?

476
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,222
I'd say you're unaware of what
you're feeling at this moment.

477
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:52,558
I feel like crap, my life is falling
apart, but I don't feel scared.

478
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,196
Not of the rehab, anyway.

479
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,964
We've always been able
to find a way to cheat.

480
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,366
It won't work.

481
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,379
You want it to work this time.

482
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,108
Do we?

483
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,548
House, it's your only option.

484
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,911
And what do I do if my
only option won't work?

485
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,588
You don't give up.

486
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,129
It's either that or
electroshock every six hours.

487
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,325
Good night, Wilson.

488
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,281
What if we put her on
a heart-lung machine?

489
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,364
She's septic.

490
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,717
We don't need a
heart-lung machine.

491
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,336
We need a blood vessel
holder-together machine.

492
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,139
We could try a
high-dose dopamine.

493
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,679
It's a vasoconstrictor.

494
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,875
It'll close the blood vessels
so she won't bleed out.

495
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,885
Her heart can't take that
much dopamine. It'll explode.

496
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,319
And if we don't use the
dopamine, it'll implode.

497
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,583
Is House really done?

498
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,818
Sounded that way.

499
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,620
Dopamine it is.

500
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,117
It's late and I'm tired.

501
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,018
Can we get to the talking
part of this conversation?

502
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,488
I quit.

503
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,651
Great.

504
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,688
My nanny is off
the clock at 7:30.

505
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,293
So your week off, bigger desk,

506
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,872
tighter nurses'
uniforms, or whatever

507
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,432
other stupid thing
you're about to demand

508
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,410
is gonna have to wait until...

509
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,743
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

510
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,942
who makes you feel
good about yourself.

511
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,384
Screw you.

512
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,417
Don't do this.

513
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,791
I'm hallucinating.

514
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,896
From the Vicodin?

515
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,330
Ruled out everything else.

516
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:22,303
We can admit you through the ER

517
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,612
under a pseudonym.
No one has to...

518
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:28,814
I'll cheat, scam, find
some way to keep using.

519
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,480
These people know
what they're doing.

520
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,353
These people don't know me.

521
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,818
You do.

522
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,694
She's not your keeper. She
has no responsibility for you.

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
I need you.

524
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,036
Let me call my babysitter.

525
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,955
Blood pressure is 90 over 60.

526
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,048
We know.

527
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,391
I'm just saying, it's still
90 over 60. It's holding.

528
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,953
Abscess is intact.

529
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,659
Doesn't look like any of the
surrounding tissue is affected.

530
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,463
She's gonna be fine.

531
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,594
Doctor.

532
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,982
We've got a problem.

533
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:43,591
Lie down. I'll get you some tea.

534
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,126
Yeah, then I'll be better.

535
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,506
You really think she hasn't searched
this place for your secret stash?

536
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,978
I already did this room, and
the bathroom and your bedroom.

537
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,520
Where should I
look in the kitchen?

538
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,861
Coffee cup. In the top shelf.

539
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,958
That was a test. I
already did the kitchen.

540
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,801
Nicely played. She'll think you've
come clean, given her everything.

541
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,340
There's more.

542
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:34,004
Don't. You're hurting
already. It'll only get worse.

543
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,614
House, you should
tell me where it is now,

544
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,448
because you won't have
the will to tell me in two hours.

545
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,452
In my shoes. In the closet.

546
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:52,362
It's like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

547
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,664
It's okay. Hold my hand.

548
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,762
Am I okay?

549
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,729
We were able to successfully
remove the abscess from your heart.

550
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:34,262
But the dopamine caused the blood vessels
in your hands and feet to clamp shut.

551
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:39,411
We need to amputate or the
gangrene will spread, and you'll die.

552
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,311
My feet?

553
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,613
And your hands. I'm sorry.

554
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,614
No. I'm a dancer.

555
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,592
The tissue can't be saved.

556
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,684
No.

557
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,659
We know what House would do.

558
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,261
House would have never
woken her up to ask for consent.

559
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,250
If you can't live with the
answer, don't ask the question.

560
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,175
You're saying we should
accept her decision?

561
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,938
Bold idea, I know.

562
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,989
Maybe we can get the
boyfriend to convince her to do it.

563
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,608
Yeah, boyfriends get
everything they want.

564
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,314
Forget it. The boyfriend
doesn't want to talk to her at all.

565
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,528
Where are you going?

566
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,922
Home. The case is over.

567
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,256
No, it's not. Not
until we come up

568
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,454
with something that might work.

569
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,463
It's a shame that she might die

570
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,261
because House has some
personal crap to work through.

571
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,131
Technically, if she dies,

572
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,180
it's because House has some
personal crap to work through

573
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,436
and we weren't smart enough
to get the answer without him.

574
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,888
False alarm.

575
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,655
Drink this.

576
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,162
That's your advice? Drink this?

577
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,058
It's ginger. It'll
ease the nausea.

578
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,126
You know what would
calm the nausea?

579
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,902
Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma.

580
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,008
Don't pretend you didn't see it.

581
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,241
I saw it, which
means you saw it.

582
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,674
Send her away.

583
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,551
Too bitter. I already
have enough bitter.

584
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,720
I'll add some honey.

585
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,770
You're pathetic.

586
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,271
If you want the pill,
just send her home.

587
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,738
But you can't, because that
would be admitting defeat to her.

588
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,058
Now this is interesting.

589
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:12,029
If you take the pill,
you don't deserve her.

590
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:16,432
If you secretly take the pill,
you don't deserve anyone.

591
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,504
No!

592
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:28,036
No. No!

593
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,894
This isn't going to work.

594
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,904
It might work. That's
all we're going for.

595
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:53,971
Vasodilators can...

596
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,008
Big jump from
reopening to reanimating.

597
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,668
I'm out of the ulnar.

598
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,412
Not seeing any
clearing. This won't work.

599
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,540
This probably won't work.

600
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,845
Radial artery's really tight.

601
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,943
Don't go too fast. If it
clots, she loses the hand.

602
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,285
If it clots, she's dead.

603
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,257
I can't believe it.

604
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,489
What?

605
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,463
It might be working.

606
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,109
Can you stop?

607
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,843
The breathing.

608
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,322
Air goes in, air goes out.

609
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,824
Use your nose.

610
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,521
You're supposed to feel
like crap. You're doing great.

611
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,892
And after?

612
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,026
You come back to work.

613
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,199
What if I can't?

614
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,777
Opioid dependency
can make you think

615
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,143
you have more pain
than you really have.

616
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,377
You're going to be okay.

617
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,145
You're telling me what I
want to hear, with no evidence.

618
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,211
I'm telling you what I
believe to be the truth.

619
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,414
With no evidence.

620
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,753
You're hardly the most
unbiased observer.

621
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,190
Neither are you.

622
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,192
I'm your hospital's
biggest asset.

623
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,535
Is that why you think I'm here?

624
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,847
That's why you're here, that's
why you're lying to me about...

625
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,364
I haven't lied to
you in 20 years.

626
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,500
Sure you have.

627
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,923
Which means that
you just said that

628
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,349
because you want to tell me what
you lied to me about 20 years ago.

629
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,547
You're an ass.

630
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:51,851
Am I wrong?

631
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,254
I wasn't in your
endocrinology class.

632
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,276
You sat next to me. I
cheated off you in the mid-term.

633
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,462
I audited your
endocrinology class.

634
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,971
Why would you...

635
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,477
Because I thought you were
an interesting lunatic even then.

636
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,573
I'm not here protecting
hospital property.

637
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,495
We're alone.

638
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,196
We've been alone all night.

639
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,605
No, I mean Amber.

640
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,339
She's gone.

641
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:05,592
Where's Jeremy?

642
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,687
He left.

643
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,201
You okay?

644
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,645
The surgery worked.

645
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,881
Congratulations.

646
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,687
I can't do it.

647
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,163
You have doubts.

648
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,429
You don't?

649
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:46,932
No.

650
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,008
That's

651
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,212
naive.

652
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,449
I want to spend the rest of
my life with you. I love you.

653
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,075
That's how I feel right now,

654
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:06,146
but I don't know.

655
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,519
I'll wait until you do.

656
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:19,099
I can't know. No one knows.

657
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,100
I do.

658
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:35,252
I'll see you in later? I have
some papers to push for you.

659
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,889
Thank you.

660
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,024
You want to kiss me, don't you?

661
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,391
I always want to kiss you.
