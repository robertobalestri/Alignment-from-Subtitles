1
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,337
Excuse me. I've been
waiting here for over an hour.

2
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,844
All I need is a refill on
my migraine medication.

3
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,122
We'll get to you
as soon as we can.

4
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,208
You can get to me now. It'll
only take you two minutes.

5
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,445
You're not an emergency.

6
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,384
This isn't an emergency room.

7
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,287
And it's not gonna go any
faster by pissing me off.

8
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,290
Got a minute? No.

9
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,320
Routine check-up can
wait. What else you got?

10
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,162
I'm consulting on some clinical
trials that involve CNS compounds.

11
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,101
While it's true that "no" sometimes
means "yes," in this context...

12
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,400
One's a new Huntington's drug.

13
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,602
Phase three trials are showing real
results in delaying neuronal degeneration.

14
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,110
Probably get you in.

15
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,242
No, thanks.

16
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,092
Are you doing anything about your
disease? Following any kind of program?

17
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,483
No. Nor am I
looking for a consult.

18
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,808
Excuse me. I'm
looking for Dr. Cuddy.

19
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,813
She's either not here,
or she's under the desk.

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,873
Either way you're gonna have
to wait outside until I'm finished.

21
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,362
Do you know when she'll be back?

22
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,322
Yes, which is why I need you
to get out and leave me alone.

23
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,820
Sorry.

24
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,445
Nice try. Love to help.

25
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,649
Shut up.

26
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,191
You wanted to
see... I said shut up.

27
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,326
I'm sick, and I
want to know why.

28
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,874
I want the best
doctor in this hospital,

29
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:53,705
here, now, or I'm
gonna start killing people.

30
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,415
What seems to be the problem?

31
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,350
Close those blinds.

32
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,979
You, push the sofa
in front of that door.

33
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,659
You, move that table
in front of the other door.

34
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,887
Now! Okay!

35
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,625
Okay. We'll just move it. Okay.

36
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,635
You don't have to point the gun, man.
We're gonna do whatever you want.

37
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,136
No, we're not.

38
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,173
House.

39
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,837
That's a bathroom you're
barricading. Might come in handy,

40
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,007
especially since you've cleverly decided
to take a bunch of sick people hostage.

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,048
Do it!

42
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,124
My medical records. I
need you to read them.

43
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,353
You really think that
re-enacting <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>

44
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,362
is the best way
to get diagnosed?

45
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,989
I'm sure you've been waiting for
hours in an uncomfortable chair,

46
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,933
but you should watch the
movie all the way through.

47
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,961
I've been to 16 doctors
in the last two years,

48
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,440
had three full-body
CTs and two MRIs

49
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,105
seven blood panels, and
one homeopathic consult.

50
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,644
And all that was missing
was the threat of violence.

51
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,810
What's missing is an answer.

52
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:50,017
I can't breathe.
I'm tired all the time.

53
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,921
I get skin rashes and heart
palpitations and insomnia.

54
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,933
It's a cool constellation of
symptoms. It could be something minor.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,525
At least, compared
to life in prison,

56
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,265
which is what you seem to prefer
to seeing 16 more specialists.

57
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,003
Shut up and do your job.

58
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,585
Keep moving.

59
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,789
Keep moving.

60
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,061
You barely looked at the file.

61
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,293
No need.

62
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,598
Symptoms? Those are the
things you keep whining about.

63
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,071
Tests? All negative or
you wouldn't be here.

64
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,576
History? Shy, quiet
kid, kept to himself,

65
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,703
collected comic books
and missing children.

66
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,908
Excuse me. My wife
feels sick to her stomach.

67
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,884
Next time pack some
heat, maybe we'll look into it.

68
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,181
I'll be okay.

69
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,661
If you ask me,

70
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,326
keeping an open line of communication
is the best way to resolve conflict.

71
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,935
What kind of breathing problems?

72
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:18,734
Shortness of breath and
sharp pain when I inhale.

73
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,446
So you figured your wife left you
because you couldn't breathe, right?

74
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,513
Me, I rarely kidnap someone
unless I got a serious health problem.

75
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,853
And since you're not almost
dead, means you're armed

76
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,224
because you're blaming something
other than your health on your health.

77
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,160
I've never been married.

78
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,188
Got a match? Why?

79
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,859
Because I'd rather
not stand here

80
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,029
while you try and negotiate a hostage
trade for an incentive spirometer.

81
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,801
I'll look in Cuddy's desk.
Stay out of the desk.

82
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,708
Cuddy doesn't smoke,
but he does. No, I don't.

83
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,542
Right, you just brush your
teeth with coffee grounds.

84
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,845
Look, sir, I've never
smoked in my life, okay?

85
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,950
Jerk.

86
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:05,052
You figure that two people snuck
weapons into the clinic today?

87
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,220
I'm sorry. I just got a lighter.

88
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,795
Slowly.

89
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,799
Hold it out as far as you
can. Try to blow it out.

90
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,580
Decreased lung
volume, heart palpitations,

91
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,453
fatigue, stomach
pain, intermittent rash...

92
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,620
Could be a hundred things.

93
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,462
You add on that final symptom and it
can only be pulmonary scleroderma.

94
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,626
What final symptom?
Those were all my symptoms.

95
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,102
Last one is the 16
doctors who missed it.

96
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,631
Simple alkylating agent, case
solved. See you on visitor's day.

97
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,456
Crime scene.

98
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,152
House, what's going on in
there? Is everyone all right?

99
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,457
About to be,
assuming he's not lying.

100
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,963
But he seems like a
pretty straight arrow to me.

101
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:25,129
I'm gonna need some propofol to
prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma,

102
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,436
<i>and we all get to go
home.</i> Propofol? You sure...

103
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,376
Have one of the guards bring
it in. No, no guards, no cops.

104
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,707
I'll go get it.

105
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,906
And no one's leaving.

106
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:47,217
She's not a cop. Dr. Cuddy
brings in the drugs. Alone.

107
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,526
She might be armed. I'd
have her deliver it shirtless.

108
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,307
Who is it?

109
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,560
Oh, God. House, maybe
we should wait for the...

110
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,972
Guys with even bigger guns?
Who know how to talk to armed...

111
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,090
Say goodbye or I shoot her.

112
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,550
Pull up your sleeve.

113
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,449
Give it to someone else first.

114
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,319
You're the only
one who needs it.

115
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,881
Give it to someone else.

116
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,951
If it goes in okay, you can
give a second dose to me.

117
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,091
I don't care who, but
just pick someone.

118
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,796
Again, had your brilliant plan
included a roomful of hostages

119
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,500
who don't have fetuses,
bacterial and fungal infections,

120
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,414
leaving their immune systems too
weak to deal with the metabolic strain,

121
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,970
or who are already on painkillers
that have fatal interactions...

122
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,279
He's not on painkillers. I
heard him tell her in the clinic.

123
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,343
Come on, man.
Don't take it out on us.

124
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,723
You got a problem with doctors,
take it out on the doctors. Give it to her.

125
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:32,695
She's sick. And you
are a very large creep.

126
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,424
Take off your shirt.

127
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,208
Satisfied?

128
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Fine.

129
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,551
Roll up your sleeve.

130
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,669
You think I'm an idiot?
That's what you think?

131
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,468
Thought I had a little more
time with a guy that size.

132
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,572
You're not gonna do anything.

133
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,946
You still need me.

134
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,382
Come on.

135
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,320
What are you doing?
He didn't do anything.

136
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,189
You're right. I need you.

137
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,751
I also need you to know
you can't screw with me.

138
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,370
It's for you.

139
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,207
Lieutenant Bowman,
Princeton SWAT.

140
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,969
Dr. Lisa Cuddy,
Dean of Medicine.

141
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,375
We just heard a gunshot, but I
haven't been able to make contact.

142
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,450
We'll handle that once we secure
our perimeter and set up our positions.

143
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,352
By perimeters I assume you mean
snipers. We have to put an end to this.

144
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,447
Got a husband in
there, or a loved one?

145
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,650
No.

146
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,645
Don't worry. We'll decide
when to start shooting.

147
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,624
House is gonna
get someone killed.

148
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,133
Guy's ready to
kill for a diagnosis.

149
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,796
I can't think of a better doctor
to be trapped in there with him.

150
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,349
How about somebody who's not
gonna keep pushing the wackjob's buttons

151
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,568
until he cracks?

152
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,378
It's House.

153
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,745
Joe's Bar and
Grill. <i>It's Foreman.</i>

154
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,414
And every fellow you've
had in the last five years.

155
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,450
What causes low lung volume,

156
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,828
<i>heart palpitations, fatigue,
stomach pain, insomnia and a rash?</i>

157
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,025
This is pathetic.

158
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,695
If I strap a bomb to my chest, do I
get seven doctors attending to me?

159
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,398
Dr. Robert Chase.

160
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:30,307
On the off-chance you have some brilliant
escape plan and are the vengeful type.

161
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,746
You think he's the only guy in New Jersey
with an unsolved illness and a pistol?

162
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,442
I'm not playing this game.

163
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,644
Seriously? You're walking out?

164
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,081
<i>No, he's just kidding.
He's right here.</i>

165
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,557
Throw me that marker, will you?

166
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,928
Chest pain, the lung problems, fatigue,
rash, sounds like chronic lung infection.

167
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,694
Heart palpitations and fatigue,

168
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,032
could be a cancer that's
spread from the lungs.

169
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,127
Next.

170
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,749
If his diaphragm's not working,
maybe his nerves are freezing up.

171
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,884
I think he's going into shock.

172
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:06,107
First rule of triage, guys
with guns go first. Next.

173
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,116
Shortest distance between stomach
pain and insomnia is bad circulation.

174
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,675
<i>Plus trouble breathing,
could be a heart defect.</i>

175
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,681
You needed to write four
things down to remember?

176
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,762
It's not my wall.

177
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,230
You're gonna get
some special deliveries.

178
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,430
Foreman, we're gonna draw blood.
Run a test for infection and cancer.

179
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,369
<i>Cameron, comb through
his medical records,</i>

180
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,239
see if any of his past 900 medications
could have screwed up his heart.

181
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,972
Taub and Kutner, go to his
apartment, check for neurotoxins.

182
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,605
873 Marshall, South Brunswick.

183
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,346
Back window's unlocked.

184
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,951
Giving out your address?

185
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,114
Clearly not going back there.

186
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,987
Means you do have an end game.

187
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,588
I'm Lieutenant Bowman.
How's everyone doing in there?

188
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,965
Got one lower limb flesh
wound, another guy unconscious.

189
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,663
Unfortunately, not
the guy we hoped.

190
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,263
We're gonna need
someone to deliver his blood.

191
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,855
It's gonna be hard
to play doctor...

192
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,074
Shut up.

193
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,747
Open that blind,
just a few inches.

194
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,982
Why me? Just open it. Open it.

195
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,854
Why me? Anyone
can do it. Why pick me?

196
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,294
Get back! Get back!

197
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,267
I will kill her unless you
back the hell out of there now!

198
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,812
Interesting.

199
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,977
Anybody else hear
those guys outside?

200
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,217
Anybody?

201
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,290
He's got hyperacusis.

202
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,450
What does that mean?

203
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,721
It means we have a favorite.

204
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,829
It's nerve-related.

205
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,060
Amped-up hearing could
be linked to nerve palsy.

206
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,535
Puff out your cheeks. Come on.

207
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,601
Now, a big mug-shot smile.

208
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,338
Left-side facial weakness.

209
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,210
Seventh-nerve palsy.

210
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,877
Plus intermittent rashes, plus
migraines, it's postherpetic neuralgia.

211
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,978
Herpetic? You
think I have herpes?

212
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,352
I'm not judging here.

213
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,051
This thing is just as likely
to be caused by chicken pox.

214
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,615
I need proof now.

215
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,754
There is a test. It's
dangerous and painful

216
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,991
while the treatment
is safe and painless.

217
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,726
But you make a good
point. You need proof now.

218
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,600
I'll order up the test.

219
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,105
If you have neuralgia,
you won't feel it going in.

220
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,143
It only hurts if your
diagnosis is wrong.

221
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,302
Win-win.

222
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,985
Jason, don't hang
up the phone again.

223
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,962
You're gonna send in...

224
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,966
Capsaicin, 200 micrograms.

225
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,467
And two syringes this time.

226
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,629
And we'll give you the
blood and his records.

227
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,834
No more meds, Jason, and no
deliveries without something in return.

228
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,570
You gotta give us a hostage.

229
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,643
You can have two.

230
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,772
<i>Great.</i>

231
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,928
<i>Then I'll send an officer
right in with the transfer.</i>

232
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,111
Everything gets
brought in by Dr. Cuddy.

233
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,211
Jason, I'm not
gonna let her do that.

234
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,315
First, don't use
his name so much.

235
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,271
It doesn't sound reassuring,
just sounds creepy.

236
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,526
And second, come on, he's
not gonna shoot the one person

237
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,690
he trusts to bring
in his medication.

238
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,598
He's gonna shoot the
hostages if she doesn't bring it in.

239
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,062
I'll get back to you.

240
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,600
The guy's demanding
that you do all the transfers.

241
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,705
Okay. "Okay"?

242
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:02,874
What am I supposed to say?

243
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:06,181
You're supposed to
say no, it's not your job.

244
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,031
If you got a conflict here,
if you have stakes in this

245
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,025
that you're not telling me
about, then I can't trust you.

246
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,560
Got it. I'm okay.

247
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,531
Can you tell him
I'm coming in now?

248
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,193
Who's taking the first dose?

249
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,204
Anybody here got a
longstanding case of neuralgia

250
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,831
that's killed their nerves
so this won't hurt at all?

251
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,705
How bad does it hurt?

252
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,039
You're looking to be the hero?

253
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:08,047
I've been beaten up a
lot, and I can handle pain.

254
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,946
How old are you?

255
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,350
Guy's got a gun. I think that
covers the parental consent issue.

256
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,321
And that stuff can also cause
nerve and muscle damage.

257
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,003
Uh...

258
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,304
No way am I taking
that crap. Come on.

259
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,173
You have to. It's the rules.

260
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,139
I'll do it.

261
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,981
This is a level of risk-taking

262
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,289
beyond anonymous
girl-on-girl action.

263
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,329
They're patients, I'm a doctor.

264
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,957
With a degenerative,
drug-unfriendly illness.

265
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,797
Everything's not some
fascinating character flaw.

266
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,496
This is a genetic flaw.

267
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,904
This is your Huntington's speaking. This
is you waving a white flag at the world.

268
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,737
Yes, I have a
shortened lifespan.

269
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,438
Another reason why I'm
objectively the right choice.

270
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,950
Wow, I would have laid
money you had herpes.

271
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,854
Your turn. So, why are we here?

272
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,325
We've ruled out immediate
risk of death, lost love.

273
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,194
That just leaves work.

274
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,595
You're defined by your work.

275
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,569
But you kept seeing
doctors, kept missing time,

276
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,229
couldn't focus.

277
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,809
And you made a
huge mistake, got fired.

278
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,811
I just want an answer.

279
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,782
I know. I'm asking why.

280
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,799
Guy knew he wasn't coming back.

281
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,773
Everything's laid out for us.

282
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,736
I'll check for toxins
in the kitchen.

283
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,246
He must have $6,000,
$7,000 in unpaid medical bills.

284
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,009
I've got debt, too. You don't
see me acting like a lunatic.

285
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,641
There's no excuse
for what he's doing,

286
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,229
but if you've got millions of
people thousands of dollars in debt

287
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:30,883
because they're sick, at least one of
them is going to do something inexcusable.

288
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,720
Especially if it works.

289
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:41,256
White blood cell count's
normal. It's not infection.

290
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:49,207
So either his heart is on
the fritz, or he's got cancer.

291
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,406
I found a picture of his mom. She's
got a droopy eye, fat face, thick neck.

292
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,756
Classic signs of an
upper-lobe tumor.

293
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,839
<i>Or she's just ugly.</i>

294
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,826
They're also classic signs
of an adrenal problem.

295
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,182
It's his heart.

296
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,747
You can't be sure which...
His neck, distended jugular.

297
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,720
What are you doing?

298
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,890
I'm going to try to strangle you
faster than you can pull a trigger.

299
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,593
He needs to check your pulse.

300
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,836
It's racing, 160.

301
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,606
We need to get paddles.

302
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,645
Or maybe we could
just do nothing.

303
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,978
If I get any weaker and
they don't fix it, I'll shoot you.

304
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,540
Don't! He didn't mean to...

305
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,176
Shut up, all of you.

306
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,449
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

307
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,552
Carotid massage,
it'll slow your heart.

308
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,864
It's 200. Get the paddles.

309
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,376
The whole point of those things is
they make your muscles contract.

310
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,045
They don't discriminate
against trigger fingers.

311
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,004
Nobody gets my gun.

312
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,801
Send in paddles! Don't!

313
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,537
Get the damn paddles,
or I'll shoot you.

314
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,507
Threatening to shoot the guy who's
diagnosing you makes a lot of sense.

315
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,847
Actually doing it, not so much.

316
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,358
Give him your gun
so he can save you.

317
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,685
Just let him die. Bill, stop.

318
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,452
We can cardiovert chemically.

319
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,102
If we don't know what
kind of heart rhythm it is...

320
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,670
If we don't try something,
he's gonna kill someone.

321
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,494
I'm gonna get the drugs.
No one goes anywhere.

322
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,300
If she doesn't come back, you've got
plenty of other people you can shoot.

323
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,835
You, come here.

324
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,207
All right.

325
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,411
Thirty seconds.

326
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,768
She's gonna go.

327
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,078
She's gonna come back.

328
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,211
She should go.

329
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,151
He'll kill him. But not her.

330
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,587
Is that your
version of morality?

331
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,253
If you don't think your life is
worth more than someone else's,

332
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,954
sign your donor
card and kill yourself.

333
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,534
Shoot me.

334
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,105
You really want... Yes.

335
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,274
No! No!

336
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,750
She just needs time. She just needs
more time to find you the right drug.

337
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,310
She just needs time
to get your... It's me.

338
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,789
She takes it first.

339
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,832
Adenosine slows the heart, which
is fine, if it's beating fast like yours,

340
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,736
not fine, if it's
normal like hers.

341
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:08,984
You following the math on this?

342
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,499
She takes everything I take.

343
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,943
I don't want anything
that cross-reacts.

344
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:30,487
Martyr's heart is beating
dangerously slow. Are we good to go?

345
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,565
Your heart's back to normal.

346
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,339
No tachycardia, no sign
of a heart defect at all.

347
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,380
But you're sweating.

348
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,044
I nearly had a heart attack,

349
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,519
you're surprised I'm sweating?

350
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,556
One side of your
face, but not the other.

351
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:58,750
What does that mean?

352
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:02,591
A tumor is pressing on
your sympathetic nerves.

353
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,027
You have lung cancer.

354
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,741
Pulse is down below 50.

355
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:21,242
So is her IQ. Help her up,
get her heart going faster.

356
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,281
I need proof it's cancer.

357
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,217
Of course you do.

358
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,687
It's gotta be a Pancoast tumor.

359
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,459
Patient's got dyspnea,
seventh-nerve palsy,

360
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,466
he's sweating on
one side of his face.

361
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,001
Everything okay in there?

362
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,867
Take your time. It's not like
I've got a gun to my head.

363
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,931
Lung cancer usually shows
up lower than the seventh nerve.

364
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,339
<i>Did you check his throat?</i>

365
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,878
Spit on the floor. What?

366
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,382
If I do it, I can't tell Cuddy
that it was medically necessary.

367
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,815
I'm gonna ask you to
piss on her chair next.

368
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,819
Dry mouth, his parotid
glands aren't working.

369
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:13,263
If there's swelling, it's a Pancoast
tumor that's metastasized.

370
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,133
Feel that. Right there.

371
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,337
If it's cancer, there
must be a test.

372
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,468
You just did it.

373
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,410
What about an
X-ray or something.

374
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,742
Good idea.

375
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,808
Oh, damn, I left my CT
machine in my other pants.

376
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:46,957
How many hostages do you think
it'll cost me for a trip to radiology?

377
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,257
So, what made you snap?

378
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,084
HMOs? Shut up.

379
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,097
Nah, you saw 16 doctors,
how bad could they have been?

380
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,462
Shut up.

381
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,831
Humiliation?

382
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,906
Doctors treating you
like a piece of meat?

383
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,042
Too many fingers and
tubes up your holes?

384
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,739
You hate doctors, you
want to take back control.

385
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:13,075
If so, I apologize for the fact
that you are a piece of meat.

386
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,710
I just want an answer.

387
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,323
That's all.

388
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,906
Everyone stays in here with me.

389
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,749
You need anything
from in there, get it now.

390
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,960
Move around.

391
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,774
Anyone moves, I fire.

392
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,283
That's not all.

393
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,823
Curiosity is not enough.
There's got to be a deeper reason.

394
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:36,031
You never did anything just
because you had to know?

395
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,070
Never shot anyone.

396
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,900
You're not me.

397
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,430
This is my body,
this is my life,

398
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,271
and there's a truth out there.

399
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,547
I'd rather rot in
jail knowing than...

400
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,985
I can't handle not knowing.

401
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,892
Yeah.

402
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,575
Hold that.

403
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,112
You want your answer,
you gotta give me the gun.

404
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,955
What's this?

405
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:40,158
Starburst artifact, the metal
from the gun is ruining the image.

406
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,598
Show him.

407
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,461
Starburst.

408
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,402
Now, unless you think
we pre-arranged that

409
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:51,705
just in case we were ever held hostage
by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying.

410
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,609
So, you have two choices,

411
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,375
you can give me the
gun and get your answer,

412
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,976
or you can shoot me.

413
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,694
I'm not gonna give you the gun.

414
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,784
Why did he release you?

415
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,847
House got him to give
up his gun. We just ran.

416
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,395
Why are you still here? Curious.

417
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,432
It's safe now, right?

418
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,861
They're gonna be through that door
any moment, just show me the tumor.

419
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,033
There isn't one.

420
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,898
I don't know what you have.

421
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,510
So,

422
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:40,947
it's over.

423
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,459
Thanks for trying.

424
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,121
You had four theories,
you ruled out four theories.

425
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,058
Maybe no one can cure me.

426
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,957
He overpowered
me. Got the gun back.

427
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,834
You're a coward.

428
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,105
You need to know everything
because you're afraid to be wrong.

429
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,633
You're so afraid of being ordinary,
of being just another doctor,

430
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,875
just another human being, that
you'll risk other people's lives.

431
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,349
I'm arrogant, you're the coward.

432
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,147
You're terrified of death.

433
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,619
You just want to cheat it
by making it come sooner.

434
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,714
It gives you the
illusion of control.

435
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,517
Can I go?

436
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,758
Sorry. We might need you.

437
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,270
How do they expect me to think?

438
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,174
Is he lying? Why
would he do that?

439
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,871
Over time, hostages
start to root for the captor.

440
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,311
House isn't the rooting kind.

441
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,077
No, he's the
obsessive, defiant kind.

442
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,615
Mic the door, get
a frame charge.

443
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,519
Hope your boyfriend
knows what he's doing.

444
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,161
Are you insane?

445
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,259
He's quick for a sick guy.

446
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:41,966
Dyspnea, anemia,
seventh-nerve palsy, tachycardia.

447
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,834
Long passes, anything, go.

448
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,109
I don't believe it. Chase was
right, you're gonna kill someone.

449
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,846
I don't want to be a part of it.

450
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,252
Loa loa filariasis.

451
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,461
You ever been to Cameroon
or on the Ogowe River? Next.

452
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,895
Could be Q fever, if he's
had exposure to goats.

453
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,330
No goats.

454
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,160
Histiocytosis X explains
the lung involvement and...

455
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,601
You have a new symptom.

456
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:22,173
He's turning his head,
favoring his left ear,

457
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,273
which means he's
partially deaf in the right.

458
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,784
Three hours ago he
had superhero hearing.

459
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,117
Cushing's causes fatigue, breathing
problems, fluctuating hearing...

460
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,918
Even increased
aggression and risk-taking.

461
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,051
I'm doing this by choice,
it's not a symptom.

462
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,857
We'll keep that between us
until we talk to your lawyer.

463
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:46,232
I need dexamethasone and enough
time to provoke a respiratory reaction

464
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,897
and confirm Cushing's syndrome.

465
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,999
<i>You need more time? House,
we're not negotiating with you.</i>

466
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:53,238
Actually, we're
through negotiating.

467
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,780
I've still got three
hostages left.

468
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,276
I'll give you one.

469
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,478
And no more testing
drugs on the sick doctor.

470
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,021
Fine.

471
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,579
Send in the drugs.

472
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,932
Son, come here, come here.

473
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,167
House, you can't...

474
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,937
If you have Cushing's,
this will slow your breathing.

475
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,446
Give it to her first.

476
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,877
Those were not the terms.

477
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,487
I lied.

478
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,386
These drugs could be fake.

479
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,818
Why would I do that? I
gave you back the gun.

480
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,885
You wouldn't, they would.

481
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,487
She has Huntington's.

482
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,723
If these drugs are real, it
could screw up her liver...

483
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,203
Chances are slim. Chances of him
shooting one of us, on the other hand...

484
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,498
Don't...

485
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,578
How long do you have to live?

486
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,445
Eight, ten years.

487
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,252
Killing her is your
chance to get personal?

488
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:16,454
Huntington's
doesn't have a cure?

489
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,095
No.

490
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,166
So, if we get out of here...

491
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,761
If she were clinging to hope,

492
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,104
she wouldn't be standing in line
waiting for you to order up more drugs.

493
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,541
Take a deep breath.

494
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:43,847
Not knowing what was wrong
with me made me miserable.

495
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:51,357
Maybe that's insane, and
doing this, yeah, insane.

496
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,195
But I had something to gain.

497
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,335
You can't take risks
with no upside at all.

498
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,500
I can't decide which is riskier,

499
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:06,477
taking crazy risks, or taking advice
on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker.

500
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,050
Heart's racing. No fever.

501
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,213
And your breathing's unchanged.

502
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,091
Does that mean she...
Means I was wrong.

503
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,095
Her kidneys are shutting down
because of the meds you made her take.

504
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,606
We have to get her out of here.

505
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:44,137
The dexamethasone is
making Thirteen's kidneys fail,

506
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,047
but not the patient's, why?

507
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,415
This guy's been on 50
different medications,

508
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,320
maybe his kidneys should be failing,
but something's protecting them.

509
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,656
I need to slap you for
diagnostic purposes.

510
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,958
Seriously. If I was jerking you around,
I'd say I need to kick you in the groin.

511
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:15,044
That twitch is Chvostek's sign. Don't
ask me how Chvostek discovered it.

512
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,706
He has calcium deficiency.

513
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:20,013
Drugs that block calcium tend
to shield against kidney damage.

514
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,111
He's been on protein pump inhibitors
for years, for his stomach pain.

515
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,918
Those drugs have been
protecting his kidneys for years.

516
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:30,158
He has something that
has a long incubation period,

517
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,060
something that should've
wrecked his kidneys,

518
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,965
something that explains
breathing problems, heart problems,

519
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,469
jumpy nerves and weak blood.

520
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,064
Leishmaniasis.

521
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:43,370
Would make perfect sense if our
patient was an Arabian Bedouin.

522
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,402
Melioidosis.

523
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,968
<i>Bacteria gets into the
lungs, spreads to the heart.</i>

524
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,375
<i>It explains everything.</i>

525
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,027
Except that if you'd
read the history,

526
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,627
you'd know that our patient has
never been to a tropical climate.

527
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,520
Is he absolutely sure of that? Mexico,
Costa Rica... You've never been...

528
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,023
I've never been
anywhere south of Florida.

529
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,892
You idiot.

530
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,999
Florida counts?

531
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,936
Not to the Supreme Court,
but it's warm enough for germs.

532
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,666
You keep blaming doctors.

533
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,438
You can't even give a
halfway-decent history.

534
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,875
Negotiation's over.

535
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,043
It will be as soon as you get
us three grams of ceftazidime.

536
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,555
<i>He comes out, he gets
all the medicine he wants.</i>

537
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,590
You can have Dr. House.

538
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,019
Why are you getting rid of me?

539
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,088
I need to trade
you for the answer.

540
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,430
You're gonna give
her the meds. No.

541
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,765
Come on. Give
them to me instead.

542
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,708
She's taken
everything I've taken.

543
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,043
The combination of
meds could knock me out.

544
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,605
Her kidneys are failing.

545
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,414
You give her those drugs, she'll be
dead by the time they get the cuffs on you.

546
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,045
I need my answer.

547
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,113
Your obsession
is gonna kill her!

548
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,283
Your obsession
gave me back the gun.

549
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,291
It is pointless to
give her those drugs,

550
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,806
even if they are screwing with
you. This is your last diagnosis!

551
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,961
Only if you're right.
House, get out of here.

552
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,130
Shut up, I'm not leaving.

553
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,439
Who's the martyr now?

554
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:26,672
Either the drugs kill me or he kills me.
Doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.

555
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,970
You really don't feel
bad about killing me?

556
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,569
Not if you don't feel
bad about killing yourself.

557
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,043
I don't want to
die. Yeah, you do.

558
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,945
You just don't have the
nerve to actually do it.

559
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,424
You just want it out of your control.
Well, it is. Because I've got a gun.

560
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,904
Don't do this.

561
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,442
Either I do this
with you alive or...

562
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,309
Please. Sometimes you
just have to trust people.

563
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,841
I don't want to die.

564
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,940
I don't want to die.

565
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,462
Why are you still alive?

566
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,337
He didn't make me take it.

567
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,258
A week of temporary dialysis,
your kidneys will be okay.

568
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,936
I'm sorry I backed
out of the differential.

569
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:04,221
About that
Huntington's drug trial.

570
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,755
Test confirmed melioidosis.

571
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,589
Easy to miss on the stain.

572
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,163
Scans and X-rays vary widely.

573
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,029
Is that all you care about?

574
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,231
A moron storms the clinic, bullies
his way into life without parole,

575
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,398
you enabling him at every step.

576
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,999
If he hadn't done what
he did, he'd be dead.

577
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,305
Good thing you enabled
my every medical move.

578
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,788
You think I handled this differently
because you were in here?

579
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,377
I don't know. Let's
try it again without me.

580
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,020
This is why you
and I can't be a thing.

581
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,963
If you're suggesting
that you screwed up

582
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,467
because of a
non-relationship with me,

583
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,094
I don't know how I can help you.

584
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,232
Because the only change you can
make from a non-relationship is...

585
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,245
You want a relationship?

586
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,740
God, no. I was just
trying to follow your logic.
