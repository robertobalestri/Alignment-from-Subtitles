1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,997
<i>I didn't sleep well last night, and
I woke up with a scratchy throat.</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,808
<i>I just don't feel so
good. Uh, cough.</i>

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,573
Yeah, um-um, I have a bit of an

4
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,546
upset stomach too, and I
think I'm running a fever.

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:22,613
I'm just worried I
might be contagious.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,525
Inventory. Tomorrow. I'm—Yeah,
I'm sure I'll be feeling better by then.

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,862
Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,627
I cannot believe
you just did that.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,537
I-I really do have a cough.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,939
Oh. So you weren't lying.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,674
You'd be curled up in bed
with a bowl of chicken soup...

12
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,909
Even if you didn't have
a horny girl in your bed?

13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,976
Yes. Because I really do— Hey.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,718
I really do have a cough.
You also have a little rash.

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:03,458
Um, I'm not sure
we should be kissing.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,695
Oh. It's okay. Because I have
almost no interest in kissing you.

17
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,260
Perfect. Good.

18
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,465
Uh-uh-uh.

19
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,813
Oh, baby.

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,849
Oh, Brandon.

21
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,910
Brandon.

22
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,452
I know I'm good, but come on.

23
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,055
Brandon?

24
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,026
Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.

25
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,265
<i>Brandon! Brandon!</i>

26
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:55,298
<i>Any additional R. N. to Surgical.
Any additional R. N. to Surgical.</i>

27
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,217
<i>Why do you want
me to treat this guy?</i>

28
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,284
Blood pressure's not
responding to I.V. fluids.

29
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,956
No, no. I didn't ask how you
plan to con me into treating him.

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,693
<i>I asked you why</i> you
<i>want me to treat him.</i>

31
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,429
He's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.

32
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,165
There are about a billion sick
people on the planet. Why this one?

33
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,232
Because this one's in our emergency
room. Ah, so it's a proximity issue.

34
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,716
If somebody was
sick in the third-floor

35
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,355
stairwell, that's who'd
we be talking about.

36
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,543
Yes. I checked the
stairwell. It's clear.

37
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,107
Okay, then. Emergency
room guy it is.

38
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,849
Wait. Why was that so
easy? You know why.

39
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,525
- Blood pressure's not responding to
I.V. fluids?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,759
That's just weird.

41
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,628
C.B.C. was unremarkable. Abdominal
C.T. scan didn't show anything.

42
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,365
<i>So, people, differential
diagnosis. What's wrong with her?</i>

43
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,373
- Him.
- Him. Her. Does it matter?

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,605
Does anyone think it's a
testicular problem? No. So, Chase?

45
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,671
- Yersinia infection?
- No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.

46
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,082
What about arthritis? Accompanying
vasculitis causes nerve damage...

47
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,952
- No. It wouldn't cause
the blood pressure problems. Allergy?
- The kid's got abdominal pain.

48
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,286
Maybe carcinoid? No. But
then you wouldn't get the...

49
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,700
Foreman, if you're going
to list all the things it's

50
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,954
not, it might be quicker
to do it alphabetically.

51
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:27,160
Let's see, now. "Absidia." Excellent.
Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.

52
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,068
- No condition accounts for
all these symptoms.
- Oh, good.

53
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,198
Because I thought maybe he
was sick. But, apparently, he's not.

54
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,833
<i>Who wants to do up
the discharge papers?</i>

55
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,812
Okay. Unless we control
the blood pressure,

56
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,093
he's gonna start circling the drain before
we can figure out what's wrong with him.

57
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,335
Treat him for sepsis,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

58
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,646
and I want a Cort-stim
test and an echocardiogram.

59
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,462
You all right? Yeah.

60
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,801
The Cort-stim test will
tell us if your pituitary

61
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,697
and adrenal glands
are working properly.

62
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,933
- His glands? What does that mean?
- We have a few theories we're working on.

63
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,669
- You mean you don't know.
- Mindy.

64
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,554
I'm just saying, if they knew they wouldn't
be testing you, they'd be treating you.

65
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,062
<i>Yeah, well, that's the
way it works. First we</i>

66
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,539
<i>find out what it is,
then we get you better.</i>

67
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,353
You're half an hour
late. Busy caseload.

68
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,795
One case is not a load.

69
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,736
So how are we doing
on cotton swabs today? If

70
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,699
there's an acute shortage,
I could run home...

71
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:38,261
No, you couldn't. Nice.

72
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,644
Hello, sick people
and their loved ones.

73
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,879
<i>In the interest of saving
time and avoiding a lot</i>

74
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,048
<i>of boring chitchat later,
I'm Dr. Gregory House.</i>

75
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,384
You can call me Greg. I'm one of three
doctors staffing this clinic this morning.

76
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,586
Short. Sweet. Grab a file. This
ray of sunshine is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

77
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,155
Dr. Cuddy runs this
whole hospital, so,

78
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,206
unfortunately, she's much
too busy to deal with you.

79
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,826
I am a <i>board</i>-certified
diagnostician,

80
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,495
with a double specialty of
infectious disease and nephrology.

81
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,524
I'm also the only doctor
currently employed at this

82
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,449
clinic who is forced to
be here against his will.

83
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,965
That is true, isn't
it? But not to worry.

84
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,740
Because for most of you, this job could be
done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.

85
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:23,909
<i>Speaking of which, if you’re particularly
annoying, you may see me reach for this.</i>

86
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,648
This is Vicodin. It's
mine. You can't have any.

87
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,715
And, no, I do not have a pain
management problem. I have a pain problem.

88
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:36,092
But who knows? Maybe I'm
wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.

89
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,495
<i>So, who wants me?</i>

90
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,771
And who would rather wait
for one of the other two guys?

91
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:51,001
Okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room
One if you change your mind.

92
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,148
Jodi Matthews?

93
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,516
Please accompany
Dr. House to Exam Room One.

94
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,087
<i>Dr. Chase.</i>

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,653
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend
is the best medicine for him right now.

96
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,065
I know. I get stupid when I'm
scared. Don't go rock climbing.

97
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,469
Look, I was wondering. Before
this happened, we were having sex.

98
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,868
What? You're wondering if whatever
he has, you might've gotten it?

99
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,938
It-It's unlikely. We ran a
complete S.T.D. panel, so...

100
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,679
No. I'm wondering if maybe I
did this to him. I was kind of rough.

101
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,361
It was yellow. It <i>was</i>?

102
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,559
It's not anymore.
Well, that's a shame.

103
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,298
I thought that might be a
problem, so I brought you this.

104
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,802
Your mucus was "pale goldenrod."

105
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,576
Last week, yes. Should I
be worried? Oh, yes. Very.

106
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,086
Really? I thought
it was okay now.

107
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,644
And yet, here you
are. What happened?

108
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,282
Paramedics took a week
to respond to your 911 call?

109
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,260
You're not a very
nice doctor, are you?

110
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,058
And you are very bad
at whatever it is you do.

111
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,430
You don't even know me. I
know you're gonna get fired.

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,596
That's why you got the new glasses.
That's why your teeth are sparkly white.

113
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,164
You're getting the most of your
health insurance while you still can.

114
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,668
I might be quitting.

115
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,021
If you were quitting, you'd
have known that last week when

116
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,306
your snot was still pale
goldenrod. You're getting fired.

117
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,580
I just don't like
being told what to do.

118
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,220
I can get you in for a full
body scan later this week.

119
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,785
Thanks.

120
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,299
<i>It's got to be viral. We should
start running gels and titers.</i>

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,464
Maybe we should look into the girlfriend's
theory. She thinks she rode him to death.

122
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,907
What'd you tell her?

123
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,445
I told her 22-year-old
men don't die of sex.

124
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,606
- What'd you ask her?
- What do you mean?

125
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,673
I mean, I hope you got some
specifics on exactly what was going on.

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,585
If the girl thinks it could kill
you, it's worth knowing about.

127
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,117
Have you ever taken a life?

128
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,637
We should stop the antibiotics.

129
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,664
It's too soon to say
they're not having an effect.

130
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,800
They're having an effect.

131
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,973
<i>His B. P. 's falling fast.
There's fluid filling his lungs.</i>

132
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,312
His creatinine is rising.

133
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,314
<i>His kidneys are shutting down.</i>

134
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:57,025
<i>Our treatment isn't making
him better. It's killing him.</i>

135
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,736
<i>So, we had six symptoms
that didn't add up</i>

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,432
<i>to anything. Now we
got seven. Who's excited?</i>

137
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,205
I don't think it
complicates things. The

138
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:09,169
kidney failure was
caused by the antibiotics.

139
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:13,907
- Maybe.
<i>- Typically, low blood pressure</i>
<i>and abdominal pain means an infection.</i>

140
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,882
An abdominal infection causes
sepsis, low blood pressure.

141
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,886
Except we checked
for abdominal infections.

142
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,967
But what if it's the other
way around? What if the

143
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,947
low blood pressure's
causing the abdominal pain?

144
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,081
Viral heart infection.
The intestines aren't

145
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,518
getting enough blood,
and the result is belly pain.

146
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,555
- I know it's not
the standard presentation.
- It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.

147
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,295
I thought that's what
we dealt with here.

148
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:41,035
It explains the cardiomyopathy,
the pain, the low B.P., the fever.

149
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,207
You read the book. Impressive.

150
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,978
<i>It's a ludicrously long
shot that explains every one</i>

151
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,776
<i>of those symptoms— except
for the cough and the rash.</i>

152
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,516
Should we just erase those?
Well, anything can cause a rash.

153
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,626
Okay. Cardiac infection.

154
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,065
- Cameron, you thought allergy.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

155
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,531
Chase, what was it
you thought? Carcinoid?

156
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,368
Then there's hypothyroidism.

157
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,240
<i>Could be parasites.</i>

158
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,081
Finally, sinus infection.

159
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,778
If you're gonna list all the things it
can't be, you're gonna need more colors.

160
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,187
Cameron was right. No condition
explains all these symptoms.

161
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:36,489
- But orange and green covers everything.
- Orange and green?

162
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,590
<i>Two conditions
contracted simultaneously?</i>

163
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,932
Occam's Razor. The simplest
explanation is always the best.

164
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,972
- And you think one is simpler than two?
- Pretty sure it is, yeah.

165
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,269
Baby shows up.
Chase tells you that two

166
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,969
people exchanged
fluids to create this being.

167
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,299
I tell you that one stork
dropped the little tyke off

168
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,643
in a diaper. Are you gonna
go with the two or the one?

169
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,346
- I think your argument is specious.
- I think your tie is ugly.

170
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,484
<i>Why is one simpler than two?
It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?</i>

171
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,653
Each one of these conditions
is about a thousand-to-one shot.

172
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,392
<i>That means that any two of them happening
at the same time is a million-to-one shot.</i>

173
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,299
Chase says the cardiac
infection is a 10 million-to-1 shot,

174
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,963
which makes my idea
10 times better than yours.

175
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,836
<i>Get a calculator.
Run the numbers.</i>

176
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,432
We'll run the tests.
<i>Tests take time.</i>

177
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,343
Treatment's quicker. Start the kid
on Unasyn for the sinus infection,

178
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:31,043
- and... what was orange?
<i>- Hypothyroidism.</i>

179
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:35,282
My uncle has
hypothyroidism. Not like this.

180
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,022
Intravenous
Levothyroxin is an artificial

181
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,985
thyroid medication that
should take care of it.

182
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,551
Also, the nurses are going to start you
on Unasyn. It's a more targeted antibiotic.

183
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,291
For the sinus infection? Yes.

184
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,028
- The other stuff is
for something else entirely.
- Bad luck, huh?

185
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,833
Don't worry. He should be
back to ditching work in no time.

186
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,305
Brandon?

187
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:01,478
Hey, Mom.

188
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,311
We're his parents.
How's he doing?

189
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,875
Um, Brandon is...

190
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,583
<i>Uh, Mom. Dad— This is Mindy.</i>

191
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:16,890
<i>I was gonna bring her home for
Christmas. Um, we're engaged.</i>

192
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,437
<i>Dr. Hall to the
recovery room. Dr. Hall—</i>

193
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,172
Did you tell the
family House's theory?

194
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:36,239
Two odd conditions striking completely
coincidentally at the exact same time?

195
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,309
I didn't phrase it quite that
way. They agree to treatment?

196
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,719
Of course they did. We're doctors.
They believe whatever we tell them.

197
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,452
So, is that our job?
House's puppets?

198
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,359
He comes up with an insane
idea, we get to pretend it's not?

199
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,592
His insane ideas are usually right.
We've been here long enough to...

200
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,876
We've been here long enough
to have Stockholm syndrome.

201
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,565
What, because we don't hate him?
He thinks outside the box. Is that so evil?

202
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,301
He has no idea where the box is.

203
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,820
If you guys think he's
right, go home. Relax.

204
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,039
Just wait for the
kid to get all better.

205
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,946
I'm going to the lab to
test for viral infections.

206
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,458
Negative for
Coxsackie "B" virus.

207
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,191
Seven down, about 5,000 to go.

208
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,473
You really think we're gonna
come up with your mystery

209
00:14:27,497 --> 00:14:29,565
virus just by running
gels till we guess it right?

210
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,133
<i>No. I think we're gonna do it by standing
around watching other people work.</i>

211
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,975
I'm waiting for the
Epstein-Barr virus.

212
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,779
- She's weird, isn't she?
- Bad idea.

213
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,185
- What?
- Bad idea. You work with her.

214
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,189
What did I say?

215
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:55,923
Is weird some new ghetto euphemism for
sexy, like bad is good and phat is good?

216
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,521
- Then what the hell does "good" mean?
- "Ghetto euphemism"?

217
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,830
You don't think she's hot?

218
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,699
No.

219
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,231
Wow. Then you're brilliant. And I
am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.

220
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,641
Obviously, the girl is hot. Y-You're
not talking about her aesthetics.

221
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,146
You're talking about if I
want to jump her. I don't.

222
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,273
Brilliant.

223
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,121
Your Epstein-Barr is ready.

224
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,094
What are you doing? Level four.

225
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,726
No, no. I mean— I know
what you meant. We're waiting.

226
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,169
My throat hurts. So you said.

227
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,732
How long are we waiting? Two minutes less
than when you asked me two minutes ago.

228
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:50,481
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.

229
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,215
Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. His
throat seems to have some condition.

230
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,356
Say "Ah." Ah.

231
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,490
He has a sore throat.

232
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,496
Of course. Yes, why didn't I...

233
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,514
I mean, because he
said that it hurt, and I

234
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,506
should have deduced
that meant it was sore.

235
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,065
I was in a board meeting.
Patients come first, right?

236
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,854
Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if
there's any doubt about its efficacy, huh?

237
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:23,043
You once asked me why I think I'm always
right, and I realized that you're right.

238
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,244
At least, I think you're right.
I don't really know, now do I?

239
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,822
- Hey. I'm here.
- Go home. Drink some hot tea.

240
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,858
Excellent counsel.

241
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,265
Negative on parvovirus B-19.

242
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,499
I'm impressed. Thank
you. I was born to run gels.

243
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,700
I meant about Chase.
What about Chase?

244
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,436
Well, the man has no
physical interest in you.

245
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,351
<i>He has a completely
professional relationship with</i>

246
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,008
<i>you, respects you as a
colleague and a doctor.</i>

247
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,078
And yet, he can't look at
you without thinking sex.

248
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,089
Because I asked what
kind of sex could kill you?

249
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,786
You now have total control
over your relationship with him.

250
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,980
So, a woman can't
express her interest in sex

251
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,195
without it being some
professional power play?

252
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,100
<i>No. If you look the way you
do and you say what you said,</i>

253
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,070
you have to be aware of the
effect that it's going to have on men.

254
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,472
- Men should grow up.
- Yeah, and dogs should stop
licking themselves.

255
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,135
<i>It's not gonna happen.</i>
What's going on?

256
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,137
- Yeah, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you guys.

257
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,359
- Why didn't you page us?
- 'Cause I knew you'd be here.

258
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,477
Who told him? <i>No one.</i>

259
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,763
I assume you're trying to
prove my crazy, two-illness

260
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,149
theory wrong, so, obviously,
you're gonna be in the lab.

261
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,249
- You spin the urine?
- Not yet.

262
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,851
Talk to me when you have.

263
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,496
What'd you find out? Kidney
failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.

264
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:59,808
- I wonder if that's significant.
- It means the antibiotics
didn't cause the kidney failure.

265
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,814
How'd you know?

266
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,559
If you guys hadn't been
so busy trying to prove

267
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,394
me wrong, you might've
checked in on the poor kid.

268
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,717
<i>You</i> visited a patient?

269
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,849
I was sitting by his bed all morning, just
so he'd know someone was there for him.

270
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,722
I looked in on him.
He's much better.

271
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,729
Ergo, the treatment's working.
Ergo, me right, you wrong.

272
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,163
Hey, I'm glad for the kid.

273
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,136
That smugness of yours really
is an attractive quality. Thank you.

274
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,039
It was either that
or get my hair

275
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,540
highlighted. Smugness
is easier to maintain.

276
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,655
I get that you're not a big believer in
the "catching flies with honey" approach,

277
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,172
but do you honestly think you'll
collect a jarful by cleverly taunting them?

278
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,083
Flies, no. Doctors, sure.
If I'd said to Foreman,

279
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,801
"Nice try. Great
guess, but sorry, not this

280
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:43,732
time," what do you think
he'd be doing right now?

281
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:48,091
I think he'd go home not feeling
like a piece of crap. Exactly.

282
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,824
You want him to feel like a piece of
crap? No. I don't want him going home.

283
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,665
Dr. Foreman.

284
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,072
Still have the cough. I'm
feeling a lot better though.

285
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,305
His fever is gone.
His rash is going away.

286
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,372
I see. Is everything okay?

287
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,283
Just ordering some tests.
Absolutely nothing to worry about.

288
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:35,271
- How much longer?
- 9:30. I figure she was on
the eighth hole when I paged her.

289
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,778
You probably got
another half hour.

290
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,708
I ran a T.S.H., T3 and
T4. The patient's negative

291
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,592
for hypothyroidism. I'm
not talking about you.

292
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,686
<i>The fact that he's getting better would
indicate the unreliability of the tests.</i>

293
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,755
If I'm right and it's a viral infection,
one of two things always happen:

294
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,325
the patient dies, or the patient's
immune system fights off the invader.

295
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,303
What's with her?

296
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,365
Her leg hurts after running six
miles. Who knows? Could be anything.

297
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,238
He's getting better.
That doesn't prove you're

298
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:13,002
right. That just proves
he's getting better.

299
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,475
It-It's not two illnesses.
It can't be two illnesses.

300
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,418
I am so glad you work here.

301
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:24,150
If I'm right, the antibiotics
you prescribed...

302
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,387
could box his kidneys and liver, impeding
his ability to fight off the virus.

303
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,626
- It could kill him.
- Well, that certainly would be a concern.

304
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,428
Fifty bucks?

305
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,197
Don't look away. The space
monkeys will be all over you.

306
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,915
- You wanna bet on the patient's health?
- You think that's bad luck?

307
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:44,570
<i>You think that God will smite
him because of our insensitivity?</i>

308
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,044
Well, if God does,
you make a quick 50.

309
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,776
- Oh.
- Go check his white blood count.

310
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,017
If he's fighting off a virus
like you think, it'll be way up.

311
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:07,061
Hey. Cuddy said you needed
a consult. What's up? I'm busy.

312
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,002
Oh!

313
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,675
- I was just being glib.
- You haven't said anything.

314
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,868
No. Before, when I was
talking about Brandon's

315
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:32,555
girlfriend thinking
sex could kill you.

316
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,924
<i>I was just making a joke
because I was uncomfortable.</i>

317
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,862
Oh, I don't even remember what
you said. I'm uncomfortable about sex.

318
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:44,363
- Well, we don't have to talk about this.
- Sex could kill you.

319
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,531
Do you know what the human body
goes through when you have sex?

320
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,098
Pupils dilate.
Arteries constrict.

321
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,203
Core temperature rises, heart
races, blood pressure skyrockets.

322
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,579
Respiration becomes
rapid and shallow.

323
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,983
The brain fires bursts of electrical
impulses from nowhere to nowhere.

324
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,850
Secretions spit
out of every gland,

325
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:06,086
and the muscles tense and spasm like you're
lifting three times your body weight.

326
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,823
It's violent, it's
ugly, and it's messy.

327
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,825
And if God hadn't
made it unbelievably fun,

328
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,733
the human race would've
died out eons ago.

329
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,297
Men are lucky they can
only have one orgasm.

330
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:26,402
You know that women can
have an hour-long orgasm?

331
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,470
Hey, Foreman. What's up?

332
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,778
- Hey, Foreman.
- Hey.

333
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:37,018
- White cell count isn't up, is it?
- No. We were both wrong.

334
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,253
<i>White cell count is down—
Way down— and dropping.</i>

335
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,819
His immune system is shot. We
need to get him into a clean room.

336
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,828
Can you walk, Brandon?

337
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,897
Yeah. A little.

338
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:59,435
Okay. 'Cause we'll need to
leave the chair outside. Thank you.

339
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,140
Where's April? April?

340
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:07,050
Can you take that chair,
please? Thank you. Yes, Robert.

341
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,453
I'll need to take your, um—
Your mask and your robe too.

342
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,926
You might wanna block your
ears for this, it's quite loud.

343
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,673
Something's made him
immuno-compromised.

344
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:39,242
His white blood cell count is down, which
means his body can't fight off infections.

345
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:43,653
If he gets sick, he'll
die. Sick? How sick?

346
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,385
<i>If he gets a cold, he'll die.</i>

347
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:02,506
Okay. I'm gonna push the needle into
your hip bone and take some of the marrow.

348
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,945
That's not so bad.

349
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,450
Uh-uh. That was
just the anesthetic.

350
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:16,182
The core biopsy
needle, it's a bit bigger.

351
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:21,421
Hey, man. Take a deep breath.
This-This is gonna hurt... a lot.

352
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,300
Your marrow makes
the blood cells.

353
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,504
We take a peek at it
under a microscope,

354
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,567
<i>and maybe we
find a viral infection.</i>

355
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,670
<i>Maybe we find some fibrosis.</i>

356
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:44,740
Something to explain why
your blood count is so low.

357
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,686
There we go.

358
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,419
One step closer to an answer.

359
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,483
If you don't find one,

360
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,922
I can't stay here forever.

361
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,299
<i>- The patient could've died.</i>
- The one with the pulled muscle?

362
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:15,212
Those symptoms are consistent
with a dozen other conditions.

363
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,226
- I'm entitled to a consult.
- You are not getting out of clinic duty.

364
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,881
Come on. You got a hundred other
idiot doctors in this building who go...

365
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,844
all warm and fuzzy
every time they pull a toy

366
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,653
car out of a nose—
You don't need me here.

367
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,889
No, I don't. But working with people
actually makes you a better doctor.

368
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:33,242
When did I sign up for that course? When
did I give you the impression that I care?

369
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,064
Working in this clinic obviously
instills a deep sense of compassion.

370
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:42,632
I've got your home number, right? In case
anything comes up at 3:00 in the morning.

371
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,337
It's not gonna work.
You know why?

372
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,903
Because this is fun.

373
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,886
You think of something
to make me miserable.

374
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,883
I think of something to
make you miserable...

375
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,147
It's a game, and I'm
gonna win because I

376
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:56,615
got a head start. You
are already miserable.

377
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,493
Uh— Is this important?

378
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,496
Uh, no. Good.

379
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,433
What's with you and her? Don't.

380
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,712
You have a thing for her? The
only people who can get to you...

381
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,898
No. There is not a thin
line between love and hate.

382
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,530
There is, in fact, a Great
Wall of China, with armed

383
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:18,137
sentries posted every 20
feet between love and hate.

384
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,543
Thirty-six Vicodin.
Who's the patient?

385
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,444
I am. You can't...

386
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,006
Dr. Wilson is the
prescribing physician. Yeah.

387
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,012
You will lie, cheat and
steal to get what you

388
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,249
want, but you're incapable
of kissing a little ass?

389
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,256
We all have our limitations.

390
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:35,556
House? Wrong
bottle. Do me a favor.

391
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,044
Take one of these,
wait five minutes for it

392
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,622
to kick in, then find
Cuddy and kiss her ass.

393
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:45,294
What was the
kid's first symptom?

394
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,863
You did the history. Of his 800
symptoms, which one hit him first?

395
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,876
Uh, the cough.

396
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,564
Gout.

397
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,033
Um, are we talking
about Brandon? <i>Gout?</i>

398
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,041
Uric acid crystals
in the joints?

399
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,700
The symptoms are
pain, swelling, redness,

400
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:35,979
stiffness. Not one of which
do I see on that board.

401
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,347
Because he doesn't have gout.

402
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,019
Every day, cells die.

403
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,483
<i>We survive because the remaining
cells divide and replace the losses.</i>

404
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:56,663
<i>The colchicine, a gout medicine,
blocks mitosis and stops cell division,</i>

405
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:01,238
which will result in
abdominal pain, rash,

406
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,971
nausea, fever, kidney
failure, low blood pressure...

407
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,070
and will also mess
with the bone marrow.

408
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,358
But he doesn't have gout. Why
would he have gout medication?

409
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:13,841
Because you guys were right. He didn't
have two conditions at the exact same time.

410
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,378
First, he got a cough. And because
he's an idiot, he went to a doctor.

411
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,293
In order to justify
charging $200, that

412
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:21,416
doctor felt he should
actually do something.

413
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,156
Oops. He wrote a prescription.

414
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,064
Seven thousand people die each
year from pharmacy screw-ups.

415
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,068
Not nearly as many as
die from doctor screw-ups,

416
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,764
<i>but still, not something they
use in their promotional materials.</i>

417
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:36,331
The pharmacist gave him gout
medicine instead of cough medicine.

418
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,570
And the only
thing it wouldn't do,

419
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:42,638
it would do absolutely
nothing to relieve his cough.

420
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,740
Occam's Razor...

421
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:48,617
The simplest explanation is almost
always that somebody screwed up.

422
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,681
But once he checked into this
hospital, he was completely in our control.

423
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,920
Our food, our
pills, our everything.

424
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,656
<i>So even if you’re right,
no more gout medication.</i>

425
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,722
<i>He'd either continue to deteriorate,
or he would've gotten better.</i>

426
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,633
But he got better,
and then he got worse.

427
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,171
It doesn't fit. It
doesn't make sense.

428
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:09,231
Okay. Two people screwed up.

429
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,834
Not as simple as one, but...

430
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,016
He's resting. He's—
I'm Dr. House.

431
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,083
I'm your son's physician. Oh.
You're the one we haven't met yet.

432
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,564
You're the one he hasn't met. How can
you treat someone without meeting them?

433
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,795
It's easy if you don't
give a crap about him.

434
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,359
That's a good thing.

435
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:42,841
If emotions made you act rationally, well,
they wouldn't be called emotions, right?

436
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:46,743
That's why we have this nice division of
labor. You hold his hand, I get him better.

437
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,524
If I start tucking him in at night,
well, that's not fair to you guys.

438
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,026
And if you start prescribing
medicine, well, that's not fair to me.

439
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,782
So, what I wanna know is, who
stepped on my side of the net?

440
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,724
Who cared enough to get stupid
enough to give him his cough medicine?

441
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,727
When we checked
in, Dr. Foreman...

442
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,788
Tuesday, he's getting better.
Wednesday, he's getting sick again.

443
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,563
Somebody gave him his
cough medicine Wednesday.

444
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,466
Come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.

445
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,035
I just wanna know
who tried to kill the kid.

446
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,510
- Dr. House, maybe we
should— - His throat was sore.

447
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,858
Page Dr. Occam. He's gonna
wanna hear about this. I'm sorry.

448
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:40,092
He was coughing, and I just
wanted to help him— Aren't you a dear.

449
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:44,034
Where are the pills? He took the last of
'em before he was switched into that room.

450
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,813
<i>They're all gone?</i> It
was just cough medicine.

451
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,466
No, it wasn't.
Where's the bottle?

452
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,512
We need to know exactly
what you put in this bottle.

453
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,519
We think it was colchicine,
a gout medication.

454
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,579
If the prescription said cough
medicine, that's what I dispensed.

455
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,818
The family is prepared
to waive liability, all right?

456
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:11,057
We just need to know what it was, what
dosage it was— It was cough medicine.

457
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,621
Refill it.

458
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,402
He's gonna be okay.
You don't know that.

459
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,799
Does Brandon like
that quality in you?

460
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,038
You're a little negative.

461
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,250
Things don't always work out for
the best. Doesn't hurt to hope they do.

462
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,613
No. Not unless that
makes you figure you can do

463
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:38,154
whatever you want, like
give people cough medicine.

464
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:44,052
This is cough medication. This is
what Brandon was supposed to get.

465
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,826
They're small, round and yellow.

466
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,066
Can you tell this man
what the pills in your

467
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,233
son's medicine bottle
actually looked like?

468
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,167
They were small, round
and yellow, exactly like this.

469
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,403
Those were the pills
that Brandon was taking.

470
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:03,575
Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know
what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.

471
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,086
<i>It was so perfect.
It was beautiful.</i>

472
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,320
Beauty often seduces
us on the road to truth.

473
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,828
And triteness
kicks us in the nads.

474
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:22,061
So true. This
doesn't bother you?

475
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,467
That you were wrong? I
try to work through the pain.

476
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:30,532
I was not wrong. Everything I
said was true. It fit. It was elegant.

477
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:36,276
- So, reality was wrong?
- Reality's almost always wrong.

478
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,451
The cough medicine
did something.

479
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,221
Aggravated the condition.

480
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,353
<i>It's all over the place.
Must be in his blood.</i>

481
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,160
- What if it is his blood?
- Lymphoma?

482
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,565
Unless you've got
something better.

483
00:33:56,635 --> 00:34:00,128
We foolishly ruled out lymphoma because
his C.T. scan showed no adenopathy,

484
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:04,905
C.B.C. showed a normal differen-smear,
bone marrow showed no— Screw the tests.

485
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,878
Do an exploratory laparotomy
and find out what's in there.

486
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:12,646
He has no blood pressure, no immune system
and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him.

487
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,745
Yeah, you're right. Let's
stick with the wrong pill theory.

488
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:24,093
I'll schedule him for surgery.

489
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,263
Okay, Brandon, we're running
this tube through your heart...

490
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,431
and into the pulmonary
arteries in your lungs.

491
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,423
The sensors will
give us information we

492
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,586
need for the exploratory
surgery later this afternoon.

493
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,314
- My fingers are numb.
- Try not to move.

494
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:50,651
We're in the right atrium, trying to
catch the flow through the tricuspid valve.

495
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,419
I think the catheter's
curling in the atrium.

496
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,952
Got it. We're in the R.V. now.

497
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,658
Ectopy.

498
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,134
<i>- You must've irritated the heart wall.</i>
- It'll calm down.

499
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,310
<i>He can't tolerate any
cardiac arrhythmia. Pull back.</i>

500
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:07,334
He needs the surgery.

501
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:22,244
Pressure's dropped.

502
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
- You still with us, Brandon?
- Get the curtains.

503
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,551
V.F.

504
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:40,235
Charging. Clear.

505
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,738
Sinus rhythm.

506
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,475
I got a pulse.

507
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,716
Yeah, but no surgery today.

508
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:05,922
- How're you doing?
- Okay.

509
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,330
Great. I'm doing good too.

510
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,734
I get to knock off an hour
early today. You know why?

511
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:15,570
Because I kissed my boss's
ass. Do you ever do that?

512
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,352
I think she just said yes 'cause
she wants to reinforce that behavior.

513
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,040
Wants me to kiss a lot of other people's
ass, like she wants me to kiss yours.

514
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:26,278
<i>What would you want? A doctor
who holds your hand while you die,</i>

515
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,786
or a doctor who ignores
you while you get better?

516
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,790
I guess it would particularly suck to have
a doctor who ignores you while you die.

517
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,788
- I should go.
- You think it's gonna come out on its own?

518
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,532
Are we talking bigger
than a breadbasket?

519
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,471
Because, actually, it
will come out on its own.

520
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,897
Which for small stuff
is no problem. It's

521
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:53,535
wrapped up in a nice,
soft package, and plop.

522
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,443
Big stuff, you're
gonna rip something,

523
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,210
which, speaking medically, is
when the fun stops. How did you...

524
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:02,311
You've been here half an hour, you haven't
sat down. That tells me its location.

525
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,551
<i>You haven't told me what it
is. That tells me it's humiliating.</i>

526
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,517
<i>You have a little birdie
carved on your arm. That</i>

527
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,537
<i>tells me you have a high
tolerance for humiliation.</i>

528
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,929
So I figure it's
not hemorrhoids.

529
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,567
I've been a doctor 20 years.
You're not gonna surprise me.

530
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,839
It's an MP3 player.

531
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,943
Mm.

532
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:37,853
Is it—Is it because of
the size, or the shape,

533
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,653
or is it the pounding bass line?

534
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,422
What are we gonna do?

535
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,099
- I'm gonna wait.
- For what?

536
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,431
Okay. It's 3:00. I'm off.

537
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,839
Would you tell Dr. Cuddy there's a patient
in Exam Room Two needs her attention?

538
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,072
And the R.I.A.A. wants her
to check for illegal downloads.

539
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,838
Brandon's not ready
for surgery. Okay.

540
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,075
Let's leave it a couple of
weeks. He should be feeling

541
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:08,080
better by then. Oh, wait.
Which way does time go?

542
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,487
He crashed during prep. He's
also experiencing pain in his fingers.

543
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,548
Think some bug may have
gotten in the clean room.

544
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,897
I think we should double
his dosage of G-CSF to

545
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,120
temporarily boost his
white blood cell count.

546
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:22,133
Pain in his fingers. Right.

547
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,710
Hi again. He can't...

548
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,770
Where's he going?

549
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,043
Hey. How you all doing?

550
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:43,578
Interesting fact. Every seven years, it's a
whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?

551
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:47,319
Dr. House, this is a clean
room. Yeah. I read the sign.

552
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:52,092
But cells of different organs
reproduce at different rates.

553
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,656
So, you get a new
kidney every three years.

554
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,066
<i>Get a new stomach
lining every week.</i>

555
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:02,369
This is why colchicine poisoning causes
all these symptoms, but not all at once.

556
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,932
But we went to the
pharmacy. We saw the pills.

557
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,002
Colchicine does its damage
in a very specific order.

558
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,254
First of all, there's the
pain in the abdomen, the

559
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:12,346
rash, the fever. Isn't
that what you got first?

560
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:16,878
Then the kidneys go, which
is exactly what happened to...

561
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,856
- Brandon.
- Right.

562
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:23,952
Then it screws up your bone
marrow, and then neuropathy.

563
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,556
A painful tingling in
the fingers and toes.

564
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,192
And what do you suppose
happens after that?

565
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,040
Hair loss. The bad news is...

566
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,546
your special boy is
doing drugs. No, he's not.

567
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:44,082
Ecstasy? No.

568
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:49,143
- Twice with Dan and Mike.
- You know what they cut that stuff with?

569
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,468
Apparently, colchicine.
Unless you ingested the

570
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:53,715
colchicine through your
contact lens solution,

571
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,488
or skin cream or some
other drug you're lying about.

572
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:01,431
<i>I don't know how it happened. I don't care
how it happened. It happened. Start, uh—</i>

573
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,992
- Brandon.
- Lovely name.

574
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,234
<i>Start Brandon on FA B fragments, and get
him some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out.</i>

575
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,469
And get some air in here.

576
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,907
Make a note. I should
never doubt myself.

577
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,916
I think you'll remember.
You know, it wouldn't

578
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,644
hurt you to be wrong
every now and then.

579
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,084
What, you don't care
about these people?

580
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:30,559
The colchicine interferes with the
ability of the heart muscle to contract,

581
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,462
<i>pumping blood, lowering
your blood pressure.</i>

582
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,295
<i>The antibodies we're giving you
should neutralize the colchicine,</i>

583
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,772
<i>allowing your heart to
beat at its normal rate.</i>

584
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,111
When will you know?

585
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,115
We know now.

586
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,113
Thank God.

587
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,121
Mmm.

588
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:21,145
Big weekend? It's not
for me. I'm fully stocked.

589
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:25,673
- Cuddy got you doing inventory?
- Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.

590
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,413
The gout medicine O.D.? Yeah.

591
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,263
The fact that I know
it's a gout medicine O.D.

592
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,932
would indicate the
case is already solved.

593
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,891
Well, you'd be wrong.

594
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:38,794
What about the fact that the kid is now—I
believe the technical term is— "not sick"?

595
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,241
You know how many forms of
colchicine there are on the market?

596
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,734
- Stop it.
- Neither do I. But it's a lot.

597
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,999
<i>Pills, powders,
liquids, I. V. fluids.</i>

598
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:51,236
Somewhere at a party, in his coffee,
up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.

599
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,210
You're not happy with
your Ecstasy theory?

600
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,610
- He said he used it twice.
- People lie.

601
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,925
- If you're gonna lie, it's— - You
know what? I'm not interested.

602
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:02,216
- Not curious?
- No. Because I'm well-adjusted.

603
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,085
Right.

604
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,391
Temperature's normal. I
want cousin Sharon there.

605
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,692
If we invite Sharon, we
have to invite all the cousins.

606
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,962
So what? My side of the
family doesn't need anything.

607
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:23,931
I don't suppose I could have some of those
cough pills, huh? They're okay, right?

608
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,477
- Yes. You're doing great.
- You should invite Dr. House.

609
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,412
- Will he come?
- No. But he'll send a gift.

610
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,972
I'll make sure it's a good one.

611
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,714
There's a letter on
the back of these pills.

612
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,053
Your old pills didn't
have a letter on them?

613
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,423
No. Round and
yellow, but no letter.

614
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:52,666
Well, these will
help your cough.

615
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,502
Hey, you wanna go get some— No.

616
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,703
That's some bad hat, Harry.
