1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,869
He is not sick.

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,667
Dr. Riley is throwing up.
He obviously can't lecture.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,732
You witnessed the spew? Or
you just have his word for it?

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,540
I think I'm coming
down with a little bit of

5
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:12,439
the clap. I may have to
go home for a few days.

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,607
Dr. Riley doesn't have
a history of lying to me.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,617
You said this is the fifth time
he's missed a class this year.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,121
- Either he's dying or he's lying.
- I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,022
Fine. I'll have Cameron do it.
She loves inspiring the inspired.

10
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,289
<i>- You'll</i> do it.
- Why is it always me?

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,297
Because the world hates you. Or
because it's a class on diagnostics.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,856
Pick whichever reason
feeds your narcissism better.

13
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,959
I'm not doing it.

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,112
You're supposed to
stop me. Renegotiate.

15
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,414
And you were supposed
to keep on walking.

16
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,046
Sorry. Guess we both
screwed up. Go on. Do it again.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,821
I'll do the lecture for
four hours off clinic.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,124
Two. I know you'd rather
spend a couple of hours...

19
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,892
listening to yourself
than listening to patients.

20
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,833
Class starts in 20 minutes.

21
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,601
<i>- Dr. House, there's a patient.</i>
- I'm outta here. Take it up with Cuddy.

22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,610
<i>Greg.</i>

23
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,251
Hi, Stacy.

24
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,787
How ya doin'?

25
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,413
How am I doing?

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,355
The last five years
have been like...

27
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,192
You ever see those
<i>Girls Gone Wild</i> videos?

28
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,825
Your life's been like that? Or your
life's been spent watching them?

29
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,765
I have missed you.

30
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,203
Is that why you're here?

31
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:58,213
I need your help.

32
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,728
Who am I looking at? My husband.

33
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,964
Who is suffering abdominal
pain and fainting spells.

34
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,736
No sign of tumors,
no vasculitis.

35
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,573
Could be indigestion.

36
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:29,743
Or maybe a kidney stone.
Little one can pack a lot of wallop.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,717
Did you think I wasn't
going to get married?

38
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:35,620
Not to someone
so poorly endowed.

39
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,920
This guy's pancreas is pathetic.

40
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,829
There is no kidney
stone, no indigestion.

41
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,335
Three hospitals, five doctors—
Not one of them found anything.

42
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,394
Maybe there's
nothing to be found.

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,032
Right. You suddenly trust doctors,
love puppies and long walks in the rain.

44
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,099
Walks are out.

45
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,544
I was around you long enough to
know when something's not right.

46
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,482
Mark's had personality changes.
He's acting strange, disconnected.

47
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,485
Interesting.

48
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,216
Means there's either a neurological
component, or he's having an affair.

49
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,724
No affair. No
nothing. He's sick.

50
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,258
I know you're not too busy.
You avoid work like the plague.

51
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,924
Unless it actually
<i>is</i> the plague.

52
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,936
I'm asking you a
favor. I'm not too busy.

53
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,065
But I'm not sure
I want him to live.

54
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,103
It's good seeing you again.

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,492
Three guys walk into a clinic.

56
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,265
Their legs hurt. What's
wrong with them?

57
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,709
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

58
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,871
The most likely cause of
leg pain is muscle strain.

59
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,710
Apply heat and
rest affected areas.

60
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,274
Statistically, you're
right. Very good.

61
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,219
<i>My experience, over half of
leg pain is musculoskeletal,</i>

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,415
generally from
excessive exercise,

63
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,358
<i>Twelve percent is varicose
veins brought on by pregnancy,</i>

64
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,590
<i>and most of the rest is the
result of vehicular accidents.</i>

65
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,633
I said three people.
That's six legs.

66
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,880
So you've got three
hurt jogging, two in

67
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:04,330
collisions, and one
of the legs is pregnant.

68
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,397
What were they doing
when pain presented?

69
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,414
I have no idea.

70
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,933
You didn't ask? You
didn't take a history?

71
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:15,312
Of course. But all that told
us is what they said happened.

72
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,285
Person "A," farmer, says
he was fixing a fence.

73
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,522
<i>Tightness in the ankle,
loss of muscle control.</i>

74
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,859
Person "B," volleyball practice.

75
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,465
<i>Coach figured it
was a pulled muscle.</i>

76
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,304
And "C," we've got
Carmen Electra golfing.

77
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,211
- Yes!
- Whoa. You treated the <i>Baywatch</i> chick?

78
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,080
The <i>Baywatch</i> thespian. And no.

79
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,881
I gotta disguise the identity
of each of the patients,

80
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,047
<i>and I got tired of using
the middle-aged man.</i>

81
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,421
Carmen seemed like
a pleasant alternative.

82
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,517
Also, she's apparently
quite the golfer.

83
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,087
<i>In less than two hours,
one of these three...</i>

84
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,692
will be tossed out of the hospital because
they were faking it to score narcotics,

85
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,671
<i>and one will be
very close to death.</i>

86
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,573
Any guesses on which is which?

87
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,841
Okay, I say we
start with the farmer.

88
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,341
<i>Did you hike to the
fence, and how far?</i>

89
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,411
Yes. It's about a half a
mile from my farmhouse.

90
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,423
Where is the pain localized?

91
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,654
It started just above my
ankle, and it's radiating up.

92
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,094
So, what should we do first?

93
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,097
Family history?

94
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,224
Indicative of leg pain?
That's a very short list.

95
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,102
Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis
imperfecta or multiple myeloma?

96
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,072
Could be a blood issue.

97
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,668
We should run a C.B.C. and
a D-Dimer. And get an M.R.I.

98
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,509
M.R.I. or a PET scan? If the
problem's vascular, he's better off...

99
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,348
Sorry. Thanks for playin'.
Patient's dead. You killed him.

100
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,798
We had no time to run any tests.
There was nothing we could do.

101
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,382
You had time to look at the leg.

102
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,395
<i>I thought we were starting
with the farmer's case first.</i>

103
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,698
We are. But if we're
gonna look at a leg...

104
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,830
I need you to
take off your pants.

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,462
Puncture.

106
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,447
<i>Snakebite.</i> That
would be my guess.

107
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,883
Farmer didn't know he'd been
bitten by a snake? <i>That's what he said.</i>

108
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,503
Sudden shooting pain, tall
grass. Never saw a thing.

109
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,791
- What kind of snake?
- You want me to tell you what kind of snake
it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?

110
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,345
How are we to know
what kind of antivenom to

111
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,994
use if we don't know
what kind of snake it is?

112
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,954
Oh, there are people
to find those things out.

113
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,718
Shouldn't we wait for the
Humane Society or something?

114
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,454
Guy might only have
a couple of hours.

115
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,697
And while we wait for the
Humane Society to show up,

116
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,330
what say we check in
on the volleyball player.

117
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,167
You have tendinitis.

118
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,303
<i>How old is this person?</i>

119
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,043
I mean, it's not really a 40-year-old
man on a girls' volleyball team, right?

120
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,381
It's a leg. A leg
is a leg is a leg.

121
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,047
- Well, I was just
worried that— - Would

122
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,853
you worry about her
more if she was younger?

123
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,822
<i>Obviously, we should care about
all our patients, no matter what age—</i>

124
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,125
Yeah, right. I saw the way
you were looking at Carmen.

125
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,791
<i>She's mine. Stay away.</i>

126
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,270
- Would you operate on your mother?
- Of course not.

127
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,897
I'd be too nervous.
Couldn't be objective.

128
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,637
Then why are you so anxious to
treat every patient like they're family?

129
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,908
<i>The actual patient is 1 6.</i>

130
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,245
Here's what happens
when doctors care too much.

131
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,851
I need to know
everything about you.

132
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,889
<i>I went back three generations.</i>

133
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,717
<i>No history of cancer, Parkinson's
or any other degenerative condition.</i>

134
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,304
But there's this boy at school, and
he's on the boys' volleyball team.

135
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,540
They made out at a party,
and now he won't call her back.

136
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,331
And this friend of hers at school said
this boy didn't like her and never did.

137
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,666
You got all this from an
examination of the knee?

138
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,933
I think she's depressed.
She doesn't have tendinitis?

139
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,217
She has tendinitis. She's
depressed about having tendinitis?

140
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,553
She's depressed for the same reason
that she has tendinitis. Not the boy?

141
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,741
No, the boy's a jerk. She knows
that, and yet she's depressed.

142
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,908
I found a nodule.

143
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,147
Ahh. Problems with the thyroid
gland— Causes depressed mental state...

144
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,519
can cause inflammation
of the tendons.

145
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,058
I'll run the tests.

146
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,856
<i>So because she took
such an extreme interest,</i>

147
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,420
she found out that the
person had a thyroid condition.

148
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:01,901
No. Because she took such an
interest, she discovered a tiny nodule...

149
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,030
which in reality signified
nothing but gave us no choice...

150
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:10,237
but to put a person with tendinitis
through an expensive and painful test.

151
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,048
Here's how a well-adjusted
doctor handles a case.

152
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,090
Can I put my pants back
on now? I'd rather you didn't.

153
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,655
<i>Which Carmen Electra is this?</i>

154
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,099
The first one. The golfer.

155
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,263
Then why isn't
she wearing pants?

156
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:42,139
You have decreased
reflexes in your patellar tendon.

157
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,507
- Anyone?
- Slipped disc.

158
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,411
Could be. How bad does it hurt?

159
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,973
- It hurts really, really bad.
- Yeah?

160
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,281
It doesn't seem real.
Is she the one faking?

161
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,603
Oh, for God's sake.
She's here to play into

162
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:57,848
my fantasy, not 'cause
she's Meryl Streep.

163
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,656
Fine.

164
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,756
What the hell is wrong with me!

165
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,666
Do something!

166
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:12,502
<i>Too much pain to be a slipped disc. Could
be herniated and impinging the nerve root.</i>

167
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,803
<i>Or it could be referred
pain from his groin.</i>

168
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,811
<i>Sir, are you getting
pain anywhere else?</i>

169
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,371
- He's curling. It's not the back.
- Sir, where are you getting pain?

170
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,112
<i>- Help me!</i>
- He's not gonna tell us anything
if we don't get him out of pain.

171
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,520
- Give him 50 milligrams of Demerol.
- We have no history. He could be allergic.

172
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,354
- What do I do?
- We can't diagnose him while he screams.

173
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,054
Better than killing him
with painkillers. That...

174
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,464
Apparently he's not allergic.

175
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,141
Thank you. I feel
a lot better now.

176
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,716
We screwed up.

177
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,719
No. You did exactly
what his attending did.

178
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,255
<i>And that was the proper
way to handle the case?</i> Yeah.

179
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,348
The guy used him as a dealer.

180
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,223
You're gonna see a lot of
drug-seeking behavior in your practice.

181
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,228
There's a reason—It works.

182
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,062
Meanwhile, back on the farm...

183
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,401
Yeah. Timber rattlesnake.

184
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,103
<i>Four vials of the
CroFab antivenom.</i>

185
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,373
- Hey, how ya doin'?
- All right.

186
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:30,907
Thank you. This will start
making you feel better really fast.

187
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,192
<i>- He's having an allergic reaction.
- Bag.</i>

188
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,958
Paddles and epi.

189
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,365
<i>His heart's fine.</i> It's
not gonna stay that way.

190
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,598
Paddles!

191
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,404
What say we take five,

192
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,245
get some coffee, go pee.

193
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,919
You didn't think she
was gonna get married?

194
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,554
She asked me the same question.

195
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,197
And... what? You're
not gonna treat him?

196
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,332
There's probably
nothing wrong with him.

197
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:32,004
Oh, sure, that makes sense. She's
just using the old sick husband routine...

198
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,445
as an excuse to get
back in touch with you.

199
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,983
<i>You think this is easy for her?</i>

200
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,986
The only reason she'd be anywhere
near you is if she was desperate.

201
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,682
So I should help her
because she hates me?

202
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,884
She doesn't hate
you. She loves you.

203
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,693
She just... can't stand
to be around you.

204
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,369
Uh, Dr. House?

205
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,962
It's been almost six minutes.

206
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,848
Found him.

207
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,241
<i>The volleyball player...</i>

208
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,223
was responding to the anti-inflammatories
as you'd expect in a case of tendinitis.

209
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,989
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the snakebite guy?

210
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,428
I don't really care about
the volleyball player.

211
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,763
What if I told you the volleyball
player had a sudden massive stroke?

212
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,668
- Really?
- No.

213
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,367
But that would make you interested,
right? What if her T-4 came back low?

214
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,604
<i>It's not quite as interesting, but
it has the benefit of being true.</i>

215
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,408
You said the thyroid
biopsy was a wasted test.

216
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,809
No, I didn't. I said
she put a person with

217
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,578
tendinitis through an
expensive and painful test.

218
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,179
<i>Apparently, the patient had
tendinitis</i> and <i>a thyroid condition.</i>

219
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:53,317
We're gonna start you on thyroxine. It'll
make you feel better and level your moods.

220
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,463
Thank you.

221
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,040
<i>- So that's it?</i>
- You were right the first time.

222
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,605
<i>Snakebite guy's way more
interesting. Gross, actually.</i>

223
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,485
<i>The patient responded
to epinephrine,</i>

224
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,382
<i>and the allergic
reaction was arrested.</i>

225
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,981
<i>Unfortunately, the patient
continues to deteriorate.</i>

226
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,959
<i>Maybe the snake wrangler was
wrong about the type we caught.</i>

227
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,658
He faxed us the venom test.
Confirmed. It's a timber rattlesnake.

228
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,566
No, it's not. Notice the volume?

229
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,709
I skimmed over that
and the gender and the

230
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,130
coloring. Jumped right
to the name of the snake.

231
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:44,940
Two hundred milligrams. Our
guy got bit less than four hours ago.

232
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,675
There's no way a snake regenerates
that much venom that quickly.

233
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,912
- We're supposed to know how fast
snakes make their venom?
- No.

234
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,498
Unless you've got a
patient bit by one. Then

235
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,945
it might be helpful. So
what do we do now?

236
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:01,461
He must have been bitten by a
different snake. We go back and find it.

237
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,959
Or you go online, and
you find there's only

238
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:04,473
three poisonous snakes
common in New Jersey:

239
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,966
the copperhead, timber
rattler and the coral.

240
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:11,027
Copperhead and timber rattler both
respond to the antivenoms we gave the guy.

241
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:15,336
- So we give him the antivenom
for the other one?
- Is that a question?

242
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,336
We can't just blindly give
him another antivenom,

243
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,311
especially after the first
one almost killed him.

244
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,940
You said only three types of poisonous
snakes <i>commonly</i> found in New Jersey.

245
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,213
- Well, what if this is an uncommon one?
- Very good.

246
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,845
- We gotta find the right snake.
- No need.

247
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,717
Odds are by the time
you get back, the autopsy

248
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,641
results will tell you
what kind of snake it was.

249
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,856
- But you said— - So we do give
him the antivenom for the other one?

250
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,559
Again, was that a question?
I asked what <i>you</i> would do.

251
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,330
It seems unfair for you to
ask <i>me</i> what you would do.

252
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,600
Who gives the guy
the other antivenom?

253
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,834
And who goes
looking for the snake?

254
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,081
I assume that one choice kills
him, the other one saves him.

255
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,981
That's usually the way it works
at the leg-turning-black stage.

256
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,010
<i>So half of us killed him,
and half of us saved his life.</i>

257
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,889
- Yeah.
- We can't be blamed for...

258
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,472
I'm sure this goes
against everything you've

259
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:10,919
been taught, but right
and wrong <i>do</i> exist.

260
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,077
<i>Just because you don't
know what the right answer is—</i>

261
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,829
Maybe there's even no way you
<i>could</i> know what the right answer is...

262
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,337
Doesn't make your
answer right or even okay.

263
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,774
It's much simpler than
that. It's just plain wrong.

264
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,915
<i>We gave the guy the antivenom.</i>
What if I'm allergic again?

265
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,246
That's why these
people are here.

266
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,947
If you have a reaction, we're
ready to do whatever's necessary...

267
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,923
to ensure your airways stay
open and your heart keeps beating.

268
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,721
My wife's on her way
in. Can't this wait?

269
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,957
I'm sorry. It can't.

270
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,124
It hurts again. <i>He came back?</i>

271
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,257
On average, drug
addicts are stupid.

272
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,829
- I'd call the cops.
- Good for you.

273
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,738
A lot of doctors wouldn't
risk their careers on a hunch.

274
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,436
It's not a hunch. I mean,
I know he wants drugs.

275
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,637
Well, even drug
addicts get sick.

276
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:37,412
Actually, for some reason, they tend to
get sick more often than non-drug addicts.

277
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,510
Luckily, you don't
have to play your hunch.

278
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,114
<i>There's a faster way.
Actually, there are several.</i>

279
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,353
My preference is urine testing.

280
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,261
- But you already know
he has drugs in his system.
- That's not what I'm testing for.

281
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,927
We're gonna put this hard rubber tube
up your urethra and into your bladder.

282
00:18:56,002 --> 00:19:00,269
<i>- It may be a little uncomfortable.</i>
- Shouldn't I be getting
some sort of anesthetic?

283
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,808
We're concerned about
allergic reactions today.

284
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,684
If the guy can handle a rod in his
penis for half an hour, he's really sick.

285
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,815
Or he's really jonesing.

286
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,052
There's easier ways
to get ahold of drugs.

287
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,561
Other hospitals, for example.

288
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,991
The volleyball player is
not responding to treatment.

289
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,703
<i>A t least we think
it's not working...</i>

290
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,037
on account of the fact
that she's getting worse.

291
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,906
- Can you still hear me?
- No.

292
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,912
A little! Not really!

293
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,712
Well, if you can't hear me,
how do you know what I asked?

294
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,151
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. What did I do?

295
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,486
I don't know. It really hurts.
I promise to be very careful.

296
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,220
- Susan— - Not her real name.

297
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,094
Susan, I barely touched you.

298
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:02,226
It hurts so much! I'm sorry. I
have to get this blood. Just hold on.

299
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,065
Hypersensitivity to touch.

300
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,662
<i>- Her calcium up?</i>
- Lab over 16.

301
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,403
- Question is why. Likely suspects.
- Parathyroid adenoma.

302
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,621
- Kidney problems.
- Vit "D" intoxication.
<i>- Hyperthyroid.</i>

303
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,205
- Caused by our treatment?
<i>- Whoa, whoa.</i>

304
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,942
Can you please slow down?

305
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,717
The adenoma is most likely.

306
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,123
<i>Check her P. T.
H., phosphorus...</i>

307
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,856
and ionized calcium.

308
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,125
<i>And do a technetium sestamibi.</i>

309
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,862
Okay, that's enough
about the volleyball player.

310
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,235
- What's up with the farmer?
- What farmer?

311
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,206
Snakebite guy.

312
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,038
Oh, right. You guys
don't know about him.

313
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,877
He doesn't get bitten until three months
after we treat the volleyball player.

314
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,247
Luckily, it's been well established
that time is not a fixed construct.

315
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,754
His condition is not
improving. Double the dosage.

316
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,153
- Already did.
- There's another antivenom.

317
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,283
- It's not as effective,
but— - Already tried it.

318
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,995
The first stuff, the
stuff he was allergic to.

319
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,437
Gave it to him with
high-dose steroids.

320
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,488
- Nothing's working.
- What does it all mean?

321
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,331
- Wrong snake?
- We tried every other antivenom we had.

322
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,805
- We're too late?
- Yep. He's dying. His wife's here.

323
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,605
<i>Finally found a babysitter.
Who wants to let 'em know?</i>

324
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,780
- Actually, I'm kidding.
- He's not dying?

325
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,147
Oh, yeah, he's dying.
But there's no wife and kid.

326
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,152
Which is great.

327
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:31,179
Makes the breaking-the-news
thing way easier.

328
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,624
Oh, yeah. One
more piece of news.

329
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,197
<i>The drug addict is peeing blood.</i>

330
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,876
How do they teach you how to
tell someone that they're dying?

331
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:59,445
It's kind of like teaching architects how
to explain why their building fell down.

332
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,749
Do you role-play and stuff?

333
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:06,259
Yeah. One of us gives the bad
news, and one of us gets the bad news.

334
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,818
What do you have to do to
get an "A" in You're Dying 101?

335
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,627
They grade you on
gentleness and supportiveness?

336
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:18,194
<i>Is there a scale for
measuring compassion?</i>

337
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,440
This buddy of mine...

338
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,966
I gotta give him 10 bucks every
time someone says thank you.

339
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:28,845
<i>Imagine that.
This guy's so good,</i>

340
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,476
people thank him for
telling 'em that they're dying.

341
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,848
Needs brown.

342
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,019
I don't get thanked that often.

343
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,995
You're dying.

344
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,025
In a few hours.

345
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,201
There's nothing we can
do except deal with the pain.

346
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,673
Well, I need to go home.

347
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,676
You're not going home.

348
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:04,512
But my dog. What
will happen to my dog?

349
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,491
Her neck looks
clean. No adenoma.

350
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,427
<i>Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying,
and all he cares about is his dog?</i>

351
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:22,725
Any of you guys go the dog
route in your improv sessions?

352
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:29,302
It's a basic truth of the human
condition that everybody lies.

353
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,774
The only variable is about what.

354
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,111
<i>The great thing about telling
someone they're dying...</i>

355
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,447
is that it tends to
focus their priorities.

356
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,420
<i>You find out what
matters to them.</i>

357
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:45,481
What they're willing to die for.

358
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,561
What they're willing to lie for.

359
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,190
You must have a neighbor
who— Neighbors don't like him.

360
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,602
So the Humane Society will take him
in and find him a home. No, they won't.

361
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,203
Yeah, but maybe my aunt...

362
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,268
It wasn't a snakebite, was it?

363
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,716
I said I don't
remember bein' bit.

364
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,309
Sure you do. Just
not by a snake.

365
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:18,085
I assume that Cujo bit one of
your neighbors a while back.

366
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,594
You tell me that he bit
you, and I gotta report it.

367
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,255
Cujo's got a record.
He gets the chair.

368
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:32,468
The good news is you might just live.
The bad news is your dog's gonna die.

369
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:36,066
Guy risked his life
to save this thing?

370
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,639
I'll hold him. You
swab the mouth.

371
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:45,276
I think I've got a better grip
here. You go for the mouth.

372
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,946
All right. I'm odds.

373
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,489
You serious? One, two, three!

374
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,957
Damn.

375
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,257
I don't care if he's scratching
your nads off, you don't let go.

376
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,762
Just do it!

377
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,267
I say we let the guy die.

378
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,327
- I got his head. Just do it.
- Got it.

379
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,943
What would you call that?

380
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,176
It's tea-colored, right?

381
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,980
The guy we thought
was just after the drugs...

382
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:24,581
What's the differential diagnosis
for urine that's tea-colored?

383
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,182
<i>Kidney stone.</i>

384
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,854
Kidney stones would cause what?

385
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,625
- Blood in urine.
- What color is your pee?

386
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,633
- Yellow.
- What color is your blood?

387
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,726
- Red.
- What colors did I use?

388
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,829
Red, yellow and brown.

389
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,875
- And brown. What causes brown?
- Waste.

390
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,376
- Which means the kidneys
are shutting down. Why?
- Trauma.

391
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:49,124
- None that his history would indicate.
- Could be damage done
by the self-injection of the Demerol.

392
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,310
- Treatment?
- Heat and rest...

393
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,716
- Other possible causes?
- Infection.

394
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,017
Start him on
antibiotics. What else?

395
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,525
Come on! Come
on! I-I don't know.

396
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,925
You're useless. But
at least you know it.

397
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,555
<i>Blood tests show
elevated creatine kinase.</i>

398
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,809
- What does that tell you?
- The trauma diagnosis was right.

399
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,393
- He takes it easy
for a few days, he'll be fine.
- You sure?

400
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,906
- The elevated C.K. rules out infection—
- You know what's worse than useless?

401
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,067
Useless and oblivious.

402
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,907
What are they missing?

403
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,259
It's kind of hard to think
when you're in our face like...

404
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,410
Yeah? You think it's gonna be easier
when you got a real patient really dying?

405
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,420
What are you missing?

406
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,683
<i>Muscle death.</i>

407
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:38,797
- Not your case.
- Nothing wrong with a consult.

408
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:43,632
Dying muscle leaks myoglobin.
It's toxic to the kidneys.

409
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,467
Brilliant.

410
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,997
<i>M.R.I. his leg.
See what's killing it.</i>

411
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,128
- Why is the girl getting the M.R.I.?
- Because the neck scan revealed nothing,

412
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:04,089
and her doctor's way more
obsessive than she thinks she is.

413
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,602
- But you said the guy needed the M.R.I.
- Because Dr. Cameron back there
said muscle death.

414
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,926
Not one of you said it. Not
one of this guy's doctors said it.

415
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:15,457
<i>They gave him bed rest and
antibiotics, just like you guys would have.</i>

416
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,231
- Did he get better?
- No.

417
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,068
- How long— - Three days.

418
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,305
It is in the nature of medicine
that you are gonna screw up.

419
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,312
You are gonna kill someone.

420
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,646
<i>If you can't handle that
reality, pick another profession.</i>

421
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:35,313
Or finish medical
school and teach.

422
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,357
Three days before they thought
it might have been muscle death?

423
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,918
No, three days before the <i>patient</i>
suggested it might have been muscle death.

424
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:50,430
The M.R.I. revealed
an osteosarcoma.

425
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:56,032
A cancerous tumor on your femur.
It needs to be removed surgically.

426
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,873
<i>With chemo, she has an
excellent chance of survival.</i>

427
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:04,474
But I have to warn you— depending on how
large the tumor is and how ingrained it is,

428
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,854
the surgeon may need
to amputate your leg.

429
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,682
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

430
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,524
It's okay.

431
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,768
Dogs' mouths are pretty filthy,

432
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,033
but they have natural antibodies
to fight off most of the stuff.

433
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,631
We don't. That's why
dog bites can be so nasty.

434
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,543
Lab tests of your dog's saliva
revealed a type of strep bacteria.

435
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,776
It's commonly known as
the flesh-eating disease.

436
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,307
We need to operate immediately
to remove the damaged tissue.

437
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,184
We may need to remove the leg.

438
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:54,529
The M.R.I. revealed
a problem. No kidding.

439
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,593
I'm sorry none of your
doctors found it earlier.

440
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,780
I am personally gonna
oversee your treatment from

441
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,765
now on. You're gonna
cut me open, aren't you?

442
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,677
We may need to remove the leg.

443
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:22,792
His M.R.I. showed that the leg pain
wasn't caused by the self-injection.

444
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,353
<i>It wasn't caused
by an infection.</i>

445
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:30,166
It was an aneurysm
that clotted...

446
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,467
leading to an infarction.

447
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,531
My God, you were
right. It's House.

448
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,568
<i>We have to do the surgery.</i>

449
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,912
The necrotic tissue has to be
removed. If there's too much...

450
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,076
I don't care what you find.

451
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,211
It may become necessary
in order to save your life.

452
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,916
I like my leg.

453
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,925
I've had it for as long
as I can remember.

454
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:58,623
Greg, I love your leg as much
as you do. They're not cutting it off.

455
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,202
The patient made
the right choice.

456
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,535
Tell a surgeon that
it's okay to cut a leg off,

457
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,405
and he's gonna spend the
night polishing his good hacksaw.

458
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,741
Right. Surgeons could
care less about saving limbs.

459
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,908
Of course they care about their patients.
They just care about themselves more,

460
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,748
which is not an
unreasonable position.

461
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,947
Trying to maximize
the tissue you save...

462
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,082
<i>also maximizes the chances
of something going wrong,</i>

463
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,890
which means you've gotta be extra
careful, which is such a pain in the ass.

464
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,593
Amazing advances have been
made. Kids with prosthetic legs...

465
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,863
are running the hundred-meter
dash in 12 seconds.

466
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,405
Yeah, they're
just not as pretty.

467
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,575
Do a bypass.
Restore the circulation.

468
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:47,044
- Amputation is safer.
- For you or me?

469
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,913
- The blockage of blood
flow— - Four-day blockage.

470
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,042
Yes. It caused
muscle cell death.

471
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,713
When those cells die, they
release cytokines and potassium.

472
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,814
And if you restore the blood
flow instead of just lopping it all off,

473
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,223
then all that crap gets
washed back into my system.

474
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:05,128
<i>The cytokines could cause organ failure.
The potassium could cause cardiac arrest.</i>

475
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,065
On the other hand, I may
just get the use of my leg back.

476
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,070
The postoperative pain
alone will— I'll get through it.

477
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,904
<i>I understand the risks. You're in
the clear. Go schedule an O. R.</i>

478
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:27,481
- God, you're an idiot.
- I think I'm more of a jerk.

479
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,112
I'm not being glib,
and I'm not being cute.

480
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,022
I don't want you
to kill yourself.

481
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,185
I'm not gonna die.

482
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,458
Oh, I feel completely reassured.

483
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,455
<i>More suction.</i>

484
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,507
Inserting now.

485
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:23,465
They gotta up the morphine.

486
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:28,769
- Doctors say they can't.
- Doctors recommended
bed rest and antibiotics.

487
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,981
They screwed up. It doesn't
mean they're wrong this time.

488
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:32,253
Sure doesn't mean they're right.

489
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,576
- Morphine will kill you.
- I can handle it.

490
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,662
You're in pain. You're
not thinking right.

491
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,447
That's why I need
the damn morphine!

492
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,043
<i>I'll talk to them.</i>

493
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:46,616
<i>Oh, my God. How much
longer is the pain gonna last?</i>

494
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,092
It depends on how much
muscle cell death there was.

495
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,824
He could be right. He could come out
of this with almost full use of his leg.

496
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,127
Or?

497
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,135
He could be in pain
for the rest of his life.

498
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,733
There's a third
option... surgically.

499
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,778
A middle ground between
what we did and amputation.

500
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,350
He's not big on middle ground.

501
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,683
Yeah.

502
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:43,480
Nurse? Nurse!

503
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,609
<i>- I need more calcium gluconate.</i>
- You just had five ml.'s.

504
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,780
The Q.R.S. is getting
wider. My potassium is rising.

505
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,099
- I'll talk to your doctor.
- Well, you better make it fast,

506
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,149
'cause I'm about to
go into cardiac arrest.

507
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,663
You give me the dose, or I go
into wide complex tachycardia.

508
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,575
- I could get in trouble— -
Listen, it's not a narcotic!

509
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,865
I'm not looking for a buzz.
You got about 20 seconds.

510
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,405
I was wrong.

511
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,410
What do you got? Wide
complex tachycardia.

512
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,920
You diagnosed— He did.

513
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,684
<i>Defibrillator.</i> Paddles.

514
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,224
Charge. Clear.

515
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,193
The patient was technically
dead for over a minute.

516
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,661
He's back.

517
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,445
<i>Do you think he was dead?</i>

518
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,311
<i>Do you think those
experiences were real?</i>

519
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,620
Define "real." They
were real experiences.

520
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,920
What they meant...

521
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:36,291
Personally, I choose to believe that
the white light people sometimes see,

522
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,388
<i>the visions this patient saw,</i>

523
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:43,424
they're all just chemical reactions that
take place while the brain shuts down.

524
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,666
- You <i>choose</i> to believe that?
<i>- There's no conclusive science.</i>

525
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,734
My choice has no practical
relevance to my life.

526
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,246
<i>I choose the outcome
I find more comforting.</i>

527
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,181
You find it more comforting
to believe that this is it?

528
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:04,221
I find it more comforting to
believe that this... isn't simply a test.

529
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:12,931
How bad is the pain right now?

530
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,967
It's bad.

531
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:19,698
It's not getting any better. If you
were right, the pain would be subsiding.

532
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,570
You'd be getting better.
It's just taking longer.

533
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,609
No, it's not.

534
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,544
We've gotta let
'em cut the leg off.

535
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:34,783
It's my leg. It's my life.

536
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,482
Would you give up
your leg to save my life?

537
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,683
Of course I would.

538
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,989
Why do you think your
life is worth less than mine?

539
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,393
If this were any other patient,
what would you tell them to do?

540
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,607
- I would say it's their choice.
- Not a chance.

541
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,667
You'd browbeat them until they
made the choice you knew was right.

542
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,704
You'd shove it in their
face that it's just a damn leg.

543
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,181
You don't think
you deserve to live?

544
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,417
You don't think you
deserve to be happy?

545
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,883
Now let them cut off your leg.

546
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,661
I can't. I can't.

547
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,668
I'm sorry.

548
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,613
The pain alone
is gonna kill you.

549
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,081
I know. I know.

550
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,723
I need you to
talk to the doctor.

551
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,866
He change his mind?

552
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,595
No.

553
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,199
He's asked to be put in a
chemically induced coma...

554
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,106
so that he can sleep through
the worst part of the pain.

555
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,876
We can do that.

556
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,047
What happens after
he's in the coma?

557
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,609
We'll obviously monitor
his condition closely,

558
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,647
and if he can get through the next 48
hours without another cardiac incident...

559
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,212
I meant, I'm his health
care proxy. I get to make

560
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,594
medical decisions for
him if he's not able to.

561
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,164
You should talk to him
about what he wants to do.

562
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:33,603
I know what he wants. But
if he's out, it's my call, right?

563
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,916
You'll be out in
less than a minute.

564
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:59,597
Thank you.

565
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,034
- Hey.
- Hey.

566
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,006
I'll see you when I wake up.

567
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,804
We'll go golfing.

568
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,974
I love you.

569
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,820
I love you too.

570
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,059
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,126
You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

572
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,845
The middle ground
you were talking about...

573
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,389
We go in, take out
the dead muscle.

574
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,925
There's still some risk
of reperfusion injury, but...

575
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,154
Give me the forms
you need signed.

576
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,623
You're saving his life.

577
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,603
He won't see it that way.

578
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:35,153
Because of the extent
of the muscle removed,

579
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:39,391
the utility of the patient's leg
was severely compromised.

580
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:43,265
<i>Because of the time delay
in making the diagnosis,</i>

581
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,566
the patient continues to
experience chronic pain.

582
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,303
<i>She had no right to do that.</i>

583
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,781
- She had the proxy.
- She knew he didn't want the surgery.

584
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,647
She saved his life.

585
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:00,627
We don't know that. Maybe
he would've been fine.

586
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,917
It doesn't matter.
It's the patient's call.

587
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:04,213
The patient's an idiot.

588
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,257
They usually are.

589
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:12,127
Do you have a buzzer or something?
What time does this class end?

590
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,461
Twenty minutes ago.

591
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,271
I'm not doing this again.

592
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,277
And this guy is not the world's
greatest dad. Not even ranked.

593
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,462
Who the hell lets
their kids play with

594
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:31,078
lead-based paint? That's
why he's always sick.

595
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,642
Find him some plastic cups,
and the class is all his again.

596
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,079
Stacy, it's Greg.

597
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,847
I've got an opening in my calendar
for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

598
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,515
Make sure your
husband isn't late.

599
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,166
That's some bad hat, Harry.
