1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:04,360
<i>Collins working on
King here, top of the key—</i>

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>Dribbling around him, coming
around the corner there, he's up!</i>

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,842
<i>Two points! Beautiful play.</i>

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,879
<i>Now, that's a great play.</i>

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,414
<i>If you testify, no
one can protect you,</i>

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,416
especially the feds.

7
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,884
- We'll keep you safe, Joey.
- Right. In Witness Protection.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,716
<i>This great new
life he's giving you?</i>

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,655
You're sackin' groceries at
some goat-town Stop and Shop,

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,956
when one of Vitale's guys comes
and puts two in the back of your skull.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,780
Counselor, are you
advising a witness to

12
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,759
withhold evidence from
a federal grand jury?

13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,766
He came forward. He volunteered.

14
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,600
<i>I'm advising him not to testify until
I'm satisfied you can protect him.</i>

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,333
Hey, you guys mind?
I got money on this.

16
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,807
What do you want? We gave
you everything you asked for.

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,209
- I asked for pasta.
- You got steak. Enjoy it.

18
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,716
- What are you doin'?
- What?

19
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,588
Where's your quit candy? I just
gave you a pack. Yeah, sorry.

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,489
I forgot.

21
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,493
Joey, whatever they give us,

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,496
what they tell you, you get popped,
what am I gonna do, sue them?

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,565
That's not what this is about.

24
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,761
You're gonna miss me.

25
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,168
- I'm your lawyer, Joey.
- You're my brother.

26
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,808
And I do this—you know, I
go into Witness Protection...

27
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,004
We're never gonna
see each other again.

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,913
- That doesn't bother you?
- It kills me.

29
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,253
<i>There he goes. Nice pick.</i>

30
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,287
I gotta take a leak.

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,032
You all right?

32
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:46,436
<i>Yeah, yeah. Just,
uh, a little dizzy.</i>

33
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,169
<i>Get some air.</i> Hot.

34
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,242
- Joey.
- What'd you say to him?

35
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,148
Yeah, nice try. Come
on! Let go of me!

36
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,584
- Let go of me! Can't you see he's sick?
- Joey!

37
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,213
<i>Let me go! Something's
wrong with him!</i>

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,155
You're not getting out
of this that easy. Joey.

39
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,659
<i>Either you’re dead
or you’re testifying.</i>

40
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,662
<i>Don't have it.</i>

41
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,324
<i>Budget?</i> Nope.

42
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,834
Revenue statement.
List of expenses.

43
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,836
House has been very busy.

44
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,429
Saving New Jersey
from leprosy. Yes, I know.

45
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,567
Getting me his
numbers, that's your job.

46
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,806
- We're in a meeting.
- I need the lawyer.

47
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,145
Who'd you kill? Nobody.
But it's not even lunch.

48
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,185
<i>I got served with a federal court
order. Some witness went into a coma.</i>

49
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,187
They want me to
take a look at him.

50
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,018
<i>What?</i>

51
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,821
They want you to
examine a sick person?

52
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,021
This is a public
relations nightmare.

53
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,291
Folk think our staff do that
kind of thing around here,

54
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,833
this place will be
crawling with sick people.

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm a doctor. I'm not a lapdog
for the feds. I don't play fetch.

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,435
Nobody tells you what to
do. Am I right, Dr. Cuddy?

57
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,660
You have three choices.
Hire a lawyer to fight the

58
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,774
order, treat the guy or
go to jail for contempt.

59
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,178
Up to you.

60
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,651
Jail. You'd like that. No
more naughty schoolgirl.

61
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,211
Conjugal visit—that's
her new fantasy.

62
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,289
We're not leaving until
he's gone, or you show me...

63
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,629
one good reason for keeping him.

64
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,659
He's really out of it, huh?

65
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,929
Causes of coma— metabolic,
structural— He had his stomach pumped.

66
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,490
Why would they do
that? Rule out poisoning.

67
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,502
Huh. Not the
typical first guess.

68
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,992
Nope, first guess was
faking it. The patient's

69
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:34,303
a federal witness—
Reluctant, I'm assuming.

70
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,434
He's also an eight on
the Glasgow Coma Scale.

71
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,877
He's barely alive.
Pretty tough to fake.

72
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,847
Any recent history of head
trauma? Bad car accident? Fall?

73
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,248
They tell me no, but
do an M.R.I. to be sure.

74
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,286
<i>Metabolic causes—
Liver, kidney, diabetes—</i>

75
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,447
Check for everything.
Feds are paying.

76
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,684
We're gonna turn a
profit on this one, boys.

77
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,852
Dr. House, Bill
Arnello. I'm a lawyer.

78
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,364
I represent Mr. Smith.
What's wrong with him?

79
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,626
Do I come to you
with my problems?

80
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,259
He's also my brother.

81
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,531
What? You changed your name?

82
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,039
Smith wasn't good
enough for you?

83
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,906
His name's Joey. He's my only
brother. He's important to you.

84
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,471
Got it. So, no placebos for
him. We'll use the real medicine.

85
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,574
This was fun. Let's
do it again soon.

86
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,489
Brother in the Mafia?

87
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,227
So, just Joey?

88
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,322
I was hoping for a nickname.

89
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,732
Joey Mango. Joey the Wrench.

90
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,439
People know where I am.
I want you to do your job.

91
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,173
Diagnose him, fix
him and keep him here.

92
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,067
We're a bit of a specialized
hospital. We generally

93
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,481
only deal with patients
while they're actually sick.

94
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,817
If you release my
brother to the government,

95
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,347
and he does what they want,
even if you fix him, he's dead.

96
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,360
I need time to
convince him of that.

97
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,028
Good news is, if you screw up,

98
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,438
you don't have to worry
about a malpractice suit.

99
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,112
Instead, one by one,

100
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,013
I'll take away the things you
love till there's nothing left.

101
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,455
So, on the Mafia thing,

102
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,515
that's a yes.

103
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,003
<i>Did House seem weird to you?</i>

104
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,005
Were you expecting
him to be weird?

105
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,476
We spoke...

106
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,977
about how we felt.

107
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,742
You told him you liked
him? No, of course not.

108
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,376
Wh-What are you talking about
then? I asked him if he liked me.

109
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,512
Why would you
do that? Because...

110
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,084
I like him.

111
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,390
You <i>like</i> him like him?

112
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,657
Doesn't matter.
He doesn't like me.

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,167
Hey, he doesn't like anybody.

114
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,737
And nobody likes him.

115
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,038
<i>M.R.I. showed a
subdural hematoma.</i>

116
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,204
Bleeding around his brain caused pressure
inside his head, which caused the coma.

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,373
These look like
pseudo-membranes.

118
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,383
Those take time to form.

119
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,681
If it's an old injury, it
wouldn't cause the coma.

120
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,848
Patient history indicates he
was hit with a tire iron in 1996.

121
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,290
Brother says he was
changing a tire and it slipped.

122
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,693
An old hematoma placed where this
one is could have caused his coma.

123
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,561
- What about his liver?
- L.F.T.'s are slightly elevated.

124
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,534
Key word is "slightly," as in not
high enough to cause the coma.

125
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,765
It's the subdural. I say we evacuate
the cavity, see if he wakes up.

126
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,158
The neurologist thinks
it's his brain and wants

127
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,276
to open up his head?
Frankly, I'm shocked.

128
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,246
<i>And you get to use the "big boy"
drill in Daddy's big red toolbox.</i>

129
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,044
<i>No drilling.</i>

130
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,080
- Hi.
<i>- Mr. Smith.</i>

131
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,920
Call me Joe. Can
you not do that?

132
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:19,160
So, we're clear
about the no drilling?

133
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,303
<i>He's okay now. He can leave.</i>

134
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,340
I'm not releasing him. 'Cause
the brother doesn't want you to?

135
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,865
Or because he had an unexplained
coma. Which sounds better?

136
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,471
The hematoma caused the coma. That's a
catchy diagnosis. You could dance to that.

137
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,811
<i>I think Chase is right.</i>

138
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,885
It still should be evacuated,
but it's not an immediate threat.

139
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,662
Cameron's my girl.

140
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,823
I'd release him.

141
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,984
- Are you disagreeing
with me because— - I'm

142
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,933
disagreeing because
that's my medical opinion.

143
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,495
Of course it is.

144
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,134
But unless I've been named as
the fourth part of the "axis of evil,"

145
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,940
invaded and occupied,
this is still not a democracy.

146
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:10,211
He's staying. Send for hepatitis
serologies and an autoimmune panel.

147
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,496
Hey, I'm with you.

148
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,722
<i>Old enough to drink, old
enough to do something</i>

149
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:27,557
<i>really stupid and
make yourself a baby.</i>

150
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,332
He's my brother. I'm watching him
while our parents are in Barbados.

151
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,203
He's having trouble breathing,
and there's a lot of wheezing.

152
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:38,302
Whistling, technically.
Upper airways. Nose.

153
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,906
If he's got the croup, that— that could
become meningitis, right? Absolutely.

154
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,713
I—I was just studying, and all of a sudden
I hear him crying and sounding all weird.

155
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,222
Oh— M-My parents
are gonna kill me.

156
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,918
I doubt it. You don't know them.

157
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,723
No, I doubt you were studying
while your parents were away.

158
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:02,234
<i>Hello, Officer.</i>

159
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,272
You might wanna rinse this off
before you let him play with it again.

160
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,283
What happened? Where is he?

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,424
Vogler called Admitting. Admitting called
Justice. Justice came and took him away.

162
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,798
And who called Vogler?

163
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,368
He loses money.

164
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:48,074
So does Ophthalmology.
Who cares? This is a hospital.

165
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,710
- You can't just cut a department.
- You can't control him.

166
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,879
I am the only one
that <i>can</i> control him.

167
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,389
♪ D-D-Dr. House in the house ♪

168
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,392
Impeccable timing as always.

169
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,621
You had no authority
to release my patient.

170
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,961
My colleague has just informed
me she has a singular talent.

171
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,866
You are just in time
for a demonstration.

172
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,964
Dr. House, from
what I understand,

173
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,305
your patient— From what you
understand— He's not your patient.

174
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,902
<i>How the hell do you
understand anything?</i> It's sad.

175
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:24,645
- You're not even a doctor.
- John Smith is here
only because of a court order.

176
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,448
I had the records faxed to the
judge. She rescinded the order.

177
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,924
- Why bother? Just to piss me off?
- Keeping the government off our ass.

178
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,017
Hmm. Yeah.

179
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,996
- That makes no sense
for a public institution.
- Okay.

180
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,092
- Okay, what?
- Okay, sir.

181
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,103
Carry on.

182
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,142
He really cares
about his patients.

183
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,044
Yeah, and he just walked out of
here with nothin'. Something's up.

184
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,275
Just started vomiting
and passed out.

185
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,012
<i>More lidocaine. 590, with epi.</i>

186
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,502
<i>Thirty-five-year-old
male. Vital signs</i>

187
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:04,023
<i>are stable now. Gave
him two liters en route.</i>

188
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,317
<i>He was just released
from here two hours ago.</i>

189
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,557
You said he was good to go.

190
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,033
Watch that line. <i>He's
still not responding.</i>

191
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,639
So, the junior G-man
badge isn't looking so good.

192
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,612
<i>- His liver's worse.</i>
- Comatose?

193
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,197
No. Completely different
symptoms than the first time.

194
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,022
His serology tests came
back positive for hepatitis "C."

195
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,790
Hep "C" is a chronic condition. You
don't think this is an acute situation?

196
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,491
Coma, vomiting, abdominal
pain. Hep "C" explains everything.

197
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,763
- Except for the suddenness of the onset.
- What's wrong with the timing?

198
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:52,795
You get home one night, your
wife hits you with a baseball bat.

199
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,809
<i>Likely causes: The fact that you haven't
thanked her for dinner in eight years...</i>

200
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,870
or the receipt for fur handcuffs
that she found in your pants?

201
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,348
Sudden onset equals
approximate cause.

202
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,443
He also has high
estrogen levels in his blood.

203
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,786
That's indicative of a
chronic condition, not acute.

204
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,018
One test. What do his
other liver tests tell us?

205
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,185
Normal albumen levels
point toward acute.

206
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,697
Oh, okay, and, uh, why is
her test better than mine?

207
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,566
Because she's cuter,
though it's close.

208
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,003
Do a liver biopsy. When the results come
back, we'll know what we're looking at.

209
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:30,476
Why wait to treat the hep "C"? If I'm
right, Joey gets better that much faster.

210
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,310
Right. Then he gets to testify.
And you get a gold star from Cuddy.

211
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,374
And what's the downside?
Or is that the downside?

212
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,649
<i>Do I have a reason for not
wanting you to get any stars?</i>

213
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,854
Fine. Start the treatment.

214
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,918
It's all your idea. Don't
even mention my name.

215
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,829
There's nothing wrong
with your theory. Go.

216
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,203
But in the "humor me" department,
get a biopsy while you're at it.

217
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,173
<i>Foreman, we need to talk.</i>

218
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,577
- You're off the case.
- What?

219
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,952
- Why?
- Somebody told Vogler that I lied
to the transplant committee.

220
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,719
- You think I did?
- You're too careful.

221
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,648
You wouldn't jump ship
unless you knew what

222
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,728
was in the water. Stop.
You're embarrassing me.

223
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,889
But I want Vogler to
think I think it's you.

224
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,526
And I want Cameron and Chase,
Cuddy and Wilson, the nursing staff...

225
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,866
and the cashier in the
parking lot to think that too.

226
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,036
Right.

227
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,044
The blood tests show
you have hepatitis "C."

228
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,582
It's a virus that
infects the liver.

229
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,981
No way. It's not all bad news.

230
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,579
It can often be cured. And
even if not, it's manageable.

231
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,645
How'd my brother get
this? It usually involves

232
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:52,421
the exchange of
bodily fluids. Either...

233
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,984
Bodily fluids? What
are you talkin' about?

234
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,790
There are many ways the
virus can be transmitted...

235
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,173
Sharing needles,
blood transfusions...

236
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,066
Hey! Nobody talks to
my brother like this, okay?

237
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,263
Fine. No idea how he got it.

238
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,636
But he has hepatitis "C."
We're gonna start him on...

239
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:13,307
He doesn't have it. Don't mention
it again. Don't treat him for it.

240
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,684
<i>House has some
directed donations,</i>

241
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,688
foundation support...

242
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,690
It's around here.

243
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,393
He makes you miserable.

244
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,330
Eight years he's worked here—
Never made a dime for you.

245
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,333
Never listened to you.
He can change. He's...

246
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,960
He hasn't changed
in eight years.

247
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,335
Either he can't change,
or you can't change him.

248
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,768
You have no idea how many times
he's lied to you, undercut your authority,

249
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,973
made you look like
crap to other doctors.

250
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,781
Yes, I hate him, and here I am
desperately trying to protect his job.

251
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,378
- What does that tell you?
- That you don't hate him.

252
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,918
I do not protect people I like.

253
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,222
I protect people who
are assets to this hospital.

254
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,196
No. That's me.

255
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,659
You...

256
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,293
- You're softer.
- Right.

257
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,100
There are three female
chiefs of medicine...

258
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,107
at major hospitals
in this country,

259
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,473
and we all got there
using our feminine wiles.

260
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,173
- It's human nature to want to
protect people we like.
- I don't like him.

261
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,969
<i>To think if we just
form the right team, we'll</i>

262
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:24,626
<i>all get along and be
able to pull the boat—</i>

263
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,643
- I don't get along with him!
- This is not a team.

264
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,879
It's not a boat. It's
not a machine that has

265
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:31,987
a lot of parts that
have to work together.

266
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:36,519
The metaphors are all crap.
This is a business. That's all it is.

267
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,761
<i>You like him. That's
bad for business.</i>

268
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,369
Oh, this is all my fault.

269
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,279
Took another homework
break with Betty Lou?

270
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,340
No, last week I showed
him a magic trick.

271
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,285
You pulled a quarter out
of his nose. It's a classic.

272
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,256
Yeah, and now he won't
stop shovin' stuff up there.

273
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,521
- Dr. House.
- Got a crisis here.

274
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,629
It's okay.

275
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,735
Stop!

276
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,154
That's a neat trick.

277
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,156
They have to believe
you'll actually hurt them.

278
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,158
Ah.

279
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,066
Your people insulted my brother.

280
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,570
What, they put Romano in the
Parmesan cheese shaker again?

281
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,265
Said he was a crackhead
or a homo or somethin'.

282
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,274
Those idiots.

283
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,800
How many times am I gonna have
to send them for sensitivity training?

284
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,814
<i>Nobody's saying he's a homo.
That would be really, really bad.</i>

285
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,373
So let's put a nice,
friendly spin on it.

286
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,614
Let's go with, "He
got raped in prison."

287
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,622
<i>I saw the jailhouse tats.</i>

288
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,249
Put it together
with the blood tests.

289
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,092
There were rumors, but Joey
never said anything about it.

290
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,190
If people find out he's
bein' treated for hep "C"...

291
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,137
Feds get that chart, someone says
somethin' to somebody, word will get out.

292
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,334
And then Joey's manhood,
his rep— He's destroyed.

293
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:37,116
You're worried about how his coworkers
will react at the Wal-Mart in Des Moines.

294
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,278
He's not going into Witness
Protection. I'm not gonna let that happen.

295
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,990
Listen, I don't know
if you know about this,

296
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,186
but mob businesses sometimes
keep two sets of books.

297
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,822
- One legit, one not.
- Exactly.

298
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,468
You jerkin' my chain?

299
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,199
Doctors are busy. Sometimes they forget
to write things down. Happens all the time.

300
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,010
Thanks.

301
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,273
<i>Oh, and, uh,</i>

302
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,341
whatever you're not giving him
for whatever he doesn't have,

303
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,353
is that gonna fix him?

304
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,556
I doubt it.

305
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,934
On your way to
polish Vogler's car?

306
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,063
Gone are the days of
the grumpy old doc...

307
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,769
seeing patients in the basement of
his house, getting paid a few chickens.

308
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,404
- How will I eat?
- You know what Cuddy's been
locked away with Vogler about...

309
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,675
all day today and yesterday?

310
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,546
Floor polish costs
through the roof?

311
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:48,418
You. Her secretary's been at the
photocopier all day with your records.

312
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,219
<i>That's all they're looking at
in there.</i> My car's been stolen.

313
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,862
<i>Or rein-car-nated.</i>

314
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,772
Pink slip.

315
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,537
A gift from the
Arnello brothers.

316
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,877
You know, they're
gangsters, sure,

317
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,941
but they're thoughtful too.

318
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,488
You can't keep
it. It's... graft.

319
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,685
No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

320
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,161
Graft is if I tell him I'll only make him
better if he slips me a couple bucks.

321
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,199
Or a payoff for something
I'm not supposed to do.

322
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,258
If I'd asked for the
payoff, which I didn't,

323
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,270
I would've done the
bad thing anyway.

324
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,465
So there's nothing
wrong with this.

325
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,474
Right. Damn.

326
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,443
Sixty-five.

327
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,446
Perfectly restored.

328
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:51,951
What do you think a guy like Joey
would do if someone turned down a gift?

329
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,612
That's kind of
an insult, isn't it?

330
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:58,852
He might hurt you.
It's definitely possible.

331
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,326
I'm screwed. Gotta take the car.

332
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,002
<i>Did you see House's new car?</i>

333
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,005
From Joey. He
obviously can't keep it.

334
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,803
You don't mind the hospital
taking money from Vogler?

335
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,037
That's different.
Vogler's legit.

336
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,740
That's worse. Vogler's
money came with strings.

337
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,216
Vogler doesn't set me up to
have a mobster take a swing at me.

338
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,415
- I'm sure House didn't know—
- Joey's pressure dropped.

339
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,821
Pushed I.V. fluids, now he's
holding a hundred systolic.

340
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,123
<i>Septic? No, it looks like
he's bleeding into his liver.</i>

341
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,789
Varices. See it with
chronic hep "C" all the time.

342
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,697
Biopsy's back.

343
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,167
<i>Two findings. Number one,</i>

344
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,069
lymphocytic infiltrate
and no bridging fibrosis.

345
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,733
Whatever's killing him's
not hep "C." It's acute.

346
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,141
Who said that? I forget.

347
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,544
What are you doing here? I
told you you were off the case.

348
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:01,417
Right. Your diabolic plan to convince
the evil genius he's in the clear,

349
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,565
so he'll let his guard down
and make a fatal mistake.

350
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,388
Sure. Well, it's clearly
not gonna work now.

351
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,552
What evil genius?

352
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,087
If we knew that, we wouldn't
need a diabolic plan, would we?

353
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,603
- House thinks someone
ratted him out to Vogler.
- What, one of us?

354
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,003
No, you guys love me too much.

355
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,193
Look, if it's not the
hep "C," then what's

356
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,567
the problem? What's
causing the liver failure?

357
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,579
<i>Finding number two, toxins.</i>

358
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,848
No. He's only 30 years
old, and his job doesn't

359
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:32,050
expose him to heavy
metals or environmental...

360
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,279
He's a 30-year-old mobster.

361
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,346
He doesn't have a job that results
in accidental exposure to toxins.

362
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,757
He has a job that results in
<i>intentional</i> exposure to toxins.

363
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,432
Someone's poisoned him.

364
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,847
<i>Whatever this toxin is,
it's doing the job and fast.</i>

365
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,387
How long till we have the
next round of test results?

366
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,618
- About four hours.
- Too bad his liver's only
gonna last another two.

367
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,455
- We're gonna have to get him a new one.
- What, in two hours?

368
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,698
There is another way.

369
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,463
Relax. It's kosher.

370
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,879
<i>This is so bizarre.</i>

371
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,717
Not really. We just take
Joey's blood out of his body...

372
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,950
and run it through a pig.

373
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:49,394
<i>The pig's liver does what
Joey's can't. It cleans the blood.</i>

374
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,396
<i>Which we send right back to him.</i>

375
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,134
<i>And the pig makes him better?</i>

376
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,728
<i>Nope. Just buys us some time to
figure out what's poisoning your brother.</i>

377
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,965
Like nothin'. Like you
do this all the time.

378
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,103
Oh, we've basically got
a barn in the basement.

379
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,287
<i>Cross off hemlock.</i>

380
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:18,415
You thought he was being
poisoned by hemlock?

381
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,584
Dr. Euripides tell
you to check for that?

382
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,094
It grows wild by the
highways out here.

383
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,429
So, how much do you like House?

384
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,534
- Chase has a big mouth.
- Yeah. He's probably the one
who ratted to Vogler.

385
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,802
- I don't think that he would— -
Does it hurt when you're with House?

386
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,309
Little pain in the tummy,
but it sort of feels good too?

387
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:41,677
- I don't have the right to show
interest in someone?
- You absolutely do.

388
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,216
And I absolutely have the
right to humiliate you for it.

389
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,920
Anything?

390
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,194
White blood count's
low, probably a result of

391
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:52,448
the illness. Nothing
to connect to the liver.

392
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,459
- Is he a smoker?
<i>- Let me check.</i>

393
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,124
Early signs of emphysema. He's
been smoking at least a dozen years.

394
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,180
<i>Eighteen. You got that
from the white count?</i>

395
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,571
<i>Nope. Got that
from the chest X-ray.</i>

396
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,608
White count just
tells me he's quitting.

397
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,512
Two weeks ago.

398
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,689
How's your tummy?

399
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,018
Flat and taut.

400
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,586
<i>I've been on the
job for 12 years.</i>

401
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,870
You put $3,000 in your
wife's checking account

402
00:25:33,894 --> 00:25:36,124
this morning. I wanna
know where it came from.

403
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,662
I got a perfect record.
Where did you get the money?

404
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,106
Cancel the thumbscrews.
I've got our culprit.

405
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,610
Who? Not who, "Hu."

406
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,909
- Huh?
- Thanks for playing along.

407
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,974
Chai Hu. Chinese herb in
his "quit smoking" candy.

408
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,352
Reduces cravings. Also
reduces his white blood count.

409
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,721
Oh, yeah, he also took enough
of them to poison himself.

410
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,057
We'll keep him on the pig for a few more
hours, and then take him off the candy.

411
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,062
He'll be fine.

412
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,963
Pig won't be. Oh, no.

413
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,344
Hey.

414
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,817
<i>Hey, feelin' better?</i>

415
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,876
I'm famished.

416
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,888
I think they got fish
sticks on the menu.

417
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,255
Ah, yeah. Makes me miss prison.

418
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,363
So, the mobster's good to go?

419
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,492
I'll keep him overnight,
then let the feds know...

420
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:45,003
he's good to rat out
whoever he wants.

421
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,006
- Brother won't be happy.
- Maybe I have to give back the car.

422
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,743
You should let Vogler
tell the feds. Why?

423
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,370
Because it matters to him.

424
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,041
Because you humiliated him
the first time Joey was released.

425
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,951
- You think you should still
be in third there, ace?
- He humiliated himself.

426
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,230
And because your job
depends on the kind of mood

427
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,582
Vogler's in at the end of
his marathon with Cuddy.

428
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,623
Seriously, man, have
you ever actually driven an

429
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:09,719
automobile before? There
are four gears, you know?

430
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,129
The '66 came with
a "shut up" button.

431
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,546
<i>I have a problem with the tests.</i>

432
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,818
I need to know...

433
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,597
It is my medical opinion that the
patient is healthy and can be released.

434
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,900
Thanks for letting us know.

435
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,635
Get me the U.S.
Attorney's office.

436
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,076
I see you found out what we're
meeting about. You're having a meeting?

437
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,411
Well, whatever the reason,
the coat looks good on you.

438
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,916
Chai Hu lozenges cause this
kind of liver failure? No way.

439
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,753
Not by themselves. But in combination with
the interferon it's like gas to a flame.

440
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,349
- What interferon?
- For the hep "C."

441
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,692
- What hep "C"?
- Oops.

442
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,323
Is hiding a mobster's
hep "C" that important?

443
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,335
Is letting the feds know
everything that important?

444
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,031
You are a piece of work.
Even now, knowing— Ed...

445
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,369
Edward.

446
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,000
Joey's back in a coma.

447
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,717
He's stable, but comatose.

448
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,744
Worse than before.
He's on a ventilator.

449
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:42,721
Question is, why?

450
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:47,222
It's not his brain.
It's not a toxin.

451
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,887
Our friend Babe
helped with that one.

452
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,056
- So, what else?
- Hep "C."

453
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,200
<i>We never really treated
it. We stopped the</i>

454
00:28:54,224 --> 00:28:56,568
<i>interferon when it
started poisoning his liver.</i>

455
00:28:56,635 --> 00:29:00,197
<i>Am I gonna have to write a song
about it? His chronic hep "C"...</i>

456
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,867
was not bad enough to
produce these symptoms.

457
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,954
- The estrogen level indicates it is.
- It indicates something else entirely.

458
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,054
We can't give him
interferon now. There are

459
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,177
still traces of the
lozenges in his system.

460
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,343
<i>It’ll just poison him
again. Genetics.</i>

461
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,409
We don't treat the
virus, we change it.

462
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,785
A nonnucleoside
allosteric inhibitor.

463
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,967
It's never been tried on a
human being. It could kill him.

464
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,101
<i>What's the difference?
He's dead without it.</i>

465
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,231
They're running a trial...

466
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,889
<i>on dogs at St. Sebastian's
out in Philadelphia.</i>

467
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,898
I'll make the call.

468
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,600
<i>What else could cause his
estrogen level to be that high?</i>

469
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,272
Nothing.

470
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,896
We're gonna put
the medicine in here.

471
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,831
<i>Don't want it to burn
his veins when it goes in.</i>

472
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,868
<i>And you have
no idea if it’ll work.</i>

473
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,994
It's shown promise in testing.

474
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,750
<i>Ma-Maybe there's nothing up
there. I watched him like a hawk.</i>

475
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,917
Pretty sure you didn't.

476
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,962
I—I didn't let him play
with any more little toys.

477
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,021
Thus forcing him to
shove a big one up there.

478
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,433
Stop, or I snap your nose off!

479
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,546
He— He's not too smart.

480
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:54,052
Genetics is a powerful force.

481
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,427
<i>On the other hand, maybe
he's smarter than you think.</i>

482
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,866
What's goin' on?
Just give me a second.

483
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,736
Always wanted to
use one of these.

484
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,108
Tilt his head back.
I—I don't know. I do...

485
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,948
Just tilt his head back.

486
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,869
Nice grasp of concepts.
Relationships. Very smart.

487
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,030
<i>Very cool.</i>

488
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,904
First the policeman, the
fireman, then the fire truck.

489
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,537
Your brother was sending
in teams to save the cat.

490
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,241
<i>Wow.</i>

491
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,144
Sometimes the simplest answer...

492
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,721
What types of comas
do you just snap out of?

493
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,664
He's not snapping out of
this one. He's not improving.

494
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,760
You've crossed out estrogen.
You got an explanation?

495
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,500
Yes, I have, a very simple one.

496
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,202
And?

497
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,335
It's private.

498
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,782
You think I'm the
one— Running to Vogler.

499
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,578
You're currently
top of the list.

500
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,987
<i>Toxic comas—</i>

501
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:15,994
<i>Person's away from the cause
long enough, they recover.</i>

502
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:19,589
The feds checked for poisons.
We checked for poisons. I didn't do it.

503
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,725
It's not a poison
then. An allergy.

504
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,964
- Did you hear me?
- What about a food sensitivity?

505
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,109
All his food is strictly
controlled. There's no

506
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,272
correlation between his
meals and his condition.

507
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,745
He had steak and potatoes
before the first coma,

508
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,408
and the hospital served fish
sticks before the second one.

509
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,884
You can trust me.

510
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,456
Problem is, if I
<i>can't</i> trust you,

511
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,996
I can't trust your statement
that I <i>can</i> trust you.

512
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,930
But thanks anyway.
You've been a big help.

513
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,970
So, where <i>did</i> you
get the money? What?

514
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,575
Someone paid you off.
What are you talkin' about?

515
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,586
He wasn't poisoned.
You told us that...

516
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,920
Who's talking about poison?
I'm talking about payoffs, graft.

517
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,221
Leave him alone.

518
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,625
You paid the marshal off.

519
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,929
I didn't pay him to
poison my brother.

520
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,492
No. It just worked out that way.

521
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,665
I gave the guy some money
to bring in some decent food.

522
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,506
Better than fish sticks?
I'm thinking steak.

523
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,937
We asked for pasta, but those
stupid feds could care less...

524
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,278
He had steak before both comas.

525
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:47,342
Your brother has ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency.

526
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,945
Want me to write it down?

527
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,049
Good, 'cause it takes a while. It's
genetic, can present at any time.

528
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,677
If the patient eats
a large amount of

529
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,618
protein, especially
if he's not used to it...

530
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:01,792
What, that's it? He just stays off
the red meat, and he's gonna be fine?

531
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,802
Yes. If I'm right and we stop the
current treatment, he gets better.

532
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,636
If we stop the current
treatment and I'm wrong, he dies.

533
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,768
- Why would you be wrong?
- His estrogen level.

534
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,438
O.T.D. doesn't explain
his estrogen level.

535
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,643
But I have a theory.

536
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,585
There is one chemical
that, if ingested,

537
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,919
can cause a person's estrogen
level to increase dramatically.

538
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,154
- What is it?
- It's called estrogen.

539
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,089
Joey's taking estrogen?
What, he wants a sex change?

540
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,099
No, nothing like that.

541
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,762
It's called "Male Flame."

542
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:43,172
<i>It's probably more consumer-friendly
in the original Chinese.</i>

543
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,268
It's an herbal aphrodisiac
marketed to gay men.

544
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,247
- Ah, here we go.
- And it's sold on the same Web site
that sells his Chai Hu lozenges.

545
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,342
Guess what's in it?
It starts with an "E."

546
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,887
You wanna get hit too?

547
00:35:55,954 --> 00:36:00,585
That would be quite a trick. He slapped
me so hard, his brother turned straight.

548
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,096
Joey's a big-time mobster. Guys
like that don't get raped in prison.

549
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,190
They get gifts. They get
food, drugs, cigarettes.

550
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,826
Cable TV.

551
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,006
Joey is not gay.

552
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,441
Maybe not gay, but
certainly delightful.

553
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:24,142
You, on the other hand, hitting a
doctor, even if it was only Chase,

554
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:28,209
and asking another one to keep
Joey's chart fresh and homo-free...

555
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,448
That's a bit of an
overreaction, wouldn't you say?

556
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,482
It's almost like you're scared
that it might be true. You're wrong.

557
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,927
Okay. Then don't
stop the treatment.

558
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,366
But if <i>you're</i> wrong, he dies.

559
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,132
Okay.

560
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,941
<i>He never said anything
to me about it, not once.</i>

561
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:41,822
That's what I love about you
mob guys, so tolerant of others.

562
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,885
<i>So accepting.</i>

563
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:48,127
Only way he was coming
out was way, way out.

564
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,295
Lose the tattoos, change his
name, move to another town.

565
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,568
How's a guy like
him gonna do that?

566
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,575
Witness Protection.

567
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,669
It's not just for
witnesses anymore.

568
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,180
You can go in now,
sit with him if you want.

569
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,565
- How much longer?
- It's only been three hours.

570
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,339
- If it's the O.T.D.— - If it's the
O.T.D.? What if House is wrong, huh?

571
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,574
That severe a reaction,
it'll take some time...

572
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,982
- He makes these assumptions about people,
talks you into things— - Mr. Arnello...

573
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,852
He's awake. He wants to see you.

574
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,964
You look like crap.

575
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:57,025
That's a joke. See? I'm
sick. I said you look like crap.

576
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,297
You have no idea what I
just went through out there.

577
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,038
<i>You kept gettin' worse.</i>

578
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,236
And Dr. House kept
sayin' all this crap.

579
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,639
You know, if—if I think you're normal, then
he's gonna keep giving you the medicine.

580
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,811
- If you weren't—
- Weren't what?

581
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,123
<i>Normal?</i>

582
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,560
Yeah.

583
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,197
He said you were a fag.

584
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,364
<i>Witness Protection— That's
your big chance to be one.</i>

585
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,937
- You believed him?
- I don't know what to believe.

586
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,568
You were sick.

587
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:43,638
<i>I had to make a decision. I
thought you were gonna die.</i>

588
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,621
You believed him.

589
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,625
He stopped the medicine.

590
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,429
Here I am.

591
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,864
- I wanted to talk to you about this.
- There's nothin' to talk about.

592
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,709
You, uh,

593
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:21,685
ordered some Chinese
Internet health crap,

594
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,757
<i>and they sent the wrong
pills, and you took 'em.</i>

595
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,260
Yeah, yeah. That, uh...

596
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,257
That must be it.

597
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,813
You wanna testify?

598
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,916
Go ahead.

599
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,976
I told the doc.
He said it's okay.

600
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,022
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't.

601
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,160
All I need to know is
you're my brother, Joey.

602
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,468
If you think this...

603
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,404
thing, whatever, is
gonna make you happy,

604
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,745
then I think you should do it.

605
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,018
You should.

606
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,019
Vogler wants to fire you.

607
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,966
Lose the whole department.

608
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,662
Good thing you fought
for me though, right?

609
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:48,605
Dress was a nice move,
but you gotta follow it up.

610
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,699
Nasty weekend in Vegas.

611
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,939
Something that shows off
your real administrative skills.

612
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,844
He threatened to fire me.

613
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,084
I'm sorry.

614
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,490
So, how long do I have? I've got
a lot of personal stuff to pack up.

615
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,620
And I assume you're
gonna want to throw a party.

616
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,665
I told him I know where
the bodies are buried.

617
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:18,294
The stuff he needs to know that's not
in the books. I told him he can't ditch me.

618
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,929
He's only keeping you on because
you know the secret handshakes.

619
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,373
He's a quick study. Six months, he'll have
the moves down. He won't need you anymore.

620
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,378
- I'll deal with that then.
- So I stay.

621
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,210
Yes.

622
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,512
But some things
are going to change.

623
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,984
<i>Profits. New world order.</i>

624
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,116
Everything's about profits.
Yeah, that's real new.

625
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:44,094
You could rent out the Corvette every
once in a while or lend it to a friend.

626
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,563
That would be easy,
and it would be wrong.

627
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,429
But Cuddy stood up for you.

628
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,468
To a point.

629
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,470
To what point?

630
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:56,269
I gotta do six more clinic hours
a month. So do two of them.

631
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,175
<i>Why only two?</i>

632
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,179
'Cause one of them's gone.

633
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,708
I gotta fire somebody.

634
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,101
Good morning.

635
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,942
That's some bad hat, Harry.
