1
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,170
Did I say anything stupid?

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,078
I had two drinks.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,106
Three.

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,208
Okay. Yeah. There was
that last one also. Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:21,745
It's okay. Someday you'll be
pregnant, and you can return the favor.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,260
I feel like such a
idiot sometimes. Oh.

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,594
You know, when the baby
comes, I am gonna be...

8
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,965
You know what? You're
gonna be so great.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,799
You are.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,840
Mmm.

11
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,608
Hey!

12
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,121
You all right?

13
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,384
Uh— Uh-huh.

14
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,426
Oh, no.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,370
You know why I pulled you
over? I'm—I'm so sorry, Officer.

16
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,668
I must have, uh, dozed
off. Have you been drinking?

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,765
No. Of course she hasn't.

18
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,372
- Somebody has.
- I've been drinking.

19
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,143
You all right? Uh,
I'm—I'm—I'm not, uh...

20
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,947
How far along are
you? Uh, almost...

21
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,511
Ma'am, step out of the vehicle.

22
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>Ma'am, walk to
the rear of the car.</i>

23
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,464
<i>Naomi. Are—</i>

24
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,434
<i>Naomi?</i>

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,364
- Naomi.
- Sir, remain in the car.

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,999
<i>Hey, listen. She's not
drunk.</i> I will arrest you, sir.

27
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,374
- She's sick! Look at her.
<i>- Can you roll me another unit?</i>

28
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,470
Get back in the car.

29
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,549
<i>Naomi! Get off.</i>

30
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,880
Call an ambulance.

31
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,987
The good news is it
doesn't look like a stroke.

32
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,081
No bleeds, no clots.

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,388
Thank God. It sounds
like there's bad news.

34
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,122
We got your blood work back.
Some things are a little off.

35
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,187
Your liver and kidneys
aren't working so well.

36
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,564
Why? What would cause
that? It's preeclampsia, isn't it?

37
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,878
I'm gonna miscarry, aren't I?

38
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,765
Preeclampsia is a possibility.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

39
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,773
I've miscarried
three times. I'm 39.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,742
We had to use in vitro. You've
gotta make sure the baby's okay.

41
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,245
Let's make sure
that you're okay first.

42
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,476
<i>How about we take care of
both of you at the same time?</i>

43
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,611
The nurse will be in soon to take some
blood. I'd like to run some more tests.

44
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,986
<i>- Thank you, Doctor.</i>
- Thank you.

45
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,883
Where is everybody?
No one's in the office?

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,124
No. I haven't heard from
Cameron all day. You seen House?

47
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,099
Look for a shallow grave
with Vogler standing over it.

48
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,633
You have a stage IV cancer.

49
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,312
It's metastasized to your liver.

50
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,412
There's a new drug called 8C12
that's shown promise in Phase II trials.

51
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,083
It's your best shot.

52
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,991
Thank you, Doctor.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,655
You've been so good to me and...

54
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,097
Well, I—I did...

55
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,600
publicly bash your
company's drug.

56
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,967
When I think about
how I treated you...

57
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,370
Oh, hey. Come on.

58
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,002
There, there, there.

59
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,977
So, um, there is some hope.

60
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,214
Always.

61
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,382
But just in case, I special-ordered
an extra-jumbo-sized coffin.

62
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,256
Hey.

63
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,126
Don't thank me.
It's just who I am.

64
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,188
<i>Hey!</i>

65
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,666
Up and at 'em, big guy.

66
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,138
Sorry. Up late. Internet porn.

67
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,903
How come you're
not in your office?

68
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,413
Because there is a computer in my office,
and if I log on, romance will ensue.

69
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,211
- My wrist might fall off.
- Hiding 'cause Vogler's
looking for you, huh?

70
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,218
That's just pathetic.

71
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,689
I don't like loud, angry giants threatening
me with violence. How is that pathetic?

72
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,555
You think you can avoid firing
one of us by hiding out here?

73
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,561
He'll find you sooner or later.

74
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,563
I'm okay with later.

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,259
39-year-old female,
28 weeks pregnant.

76
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,734
- G, four. P, zero.
- Three miscarriages?

77
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,665
Gimme. <i>Altered mental status
and complete loss of coordination.</i>

78
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,904
Tox screen? Negative
for alcohol and drugs.

79
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,241
She was on oxybutynin.
For incontinence.

80
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah. Well, we took her
off. No change. B.U.N.

81
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:16,511
and creatinine are up.
L.F.T.'s slightly elevated.

82
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:21,044
Preeclampsia. Call the OB-GYN
service and rub some prayer beads.

83
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,973
B.P.'s normal. No preeclampsia
in other pregnancies.

84
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:26,287
Because she didn't
carry for long enough.

85
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,420
<i>The three miscarriages make me
think it's an underlying physiology.</i>

86
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,762
Pregnancy-related autoimmunity.

87
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,232
Too bad that Cameron quit.

88
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,137
We could use an
immunologist right now.

89
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,956
We'll see if you're
right. Check the blood.

90
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,904
Cameron quit?

91
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,070
Last night.

92
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,740
And do an M.R.A.
for vasculitis too.

93
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,443
There's no way she quit.

94
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,077
She got fired because you
couldn't swallow your pride.

95
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,782
An ultrasound?
Excellent thought.

96
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,258
And put her on magnesium
too, in case it is preeclampsia.

97
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,790
Sure.

98
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,141
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,544
I didn't do anything.
Exactly my point.

100
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,981
You wanted me to yell at him?

101
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,911
What would that have
achieved? Was he gonna

102
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,952
jump into his time
machine and fix everything?

103
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,449
When a dog dumps on the
floor, do you pat its head?

104
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,685
No. You smack it in the
nose with a newspaper.

105
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,250
Dogs can learn
things. House can't.

106
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,762
Coward. Child.

107
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,822
Hey, there.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,129
I, uh, brought my colleague
along to help out. Hi. I'm Dr. Chase.

109
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,432
Hi.

110
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,010
Well, ultrasound looks
good. No sign of fetal distress.

111
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,013
So it's not preeclampsia?

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,914
Well, it still could be, but it
hasn't progressed at least.

113
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,612
We're gonna put you on
bed rest and monitor the baby.

114
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,350
Okay. <i>We'll give you some
potassium and magnesium as well.</i>

115
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,153
We should keep
the fluids running...

116
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,457
<i>and check her again in an hour unless
there are signs of fetal distress.</i> Honey?

117
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,793
She's choking!

118
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,197
Lean forward.

119
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,701
- Is she all right?
- Probably just some muscle weakness.

120
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,295
<i>- What do you mean "probably"?</i>
- Naomi, open up.

121
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,636
People choke. It
could be nothing.

122
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,711
<i>You all right?</i>

123
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,941
I can't—I can't— I
can't even swallow.

124
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,246
She gets sick a lot.

125
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,487
Like this—this cold got
really bad all of a sudden.

126
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,528
And the fever...

127
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,120
Shh. It's okay.

128
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,167
It's not a cold. It's pneumonia.

129
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:52,103
- Pneumonia?
- Relax. Pneumonia's her
second biggest problem.

130
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,343
<i>She has gone from the 25th weight
percentile to the third in one month.</i>

131
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,904
I'm not a baby expert, but I'm pretty
sure they're not supposed to shrink.

132
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,111
Well, there's this diet we put her
on when she stopped breast-feeding.

133
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,552
But it's healthy. Um,
raw food. We're vegans.

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,851
Almond milk, tofu,
uh, vegetables.

135
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,858
Raw food.

136
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,622
If only her ancestors had
mastered the secret of fire.

137
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:20,065
Babies need fat, proteins, calories.
Less important, sprouts and hemp.

138
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,298
Starving babies is bad—
And illegal in many cultures.

139
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,398
- I'm having her admitted.
- Is she gonna be all right?

140
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:31,104
Antibiotics for the pneumonia,
I.V. feeding to get the weight up.

141
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,373
Don't worry. It's a vegan I.V.

142
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,953
Don't see any
signs of vasculitis.

143
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,962
Odd.

144
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,964
Since you're always
right about everything.

145
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,966
Could be a different
autoimmunity.

146
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,968
Or you could bite me.

147
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,595
<i>Oh, no.</i>

148
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,971
- Naomi, you okay?
- No. I can't—I'm getting cramps.

149
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,245
Strong? <i>Oh. Yeah.
Feels like my miscarriage.</i>

150
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,475
<i>Stop.</i> Preterm labor.

151
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,518
<i>He's too little.
He won't survive.</i>

152
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,729
She's on magnesium already.
Fluids and terbutaline then.

153
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,500
<i>We're gonna give you some
medicine, okay? Try to stop your labor.</i>

154
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:16,814
<i>Okay.</i>

155
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,415
<i>Okay.</i>

156
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,880
Oh! Ah.

157
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,009
There you are. Been
looking everywhere for you.

158
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,386
Uh, listen, you said that I
had to cut one of my people...

159
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,755
if I didn't give that
speech about your drug.

160
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,523
And, uh, in fairness
to your point of view,

161
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,895
my speech really wasn't the one
you had in mind, so I've cut Cameron.

162
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,232
Now we're all
squared away, right?

163
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,600
In the morning, I expect you...

164
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,041
in my office with your
letter of resignation...

165
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,477
and plans for a public apology,

166
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,741
otherwise I'll destroy you.

167
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,016
So, that's a no on us
being squared away?

168
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,825
<i>She might make it to full term.</i>

169
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,303
Contractions are less
frequent and not well organized.

170
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,808
<i>Great to see you back in the
office. I guess Vogler found you?</i>

171
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,310
Yeah. We had a nice little chat.

172
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,711
I really should
have kept Cameron.

173
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,012
- She knew where to find the sugar.
- It's what I said: preeclampsia.

174
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,111
- A little stress from the M.R.A.,
she pops right into labor.
- Aha.

175
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,920
<i>- What about the myasthenia?</i>
- Come on. She didn't seem that weak.

176
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,756
She choked. She
couldn't even swallow.

177
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,160
- What did she choke on?
- Her food.

178
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,597
<i>But muscle weakness isn't
a symptom of preeclampsia.</i>

179
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,463
What kind of food?

180
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:10,034
A little bit of cooked pear.
Doesn't matter. Shows weakness.

181
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,368
She choked on soft, wet pear?

182
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,464
Did she forget to
take the bones out?

183
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,476
<i>That's way past muscle weakness.</i>

184
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:21,675
- Did you do an upper endoscopy?
- You think there's something
obstructing her esophagus?

185
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:25,947
- We gotta talk.
- Ooh. We gotta talk.

186
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,888
And check her eyelids.

187
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,983
Check her eyelids?

188
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:38,259
<i>Special board meeting today.
Only one item on the agenda: you.</i>

189
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,527
Enjoy the bagels.
I'm untouchable.

190
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,967
Right.

191
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,903
Any vote to revoke
my tenure has to be

192
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,167
unanimous. I've got you
and maybe even Cuddy.

193
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,539
Well, that settles it.
Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider...

194
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:53,205
will be totally stymied, go home, curl
up on the floor of his shower and weep.

195
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,214
What can he do?
I got a contract.

196
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,216
Does it say how
much your team is paid,

197
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,344
where you parking space is, if your
car should be filled with horse manure?

198
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,050
Vogler's smart. He's
got some plan to get you.

199
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,218
Does it involve candy? 'Cause
I'm a sucker for chocolates.

200
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,664
- She's doing better.
- Oh, thank God.

201
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,906
Technically, Alexander
Fleming. He developed antibiotics.

202
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,005
Pneumonia's under control.

203
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,880
From now on, what say you
go with human food, okay?

204
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,887
- Absolutely. Swear to God.
- This time, that's your guy.

205
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,224
Rachel and Joel Kaplan?

206
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,351
Yes? You're under arrest.

207
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,861
You have the right to
remain silent. What did we do?

208
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,955
You're being charged
with child endangerment.

209
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:45,662
What? How?

210
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:48,195
<i>Starving your kid. I'm
from Social Services.</i>

211
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,464
We're taking
responsibility for your baby.

212
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,101
This is how Vogler's
gonna destroy me?

213
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,206
- What did he do? Grease your cane?
- He had my patients arrested.

214
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,774
Uh, no. He didn't. I did.

215
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,719
The nurses were concerned,
and they called me.

216
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,106
There was evidence
of abuse. You took a big

217
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,418
legal risk by not
calling Social Services.

218
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,825
Those parents are not
abusive. They're idiots.

219
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,795
Oh, well, that's
certainly a relief.

220
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,492
It was my call. You
made the wrong one.

221
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:24,235
You know, there's a new biography
of Quisling. I think you might like it.

222
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,000
Sure. No idea who that is.

223
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,304
Uh, Norwegian guy,
World War II, traitor.

224
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,335
- The fact that I have to explain this
takes the edge off my flow.
- I was protecting you.

225
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,780
From what? Cops
aren't gonna bust me.

226
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,408
Disciplinary Committee maybe
gives me a slap on the wrist.

227
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,147
And Vogler has an
excuse to get rid of you.

228
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,418
If I don't give him one, he makes
one up. Vogler's just one vote.

229
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,153
He's gotta convince
the other 11 of us.

230
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,993
I'm just trying to stop you
from making that extra easy.

231
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,839
<i>Dr. Charles, dial 454 1.</i>

232
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:03,741
Sean, do your wife's eyelids
look any different than usual?

233
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,971
Uh, maybe one is
drooping a little bit,

234
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,176
<i>but, you know, she's tired, so—</i>

235
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,222
Naomi, can you open your mouth
for me and, um, tilt your head back?

236
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,657
This is gonna be a
little uncomfortable.

237
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,402
Yeah. There's swelling,
indenting the esophagus.

238
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,028
<i>Is that why she choked?</i>

239
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,734
- We'll need to do an X-ray.
- What? No. The baby. You said no X-rays.

240
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,366
It's important.

241
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,911
She has a
three-centimeter mass...

242
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,913
in her right upper lobe.

243
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,350
Maybe it's a granuloma.
No. There's no calcification.

244
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,058
It's small-cell lung cancer.

245
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,962
The tumor's starting to
press against your esophagus.

246
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,237
It hasn't metastasized,
but it has spread to

247
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,593
other parts of your
lung, so we can't operate.

248
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,035
Wait. That doesn't make sense.

249
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,801
She had, uh, kidney
failure and brain problems.

250
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:12,539
Some cancer patients get what
are called paraneoplastic syndromes.

251
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,377
You were making
antibodies to fight the tumor.

252
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,576
They got sidetracked
and attacked other cells.

253
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,280
Your brain first. Then
your liver, kidneys.

254
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,687
Even the nerves that
control your eyelids.

255
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,625
That's called Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
It told us the tumor was in the lungs.

256
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,196
How bad is it?

257
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,969
Small-cell is the most
aggressive kind of lung cancer.

258
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,702
<i>The five-year survival rate
is only about 10% to 15%.</i>

259
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,377
Which is why we have to start you
on chemo and radiation right away.

260
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,160
- Radiation? What about the baby?
- You'll need a C-section
before you can start the treatment.

261
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,653
I can get you in first
thing tomorrow morning.

262
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,984
What are the chances
my baby will survive?

263
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,151
Pretty good. Twenty-eight
weeks, so about 80%.

264
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,953
No, wait. That's
one-in-five chance he'll die?

265
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,156
I really wouldn't
advise waiting.

266
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:12,399
- Naomi, you gotta
start this treatment right away.
- What happens if I wait?

267
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:18,139
Well, 29 weeks, the
survival rate is closer to 90%.

268
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,779
I'm not doing the
radiation. But you'll die if...

269
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,046
Listen. You know the
chances. They're nothing.

270
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,280
But a few more weeks
will save the baby.

271
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,088
<i>Listen. You're depressed right
now, and you’re not thinking right, so—</i>

272
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,027
Could you j— Tell her, please.

273
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,396
This cancer moves quick. The
median survival's two to four months.

274
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,303
If you postpone—even
for a week...

275
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,445
I'm sorry, honey.

276
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,413
As most of you know, Gregory House
recently gave a speech about me.

277
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,515
I'd like to return the favor.

278
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,890
- Sorry.
- Dr. Wilson.

279
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,160
I was hoping you were
gonna miss this one.

280
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:18,562
<i>A man is the sum of his actions.
Here are a few of Dr. House's.</i>

281
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:23,906
He violated a D.N.R. and
was charged with assault.

282
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,914
He brought a termite into the
O.R. and spat on a surgeon.

283
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,180
He accepted a Corvette from a patient who
was a known member of the New Jersey Mafia.

284
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,016
- Ed, look— - Edward.

285
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,081
Edward. You look at anyone's
career, you can find things that are...

286
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,854
These are the last three months.

287
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,438
<i>He's personally had
more complaints filed</i>

288
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,491
against him than any
department <i>in this hospital.</i>

289
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,230
Okay. He's screwed-up.
He's miserable.

290
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,737
And he should probably
reread the ethics code, but

291
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:55,071
it works for him. He's
saved hundreds of lives.

292
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,509
He is a drug addict who flaunts his
addiction and refuses to get treatment.

293
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,071
He is a disgrace and an
embarrassment to this hospital.

294
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,480
I'd go on, but it gets
kind of mean, so...

295
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,521
I'm gonna keep this simple.

296
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,523
House goes or I go.

297
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,222
- You shouldn't personalize this.
- And by “I," I mean
my hundred million dollars.

298
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,256
How's that for personalizing?

299
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,372
You gave us that
money for a reason.

300
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,238
Are you really willing to throw it
all away because of one doctor?

301
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:34,576
Gregory House is a symbol of everything
wrong with the health care industry.

302
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,549
<i>Waste. Insubordination.</i>

303
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,317
Doctors preening like they're kings, and
the hospital is their own private fiefdom.

304
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:46,120
Health care is a business.
I'm gonna run it like one.

305
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,691
I hereby move to revoke the
tenure of Dr. Gregory House...

306
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,494
and terminate his employment at
this hospital, effective immediately.

307
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,126
- Don't you think we should discuss this?
- We just did.

308
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,603
- We need time— - The vote
is on the table. All in favor?

309
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,966
<i>Dr. Wilson.</i> Opposed.

310
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,306
The motion is defeated.

311
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,544
Dr. Wilson, would you mind
leaving the room, please?

312
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,311
- Excuse me?
- We're going to take another vote.

313
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,546
<i>Well, first of all, you can't void my
vote by making me stand in the hallway.</i>

314
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,353
And second, you
should check the bylaws.

315
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,862
You need notice and at least one business
day before you can reconsider any matter.

316
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,626
We're voting on a different matter,
which you are conflicted out of.

317
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,861
How can I be conflicted?

318
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,733
This vote is whether to
dismiss Dr. James Wilson.

319
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,864
<i>Naomi is refusing
to have the C-section.</i>

320
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,343
Her odds aren't good enough.

321
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,280
They do suck. Where's Wilson?

322
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,182
Paged him twice. She does
this, she knows she's gonna die.

323
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:57,246
She's saving her child. Cameron would point
out that people are capable of sacrifice.

324
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,519
Cameron isn't here.

325
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,359
- Perhaps proving her point.
- You think this woman
is making a rational decision?

326
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,297
I think people can
overcome their baser drives.

327
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,732
Pretty damn rarely.

328
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,566
And not this time.
This is purely biological.

329
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,233
In evolutionary terms, the needs of
the next generation are more important.

330
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,624
You're saying she's
making the right call?

331
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:18,766
Darwin is. I'm not.

332
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,439
The next generation
is not my patient.

333
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,212
We have to raise
the odds for Mommy.

334
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,412
Where the hell is Wilson?
He's the oncologist.

335
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,820
Good plan. Cure cancer.

336
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,121
I'm surprised no one
ever thought of that before.

337
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,522
There he is.

338
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,030
Dr. House.

339
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:42,694
You guys bust out? We made bail.
They won't let us in our baby's room.

340
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,709
Weird. You think they'd
let you take her home

341
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,830
while they figured out
if you tried to kill her.

342
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,273
We're good parents. We fed
her whenever she was hungry.

343
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,572
Big meals. We had no
idea that diet was so bad.

344
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,955
The nutritionist said it had
everything she needed. Listen.

345
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,251
The kid who stacks the
free-range grapefruit in

346
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,474
your health food store
is not a nutritionist.

347
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,486
But my uncle is.

348
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,988
He went to college
and everything.

349
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,996
- Foreman, I need a C.T.
scan on— - Olive Kaplan.

350
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,763
Seriously?

351
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,273
Olive Kaplan.

352
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,708
Look for abscesses or
occult infections. Yeah.

353
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,803
Bye-bye.

354
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,783
Listen. Vogler's all
about clinical trials.

355
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,826
<i>The hospital's
chock full of them.</i>

356
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,361
There's gotta be something
for small-cell lung cancer.

357
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,164
What are you doing?

358
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,530
I got sacked.

359
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,127
Did you make a pass at Cuddy?

360
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,672
I told you. She only
has thighs for me.

361
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,640
I voted to keep you.

362
00:22:56,408 --> 00:23:00,072
So he's getting rid of every board
member who votes to keep me around.

363
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,671
Yeah. Every one of us.

364
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,377
Just you? Yep.

365
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,751
But you're only
off the board, right?

366
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:12,155
They couldn't have gotten
unanimous approval for you.

367
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,524
Brown from oncology
voted no. So did Cuddy,

368
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,530
Taylor and Peavey.

369
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,465
Oh, so you're off
the board. Big deal.

370
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,593
Frees up Wednesday
nights for bowling.

371
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,400
You're still a doctor. Getting
dumped looks great in <i>Who's Who.</i>

372
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,566
Vogler gave me the
option of resigning.

373
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,899
And I took it.

374
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,878
Big of him. I got no kids.

375
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,711
My marriages sucks. I only had
two things that worked for me.

376
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,876
This job and this stupid
screwed-up friendship,

377
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,386
and neither mattered enough
to you to give one lousy speech.

378
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,252
They matter.

379
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,233
If I could do it all again—
You'd do the same thing.

380
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:08,581
Well, you'll be gone soon too.

381
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,650
Those clinical trials?

382
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,123
I'll make some calls.

383
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,802
Thanks.

384
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,646
It's—It's not cancer.
It's not gonna kill me?

385
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:48,984
- It's hemorrhoids.
- But all that blood—
I mean, that can't be right.

386
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,319
Looks worse than it is.

387
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,085
- Nice job of protecting me.
- Can this wait?

388
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,755
His ass can wait. You save
my job by sacking Wilson?

389
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,322
What did you think would happen
when you made that speech?

390
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,836
That you would just pout for a
little while and we'd all forgive you?

391
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,667
<i>You don't spit on the man
that signs your paycheck.</i>

392
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,299
First Cameron, then Wilson.

393
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,105
You're next. Pull your pants up.

394
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,771
<i>So it's about the money. Of
course it's about the money.</i>

395
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:18,944
The money Vogler gave, he could have
bought a few jets, maybe a baseball team.

396
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,147
<i>Or just stuck it in Chase
Manhattan and collected interest.</i>

397
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:26,682
But he gave it to us to buy
equipment, to do research.

398
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,220
You are a great doctor, House, but you
are not worth a hundred million dollars.

399
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,696
<i>We've sequenced the
D. N.A. of the tumor cells.</i>

400
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,639
P53 gene mutation at codon
55. She's perfect for your trial.

401
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,176
Hmm. She's pretty far advanced.

402
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:48,544
Well, you want easy cases,
you picked the wrong specialty.

403
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,484
Otherwise in good
health? Excellent.

404
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,012
When can she start?
Middle of next week.

405
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,891
Cancer's already stage III. It'd be a
waste of time. She can start in two days.

406
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,555
<i>She can't start in two
days. She's pregnant.</i>

407
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,156
She won't be in two days.

408
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,327
- I've scheduled a C-section.
- She'd still have to wait a month.

409
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,702
You can't take part in any trial for
at least 30 days after major surgery.

410
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,174
Well, it's definitely
surgery, but major?

411
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,577
It's not your call. Again,
question of interpretation.

412
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,673
You're scamming a doctor? Now?

413
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,218
Come on. Vogler's looking
for any excuse to can you.

414
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,720
Oh, I think he's got a
big bag of those already.

415
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,608
These regulations
aren't just here to annoy

416
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,519
you. Doing this is
dangerous to the patient.

417
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,493
Well, I'll be sure
and let her know that.

418
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,553
Care to join me?

419
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:45,233
Angiogenesis inhibitors prevent the
tumors from creating blood vessels.

420
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,273
Without blood,
the tumor starves.

421
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,433
That sounds great.
What about the baby?

422
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:53,240
The treatment would
be fatal to the baby.

423
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,976
I've scheduled a C-section
for this afternoon. No.

424
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,076
It's in the trial phase
right now, but so far...

425
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,247
<i>complete remission in
more than 30% of subjects.</i>

426
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:08,122
- I told Dr. Foreman I didn't want a C-section.
- When your chances of living were less
than a third of what they are now.

427
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,954
Well, if the baby's
premature, then...

428
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,398
Our Pediatrics department has
the best neonatal I.C.U. in the state.

429
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,437
No. His lungs. His
brain. He's not ready.

430
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,668
And he could be fine. You don't
know what it's like raising a sick child.

431
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,734
<i>His odds are much
better than yours are.</i>

432
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,179
You have to let
them at least try this.

433
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,581
- Talk to her.
- Okay.

434
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,576
Leave the room.

435
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,622
Okay.

436
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,892
How long have you
been taking oxybutynin?

437
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,960
Uh, since I was about 20.

438
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,537
Incontinence is pretty
uncommon in a woman of your age.

439
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,134
It's even more bizarre
in a woman in her 20s.

440
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,147
I guess I haven't had the best
luck when it comes to my health.

441
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,808
Seems that way.

442
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:10,447
You said to your husband, "You don't
know what it's like raising a sick child."

443
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,321
You didn't say, "You don't
know what it <i>would</i> be like."

444
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,487
This is not your
first child, is it?

445
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,658
And he doesn't know.

446
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,064
I was 18.

447
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:32,236
I got pregnant, got married.

448
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:36,840
I had the most
beautiful little girl. Grace.

449
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,712
She had infantile
Alexander's disease.

450
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,092
I'm sorry. Two years
we watched her die.

451
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,493
My husband was a— Uh,
my first husband was a...

452
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,560
A great guy,

453
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:58,536
but after that I couldn't even
look at him without thinking of her.

454
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,335
I left him.

455
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,672
I left my job. I left
everything. Very moving story.

456
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,043
Explains why you're
being so selfish.

457
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,207
I'm willing to die to
protect my husband.

458
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,775
Because it's what you want.
Your husband wants you to live.

459
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,846
Well, he doesn't understand—
Oh, who the hell does?

460
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,892
Tragedies happen.

461
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,224
If you think that turning yourself into a
disposable incubator for a few weeks...

462
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,561
is gonna protect your baby from
all the crap in this world, go ahead.

463
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,796
Die happy. I got no problem
with people killing themselves.

464
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,860
But don't think it
makes you a hero.

465
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,308
Okay.

466
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,222
You're scheduled for 4:00 p.m.

467
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,291
Yes. This is Dr. Lim.

468
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,840
Count down from 10.

469
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,504
Okay.

470
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,604
Ten,

471
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,014
nine,

472
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,075
eight...

473
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,613
<i>Tray setup.</i> That seemed
kind of fast. Is she all right?

474
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,591
She's fine.

475
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,323
Wake her up. That was
Vogler. Surgery is off.

476
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,337
Hey! You're killing her!

477
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,595
Really? I thought you
were the one trying to ram

478
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:50,872
her into a drug trial five
minutes after surgery.

479
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,975
She knows the risk.
She was fully informed.

480
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,180
Well, the guy running the study
sure wasn't. Not his life. Not his call.

481
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,281
- His study, his call.
<i>- Right. So she kicks off,</i>
<i>his numbers look bad.</i>

482
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,657
<i>The numbers look
bad, the study looks bad.</i>

483
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,822
Which would cost you money! And
keep a lifesaving protocol off the market.

484
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,627
One person! One
blip in the data!

485
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,032
Ever heard of the F.D.A.?
They eat blips for breakfast.

486
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,071
One person should
never endanger thousands.

487
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,437
Well, thank God you were
here to save all those lives!

488
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,540
The board's meeting
again this evening.

489
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,711
Why don't you settle down,
play some Game Boy?

490
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,948
Why don't you watch your soap?

491
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:34,220
I hear they're firing the handsome doctor
today. Boy, that should be a good one.

492
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,799
If we had the C-section anyway,

493
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,901
she could still do the
experimental treatment, right?

494
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:56,608
- We'd just have to wait 30 days.
- Assuming the doctor running the trial
isn't too pissed off to let her in.

495
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,845
And assuming I'm
even healthy enough to...

496
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,944
Honey.

497
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,708
Are you okay?

498
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:05,582
<i>Sats are dropping— - down to
the 80s. Stay with us, Naomi.</i>

499
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,422
What's going on? <i>We
need you to leave the room.</i>

500
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,730
<i>Respiratory distress.</i>

501
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,392
- Could you tell me
what's going on?
- We're trying to find out.

502
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,363
<i>Here.</i> Still kicking.

503
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,465
Flash pulmonary edema?

504
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,101
Lungs are clear. Here it is.

505
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,271
- Pulmonary embolus.
- Gotta get her to an O.R.

506
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,871
<i>- Now. Right away.
- Uh, what happened?</i>

507
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,112
It's an embolism—a blood clot.
Fairly common with lung cancer.

508
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,456
It's not a full saddle embolism.
So blood's still trickling

509
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,698
through. We've been able
to get Naomi breathing a little,

510
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:41,352
but we need to remove the clot, and we need
you to approve the treatment. Of course.

511
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,396
Whatever you have to do,
just do it. It's not that simple.

512
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,076
The best course for
the baby would be an

513
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,900
immediate C-section.
The longer we postpone,

514
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,733
the greater chance he'll have brain damage
from lack of oxygen. Fine. Just do it.

515
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,772
Here's the problem.

516
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,436
The C-section would be very, very
dangerous for Naomi. Dangerous like...

517
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:03,345
In her current condition, there's
a real chance she won't survive.

518
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,918
I'm sorry.

519
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,183
Your wife's unconscious. We
need you to make a decision.

520
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,055
I just want her to live.

521
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,121
No C-section.

522
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,741
Sats are still way down. We
gotta push the streptokinase.

523
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,459
Too risky. Even if it dissolves
the clot, she could still bleed out...

524
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,578
- She's hemodynamically compromised.
- It's not good for the baby.

525
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,144
Dad doesn't care.

526
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,588
Bolusing 250,000 units.

527
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,460
B.P.'s dropping.

528
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,898
<i>Pressors.</i> Don't have
time. We've gotta suck it out.

529
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,734
Systolic B.P.'s 80.

530
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,866
B.P.'s stabilizing.

531
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,277
O₂ sats rising.

532
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,411
- Did you get the clot?
- I think so.

533
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:17,115
<i>She's stabilized.</i> How long
was her oxygen at that level?

534
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,454
- About 10 minutes.
- Brain function compromised?

535
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,085
Shouldn't be, but we'll...

536
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,495
B.P.'s dropping.
Up the dopamine.

537
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,796
- She's not responding. How much?
- Up to 30 micrograms.

538
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:31,803
Is she septic?

539
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,635
She's bleeding into her abdomen.

540
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,698
We won't be able to stop it.

541
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,504
<i>I'll go talk to the husband.</i>

542
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,348
No. You stay here. Keep her as
stable as you can for as long as you can.

543
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,494
She had trauma
during the procedure.

544
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,333
She's bleeding into her abdomen.

545
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,336
There's nothing
we can do. I'm sorry.

546
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,669
Oh. No.

547
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,801
I need you to okay the C-section.
That's gonna kill her, right?

548
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,311
Probably will.

549
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,315
I can't do that.

550
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,544
She's dying either way.

551
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,533
I'm—I'm sorry.

552
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:23,316
Stay with me, Sean. I
need your okay on this.

553
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,726
She makes the
decisions, and I'm...

554
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,853
Right. And that's gonna be tough
from now on, but this decision is easy.

555
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,825
You know what she'd want. Yeah.

556
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,668
I can't do— You make this
call, only two things change.

557
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:44,540
One, yeah, you feel guilty for
killing your wife. Two, your baby lives.

558
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,944
Naomi's baby lives.

559
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,888
Okay. Okay.

560
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,260
He's out. Umbilical
cord's clamped.

561
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,793
- No respiration.
- His lungs aren't opening up.

562
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,806
They aren't mature.

563
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,900
Come on. Take a breath.
You know you can do it.

564
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:21,310
What you got?

565
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,541
- Looks like V-fib.
<i>- Pulse?</i>

566
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,642
- No. Paddles.
<i>- Right here.</i>

567
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,483
Come on. Come on.

568
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,787
<i>Clear!</i>

569
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,917
- Nothing.
- Charging.

570
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,053
- Good boy. Open up.
- How's he doin'?

571
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,931
Still not breathing.
We've gotta intubate.

572
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,229
Clear!

573
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,265
Thank you.

574
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,535
I'm late for the board
meeting. We need to talk.

575
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,668
I don't want to hear
it. It's about a patient.

576
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,525
The pregnant woman?
She wasn't qualified for

577
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,272
that trial. And I'm
not gonna apologize...

578
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,707
I'm not talking about
her. At this point, I think it's

579
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:34,115
best if I concentrate on
patients who are still alive.

580
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:39,889
Pulmonary embolism. She
bled out. Saved her son.

581
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:46,358
This is Olive Kaplan's C.T. scan—
The incredible shrinking baby.

582
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,861
Her thymus gland.

583
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,897
DiGeorge syndrome. It's genetic.
Caused the gland to wither to nothing.

584
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,570
This is why she couldn't
gain weight. Yeah.

585
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:04,581
I'll call the police and Social Services
and have all the charges withdrawn.

586
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,873
I've sent a test down to
confirm. When it comes back,

587
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:09,144
you should start Olive on
immunoglobulin replacement.

588
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,746
You're not gonna do it?

589
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,523
Well, I assume I won't be here.

590
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,550
Your boy is doing good.

591
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:05,433
<i>It's the same motion as
yesterday, people. Same reasons.</i>

592
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,948
All those in favor of dismissing
Gregory House, raise a hand.

593
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,588
<i>Dr. Cuddy,</i>

594
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,252
you realize this
is going to happen.

595
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,989
- I can't do it.
- You can't abstain.

596
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,138
I'm not abstaining.
I'm voting no.

597
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,875
You've changed your
mind since yesterday?

598
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,400
What did he do? Buy you dinner and
roses? Threaten to drown your dog?

599
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,811
- He did his job.
- Right.

600
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,816
He saved another life.

601
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,579
Maybe. <i>Good for him.</i>

602
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,018
- It's great. It's not the point.
- It's what we do.

603
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:52,751
<i>And you could do it a lot better if you
didn't have to worry about some madman...</i>

604
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,850
running around the hospital
accountable to no one.

605
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,872
- But that's not the choice
you're giving us.
- House won't listen to anyone.

606
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,958
And you're not accountable to anybody
either. Because you think you own us.

607
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,367
I move for the immediate
dismissal of Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

608
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,268
<i>She's upset. We all are.</i>

609
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,671
Why would you risk
your career to save him?

610
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,608
If you think House deserves to
go— If you think I deserve to go,

611
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:21,380
<i>Wilson deserved
to go, then vote yes.</i>

612
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,747
But if you're doing
this because you are

613
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:26,322
afraid of losing his
money, then he's right.

614
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,383
He does own you.

615
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,536
You have a choice. Maybe
the last real one you'll have here.

616
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,409
Cuddy is a genius.

617
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,355
<i>Convincing four people to give up
a fortune to save our sorry asses.</i>

618
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,822
<i>- Dr. Cuddy, the man of the hour.</i>
- Hey, hey!

619
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,694
<i>Hey.</i> What are you doing?

620
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,928
We're drinking. I would have
thought that was pretty obvious.

621
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,436
To the great
champion. Saved you,

622
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,699
saved Wilson—
Saved the whole team.

623
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,553
Of course none of them
would have needed saving if

624
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:31,017
you could actually get along
with another human being.

625
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:34,082
Thank you, Miss Buzz Kill.

626
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,923
Well, you only cost us a
hundred million dollars.

627
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,089
Could have saved some lives,

628
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,224
<i>could have made a few jobs,
helped a few people—yippee.</i>

629
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,428
You voted to get rid of him.

630
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,494
The lesser of two evils.

631
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,135
You should be mourning.

632
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,201
I know I am.

633
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,136
That's some bad hat, Harry.
