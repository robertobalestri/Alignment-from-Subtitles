1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,199
<i>Radiologist, contact 53 1 7.</i>

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,708
<i>Radiologist, contact 53 1 7.</i>

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,039
<i>Amber.</i> No.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,978
<i>Why not?</i> Amber's
a stripper name.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,346
<i>Find me one stripper
named Amber Hartig.</i>

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,351
<i>Or not. Okay.</i>

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,047
<i>- Non-stripper names.
- Um, Desiree?</i>

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,056
<i>Bambi? Kandy Kane?</i>

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,490
Max.

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,494
Maxine.

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,053
Max Hartig. It's a
cute name, isn't it?

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,396
<i>If you’re a professional
boxer, maybe.</i>

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,766
Can you believe we
made this little creature?

14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:40,240
I know. It's incredible. It's the
most amazing thing we've ever done.

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,608
I almost ran the
marathon last year.

16
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,772
If we're lucky, you won't inherit
your daddy's sense of humor.

17
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,612
Hello. Say “hi" to Bear.

18
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,848
She hasn't even eaten
anything. Why is she spitting up?

19
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,859
Well, honey, we can't bug
them again. Could you...

20
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,327
Okay, okay.

21
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,965
<i>I'm sorry. It's our first kid. We're
both a little panicky, I guess.</i>

22
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,732
Well, you gotta ask the pediatrician
next time. I just deliver 'em.

23
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,968
- Is she spitting up?
- Yeah. Second time in an hour.

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,034
Oh. If you lived
underwater for nine months,

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,602
you'd have a lot to spit up too.

26
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,909
Is something wrong?
A little lethargic.

27
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:29,787
Well, we didn't
think— - She's hot.

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,825
Is she, uh...

29
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,919
The baby's seizing!
Get the crash cart!

30
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,658
<i>- What's-What's wrong?
- Need some help in here!</i>

31
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,257
Oh, God. Is she all right?

32
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,326
<i>- I. V. access?</i>
- No. Ativan.

33
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,894
What's going on?

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,739
The M.R.I.'s back.

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,369
And? It's what we expected.

36
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,279
The accident caused
serious damage.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,942
It's amnesia.

38
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,449
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

39
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,585
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

40
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,861
Enjoying our lounge, House?

41
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,099
Just came in to get milk for
my coffee, which you're out of.

42
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,266
- Flat or sparkling?
- Sparkling.
- Splat.

43
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,938
<i>So, the Hartigs?</i>

44
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,278
Their baby gets a fever. <i>What,
don't tell me— the kid had a seizure.</i>

45
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,293
Yep. The parents, of
course, start freaking,

46
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,150
and I have to deal
with that for an hour.

47
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,018
<i>Like it was your fault.</i> She
was perfect when I delivered her.

48
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,287
If you wanna blame someone, blame
the pediatrician. <i>So, how is the kid now?</i>

49
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,626
<i>Bowel obstruction. She's
under observation. She'll be fine.</i>

50
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,690
<i>The pediatrician
will take all the credit.</i>

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,068
<i>Exhibit A: Baby Girl Hartig.</i>

52
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,135
<i>Term baby, 42 hours old.</i>

53
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,307
Went into seizures six hours ago,
brought into the intensive care...

54
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,284
diagnosed with obstruction
of the small bowel.

55
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,911
I'm still amazed you're actually
in the same room with a patient.

56
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,979
People don't bug me
until they get teeth.

57
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,321
Exhibit B: Baby Boy Hausen.

58
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,623
<i>Another term baby, 48 hours old.</i>

59
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,789
Brought into the NICU three
hours before the Hartig baby.

60
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,959
<i>Fever of unknown origin,
101 degrees, trending upwards.</i>

61
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,969
Wow, that is amazing.

62
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,015
You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge all
morning and heard about two sick babies.

63
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,271
- It's—It's eerie.
<i>- Don't touch that.</i>

64
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,335
All right. We have an infection
spreading in the hospital.

65
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,905
These kids have totally
unrelated illnesses.

66
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,508
They fell sick within
four hours of each other.

67
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,683
They had the same delivery
rooms, maternity rooms

68
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,613
are neighboring, so
transmission's possible.

69
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,568
- They have the same symptoms.
- The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.

70
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,738
No matter how close their beds are, I'm
pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.

71
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,254
What does bowel
obstruction on a chart indicate?

72
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,062
Normally I'd say it indicates a
patient's bowel is obstructed,

73
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,626
but I'm pretty sure you have
some deeper truth to impart.

74
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,909
It means that some random
doctor of indeterminate

75
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,300
skill <i>thinks</i> that the
patient's bowel is obstructed.

76
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,520
- Okay, you're upset because
they threw you out of their lounge.
- Look at the X-ray.

77
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,379
It's a normal gas pattern. If you want, I
can get you a key to the oncology lounge.

78
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,440
Air in the colon.
We're getting TiVo.

79
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,850
If it's air, no
bowel obstruction.

80
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,912
Even if it is air, it could have
been there before the obstruction.

81
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,982
No. Something's
infected both these infants.

82
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,919
And you're the only one who
put this together because...

83
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,330
Because I'm the only one
who looked at both kids.

84
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,062
I want them isolated. I want
the maternity ward shut down.

85
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,798
Because you're better at
reading an X-ray than a radiologist.

86
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,811
Radiologists always
over read babies' X-rays,

87
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:09,104
especially if they're asked
to rule out a pathology.

88
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,578
- He read into it what he wanted.
- Which is exactly what you're doing.

89
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,878
You're finding a cluster because you
think it's interesting to find a cluster.

90
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,249
Two plain old sick
babies would bore you.

91
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,084
See, this is why I don't
waste money on shrinks,

92
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,647
'cause you give me all these
really great insights for free.

93
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,354
Shrink. If you would consider going
to a shrink, I would pay for it myself.

94
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,592
The hospital would hold a
bake sale, for God's sake.

95
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,066
We have an epidemic!

96
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:39,539
Two sick babies is very sad,
but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

97
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,781
How many do?

98
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,244
Get up. We're going hunting.

99
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,380
For what?

100
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,617
Wabbits.

101
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,338
Hi. Bye.

102
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,896
He's screaming. He's fine.

103
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,312
Good-looking baby.

104
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,418
Oh, sorry. Wrong
room. We'll see you later.

105
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,683
Twelve rooms, right? That's it?

106
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,249
Yep. We've definitely
checked the whole floor.

107
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,257
Good news. No epidemic.

108
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,322
Tragic, huh?

109
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,602
Overflow rooms, third floor.

110
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,266
This imaginary infection
has spread to the next floor?

111
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,942
We were just gonna call.
Did he get hot all of a sudden?

112
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,739
Yeah.

113
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,983
<i>Yeah, I'll take
care of that for you.</i>

114
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,719
<i>Almost there, honey. Don't
worry. We're almost there.</i>

115
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,322
Excuse me! Hi. Hi.

116
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,944
Intake sent you up here? Yeah,
my wife's contractions are less than...

117
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,199
Okay, Intake messed
up. I am very, very sorry.

118
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,739
Nurse Alpert will arrange
for an ambulance...

119
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,243
to take you to
Princeton General.

120
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,747
The maternity ward is temporarily
closed. We have to leave?

121
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,749
Yes. I am very sorry.
Why are you doing this?

122
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,809
You will be there
very, very soon.

123
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,421
Happy now? No.

124
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,324
But I am interested.

125
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:49,498
Three sick babies, and a
fourth showing early symptoms.

126
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,504
- How bad?
- Spiking fevers.

127
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,040
B.P.'s plummeting. They're
barely able to keep systolic up.

128
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,619
At this rate, they
could be dead in a day.

129
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,585
Where did this come from?

130
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,377
<i>Two delivery rooms,
four different maternity</i>

131
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,478
<i>rooms. No common personnel
and no common equipment.</i>

132
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,312
- There's got to be something in common.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,547
That would be the difference
between an epidemic and a coincidence.

134
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,714
I'm putting a team together.
We're gonna start swabbing.

135
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,726
What's she gonna swab? Every respirator,
sink, vent, drain in the entire hospital?

136
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,538
- That'll take months.
- Needle in a haystack.

137
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,441
It's worse than that, We don't even
know it's a needle we're looking for.

138
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:23,369
- Then why'd you let her go do it?
- Because the hospital is her baby,
and her baby's sick.

139
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,160
If she doesn't solve this
soon, her head's gonna

140
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:26,749
explode, and I don't
want to get any on me.

141
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,708
<i>So let's figure out
what's in the haystack.</i>

142
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,903
- Differential diagnosis, people.
- Parasite.

143
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,503
- It's spreading too quickly.
- Next?

144
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,915
- Virus?
- The kids are too sick, and the blood tests
showed no lymphocytosis.

145
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,476
And they're not responding
to acyclovir or ribavirin.

146
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,898
<i>If it's some other virus, we'll
never find it in time anyway.</i>

147
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,859
Which leads us to
bacterial infection.

148
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,759
<i>It's not responding
to broad-spectrum</i>

149
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:51,091
<i>antibiotics, so we've
got something resistant.</i>

150
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,191
<i>- The usual suspects?</i>
- MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.

151
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,759
Maybe contaminated
food or water source.

152
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,702
Pseudomonas.

153
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,866
V.R.E.? "H" flu.

154
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,774
Okay. Those are the big ones.

155
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,644
Cultures will take 48 hours.
Might as well be postmortem.

156
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,879
We'll start them on vancomycin for the
MRSA and aztreonam to cover the rest.

157
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:17,049
<i>Let's get M.R.I. 's, check for
abscesses or some occult infection.</i>

158
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,254
I'll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find
something important... or unimportant.

159
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,191
<i>We did an M.R.I.
on all the babies,</i>

160
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:27,684
<i>and, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything,</i>

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,720
so we're starting them on the
strongest antibiotics that we've got,

162
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,132
and we're hoping that
that will take care of it.

163
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,466
But he's so tiny.

164
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,472
How sick is he?

165
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,634
His fever's up to 103.5, and
his blood pressure is 80 over 40.

166
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,144
How, um— How bad is that?

167
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,105
Uh...

168
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:53,017
It-It's low. The heart
needs to circulate the blood.

169
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,217
<i>If it's weak, the oxygen isn't getting
to the liver, the kidneys, the brain.</i>

170
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,727
Um, I have to ask you something.

171
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,489
<i>Judy— No, no, Kim. Let me.</i>

172
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,895
Um, I had a cold last month,
and I told the doctors about it.

173
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,061
Honey, this has
nothing to do with you.

174
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,503
Kim's right.

175
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,167
Your son was born healthy.

176
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,506
<i>He caught the
infection after his birth.</i>

177
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,172
There's no reason to think
that he caught it from you.

178
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,581
But you don't know. I mean,
you don't know how he got sick.

179
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:33,491
Pretty standard question— "How
sick is my child?" You couldn't answer.

180
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,292
I answered. You rattled
off numbers— B.P., O₂ sats.

181
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,530
It's not what they need
to know. What they need

182
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,698
to know is the future.
You got a Magic 8 ball?

183
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,431
No, just eight years
of medical training.

184
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,304
Look, I realize it's tough to
break bad news to families.

185
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,471
Not as tough as hearing it.

186
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,779
And I guess being the poor
guy dying is the toughest of all?

187
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,342
No.

188
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,913
It's easier to die than
to watch someone die.

189
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,890
<i>Well, we're checking the
vents. It could be airborne.</i>

190
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,026
<i>Somebody get the sinks,
too, and underneath them.</i>

191
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,036
I'll get it.

192
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,096
How many med students have
you got swabbing the decks?

193
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,075
What else are they gonna do?
It's not like they're delivering babies.

194
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,702
You find anything yet? Uh, yeah.

195
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,510
About half the antibacterial gel
dispensers are empty or broken.

196
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,246
That's bad, yet diagnostically
completely insignificant.

197
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,257
Well, if the staff can't wash their hands,
it's no wonder an infection has spread.

198
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,453
Hey! Tie clip! Sorry?

199
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,124
We have an epidemic in this hospital,
and your tie is becoming a petri dish.

200
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,658
Put on a tie clip or
take the damn thing off.

201
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,899
<i>My joints have
been feeling all loose,</i>

202
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,939
<i>and lately I've been
feeling sick a lot.</i>

203
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,944
<i>Maybe I'm over-training.</i>

204
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,675
<i>I'm doing the marathon, like, 10 miles a
day, but I can't seem to lose any weight.</i>

205
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,445
Lift up your arms.

206
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,951
You have a parasite.

207
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:14,119
Like a tapeworm or something?
Lie back and lift up your sweater.

208
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,186
You can put your arms down.

209
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,290
Can you do anything about
it? Only for about a month or so.

210
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,495
After that it becomes illegal to
remove, except in a couple states.

211
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,164
Illegal? But don't worry.

212
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,141
Many women learn to
embrace this parasite.

213
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,373
They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes,
arrange playdates with other parasites.

214
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,814
- Playdates?
- It has your eyes.

215
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,220
But that's impossible.

216
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,621
Well, I assume you
weren't getting your period.

217
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,660
Maybe that should
have given you an inkling.

218
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,423
But I'm on this birth control
implant. Yeah, I know.

219
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,799
I saw the scar on your
arm. And my doctor said I

220
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,297
might not get any periods
at all if it was working.

221
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,667
<i>Mm-hmm. Interestingly enough, you also
don't get any periods if it isn't working,</i>

222
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,571
which is why you were supposed
to get regular pregnancy tests.

223
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,735
Oh! <i>I'm gonna send a nurse in
here to schedule your prenatal care.</i>

224
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,110
You're due in about five months,
so start planning the shower.

225
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,383
Um, Doctor?

226
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,980
Please, me and my husband
wanted to have a kid soon,

227
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,490
but, oh, God,

228
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:22,859
like four months ago,
we had this really big fight.

229
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:27,230
He moved out. I
did something stupid.

230
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,067
One-night stand? Ex-boyfriend.

231
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,403
Well, I'll schedule
you a paternity test too.

232
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,773
I can't let my husband know.

233
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,278
Does the old boyfriend
look like your husband?

234
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,076
Yeah.

235
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,447
Then just have the
kid. He'll never know.

236
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,487
The most successful
marriages are based on lies.

237
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,284
You're off to a great start.

238
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,590
<i>Well, you look cheery.
What's going on?</i>

239
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,459
<i>The Hartig and Chen-Lupino
babies, their kidneys are shutting down.</i>

240
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,090
And the urine
tests show no casts.

241
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,970
Which means the antibiotics
are causing the kidney failure.

242
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,564
You're the nephrologist. Which
one did it? We'll take 'em off that one.

243
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,905
- Don't tell me
both vancomycin and aztreonam.
- They both can cause this.

244
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,972
There's no way to know
which one it is. No test.

245
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,382
We can't take 'em off the antibiotics
though. They'll die of the infection.

246
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,997
If we leave them on both the
antibiotics, they'll die of kidney failure.

247
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,254
<i>So, we take our best guess then.
Which drug's causing the kidney failure?</i>

248
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,956
It's like I said, it's always MRSA in
hospitals. Take them off aztreonam.

249
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,432
I still think it's the pseudomonas. I
vote to take them off the vancomycin.

250
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,499
There's no point in guessing.

251
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,472
Take one kid off vancomycin,
the other off aztreonam.

252
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,122
They have the same disease. You
want to give them different treatments?

253
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:54,062
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,319
- Therapeutic trial,
to find the cause of the infection.
- That's wrong.

255
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,520
We have four sick kids at least.

256
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:05,240
- Who knows how many more
haven't started showing symptoms yet?
- We have a duty to these two.

257
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,701
If these two have different reactions,
we'll know how to save the rest.

258
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:13,206
So you're condemning one of these
kids to die based on random chance?

259
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,205
I guess I am.

260
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,992
<i>So you're going to flip a coin?</i>

261
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,120
That's how you decide
which baby lives?

262
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,824
Can I borrow a quarter?

263
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,333
Do you want to get sued,
lose your license, House?

264
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,461
Well, generally I'd applaud that,
but my job is to protect this hospital,

265
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,666
<i>so I strongly advise you to
come up with a medical rationale...</i>

266
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,936
<i>why baby "A "should get
medicine "X" and vice versa.</i>

267
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,447
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there,
slick. We didn't all go to law school.

268
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,821
<i>Your advice is that I should
use medical reasons to make</i>

269
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:59,009
<i>medical decisions? Hmm,
that's not gonna be as easy.</i>

270
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,611
Any medical justification. It
doesn't need to be a good one.

271
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,097
Well, "Hartig" sounds
Jewish, so does aztreonam,

272
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,352
so we'll take the Hartig
kid off vancomycin.

273
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,553
How's that?

274
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,496
- You can't experiment on babies.
- Doctors experiment all the time.

275
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:15,296
<i>- On adults, with their consent.</i>
- Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

276
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,305
Their informed consent.
They have to know the

277
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,203
other kid is getting
a different treatment.

278
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,224
Sorry. Can't do that. It
would be unethical for one

279
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,185
patient to know about
another patient's treatment.

280
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,403
They have a right to know.

281
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:27,340
If they know, they won't consent.
That defeats the whole purpose.

282
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,644
That's their right.

283
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,708
Two more babies have
just become symptomatic.

284
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,777
I defer to your legal wisdom.

285
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:39,554
Which takes precedence— six dying
babies or a missing consent form?

286
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,220
You can't do it.

287
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,165
Do what you think is best.

288
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,030
Your daughter's kidneys
are shutting down.

289
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,431
Your son's kidneys are failing.

290
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,526
So we're going to take
her off the aztreonam.

291
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,435
We're taking him off vancomycin.

292
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,599
Uh, but what— what made
her sick in the first place?

293
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,543
- What do you think is causing it?
- It seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.

294
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,481
We think it's MRSA—
Methicillin-resistant staph aureus.

295
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,576
It's a very resistant form
of a very common bacteria.

296
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,121
We're hoping the
aztreonam will clear it up.

297
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:46,125
Vancomycin is the best treatment for
MRSA, so we're gonna keep giving it to her.

298
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,957
Is it gonna cure her?

299
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:56,331
Your child is very sick.
You need to know that.

300
00:18:56,402 --> 00:19:00,066
This is a Hail Mary pass. It
might cure her. It might not.

301
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,939
So-So, that'll cure him?

302
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,785
We'll know in 24
hours if it's working.

303
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,962
What did you tell them?
I told them the truth.

304
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,304
They seemed relieved. Did you
tell them how sick their son is?

305
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,776
I explained what was going
on. Allison, their baby's dying.

306
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,890
If the parents weren't in tears by the time
you left, you didn't tell them the truth.

307
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,577
That's not how I see it. Do
you want them blindsided?

308
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,984
Want them coming up and saying, "My
God, my baby died. Why didn't you warn me?"

309
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,717
So now it's about worrying
about them yelling at us? No.

310
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,555
It's about getting them prepared
for the likely death of their child.

311
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,477
If their son dies
tomorrow, you think they'll

312
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,085
give a damn what I
said to them today?

313
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,163
It's not gonna matter.
They're not gonna

314
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:01,464
care. Nothing's gonna
be the same ever again.

315
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,834
Just give those poor
women a few hours of hope.

316
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,578
Dr. House! Oh, no.

317
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,444
Dr. House, this is
my husband, Charlie.

318
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,483
Who told you
where my office was?

319
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,042
Jill, come on. He obviously
doesn't want us bothering him.

320
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,452
Ooh, I was trying to hide it.

321
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:27,357
Look, Doctor, this is about the
mono that you said you thought I had.

322
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,361
The mono? Yes.

323
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,522
You know, shouldn't
Charlie be tested?

324
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,898
<i>You know, the
test. The blood test.</i>

325
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,597
Right.

326
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,039
Yeah, I'm sorry. I—I
sometimes forget patients.

327
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,203
I thought you were this idiot who
doesn't know how to use birth control.

328
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,715
I can't have mono. I don't
even feel sick or anything.

329
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,142
That's very often
the first sign.

330
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,088
Call my office in the morning,
and I'll schedule you for blood tests.

331
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,091
Thank you.

332
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,525
I'm not even tired. Oh.

333
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,272
Find anything yet?

334
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:18,039
Oh, just some baby formula being
stored under a sink with a dripping faucet.

335
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,875
Tap water contamination. You
thinking pseudomonas infection?

336
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,609
I was. I wasted a couple
of hours chasing it down.

337
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:27,119
But, of course, the formula hasn't
been anywhere near the babies.

338
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,178
Huh. Whatever idiot
stored them there...

339
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,123
All right, we'll figure it
out. Just-Just calm down.

340
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,389
I am calm. Let me know
when you're gonna need it.

341
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,625
Oh, come— I warned you.

342
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,757
I did that calmly.

343
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,531
Hey. Hi.

344
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,670
She any better?

345
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,578
Uh, her fever has been
stable the last hour.

346
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,011
We're not gonna make it, are we?

347
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,178
Sorry?

348
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,245
Me and Ethan.

349
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,818
Our next-door neighbor,

350
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,885
her little boy died
in a car crash,

351
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:13,865
and she and her husband split up,
like, four months after the funeral.

352
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:18,428
It's just, uh, what
always happens, right?

353
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,667
Uh, what happens to patients after
they leave the hospital, I don't know,

354
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,976
but try not to get
ahead of yourself.

355
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,845
<i>Dr. Chase, activity
on the monitor.</i>

356
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,822
How long? I don't
know. It just started.

357
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,018
<i>Pulse? Fluid, wide open.</i>

358
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,993
<i>Do we have an
arterial line? Not yet.</i>

359
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,724
<i>Let's get a B. P.</i>

360
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,166
You can't come in
here. Is my baby dying?

361
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,579
<i>- Mrs. Hartig—</i> - Is she dying?
- Ma'am, you'll have to leave.

362
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,595
It's not your baby.

363
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,373
Ventilate.

364
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,970
<i>B. P. 60 over 20.</i>

365
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,845
Heart rate's 180.
Start the levophed.

366
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,317
<i>Still dropping.</i>

367
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,320
50 over 10.

368
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,320
I can't hold B.P., even
with three pressors.

369
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,695
<i>I'm losing pulse.</i>

370
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,732
V-fib.

371
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,393
Shut the blinds.

372
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,743
Charging. Set.

373
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,543
<i>Clear.</i>

374
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,709
Still V-fib.

375
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,413
Charging. Clear.

376
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,886
Charging. Clear.

377
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,393
<i>Still V-fib.</i>

378
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,400
Charging. Clear.

379
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,907
- Charging.
- Chase.

380
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,374
Time of death—6:57 p.m.

381
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,630
<i>The aztreonam doesn't work.</i>

382
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,903
Double-cover all the other
babies with vancomycin.

383
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,910
I'll do it.

384
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,311
<i>Cameron, tell the parents.</i>

385
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,815
Tell them their child
probably saved five lives.

386
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,752
- But Chase should—
- Chase is busy.

387
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,982
You're the attending.

388
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,989
Make sure she does her job.

389
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,515
I asked you to make sure she
does her job, not do it for her.

390
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,720
She froze up. She felt sorry
for the parents, so she shut up.

391
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:06,095
You felt sorry for her, so you opened
your mouth. She has a problem.

392
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:09,210
She needs to deal with it. If you hadn't
bailed her out, she would have done it.

393
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,567
Great. Then she wouldn't
have slept for two weeks.

394
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,334
Maybe she should be thinking
about a different specialty.

395
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,341
Lab work? Research?

396
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,403
- Yeah, what is it?
- The Hartig baby—
she's getting sicker too.

397
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,540
The vancomycin
isn't working either.

398
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,986
Vancomycin doesn't kill
it. Aztreonam doesn't kill it.

399
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,824
What the hell is this?

400
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,763
It's a superbug. It
could be V.R.S.A.

401
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,358
There's only been two reported
cases ever in the United States.

402
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,598
One of the kids, the
Hausen baby, had a skin rash.

403
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,741
It could be scalded-skin
syndrome, which would

404
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,904
be a sign of V.R.S.A.
Then these kids are dead.

405
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,035
This is our fault.

406
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,081
Doctors overprescribing
antibiotics.

407
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,707
Got a cold? Take
some penicillin.

408
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,049
Sniffles? No problem.
Have some azithromycin.

409
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,090
<i>Is that not working anymore?
Well, got your levaquin.</i>

410
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,284
Antibacterial soaps
in every bathroom.

411
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,760
They'll be adding vancomycin
to the water supply soon.

412
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,763
We bred these superbugs.

413
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,992
They're our babies,
and they're all grown up,

414
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:18,436
and they've got body
piercings and a lot of anger.

415
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,966
On the other hand, maybe
antibiotics had nothing to do with it.

416
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:30,138
<i>Did you notice how low his B. P. was
at the end, even with three pressors?</i>

417
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,309
Heart damage?

418
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:39,381
Go home. There's nothing
more you can do tonight.

419
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,602
Baby Boy Chen-Lupino.

420
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:07,784
Time of death—6:57 p.m.,
Thursday, December 2, 2004.

421
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:42,888
<i>This is a cross section of the
Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium.</i>

422
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,289
Fibrosis,
lymphocytic infiltrates.

423
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,192
There was no sign of
lymphocytosis in the blood tests.

424
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:52,527
Yes, well, we all had plenty of
good reasons to think bacterial.

425
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,533
Nobody is scolding you.

426
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,365
<i>Unfortunately, all those
clever reasons were wrong.</i>

427
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,530
It is a virus
infecting their hearts.

428
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,006
Then we're screwed. We
can't chase down a virus.

429
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,977
There's a thousand possibilities.
We could run gels, antibody tests.

430
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,639
<i>A thousand of them? The
kids don't have enough blood.</i>

431
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,687
Chase, you're the
intensivist. How many could

432
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,708
we do before we risk
exsanguinating the kids?

433
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:16,721
You're talking vials, not stick tests?
I wouldn't take more than five or six.

434
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:22,489
Okay, so we have to narrow
the thousand viruses down to six.

435
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:26,328
Now, the autopsy's shown
us what the virus does.

436
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,390
So, let's go. What do we know?

437
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,732
That ribavirin and
acyclovir don't knock it out.

438
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:35,331
- Cross out the herpes viruses.
- Also adenovirus.

439
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,239
What else? What
else? Keep talking!

440
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,608
Well, i-it only
seems to hit children.

441
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:43,171
The mothers aren't sick, so— <i>-
No toxoplasmosis, no rubella.</i>

442
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,376
Cross out the entire
TORCH syndrome.

443
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,078
- You didn't find any lung damage?
- No.

444
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,919
- None of the <i>paramyxoviridae.</i>
- Cardiac scarring, people.

445
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,582
C.M.V.

446
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,929
Enteroviruses too, I think.

447
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,433
<i>Eleven.</i> Influenza A.

448
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,994
Flu A.

449
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,264
Yes?

450
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,276
And?

451
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,221
I'm putting R.S.V.
down as a yes.

452
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,250
That makes eight.

453
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,287
- Eight vials of blood is pushing it.
- Pushing it? Well, we love that.

454
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,629
<i>Get the antibody kits,
start testing the sick kids.</i>

455
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,068
All right, I'll look into whether there
are any antivirals for these eight.

456
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,651
Wait a second. The kids
on the floor who didn't

457
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:43,268
get sick— are any of
them still in the hospital?

458
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,387
They got moved to the fifth floor, but
they're probably all checked out by now.

459
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,023
No, the Limpert boy had a bit of
jaundice. He's checking out today.

460
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,811
I want to test his
blood too. <i>Why?</i>

461
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,147
Because we need all the
information we can get.

462
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,948
<i>The healthy kid can
be our control group.</i>

463
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,980
I'll just tell his parents he can't check
out because he has the smallpox.

464
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,821
<i>Stephen Morgan, contact
Hospital Administration.</i>

465
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,669
<i>Dr. Paul to the Recovery Room.</i>

466
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,668
All done. All done.

467
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,646
What did we get?

468
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,172
Well, the sick babies all
tested positive for echovirus 11.

469
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,118
<i>Great.</i> And C.M.V.,
and parvovirus B-19.

470
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,816
- Three viruses?
- But what's weirder,
the healthy kid we tested,

471
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,054
<i>he's positive for echovirus 1 1
and C. M. V. antibodies as well.</i>

472
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,368
They're infants.

473
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:47,099
They have their mother's
blood, their mother's antibodies.

474
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,164
So we've just learned
nothing? Uh-uh.

475
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,321
We have half the picture.
The healthy kids survived

476
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,201
because their mothers'
antibodies saved them.

477
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,555
If the mom had C.M.V.
in the past, she'd have the

478
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:58,114
antibodies for C.M.V. The
kid would be immune from it.

479
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,651
So, we test the sick kids' moms
for echovirus, C.M.V. and parvovirus.

480
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,024
And whichever they
don't have the antibodies

481
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,057
for, that's what's
killing their kids.

482
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,118
I'll test the mothers.

483
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:34,079
<i>Dr. Kent's office, one.
Dr. Kent's office, one.</i>

484
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,903
<i>Echovirus 1 1.</i>

485
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,375
It's an enterovirus. It
lodges in the intestinal tract.

486
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:03,381
Enteroviruses cause diarrhea and
flu-like symptoms in adults, maybe a rash,

487
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,043
<i>but for newborns,
it can be deadly.</i>

488
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,110
It's damaging her heart.

489
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,247
Well, is there
anything you can do?

490
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,782
<i>Viruses are more difficult to
treat than bacterial infections.</i>

491
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,125
<i>We still haven't found a
cure for the common cold.</i>

492
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,130
So, you mean
there's no vaccine or...

493
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,065
There's a company in
Pennsylvania developing an antiviral.

494
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,125
It got positive results
in a lab setting.

495
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,933
<i>We managed to
get our hands on it.</i>

496
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,446
Imagine not being able
to touch your own baby.

497
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,285
Can I get your guys' help
with something? Sure.

498
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,160
Your daughter, her— Maxine.

499
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,632
That's her name— Maxine.

500
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,832
We need someone to hold Maxine up off
the bed while the nurse changes her sheet.

501
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,841
Sure. Okay.

502
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,901
Shh, shh, shh.

503
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,606
<i>Look at you. Hi.</i>

504
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,672
Hold still.

505
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,113
That's it.

506
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,594
Hi. Easy. Shh.

507
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,826
There you go.

508
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,227
Hey, Foreman.

509
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,567
Got a minute?

510
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:16,972
So, pulmonary resistance has stabilized
for the two kids, but, uh, B.P.'s still...

511
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,746
No news then. How's Cameron?

512
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,584
Dr. Cameron? Sure.

513
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,092
Let's start with her and then move
on to all the other Camerons we know.

514
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,322
I'm sorry. I'm just not used to you
asking about someone's well-being.

515
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,887
I can understand how the
question would surprise you.

516
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,476
I don't quite get how
it would confuse you.

517
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,629
Why do you wanna know? Why do
you wanna know why I want to know?

518
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,229
Just curious. Me too.

519
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,241
You don't get curious.

520
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,244
I'm the most curious man in
the world. Not about trivialities.

521
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,440
Well, then this
must not be trivial.

522
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,349
How is Cameron
handling everything?

523
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,444
Just fine.

524
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,317
Great. Glad we talked.

525
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:09,700
Your husband is definitely
the source of your mono.

526
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,328
Oh. Wow!

527
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,669
Oh, thank God.

528
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,573
Wow. I'm gonna be a mom.

529
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,577
Whoa!

530
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,513
Thank you so much. I gotta
get you a gift or something.

531
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,642
Sometimes the best gift is the
gift of never seeing you again.

532
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,880
Okay. All right.

533
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,651
But, Dr. House, you've
been so awesome.

534
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:37,094
I mean, I really
<i>totally</i> trust you.

535
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,393
Do you think you— No.

536
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,433
Could do the prenatal— No.

537
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,059
Or deliver the baby?
That would be "no."

538
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,832
Okay.

539
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,578
Wow.

540
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,781
Chase, take a look at this.

541
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,563
Oh, God. It's good news.

542
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,504
No. It's great.

543
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,270
Thank you.

544
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,588
Hi. She's doing great.

545
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,595
Hi, little girl.

546
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,668
Hello.

547
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,776
They all gone? Hartigs
are checking out right now.

548
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,514
You look tired. Thanks.

549
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,615
It's no wonder. You've had a
hard time the last couple of days.

550
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,715
And you haven't?

551
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,783
Not like you.

552
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,992
Anyone who's that awkward...

553
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,230
either has no experience
with death or too much,

554
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,795
and I'm pretty sure
it's not the former.

555
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,942
Chase told me about that idea you
had, the parents holding the baby.

556
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,002
Where'd you get that?

557
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,044
Did you lose someone?

558
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,711
Did you lose a baby?

559
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,416
You can be a real bastard.

560
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,722
Unfinished business?

561
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,726
I'm in the haystack.

562
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,627
Ah, because now you know
you're looking for a needle.

563
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,631
Right.

564
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:37,635
If I tell you to let it go, it won't
make any difference, will it?

565
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,297
Enteroviruses are
spread by humans.

566
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,306
Fecal or oral usually.

567
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,968
It could be respiratory
secretions though.

568
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:48,088
So Cuddy got stool samples from the
whole staff. Just wait till they come back.

569
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,047
That won't do it. Why not?

570
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,381
The shedder, whoever he is, he's so
virulent, he must have been symptomatic.

571
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,580
Cuddy would have
noticed him. Hmm.

572
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,284
And the babies didn't share
any common personnel.

573
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,261
- That's what's weird.
- Yeah, yeah. <i>That's</i> what's weird.

574
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,298
<i>Transition Team to O. R. 2.</i>

575
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,856
<i>Transition Team to O. R. 2.</i>

576
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,187
Can I help you?

577
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:11,393
You saved my life. I
just ran some tests.

578
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,626
Your will and determination
are what saved your life.

579
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,634
I know who I am
now. Yes, you do.

580
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,398
<i>And I know who I am as well.</i>

581
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,462
<i>Naomi, I love you.</i>

582
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,668
Hey, seriously, man. You're
not supposed to be here.

583
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,645
I'm performing a
delivery. <i>You</i> are?

584
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,205
A patient whose prenatal
care I've been handling.

585
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,444
I just took her on a
couple of minutes ago.

586
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:36,488
Of course, I'll need one of
you two guys to supervise.

587
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,785
When's she due? Late March.

588
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,394
That's five months from now.

589
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,625
Thank God these
chairs are comfortable.

590
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,597
That's some bad hat, Harry.
