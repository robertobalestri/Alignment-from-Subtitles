1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,596
<i>Dr. Lee, call 4 142.</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,267
<i>Dr. Lee, 4 142.</i>

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,286
Will it, uh, be much longer?

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,288
We'll call you when we're ready.

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,290
I've been waiting
almost an hour.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,792
We'll call you when we're ready.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,794
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,975
Saw him make quite
a throw yesterday.

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,739
There's a liner to left field
coming to third base's right.

10
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,248
Laskowski is up. The
throw on the way to the plate.

11
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,580
So she's really coming back?

12
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,586
Who's coming back?

13
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,622
You don't know her.

14
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,921
You give her a raise?
Increase her benefits?

15
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,429
Don't have TiVo on this
thing. Can't rewind. Shut up.

16
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,726
You lower her hours?
You don't even know her.

17
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,101
Who is this guy? He's a patient.

18
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,237
He's examining me.
He's gotta go back to work

19
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:15,165
as soon as I'm done
with the examination.

20
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,612
Guess I do too.

21
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,275
It's gotta be something. I mean, she
didn't come back because she likes you.

22
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,284
Mmm.

23
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,481
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,922
She did come back
because she likes you.

25
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,519
<i>You dog. You slept with her.</i>

26
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,861
Keep talking. I'll finish your
exam with a prostate check.

27
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,501
I've agreed to take
her on one date.

28
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,470
- What?
- So, you into this girl?

29
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,940
- Yes.
- No. She—She's not giving me any choice.

30
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,672
Wait. She's making you do her?

31
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,680
Date her.

32
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:58,014
Young ingenue doctor falling
in love with gruff, older mentor...

33
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,783
<i>Her sweet, gentle nature
bringing him to a closer,</i>

34
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,347
fuller understanding
of his wounded heart.

35
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,086
Do her...

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,491
or you're gay.

37
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,226
For God's sakes.

38
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,647
♪ Sitting in a
tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G

39
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,464
♪ Grow up. And
learn to harmonize.

40
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,972
- Oh!
- Damn it!

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,034
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Who the hell walks around
with an open urine sample?

42
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,138
I'm sorry. I didn't—I didn't...

43
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,150
Uh...

44
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,789
You think that was a
bit of an overreaction?

45
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,384
Well, he peed on
me. I'm not into that.

46
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,394
It's apple juice.

47
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,396
Now go find that
guy and apologize.

48
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,093
One more patient complaint
and you're looking at a suspension.

49
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,944
I forgive you for
ruining my jacket.

50
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,849
Look, you seem like
a regular kind of guy...

51
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,997
Not the type to get another
regular guy into trouble.

52
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,956
Am I right?

53
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,223
Twenty bucks cash
if you'll stop crying.

54
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,927
Forgive me. Yell at me. Just give
me something I can work with, okay?

55
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,816
<i>Game's over.</i>

56
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,216
You two make nice?
Get a wheelchair.

57
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,755
Get this guy into the
E.R. What happened?

58
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,417
- Right pupil's blown.
<i>- Holy—</i>

59
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,051
You gave the guy a stroke?

60
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,756
So the bear wipes
himself with the rabbit.

61
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,192
Lame.

62
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,602
Hey. Yo.

63
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,936
What are you doing
here? I work here.

64
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,442
"Here" here? In this office?

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,706
House practically
begged me to come back.

66
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,529
Please tell me you
took him to the cleaners.

67
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:41,324
Same lousy salary.

68
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,000
Then why'd you do it?

69
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:46,377
Because this is the
happiest place on Earth.

70
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,787
<i>Twenty-one-year-old male—
Comes in with grinding of the teeth.</i>

71
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,623
<i>And House gives him a
stroke. Totally blew out his pupil.</i>

72
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,152
- You scared a guy into stroking out?
- Does that surprise anyone here?

73
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,632
Blown pupils usually means
brain stem edema. Sure,

74
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,193
but since he's not dead or in a coma,
I'm going with stroke to the optic nerve.

75
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,469
C.T. scan shows two things.

76
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,737
Ischemia—death of brain tissue.

77
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,010
Means there's been some
damage, hopefully not permanent.

78
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:17,381
- And?
<i>- And that's it. There's nothing there</i>
<i>to tell us what the underlying cause is.</i>

79
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,182
- Gotta do an M.R.I.
- You're looking at the wrong part
of the scan.

80
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,035
I'm looking at the brain.
What else is there?

81
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:24,656
The jaw.

82
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,216
The jaw tells us why he stroked?

83
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,264
No, the jaw tells us
why we can't do an M.R.I.

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,925
Unless we want his jawbone
flying across the room.

85
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,800
Metal plate. He's had major reconstruction,
and there's no way we're removing it,

86
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,839
so we're forced to be clever.

87
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,204
<i>Angiogram to
rule out vasculitis,</i>

88
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,211
<i>E. M. G. for peripheral neuropathy,
tox screen to eliminate drugs,</i>

89
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,112
and echo to rule
out cardiac emboli.

90
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:55,879
Dr. Cameron, I'd appreciate you keeping
the terms of your new contract to yourself.

91
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,051
Don't want everyone
clamoring for the same perks.

92
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,065
What perks? Nothing
you'd be interested in.

93
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,897
So it's not money, then? Office
space, insurance, parking...

94
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,404
Anything he could offer
you, we'd be interested in.

95
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,566
He agreed to go
on a date with me.

96
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,578
A date? Date, dinner and a
movie, naked and sweaty, date?

97
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,240
He only committed
to the first two.

98
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,613
He's so— He's so old.

99
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,450
- And you're so young.
- It's a big mistake.

100
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
It's my boss. I'm allowed
to sexually harass my boss.

101
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,251
I'll arrange for the E.M.G. You
want to set up the angiogram?

102
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,387
And you can get the blood samples,
patient history, patient consent.

103
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,736
Like watching an
accident about to happen.

104
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,978
Morning.

105
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,014
Harvey, I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm here to discuss your case.

106
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,520
I'm Annette. I'm
Harvey's friend.

107
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,522
Nice to meet you.

108
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,254
I need your next of kin. You didn't
fill that out on your intake form.

109
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,125
Harvey's parents are dead.

110
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,960
They died two years
ago in a car crash.

111
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,932
I see. So, Harvey,
you have any siblings?

112
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,699
No. And no grandparents,

113
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,970
or uncles or aunts.

114
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,035
Annette, uh, I don't want
to have to ask you to leave...

115
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,580
I want her to stay.

116
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,674
Well, she can stay.
You do the talking.

117
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,488
<i>Why’d you come to
the clinic this morning?</i>

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,895
Uh, about six months
ago, I started grinding my...

119
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,300
<i>You know. In your mouth.
You chew with them.</i>

120
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,204
Teeth.

121
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,370
Harvey's experiencing a
little nominal aphasia. Hmm.

122
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,380
You know, when you
can't remember nouns.

123
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,473
Yeah, I think I know
what nominal aphasia is.

124
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,541
Have you had any treatment
for the teeth grinding?

125
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,018
I went to a...

126
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,650
<i>You know, they do that thing
with the sharp pointy things.</i>

127
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,136
- Needles? Someone took your blood?
- No. They make you breathe.

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,096
- Pulmonologist?
- No. She had this, uh...

129
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,928
<i>She had this electrical machine.</i>

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,935
He saw an acupuncturist.

131
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,267
Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,876
Do you know what
the acupuncturist did?

133
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,621
She diagnosed liver chi stagnation
and sent Harvey to a shen balancer.

134
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,106
He referred him to a homeopathic
doctor, who sent him to a chiropractor.

135
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,477
Naturally. The chiropractor
thought it might be

136
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:41,917
food sensitivity and sent
Harvey to a naturopath.

137
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,719
The naturopath
sent me back to the...

138
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,727
- Back to the acupuncturist.
- Yes.

139
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,026
Okay. Well, we'll need
to see the records...

140
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,033
of all of those,
uh, practitioners.

141
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,035
Okay. Thank you.

142
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,076
Everything set
for the angiogram?

143
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,477
Cameron's got the
E.M.G. first. Who's that?

144
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,811
Harvey's guru.

145
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:13,286
- That's what she called herself?
- That's what she acted like.

146
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,663
Hi. I'm having vaginal pain.

147
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,240
Pleasure to meet you.

148
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,938
My OB/GYN died recently.
He was a nice man.

149
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:43,245
- Warm hands.
- Not anymore.

150
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,911
So, does it hurt
when you tinkle?

151
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,786
Yeah, that's when it's worst.

152
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,794
You have some vaginal tearing.

153
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,795
No sign of bruising.

154
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,195
No indication of
trauma, forced entry.

155
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,759
Ramona, you naughty girl.

156
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,772
Either you've got yourself
an 18-year-old boyfriend,

157
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,434
or an 80-year-old with
some little blue pills.

158
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,704
Myron thought
he'd just try 'em out.

159
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,441
- Lucky you.
- I guess.

160
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,449
You'd prefer it if
Myron was a little...

161
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,213
droopier? Maybe a little.

162
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,450
We used to hold
hands or read together...

163
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,617
or watch <i>Jeopardy.</i>

164
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,993
I haven't seen <i>Jeopardy</i>
in almost a month.

165
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,299
Have you talked
to him about this?

166
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,393
You try talking a
73-year-old out of sex.

167
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,668
With all these male enhancements,
the pressure to put out's incredible.

168
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,869
It's worse than high school.

169
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,710
He doesn't get what he wants from me, he'll
get it from Connie in the corner condo.

170
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,650
She's dying her hair
red. Major league slut.

171
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,819
Here's a prescription...

172
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,258
for vaginal estrogen
suppositories.

173
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,852
It'll help with the lubrication.

174
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,864
Thank you.

175
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,491
Maybe you could give
Myron a prescription...

176
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,730
Something weaker
than he's got now.

177
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,570
Tell him it's better for
his heart. He'd buy that.

178
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,577
You can't tell him the truth
so you want me to lie to him?

179
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:21,581
- Would you?
- Close your legs.

180
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,948
<i>Nerves stimulate muscles to move
by creating a small electrical current.</i>

181
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,686
The machine will measure that.

182
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,289
<i>And I will insert this needle into
various muscles and ask you to flex.</i>

183
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,893
Sometimes it can be painful.
Let me know. I can pull back.

184
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,767
No.

185
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,136
I mean, it's okay.

186
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,542
Okay. Put your
arm out to the side.

187
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,413
- You all right?
- I'm good.

188
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,480
You don't have to stop.

189
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,594
Raise your arm over your head.

190
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,608
<i>The E. M. G. was clean.</i>

191
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,669
<i>Based on this history, it's either
toxic herbs from the homeopath,</i>

192
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,341
spinal damage
from the chiropractor,

193
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,408
infection from a needle
that the acupuncturist

194
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:33,011
accidentally let
sit in eye of newt,

195
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,317
or the shen balancer...

196
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,688
What the hell is a shen,
and how come it's lopsided?

197
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,489
The only abnormal test result
we found was on the echo report.

198
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,723
<i>Mitral valve prolapse.</i>

199
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,733
Hang up a shingle and condemn the
narrowness and greed of Western medicine.

200
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,792
You can make a damn fine living.

201
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,670
Clots form on the faulty valve,
get sent to the brain, voilà—stroke.

202
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,471
Of course, no harm, no foul.

203
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,943
Just taking a few bucks
from superstitious idiots, right?

204
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,847
Could also be an
aneurysm due to trauma.

205
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,477
Trauma? From what, the
chiropractic treatments?

206
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,387
<i>It's bacterial endocarditis, an infected
valve. We should do blood cultures.</i>

207
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,652
The six months that he
had with these charlatans...

208
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,415
<i>might have been better
spent going to someone</i>

209
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,305
<i>who looks at things that
exist in the real world.</i>

210
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,798
But that's just me
being all narrow again.

211
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,767
I noticed a small bruit when I
listened to Harvey's left carotid.

212
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,954
You could hear that if he
had an aneurysm from trauma.

213
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,995
An aneurysm would have
shown on the angiogram.

214
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,632
No. Not necessarily.

215
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,577
Hmm.

216
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,670
Quite a dilemma.

217
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:38,707
Oh, great pool-hall
oracle, grant me guidance.

218
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,140
<i>Do we go with Foreman's
theory, which is at least</i>

219
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:43,348
<i>marginally supported
by medical test results,</i>

220
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,985
or Chase's theory, that is completely
unsupported by medical evidence?

221
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,052
What to do?

222
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,063
The guy obviously
broke his jaw somehow.

223
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,130
Who knows what other trauma he's
suffered? We should do the angiogram again.

224
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,296
And all signs point to...

225
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,398
Ah. Sorry, Chase.
The gods have spoken.

226
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,002
Start Harvey on blood
thinners and antibiotics.

227
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,242
Wow. Yeah, I get
it. House is adorable.

228
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,250
I just want to hold
him and never let go.

229
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,689
My God! What the
hell are you doing?

230
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,854
- She's choking him.
- Foreman, stop. Let her go.

231
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,194
- She was trying to kill him.
<i>- No. No, she wasn't.</i>

232
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,564
His vitals seem okay.
Please— Please, don't hurt her.

233
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,534
What the hell is
going on in here?

234
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,243
<i>She's— She's a dominatrix.</i>

235
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,280
Right, Annette?

236
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,388
<i>The patient asked
you to strangle him?</i>

237
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,553
Harvey is an asphyxiaphyliac.

238
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,325
He likes to be
strangled or smothered.

239
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,165
That's just sick. <i>Well, that's
an intriguing legal opinion.</i>

240
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,761
Geez. What kind
of a lawyer is he?

241
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,149
- You want a legal opinion? Call the cops.
- I was careful.

242
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:12,077
I watched the monitors. Made sure his O₂
sats were over 90. I would never hurt him.

243
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,979
Then what was the
point? Harvey was upset.

244
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,982
He needed to calm down...

245
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,177
To feel in control
by being controlled.

246
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,158
He pays you for this?

247
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,024
In return, he does my
taxes and cleans my house.

248
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,994
We're not done here. We
have to talk. Call the cops.

249
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,696
Bar her from the hospital.
Force her to pierce your nipples.

250
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,705
Not really medical decisions.

251
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,477
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

252
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,036
I was seeing this
woman, a banker,

253
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,379
and, uh, turns out
she liked to be burned.

254
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,182
<i>You actually dated someone
who likes to get burned?</i>

255
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,313
<i>Yeah, why would you
want to be in a relationship...</i>

256
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,984
with someone that's so
obviously only gonna lead to pain?

257
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,755
- Shut up.
<i>- It was a weird scene.</i>

258
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:06,459
- I observed— - Chase, did you know
about this woman, what she does?

259
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,697
- I met her at some parties, yeah.
- I wouldn't have tortured you
if I knew you liked it.

260
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,035
<i>Well, here's a
phrase to remember.</i>

261
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,803
"Hey, this guy might have been
pounded on the head one too many times."

262
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,074
I said I thought it was a trauma-induced
aneurysm. <i>Yeah. Could have carried...</i>

263
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,809
a tad more weight if you'd
mentioned the "liking pain" thing.

264
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,976
<i>You're on my naughty list.</i>

265
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,543
Sorry. No leather
stethoscope this Christmas.

266
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,335
- I'm not into— - I
assume you never started

267
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,940
him on antibiotics
and blood thinners...

268
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,425
before Mistress
Ilsa's rude interruption.

269
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,275
- That was probably
a good thing, given— -

270
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,191
Start him on antibiotics
and blood thinners.

271
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,255
<i>You still think Chase is wrong?</i>

272
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,358
No, he's probably right.

273
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,365
<i>Then we should schedule
him for vascular surgery.</i>

274
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,669
Go into the carotids, find
the aneurysm, repair it.

275
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,732
We put him on blood
thinners, he might bleed out.

276
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,007
But if Foreman's right about it
being bacterial endocarditis and we...

277
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,248
I think Chase is right.

278
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,081
Okay. If Foreman <i>used</i> to be
right about it being blood clots...

279
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,021
and we take the surgery
route, we'll probably kill the guy.

280
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,940
So start him on blood
thinners, and if he has

281
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,754
another stroke, we'll
schedule the surgery.

282
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,853
- Yeah?
- You Dr. House?

283
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,229
I have a feeling I'm
gonna regret this, but yes.

284
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,737
Ramona said I should
come to you for my refill.

285
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,068
Uh, you know, the...

286
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,074
The wood's beginning to droop.

287
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,538
She said you'd probably
want to talk to me first.

288
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,879
She lied.

289
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,283
Here you go.

290
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,218
Thanks.

291
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,986
Always happy to make
people happy. Good-bye.

292
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,256
Uh, I don't know how
much more of this I can take.

293
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,561
- Much more of what?
- Sex.

294
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,124
You don't want more sex?

295
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,136
My golf swing is all messed up.

296
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,106
Hey, here's a radical
thought. Talk to her.

297
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,576
- The truth?
- Sounds crazy when you put it like that.

298
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,613
Ramona's got a big appetite.

299
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,445
If I don't perform...

300
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,451
I don't want to lose her.

301
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,823
You got a pharmacy around here?

302
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,758
In the hospital? Could be.

303
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,455
Let's see if we can find it.

304
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,772
Got any blue pills?

305
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,832
You looking for E.D. medication?

306
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,277
Well, that's one example of
a blue pill. Name six others.

307
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,508
There's a brand
of acetaminophen...

308
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,018
Perfect. Fill 'er up.

309
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:45,115
- Dr. House.
- Little busy here.

310
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:49,219
I heard about Dr. Cameron's
conditions for coming back to work.

311
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,697
It's purely business. I'll
make sure you get the receipt.

312
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,360
Well, I think it's a good thing.

313
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,528
What happened in
your last relationship,

314
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,868
it's no reason to wall yourself
off from people forever.

315
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,068
Five years of self-pity
is probably enough.

316
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,704
Wow. You've certainly
given me a lot to think about.

317
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,044
If only I was as open as you.

318
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,210
- Well— - Actually, it was
your blouse I was talking about.

319
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,252
Bear in mind, Cameron's probably
the only female who could tolerate you.

320
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,521
Wear the sky-blue shirt.

321
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,086
It almost makes you look nice.

322
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,228
They said she couldn't
come back into the hospital.

323
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,237
They won't let me see her.

324
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,399
Harvey, you're lucky
she wasn't arrested.

325
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,569
What were you thinking,
doing that at a hospital?

326
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,239
Squeeze my fingers?

327
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,909
I was scared. I'll need you
to squeeze with both hands.

328
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,920
I am.

329
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,513
<i>Weakness in his
right arm and hand.</i>

330
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,753
Harvey's having mini-strokes. The
blood thinners aren't making a difference.

331
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,761
Stop the treatment.

332
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,423
Sorry. We tried your way. You
could not have been "wronger."

333
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,762
I said Chase was
probably right. Oh, yeah.

334
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,927
We've all got perfect
20/20 hindsight.

335
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,937
Get ahold of May in Vascular.

336
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,099
See if his surgical dance
card is free for tomorrow.

337
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,710
- About tomorrow night.
- You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

338
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,112
I didn't see any reason to.

339
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,777
Where are we going? I want to
make sure I dress appropriately.

340
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,787
That would be army
boots and T-shirt.

341
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,949
It's the county paint ball
tourney. First prize is 50 bucks.

342
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,959
I'll split it with you if
you hold your end up.

343
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,961
I'm not sure that was the deal.

344
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,294
Relax. I made a
reservation at Café Spoleto.

345
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,299
Regarding wardrobe,

346
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,392
are you too young to
remember spandex?

347
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,564
I'll figure something out.

348
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,237
The surgery will repair the
damaged blood vessels in your neck,

349
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,247
and your strokes will stop.

350
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,579
All this is because
of the strangulation?

351
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,086
More like strangulations.

352
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,758
My parents are right.

353
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,294
I'm a loser.

354
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,353
<i>I don't— I don't know what—</i>

355
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,332
- I don't know what to do. I
need to— - Harvey, calm down.

356
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,834
- I need to talk to Annette.
- You can do this on your own.

357
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,667
Surgery's the
only— She hates me.

358
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,264
I've been calling. I've
been calling and she...

359
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,834
She's not picking up.

360
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:23,440
- Harvey, you don't
need— - I can't. I can't.

361
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:38,187
Harvey, you will do what I say.

362
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,233
I don't want surgery.

363
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,237
- Sign the consent. Sign it!
- I can't do anything.

364
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,706
<i>No surgery. No surgery!</i>

365
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,203
No surgery!

366
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,362
<i>We could give him</i>

367
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:57,025
<i>antidepressants. See
if he changes his mind.</i>

368
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,076
I already did. Mashed
'em up in his apple sauce.

369
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,748
It'll lighten him up soon enough.
Someone should just tell him to do it.

370
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,759
Way faster. So's
forgery—also illegal.

371
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,263
And I already tried. Not you.

372
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,595
Where's a good dominatrix
when you need one?

373
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,601
Annette's barred
from the hospital.

374
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,603
If you get caught,
Cuddy's got a hairbrush,

375
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,866
and believe me, she
knows how to use it.

376
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,848
They let you come back.

377
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,544
Not because you deserve it.

378
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,748
<i>You've been bad.</i>

379
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,849
<i>You will have the surgery.
Do you understand?</i>

380
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,862
No.

381
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,898
Do not laugh at me.

382
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,935
- You will respect me.
- Where do you get off
telling me what to do?

383
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,766
Get out of my room,
you bag-faced witch.

384
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,897
Is this a part of their deal?

385
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,238
This isn't like him.

386
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,704
- Something's wrong.
- Get out!

387
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,079
Get out! Get out! Get out!

388
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,449
- Get out!
- Emotional swings—
he's having another stroke.

389
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,318
Harvey!

390
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,156
<i>He's crashing. Can
we get a cart in here?</i>

391
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,434
So what's that? Two strokes
you've scared this guy into?

392
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,940
Yeah. It's making me question my
view of myself as a people person.

393
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,273
Now you want to do surgery
on him without his consent?

394
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,312
The kid's in a coma.
He needs the surgery.

395
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,780
He said no. We can't do it.

396
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,114
Emergent situation. We
invoke heroic measures.

397
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,847
You need a court order. <i>Great.
Where do I get me one of them?</i>

398
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,858
- Do I need to lawyer up?
- I'll need to show the judge
an affidavit from next of kin.

399
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,418
They might have a problem signing
anything, seeing as how they're dead.

400
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,424
He'll want proof.

401
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:53,660
Like what, Dad's hand? I don't
even know where they're buried.

402
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:58,500
<i>Bring me a published obit, or
death certificate, and we'll run with it.</i>

403
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,471
I don't want you to
mess up your clothes.

404
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,477
<i>His parents were accountants.</i>

405
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,956
Maybe there's an obit in the trade
papers. Guy lives in Market Town.

406
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,659
I don't know if he grew up there, but
we could check the local funeral homes.

407
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,675
Great, and when your
searches turn up nothing,

408
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,585
you should try and find where
they live. He said they were dead.

409
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,089
Accountants are usually
pretty good with money,

410
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,592
so how come he lives in
a slum like Market Town?

411
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,595
Maybe they were bad accountants.

412
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,597
Two bad accountants
from the Pacific Rim?

413
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,176
The odds are astronomical. Maybe
Harvey burned through their money.

414
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,295
Or maybe they cut him off when
they found out about his proclivities.

415
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,102
Gotta be my bet. Go to his
apartment. See if you can find his folks.

416
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,042
Number, address, something.

417
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,018
Hey. Can I talk to you?

418
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,987
Sure.

419
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,384
Look. Cameron's a friend.

420
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,089
- This whole dating— -
Time's up. Thanks for playing.

421
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,564
Hey, I've been on the scene more
than you recently. Way ahead of you.

422
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,898
I got a case of malt
liquor stashed in the trunk.

423
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,234
Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD.

424
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,934
We are gonna get all
the way down. Now move.

425
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,745
Come on. You're not into her.

426
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,748
<i>Most guys who aren't interested in
a woman try to sugar coat it, be nice.</i>

427
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,910
- Oh, you know me too well.
- That's what I'm saying.

428
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,922
I think you should go with
your instincts here. Be a jerk.

429
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,083
I'm missing my soap for this?

430
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,354
Women love to be right.

431
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:32,091
You gotta leave 'em feeling
superior, like they dodged a bullet.

432
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:35,726
But if you're nice,
she'll blame herself...

433
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,134
And fall for me even more.

434
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,970
The love doctor has made an art
out of breaking up with women...

435
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,020
'cause you're convinced
that the loss of you

436
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,274
would be too devastating
for any woman to handle.

437
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:51,215
Yeah. I'm the one with the
serious ego problem here.

438
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,582
I'm just saying...

439
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,486
some relationships
aren't meant to happen.

440
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,435
Harvey's school registration.

441
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:14,564
Permanent home address?
Emergency contacts?

442
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,575
"Annette Rains."

443
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,908
Mistress Annette.

444
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,316
You had to extort
a date out of House.

445
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:28,115
You don't think
that's a bad sign?

446
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,122
Cameron?

447
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,749
High school yearbook.

448
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,626
Think this might give
us a clue, Sherlock?

449
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,700
House isn't gonna
hand you anything.

450
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,963
You want him,
you gotta take him.

451
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,971
Jump him.

452
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,872
<i>Harvey— H-A-R-V-E-Y.</i>

453
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,876
I'm sorry to have bothered
you. Thank you. Okay.

454
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,641
Yes. Harvey Park.

455
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,841
Great. We've been
looking for you.

456
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,783
I'm calling from the Princeton
Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

457
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,946
Harvey's here,
and it's rather...

458
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,824
- He hung up.
- You tell him why you were calling?

459
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,621
I didn't get a
chance. Call back.

460
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,219
I'll do it.

461
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,531
Let the master show
you how it's done.

462
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,739
Mr. Park? This is
Dr. House calling...

463
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,917
<i>from Princeton Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.</i>

464
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,810
Your son Harvey is dead. We
need you to identify the body.

465
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,074
Yes. I'm sorry. It's the law.

466
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,385
Okay.

467
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,753
There's a real art to
delivering bad news.

468
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:43,091
- They're gonna show up at the morgue.
- Be sure and let me know
when Cuddy starts screaming.

469
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,034
You lied to them! He
told us our son was dead.

470
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,732
It's only a white lie.

471
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,832
<i>Technically, all I did
was call them a little early.</i>

472
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,105
Trust me. He'll
be dead real soon.

473
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,512
<i>Actually, I saved you
some rush hour traffic.</i>

474
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,675
I'm calling our lawyer.

475
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,687
<i>Fine. Just as soon as you've
signed the surgery consent.</i>

476
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,052
I have a pen.

477
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:20,456
Marilyn Park for Mark
Lerner. Yes, I'll hold.

478
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:25,095
<i>Harvey's your son. I'm
sure you still care about him.</i>

479
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,607
He humiliated us.

480
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:32,270
Everybody we know knows
about his... perversion.

481
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:36,042
But you don't get off on
embarrassment the way your son does.

482
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,083
My guess, maybe
it skips a generation.

483
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,449
How much money would
it take to compensate you...

484
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,648
Yeah, you guys can haggle in
a minute, but here's the thing.

485
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,750
Humiliation comes in
all kinds of packages.

486
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,761
People finding out
that your son's a perv.

487
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,265
That's pretty high up there.

488
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:57,201
People finding out that
you'd rather let your son die...

489
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,704
than sign a piece of paper...

490
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,763
Where's that rank?

491
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,901
<i>Trust me, if I have
to paste up a sign...</i>

492
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,641
in every nail salon and dumpling shop
in Pennsylvania, I'll make sure they know.

493
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,792
Your son will be in surgery
first thing in the morning.

494
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:35,103
Dumplings. That
was a cheap shot.

495
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,578
Hi. Are you, uh...

496
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,585
Can we talk?

497
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,487
Gee, I wonder what
this is gonna be about.

498
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,418
I just want to make
sure no one gets hurt.

499
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,759
I will be fine. Everybody's acting
like I'm going out with Jack the Ripper.

500
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,789
Oh. It's not— It's not
you I'm worried about.

501
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:09,331
It's been a long time since he
opened up to someone, and I...

502
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,537
You better be absolutely
sure you want this,

503
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,514
because if he opens
up again and gets hurt...

504
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,718
I don't think there's
gonna be a next time.

505
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,314
You're worried I'm
gonna break <i>his</i> heart?

506
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,799
The wide side's too short.

507
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,236
You're gonna look
like Lou Costello.

508
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,402
This is a mistake.

509
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,936
I don't know how to
have casual conversation.

510
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,848
You think you're
talking about one thing,

511
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,909
and either you are,
and it's incredibly boring,

512
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:58,116
or you're not because there's a
subtext, and you need a decoder ring.

513
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,785
Open doors for her.
Help her with her chair.

514
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,126
- I have been on a date.
- Not since disco died.

515
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,598
<i>Comment on her
shoes, her earrings,</i>

516
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,693
<i>and then move on to D. H.A.</i>

517
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:14,365
Her dreams, hopes
and aspirations.

518
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,238
<i>Trust me. Panty peeler.</i>

519
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,272
- And if you need condoms, I've got some.
- Did your wife give them to you?

520
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,751
Drug rep. They've got
antibiotics built in somehow.

521
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,287
I should cancel.

522
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,789
I've got a patient in
surgery tomorrow morning.

523
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,793
And if you were a surgeon,
that would actually matter.

524
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,499
That's a good idea. Settle
your nerves. Get me a beer too.

525
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,500
No beer.

526
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,060
You're gonna eat before dinner?

527
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,308
This is pretty lame, right?

528
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,413
I think she likes lame.

529
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,748
It's beautiful.

530
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,760
And you look very handsome.

531
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,263
Thank you.

532
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,494
I've always loved
this restaurant.

533
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:20,005
Yeah. It's changed a lot
since the last time I was here.

534
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,006
Used to be a strip joint.

535
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,670
Nice earrings.

536
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,478
My mom's. Thank you.

537
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,979
Nice shoes.

538
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,285
Comfortable?

539
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,019
I'm not expecting you to
be someone you're not.

540
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,696
We're in a restaurant.

541
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,028
We're dressed up. We're eating.

542
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,000
Without small
talk, what is there?

543
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,248
According to Freud—
And I'm paraphrasing...

544
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,984
The instinct of love toward an
object demands a mastery to obtain it,

545
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:15,755
and if a person feels they can't control
the object, or feel threatened by it,

546
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,092
they act negatively toward it.

547
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,190
Like an eighth-grade
boy punching a girl.

548
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:25,328
I treat you like garbage,
so I must really like you.

549
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,701
Given your Freudian theory, what
does it mean if I start being nice to you?

550
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,611
That you're getting in
touch with your feelings.

551
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,774
Mm-hmm.

552
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,547
So there's absolutely nothing I can do
to make you think that I don't like you?

553
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,215
Sorry, no.

554
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,598
I have one evening
with you— One chance...

555
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:56,101
And I don't want to waste it
talking about what wines you like...

556
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,102
or what movies you hate.

557
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:06,643
I want to know how you feel.

558
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,976
About me.

559
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,088
You live under the delusion that
you can fix everything that isn't perfect.

560
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:24,391
That's why you married a
man who was dying of cancer.

561
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,925
You don't love, you need.

562
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,435
And now that your
husband is dead,

563
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,405
you're looking for
your new charity case.

564
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,738
That's why you're
going out with me.

565
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,744
I'm twice your age.

566
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,042
I'm not great-looking.

567
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,742
I'm not charming.
I'm not even nice.

568
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:50,953
What I am is what you need.

569
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,991
I'm damaged.

570
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,401
Warm saline.

571
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,742
3.0 silk...

572
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,805
<i>I'll get the—</i>

573
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,414
Came in late. Good
time last night?

574
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,515
How's the surgery going?
Harvey's doing fine so far.

575
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,686
- How'd the night go?
- It was fine. How was your evening?

576
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:35,095
<i>She had the ravioli.
I had the puttanesca.</i>

577
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,635
Yes, I really want to know
about the quality of the food.

578
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,696
Either something very good happened
or something very bad. Which is it?

579
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,470
Well, I did have a little
indigestion afterwards.

580
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,511
Maybe it was the garlic bread.

581
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,377
Or the wine. Something
made my eyes puffy.

582
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,645
- Crying in your pillow can do that.
- It was the wine.

583
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,653
We had a nice
candid conversation.

584
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,215
Nothing deep. Mostly
small talk. I'm sure.

585
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,887
Took your advice. Complimented her shoes.
That's 15 minutes of chat right there.

586
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:08,332
- No snide comments?
- I guess—when we talked about you guys.

587
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,568
- Just answer one question.
- You two gonna do dinner again?

588
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,009
I... don't think so.

589
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,773
I... don't know.

590
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,009
<i>Hey, kids. You were wrong.</i>

591
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,517
No aneurysm, no
nothin'. This guy's clean.

592
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,078
<i>Which means we've got no
idea what's causing the strokes.</i>

593
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,091
He's had two more post-op.

594
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,093
We won't know the
extent of the damage...

595
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,254
until he comes out of the
coma— If he comes out.

596
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,196
Maybe we should go back to
the blood thinners. Up the dosage.

597
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,289
If it's not clots, a
loading dose of blood

598
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:44,703
thinners is gonna make
him bleed out of his ears.

599
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,704
Then he won't be able to hear.

600
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,900
Oy vey.

601
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,809
- Nobody home. Leave a message.
- This is important.

602
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,379
Chase, Cameron, get
another angiogram and echo.

603
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,386
You better get a full body scan.

604
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,355
If it is clots, it'd be good
to know where they are.

605
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,662
Sorry about that.

606
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,289
Guy dying.

607
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,129
Those pills you gave
Myron? They're not working.

608
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:19,228
Well, good to see you've got the
correct perspective on the thing.

609
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,899
Well, the old ones, I mean,
made me feel like a tree, you know?

610
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,908
Nice visual.

611
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,570
But the new ones, I might
as well be eating candy.

612
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,738
Candy wouldn't take away
your headaches. What?

613
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,783
You came to me and told me
you were having too much sex.

614
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,649
I never did. You too, sequoia.

615
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,450
- Well, no, that's not true.
I— - I know everybody lies,

616
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,318
but you'd think that
after a certain amount of

617
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,162
time together, you
wouldn't be trying so hard.

618
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,930
- Your rings don't match.
- Why would they?

619
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,387
The style is one thing,
but one silver, one

620
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:52,767
gold? How long have
you guys been married?

621
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,171
Fifty-five years.
Forty-nine years.

622
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:59,370
<i>Damn it. You're
having an affair.</i>

623
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,970
Did you really say you
wanted to have less sex?

624
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,881
Well, less. If I wanted none,
I'd stay home with Esther.

625
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,816
I just need a little rest.

626
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:11,288
You guys aren't the victims of the
little blue pills, you're the problem.

627
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,552
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

628
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,651
I should just have
told you how I felt.

629
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,629
Aw.

630
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,667
Oh, welcome to hell.

631
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,814
Uh, hey, how about the pills?

632
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,716
Looks like you guys are
good to go drug-free for a while.

633
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,020
Dr. Chase, these breath mints
you've been popping since yesterday...

634
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,252
Are they a new fetish?

635
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,990
I found them at Harvey's.
What? I just took two boxes.

636
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,727
- The guy's got a whole drawer of them.
- And you didn't find that interesting?

637
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,031
Well, there's lots of
interesting stuff in his place.

638
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,333
The mints weren't
high up on the list.

639
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,431
Wrong.

640
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,848
Chase, get your nose in here.

641
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,017
If you're trying
to humiliate me,

642
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,891
<i>I told you—</i> Come on.
Put your face in his mouth.

643
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,368
- Ugh!
- Rich, wouldn't you say?

644
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,565
Mm. Smells like old vomit.

645
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,768
Number one sign of
fulminating osteomyelitis.

646
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,038
Infection of the jaw?

647
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,570
<i>Probably from the original
break. Never healed properly.</i>

648
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,742
Infected tissue from the jaw...

649
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:50,380
<i>breaks off, blocks
blood flow to the brain.</i>

650
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:53,152
And life just isn't worth
living without blood.

651
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,659
It was hidden from the
scans by the metal plate.

652
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,323
And an infection in the jaw is
unlikely to show up in blood tests.

653
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,957
- So how do we confirm?
- Like this.

654
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,472
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have pus.

655
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,287
We're gonna remove the jaw.

656
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,580
<i>Anybody got a buzz
saw? Okay, call a surgeon.</i>

657
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,091
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

658
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,729
How's tricks, Annette?

659
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,202
I just wanted to
see if he was okay.

660
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,500
I'll leave.

661
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,269
It's okay. I came
to talk to you both.

662
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,504
Like I tell all my patients,

663
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,342
you've simply got to
say no to strangulation.

664
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,578
<i>Me, I'm a freak.</i>

665
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,620
I get off on <i>not</i> being in pain.

666
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,588
That and chocolate-covered
marshmallow bunnies.

667
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,648
He's not a freak.

668
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,251
Yeah, he is... a little.

669
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,195
<i>But it's gotta stop,</i>

670
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,494
or he'll die.

671
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:46,070
It's not about pain.

672
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,732
It's about being open.

673
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:53,039
And completely vulnerable
to another person.

674
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,408
If you can learn to
be that deeply trusting,

675
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,382
it changes you.

676
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,593
Lock him in a cage.

677
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,894
That should be fine, medically.

678
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,271
Dr. House?

679
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,609
Were my parents here?

680
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,412
Did they come to see me?
