1
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,255
You. Give me that.

2
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,062
What are you talking about?

3
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,501
<i>- Mrs. Miller?</i>
- Shh. Your phone, young lady.

4
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,682
- I was just switching it to silent
in case someone called.
- No, you were cheating.

5
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,971
- Please. Like I have
to cheat— - Lady?

6
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,341
I said wait!

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,381
Give it here. Sure.

8
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,480
Love the blouse.

9
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:35,054
- I-I need to use the bunk room.
- The bathroom? Sure.

10
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,927
- In 19 minutes.
- Can't do it.

11
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,627
You got a friend in the
bathroom with the answers?

12
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,431
Fine. I'll get you an escort.

13
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,476
<i>Don't stink up till I kill you.</i>

14
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,549
Don't stand up.

15
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:05,616
D.X.D.T.

16
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,820
Hey, he's really sick.

17
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,131
- Eyes on your work.
- Are you all right?

18
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,901
- What is going on?
- Get some help.

19
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,120
<i>The kid was just taking
his A. P. calculus exam,</i>

20
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,272
<i>when all of a sudden he
got nauseous and disoriented.</i>

21
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,713
That's the way
calculus presents.

22
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,809
Severe bradycardia. Heart
rate's down to 48 and falling fast.

23
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,320
You know the kid?
No, he just came in.

24
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,483
Mom real good
looking? I... didn't notice.

25
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,993
Then it's a mystery.

26
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,394
Not why he's sick, but
why you care so much.

27
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,399
Gift shop's open. Buy him a card.
He's not responding to atropine.

28
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:23,403
Boys love fart jokes. Find
one with a good fart joke.

29
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,373
He's a teenager. It's drugs.

30
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:32,379
Tell those E.R. geniuses to give him
charcoal and naloxone. Stop following me.

31
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:36,144
His tox screen was negative.
He's still whacked out.

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,677
You don't care about the kid.
You just find his illness intriguing.

33
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,883
His CAT scan was clean. There's
no sign of infection. It's not diabetes.

34
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,256
And you don't care about him.

35
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,091
If that's what you wanna
hear, not in the slightest.

36
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,725
Me neither. May
as well be objective.

37
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,601
Maybe it's shigellosis.

38
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,337
Wouldn't account
for the bradycardia.

39
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,345
Viral myocarditis?

40
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,347
Wouldn't account
for the whacked out.

41
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,782
- So, what's the differential
for a negative tox screen?
- He was clean.

42
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,980
- Unless someone screwed up the test.
- That never happens.

43
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,261
Or he O.D.'d on
something we didn't test for.

44
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:18,515
1,4-Butanediol would
give you these symptoms.

45
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,529
- That's a new one.
- Copy machine toner.

46
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,694
Same punch as G.H.B. A little
pricier. Way more dangerous.

47
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:32,103
On the other hand, it is legal. I want
you to go to his house and find his stash.

48
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,539
<i>I'll bet you know all
the good hiding spots.</i>

49
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,543
Actually, I never did drugs.

50
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,580
<i>Better go with him.
In case he gets high.</i>

51
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,814
- How much atropine is the kid getting?
- One ml.

52
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,582
Make it two. In case he
needs his heart later on.

53
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,457
Matt, did you take
any drugs this morning?

54
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,121
Pencils down.

55
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,461
Can you squeeze
my fingers for me?

56
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,127
Did anyone give you anything
to help with the math test?

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,106
- Matt?
- I told you. He doesn't take drugs.

58
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,080
Ms. Davis, all parents think
that about their children,

59
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,343
and they're usually wrong.

60
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,409
I gave my mum a little
trouble when I was his age.

61
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,751
I turned out okay.
Even she thought so.

62
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,816
I know my kid. The fact that you
did drugs doesn't mean he did.

63
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,153
Did he go anywhere last night?

64
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,833
No, he was home studying.

65
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,769
- Any friends come over to help him?
- And bring him drugs?

66
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,034
Is that what your
friends did? Ms. Davis.

67
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:44,806
Look, I tested him myself.

68
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,438
The home kit. I took
some hair off his brush.

69
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,951
I didn't want him to know
about it, because I do trust him.

70
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,952
Then why did you test him?

71
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,523
<i>All he did last night was study and
argue about his college interviews.</i>

72
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,895
He wants to be himself—
No haircut, ratty old clothes.

73
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,900
That'll go over big.

74
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,493
Then we both gave up
and went to bed. That's it.

75
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,904
<i>Has he ever had any problems
like this before? Any family history?</i>

76
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,172
No, it's just me and Matt.

77
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,236
Diazepam. Ten
milligrams, stat. <i>Right.</i>

78
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,646
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Just taking some precautions.

79
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,416
He's seizing. Help me hold him.

80
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,424
Stay cool, mate.
We'll calm you down.

81
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,231
This room is way too
clean for a teenage boy.

82
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,898
You know why House
thinks I'm a druggie?

83
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,617
This is gonna be a
racial thing, isn't it?

84
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,125
<i>Same reason he thinks this
kid overdosed. When you're</i>

85
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,705
<i>a drug addict, you wanna
believe everyone else is too.</i>

86
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,874
He's not addicted.
He has to take drugs.

87
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,384
The definition of an addict.

88
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,353
He's in pain. <i>And
addicted to pain killers.</i>

89
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,050
What a coincidence!

90
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,421
You really never did any drugs?

91
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,691
Now <i>this</i> is gonna
be a racial thing.

92
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,109
Deflecting a
personal question with

93
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,395
a joke. Gee, who do
I know that does that?

94
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:20,463
Yeah, I'm just like him. Except for
the angry, bitter, pompous cripple part.

95
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,169
Maybe we should all pitch
in and get you a nice cane.

96
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,111
You already have the
matching gym shoes.

97
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,720
Check this out!

98
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,659
Mom's not too careful with
the homemade tomato sauce.

99
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,400
When the top sticks out like that,
it's a sign of bacterial contamination.

100
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,241
This one's open.

101
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,617
<i>I am extremely
disappointed in you.</i>

102
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,691
I send you out for exciting
new designer drugs,

103
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,557
and you come back
with tomato sauce.

104
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,189
I bet you paid twice as
much. I got mine online.

105
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:22,531
Matt decided to make himself a
homemade pizza for a bedtime snack.

106
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,037
Source of botulism, as well
as a million other toxins...

107
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,904
that cause gastroenteritis, cardiac
symptoms and mental confusion.

108
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:32,275
I'm not so sure about gastroenteritis.
But mental confusion? Bring it on.

109
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,646
<i>- Don't— But—</i> - Mmm. Delicious.

110
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,515
- Do you have a death wish?
- I notice you didn't try to save me.

111
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,681
I figured you were trying to
make some kind of subtle point.

112
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,488
I was. The kid just started seizing.
Not a symptom of food-borne toxins.

113
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,052
<i>Also not a symptom of drug
use. Not two hours after admission.</i>

114
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,898
So what would make him seize, in addition
to all these other delightful symptoms?

115
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,665
- Pesticide poisoning.
<i>- Carbamates.</i>

116
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,332
<i>Or organophosphates,
organochlorines.</i>

117
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:04,003
- Lnhalation or absorption?
- Too soon to tell.

118
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,672
We should wash him down. The
poison could still be on his skin.

119
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,716
Already told the nurses.

120
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,894
<i>Nursing supervisor
to the instrument room.</i>

121
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,732
- I feel good.
- That's your complaint?

122
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,366
Your major symptom. I told
her this was a waste of time.

123
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,342
I notice colors more.

124
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,938
And music! I— I'm
really hearing music.

125
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:46,783
I'm 82, and I'm supposed to be
playing canasta with the other old ladies,

126
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:52,019
but now... when I see
a guy with a cute butt,

127
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,392
I can't stop looking at him.

128
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,229
Or... a sexy beard.

129
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:04,636
And you figure that enjoying
cute butts is a sign of disease?

130
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:09,074
It all started a month ago when Mark
rented <i>Gone With the Wind</i> for me,

131
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,805
but it had the wrong DVD in it.

132
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,758
Oh! Oh, right. I-I forgot.
This is all my fault.

133
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,306
Of course, he was too busy to bring
it back. Yeah, like I don't have a life.

134
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,218
So I watched it, and
it had this actor in it...

135
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,223
This kid called Ashton Kutcher.

136
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,489
Now... I think about Ashton...

137
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,554
all the time.

138
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,193
All... the time.

139
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:39,603
- Ah.
- You remind me of him.

140
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,335
Same bedroom eyes.

141
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,843
People are always mixing us up.

142
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:48,109
I-I-I suppose you— You
need to check my heart?

143
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,243
- No! No, no, that—
that won't be necessary.
- I told you.

144
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,685
<i>But I am going to admit
you to the hospital for tests.</i>

145
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,691
What tests? She's just old.
And you're just insufferable.

146
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,819
Your mother has had a sudden personality
change. It should be checked out.

147
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,832
<i>I'll have a nurse come in and admit
her. I'm too handsome to do paperwork.</i>

148
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,672
<i>Anesthesiologist
to O. R. Room 4.</i>

149
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,643
<i>Anesthesiologist
to O. R. Room 4.</i>

150
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:24,145
He's been on this
medication for over an hour.

151
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:28,450
Pralidoxime is very effective. It
just takes a little time for it to kick in.

152
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,491
And maybe you're wrong.
Maybe it's not a pesticide.

153
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,017
The blood work was pretty
conclusive. It's an organophosphate.

154
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,958
Oh, my God.

155
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,163
<i>Move back. Ms. Davis,
move back, please.</i>

156
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,498
We're at 30. Bradycarciac
arrest. Get me the pads.

157
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,511
<i>What are you doing?</i>

158
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:56,346
We're gonna beat his
heart for him. Set it at 60.

159
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,142
I can't stand this anymore.

160
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,153
We'll keep him on the pads
for another hour. Then what?

161
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,323
Let's see what happens.

162
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,124
Well, that's not my philosophy.

163
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,494
<i>Especially when it
comes to my son.</i>

164
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:49,901
<i>And if something bad might happen,
I'd like to know what our options are.</i>

165
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,111
The pralidoxime isn't doing him any
good. We're gonna have to wire his heart.

166
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,920
- Maybe we're wrong about the pesticides.
- I ran his plasma again, twice.

167
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,389
Are there any stronger treatments
for the organophosphate poisoning?

168
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,815
Oh, damn it! You caught
me. We went with the weak

169
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,215
stuff. I was just trying
to save a little money.

170
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,805
Actually, one of my
professors at Columbia

171
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,631
developed an experimental
treatment for the army.

172
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,167
- What's the success rate?
- They're targeted. There's a different
hydrolase treatment for each poison.

173
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,888
We'd need to know if Matt got
hit with Orthene or malathion...

174
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,227
- What's the success rate?
- Excellent, I'm sure. It's the U.S. Army.

175
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,201
"Be all you can be." Point is, what
are the kid's chances without it?

176
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,204
Minimal at best. The poison's
broken the blood-brain barrier.

177
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,548
I assume "minimal at
best" is your stiff-upper-lip

178
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,504
British way of saying
"no chance in hell."

179
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,413
I'm Australian.

180
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:34,036
You put the queen on your money.
You're British. Call your professor.

181
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,912
<i>If we don't know what kind of
organophosphate we're targeting,</i>

182
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,350
<i>we don't know which
hydrolase to ask for.</i>

183
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,912
<i>- There's over 40 organophosphates.</i>
- I'll get all of 'em.
- Get all of 'em.

184
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,222
- Great minds think alike.
- By the time they get here, we're
gonna know which one we need.

185
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,730
If we figure out how he got exposed,
we'll figure out what he was exposed to.

186
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,732
<i>Well, the mom had
homemade tomato sauce.</i>

187
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,291
Call me crazy, but I'm thinking
maybe... homemade tomatoes?

188
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,530
Front yard. Vegetable garden.

189
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,038
Kid's out there spraying,
sees a pretty girl,

190
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,201
hormones raging, spray
can goes off in his face.

191
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,804
- I'll check into it.
- I'll make the call.

192
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,872
I'll keep the kid alive.
For a while, at least.

193
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,280
I'll have lunch.

194
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,652
Through the
superior vena cava...

195
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,088
into the right atrium...

196
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,889
through the tricuspid valve...

197
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,464
<i>and lodging to the wall
of the right ventricle.</i>

198
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,570
Can you turn off the pad?

199
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,776
- Capturing?
- Getting a native heart rate of 36.

200
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,907
No, that won't do.
Let's get him to 50.

201
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,774
<i>"The healer with
his magic powers!</i>

202
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,372
<i>"I could rub his
gentle brow for hours.</i>

203
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:20,216
"His manly chest,
his stubbled jaw.

204
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,846
Everything about
him leaves me raw"...

205
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,256
- Psych ward's upstairs.
- "with joy.

206
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:32,196
Oh, House, your very name will
never leave this girl the same."

207
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,259
It's not bad for an 82-year-old. She
asked me to give that to her true love.

208
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,203
What can I say? Chicks
with no teeth turn me on.

209
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,265
That's fairly disgusting.
And that's ageism.

210
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,810
You better watch
yourself around this babe.

211
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,369
Here are her test results.

212
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,986
Impressive.

213
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,491
Yeah.

214
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,720
I found the pesticide.
It's disulfoton.

215
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,025
And it's empty. He used up the
whole can. Okay, I'll get Chase on it.

216
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:09,160
The poison's called disulfoton. This should
bond with it and neutralize the poison.

217
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,000
Then his nervous
system will start sending

218
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:12,899
the correct signals
to the rest of his body.

219
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,374
But there was no disul—
Well, that stuff in that can.

220
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,673
The label says
"disulfoton." I can show you.

221
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,713
But you didn't test it.

222
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,579
You said Matt sprayed with
it this morning before school.

223
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,414
Matt started that garden himself
for an environmental science class.

224
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,064
- They weren't allowed to use pesticides.
- Apparently he cheated a little.

225
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,788
It was orange peel oil. Totally organic.
He dumped that other stuff last winter.

226
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,228
The symptoms fit. There must
have been some left in the can.

227
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,198
If you're wrong, what will
this treatment do to him?

228
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,397
Well, theoretically, it could
increase the toxicity and...

229
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,564
But we're not wrong. Don't.

230
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,098
We're not wrong. I
can't let you do this.

231
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,713
<i>Get a court order. Unless you wanna
see someone killed by sheer irrationality.</i>

232
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,312
Maternal instinct is always
irrational. Doesn't mean it's wrong.

233
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,755
Actually, that's the definition.

234
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,884
It doesn't make her
mentally incompetent.

235
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,894
She's risking her son's life...

236
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,795
based on a teenager's claim
that he washed something.

237
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,958
How mentally
incompetent can you get?

238
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,366
That's a brilliant
legal argument.

239
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,664
Listen, have your
Harvard law dog whip up

240
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,068
some high-grade
legal-sounding psychobabble:

241
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,306
<i>"Temporary insanity brought on
by acute panic distress syndrome."</i>

242
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,644
I don't care. We have
to give him the hydrolase.

243
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,048
<i>Her only sign of mental illness
is that she disagrees with you.</i>

244
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,610
Some would consider
that a sign of sanity.

245
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,920
Not the kid. Let's ask him. Oh,
no, I forgot. We can't. He's dying.

246
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:44,294
Get the mother to sign off that
she's refusing this treatment.

247
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,034
Good-bye.

248
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,046
"I, Margo Davis, have
been informed of the risks...

249
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,708
"which may arise from my
refusal of advised medical care.

250
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,378
<i>- I hereby release"—</i>
- Who are you?

251
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,614
I work for the hospital.

252
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,681
<i>"... the Princeton Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital and its employees,</i>

253
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,655
"agents and otherwise,
for any adverse

254
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,956
medical conditions
resulting from my refusal.

255
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,055
It is not the hospital's
fault if my son kicks off."

256
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,106
Kicks off?

257
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,627
I punched up the language.
Mostly for clarification.

258
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,539
"I understand my doctors consider
my decision to be completely idiotic"...

259
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,045
Why are you doing this? "But I am
convinced I know more than they do.

260
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,671
I took a biology
course in high school."

261
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,012
I assume that's—Yeah.

262
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:41,817
"Besides, I enjoy controlling
every single aspect of my son's life,

263
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,721
even if it means his death."

264
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:49,123
Sign here, please.
I brought a pen.

265
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,659
Who are you? I'm the doctor
who's trying to save your son.

266
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,499
You're the mom
who's letting him die.

267
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,199
Clarification—It's
a beautiful thing.

268
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:11,077
<i>Dr. Morell, contact the CAP lab.
Dr. Morell, contact the CAP lab.</i>

269
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,520
She rethought her position.
Start him on the hydrolase.

270
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,023
No. We've got a problem.

271
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,693
Three. One, two, three.

272
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,161
Heart rate's 49. O₂
stat, 84 and falling.

273
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,633
Saline, atropine
and diazepam, now.

274
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,762
His name is Chi Ling. He
was admitted 12 minutes ago.

275
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,035
<i>Identical symptoms as Matt.
Chase isn't sure he's gonna make it.</i>

276
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,211
This one. Bag.

277
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,438
Matt's next-door
neighbor, by any chance?

278
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,872
They live 10 miles apart.

279
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,376
Apparently, they don't
even know each other.

280
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,969
<i>We live in an apartment.
We have two bamboo trees.</i>

281
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,666
No pesticides. Just dry
seaweed for fertilizer.

282
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,884
<i>The second kid's heart
is almost as weak as</i>

283
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,075
<i>Matt's. We may need
to get it wired up too.</i>

284
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,001
And I don't know how
long Matt's brain will

285
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:49,081
hold up. His heart's not
pumping enough oxygen.

286
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,083
How much are you
giving him? 80%.

287
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,346
Make it 90. We're risking
damage to his retina.

288
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,048
What the heck. Do it anyway.
He's a calculus student.

289
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,581
Probably likes having a brain.
I'll have Foreman take care of it.

290
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,254
- I'm the primary.
- Yeah, but the mom
wants to get rid of you.

291
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,525
And you know me. I'm a
people-pleasing kind of guy.

292
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,091
She complained? About
me? <i>She went to the principal.</i>

293
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:13,606
Told Cuddy you took drugs in high school.
This is gonna go on your permanent record.

294
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,801
I was trying to get
information. It was a strategy.

295
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,916
She also used the word
"slacker." You wanna come in?

296
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,710
Smoke a little weed?
Watch some MTV?

297
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,618
High school has no idea
what could have happened.

298
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,655
You sure that Chi didn't
sneak onto Matt's tomato patch?

299
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,918
Maybe they sniffed
disulfoton together to get high.

300
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,269
Same school, different grades,
different cliques, different everything.

301
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,005
They managed to get poisoned together.
They must have something in common.

302
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,246
<i>Their classes aren't
even in the same building.</i>

303
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,558
<i>They don't even eat lunch
in the same lunchroom.</i>

304
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,796
How do they <i>get</i> to school?

305
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:50,005
Unless you're with the board, the police
or the union, I don't care who you are.

306
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,035
Sir, we need to test the
bus for chemical residue.

307
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,239
And I need to pick up
the basketball team.

308
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,646
You got a problem with
that, call my supervisor.

309
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,776
Two kids were poisoned
on your bus this morning.

310
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,185
They're dying.

311
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,519
<i>My God. The things he said.</i>

312
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:13,191
Dr. House wanted your son
to get the medicine he needed.

313
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,168
- He was willing to do whatever
it took to make that happen.
- The wrong kind of medicine.

314
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:21,435
He didn't know that. At the
time, it was our only choice.

315
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,669
He would have known
if he had listened to me.

316
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,177
He listened.

317
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,942
He just assumed you were wrong.

318
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,685
To be honest, that's true
of most of our patients.

319
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,314
You're just as pompous
and superior as he is!

320
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,462
Uh, Matt is back row right. The
Asian kid, uh, first or second row left.

321
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,399
Okay. Look, I got this rash
in kind of my groin region.

322
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,403
It's, um, not a symptom.

323
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,235
Neither is being obnoxious.
Looks like you're in the clear.

324
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,042
<i>- So who poisoned 'em?</i>
- We're not sure yet
if it was done on purpose.

325
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,135
Oh, yeah? You oughta
see these little bastards

326
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,247
screaming and punching
each other all day long.

327
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,121
Did you happen to notice if anyone was
doing any spraying near the bus route?

328
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:16,458
Oh! Yeah, there was this truck down
by the pond doing something or other.

329
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,362
It smelled kinda funny too.

330
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,536
Oh! Dr. House!

331
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,836
Well, it took you long enough.
We've been waiting here...

332
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,435
Mr. Adams, would you
step outside for a moment?

333
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,777
Why? Because you irritate me.

334
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,249
<i>He is my son, Doctor.</i>

335
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,946
He's just a little
cranky from not eating.

336
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,617
Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you
had any recent sexual activity?

337
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,628
What?

338
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,791
Well, I—I don't suppose
fantasies count.

339
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,630
Oh, my God.

340
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:59,229
Unfortunately, I've
hit kind of a dry spell.

341
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:03,072
Only for the last— Oh,
I don't know—15 years.

342
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:07,773
You see? She's—She's confused. My
father died eight years ago. Heart attack.

343
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,077
Not in bed, dear.

344
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,452
Why do you ask?

345
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:19,925
Because you have
tested positive for syphilis.

346
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,986
That's impossible!
And insulting.

347
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,735
I don't think it's the first time
that Mom has heard this diagnosis.

348
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,468
"Cupid's disease." That's
what we used to call it.

349
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,240
When did you get it?

350
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,615
Uh, 1939. Prom night, I think.

351
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,085
He had a Chevrolet.

352
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,282
It was before I met your father.

353
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,917
But you said that...

354
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,327
You said Dad
was your first love.

355
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,558
He was.

356
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,126
We're talking about sex.

357
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,696
But I was treated.

358
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,937
Which suppressed it—
In your case, for 60 years.

359
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,851
But now it's back, and
the spirochetes that cause

360
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,506
syphilis are eating
away at your brain cells.

361
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,211
Oh! That's revolting.

362
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,550
It's not as revolting as
chlamydia. That's got seepage.

363
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,886
<i>And it's the 2 1st century.</i>

364
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,450
We've got flying cars,
robot dogs and penicillin.

365
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,053
High-dose regimen for
two weeks, you're cured.

366
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,565
- I can't believe this.
- Yeah, well, pinch yourself.

367
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,627
<i>I guess for the next two weeks,
I'd better practice safe sex.</i>

368
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:45,403
You'll be fine. Just
feed that cranky kid.

369
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,050
The county's worried
about West Nile, so they

370
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:55,721
sprayed ethyl-parathion
right next to the bus route.

371
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:58,417
Do you have the hydrolase
for ethyl-parathion?

372
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,392
Yeah. Only one problem. Matt's
mother faxed his records to the C.D.C.

373
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,192
She refuses to let us do anything
until she hears back from them.

374
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,166
Well, you're getting good
at this Godlike doctor racket.

375
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,361
Why don't you talk
her out of this lunacy?

376
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,564
She's not really a big
fan of mine. Or mine.

377
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:17,576
Well, only one man left in the
bull pen, and he throws like a girl.

378
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,003
I hate sports metaphors.

379
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,344
Give her the high, hard one.

380
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,080
We really think the
hydrolase is the only...

381
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,281
I'm thinking about
transferring Matt out of here.

382
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,484
Ms. Davis, your son is very
sick. He won't survive a transfer.

383
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,688
I'm getting a second opinion
from the Center for Disease Control.

384
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,529
Right. Look, when my
grandmother got sick...

385
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,125
What? You're gonna tell me some
tough decision you had to make?

386
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:47,640
- I know how hard this is for you.
- Maybe embroider the story
a little? Make it fit?

387
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,198
I can't imagine
being in your position.

388
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,905
Honesty. A kind of vulnerable
honesty. That's your thing. And the looks.

389
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:58,280
- Oh, boy.
- They send a single woman
to hustle the single mom.

390
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,785
Actually, they sent a doctor!

391
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,379
To tell you that if your son
doesn't get this treatment,

392
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,015
there's a good chance he'll die.

393
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,789
That's what House said about a
treatment that would have killed Matt.

394
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,991
You've gotta do better
than that. No, it's on you.

395
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:16,263
You need to do better.
Right now. Yes or no?

396
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,006
- I don't know.
- Figure it out.

397
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,010
Wait.

398
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,992
Nurse!

399
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,127
- Help!
- Okay. Coming.

400
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,901
- Seizing. Suction.
<i>- Watch his head.</i>

401
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,465
My son!

402
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,612
<i>- Coming.</i>
- Diazepam.

403
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,709
<i>Got it.</i>

404
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,852
- Suction.
- Ten milligrams.

405
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,326
Right.

406
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,756
He's not responding.
Another 10 milligrams.

407
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,760
You're killing him!

408
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,729
<i>- You're killing him!</i>
- Get her out of here. Get her outta here!

409
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:58,362
<i>Come on, ma'am. Ma'am?</i>

410
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,343
<i>Their hearts are barely
pumping. Their lungs are shot.</i>

411
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,711
<i>Now they're
showing liver toxicity.</i>

412
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,115
I guess Matt's mom won't nominate
us for any Doctor of the Year awards.

413
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,644
Only explanation is they got poisoned
by something besides ethyl-parathion.

414
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:19,988
Then the hydrolase would release the
neurotoxins instead of bonding with them.

415
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,220
The only thing they have
in common is the bus.

416
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,229
Except their symptoms.
Given their severity...

417
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,391
and the fact their cardiac
symptoms are getting worse

418
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,734
much faster than their other
ones, what does that tell us?

419
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,133
The poison was probably
absorbed through the skin.

420
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:34,173
They were admitted at 8:45 and
11:00. When were they poisoned?

421
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,107
Absorption through the skin?
Anywhere from three to eight hours.

422
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,701
In a case that bad, more
like one and a half to four.

423
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,738
So Matt was poisoned before
7:15. Before he got on the bus.

424
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,446
You're thinking each kid got poisoned in
his own house? Two separate exposures?

425
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,786
What do teenage boys do in
the morning, besides the obvious?

426
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,554
Wake up, go to the bathroom,

427
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,721
then the obvious, then
check their zits in the mirror.

428
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,665
- Do they both use the same acne cream?
- Because acne cream contains lanolin,

429
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,232
which could have
pesticides, and you're

430
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:05,013
thinking they both
bought the same product...

431
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,701
- It was contaminated. Shaving cream.
- Chi doesn't look like he shaves.

432
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,936
But he sweats. Deodorant
could contain lanolin.

433
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,070
Do these people have animals?
Chi has a dog. Matt has a cat.

434
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,241
<i>Fleas. Flea powder.</i>
Okay. Go to their houses.

435
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,193
<i>Check for anything that
might have touched their skin...</i>

436
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,462
<i>between the time they got up
and the time they went to school.</i>

437
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,785
I'm running low on tomato sauce.

438
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:29,055
Oh! Dr. House! Hello.

439
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:33,326
- I sent you home.
- Well, I came back.

440
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,391
I took a cab,

441
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:40,269
so my son wouldn't try
to chaperone us this time.

442
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,639
I'm sorry, but... the fact that
the sexual pleasure center...

443
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,577
of your cerebral cortex has been
overstimulated by spirochetes is...

444
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:51,674
It's a poor basis for a relationship.
I learned that one the hard way.

445
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:57,347
Doctor, um, these feelings
that I've been having...

446
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,119
Is it all because
of the syphilis?

447
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,455
Yes.

448
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:08,227
Then... here's the
prescription you gave me.

449
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,802
Well, it's not likely I'm
going to infect anyone.

450
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,710
No, but it'll kill you.

451
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,107
Well, gotta go sometime,

452
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,378
and...

453
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:31,185
I really don't want to play
canasta for the rest of my life.

454
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,352
I—I like feeling sexy again...

455
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:41,025
and... making a fool out of myself
with handsome, young doctors.

456
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,439
Do you think that I would
have given you this...

457
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,305
if it would stop you
from flirting with me?

458
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,403
Well, but if I'm cured— Then
all the spirochetes will die off.

459
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,331
But the little pieces
of your cerebral cortex

460
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,975
that have been
destroyed won't grow back.

461
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,220
You're brain damaged.

462
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,225
Doomed to feeling good
for the rest of your life.

463
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,326
Really? Well, thank you.

464
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,264
Georgia.

465
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,269
Yeah.

466
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,272
When I stop being contagious,

467
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,275
I'll come by for a checkup.

468
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:32,015
Yeah.

469
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,120
- Matt uses Sure.
- Chi uses Old Spice.

470
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,625
- No zit cream.
- Lucky kid.

471
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,560
Floral air freshener.
Doesn't matter.

472
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,565
When was the last time you heard
of a teenage boy using air freshener?

473
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,567
Pert shampoo.

474
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,728
Um, Johnson's over here.

475
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,065
Matt's mom would <i>make</i>
him use air freshener.

476
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,803
There are limits to a
mother's power. Even hers.

477
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,777
Just check.

478
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,642
Negative on the floral.

479
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,650
Matt's A.L.T.'s are up to 800.

480
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,983
If they get any higher,
we can toss his liver.

481
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:12,081
- Yeah.
- No matches on flea powder
or underarm deodorant.

482
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,786
- Or any other kind of deodorant.
- What about shampoo?

483
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,695
No to shampoo, bar soap,
dish soap, dish detergent.

484
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,809
How about laundry detergent? Maybe they
both washed their clothes this morning.

485
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,961
I'll check. You
know, if we cure Matt,

486
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,199
he can use his close brush
with death on his college essays.

487
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:30,003
- Admission guys love that stuff.
- That's how you got in, right?

488
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,271
Jailhouse diary?

489
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,473
Uh, TKO.

490
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:41,145
TKO. Liquid?

491
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,450
Liquid, 128 ounces.

492
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,981
- 128. Yellow jug. "Special"— -
"Environmentally safe formula."

493
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,152
It's the same. Bring
in the detergent.

494
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,924
So the detergent was
contaminated with pesticides?

495
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,990
Which soaked into their clothes
and got absorbed into their skin.

496
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,365
Hi. Uh, listen, the clothes
your son wore today...

497
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,272
- He washed them this morning, right?
- What?

498
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,778
Nice, respectful Asian
kid does the laundry.

499
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,179
My wife said he didn't.

500
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,351
Well, then I'm betting he washed
them last night without you knowing.

501
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,721
He doesn't even know
how to turn on the machine.

502
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,785
<i>And those clothes were new. Nobody
washed them.</i> His clothes are all new?

503
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,991
The ones he wore
today, yes. Never washed.

504
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,075
Now what?

505
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,447
What about Matt's
clothes? Were they new?

506
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,575
Uh, they're ratty
old jeans, I think.

507
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,585
They've been bagged
and taken downstairs.

508
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,298
"Davis." Yeah, they're Matt's.

509
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,603
And they're old.

510
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,368
And yet the label isn't
faded in the slightest.

511
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,105
Fake old. Hundred dollars
for the homeless look.

512
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,706
What? Kids aren't
pretentious in England?

513
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,082
Chi was wearing a different brand. How
could they both have been contaminated?

514
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,021
That is the question for the
ages. Meantime, get these tested.

515
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,855
I never bother to wash new
clothes before I wear them.

516
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,053
Right. Your wife does. She likes
you feeling nice and comfortable.

517
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,291
Hey, I'm a man. I don't
have time for laundry.

518
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,889
I'm saving lives here.

519
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,458
No, she doesn't
wash them either.

520
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:15,132
So your skin absorbs a little dye,
the odd chemical here and there.

521
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,607
You know me—
Mr. Living On The Edge.

522
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,408
Judging by the
self-importance of your strut,

523
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,188
you have identified the
chemical in question.

524
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,341
- Phosdrin.
- Hit 'em with the hydrolase.

525
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:28,012
- Chi's parents said yes,
but— - Mighty Mom said no.

526
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:33,024
<i>Well, she's gonna feel like a million
bucks when Chi lives and her son dies.</i>

527
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,756
Send Cameron. She's the only one of you
who's managed to talk her into anything.

528
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,603
Not this time. Matt's
mom won't make a move

529
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:41,425
until she gets that
opinion from the C.D.C.

530
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,931
Godot would be faster.

531
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,406
What is this?

532
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,908
Thought I'd hang out.

533
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,013
In case you change your mind.

534
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,346
Then I could give Matt
the medicine right away.

535
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:40,852
Don't worry. I've got time.

536
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,829
The C.D.C. promised they'd call.

537
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,832
I'm sure they will.

538
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:51,165
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe the day after.

539
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,070
It takes time to
review faxed records.

540
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:58,839
Then they'll probably tell you they can't
make a decision based on faxed records.

541
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,311
This is Suzie.

542
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,010
She's never gonna
marry him. No money.

543
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,246
What makes you think
you're right this time?

544
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,250
Same reason as last time.

545
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,121
If you wanna see how the
other kid does first, that's okay.

546
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:22,759
Might help you. Although
there's a real good chance...

547
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:28,102
- What? Matt might kick off?
- That's a little blunt.

548
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,301
I was gonna say
"run out of time"...

549
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:34,437
or just kind of let
my voice trail off.

550
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:47,692
Hello? Yes, this is Margo Davis.

551
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,793
But you have his
records. I sent them.

552
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,832
Yes, I understand.

553
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,638
They can't help me.
They haven't seen him.

554
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,016
<i>They can't make a
decision—</i> Give it to him.

555
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,457
"The C.D.C. is unable to give
an opinion at this time, ma'am.

556
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,028
We're gonna have a doctor
in your area next week."

557
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,597
You fooled her with that?

558
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:48,006
House!

559
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,047
So I'm gonna be cured? As long as
you don't wear any more poison pants.

560
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,955
I'm sorry, Mom. I knew
the pants were stolen.

561
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:41,329
<i>They were only five bucks. You're
gonna give me hell, aren’t you?</i>

562
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,267
Oh, honey, I'm just
glad you're alive.

563
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,634
Let's get you home
so you can rest.

564
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,299
Maybe I am too hard on you.

565
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,570
You don't have to make
up that test till next week.

566
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,340
<i>You can stay in bed and
work on your applications.</i>

567
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,508
<i>Some guy was selling pants off
the back of his truck near the school.</i>

568
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,075
When he wasn't busy as
a clothing entrepreneur,

569
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,587
he did day labor at a
cornfield out on Route 1.

570
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,055
He used the same
truck for both jobs.

571
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,686
So he spilled pesticide on the
pants and was too lazy to clean up.

572
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,959
Real question is
why are you still here?

573
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,399
Why aren't you out there
making up with the joyful mother?

574
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,131
Why would I do
that? <i>No reason at all.</i>

575
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,868
If you don't care
about her. Or her son.

576
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,673
Oh, Dr. House.

577
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,776
The C.D.C. called.

578
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,719
- Again.
- Oops.

579
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:46,054
- Who are those guys?
- Oh, they're the arrogant jerks
that saved your life.

580
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,519
That's some bad hat, Harry.
