1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,736
<i>And the only thing wrong—</i>

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,103
<i>The only thing wrong
with the American dream...</i>

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,768
is people— too many people...

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,041
Too many of us telling young
people that the dream is dead.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,947
They told me that when I was
growing up in the slums of Trenton.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,247
And they were wrong.

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,735
<i>They told me that
when I decided to run for</i>

8
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:23,313
<i>senator, with only $58
in my savings account.</i>

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,950
And they were wrong.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,011
And they are still
telling me that now— that

11
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:29,861
I don't have a chance
because I'm black,

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,637
because I don't have
the right nose, because

13
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:35,392
I still only have $58
in my savings account.

14
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:49,613
With your help, we can
keep that dream alive.

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,880
And in closing,

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,597
<i>just...</i>

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,003
let me say...

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,734
Let me say that you should
all donate the legal maximum...

19
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,744
to the next president
of the United States.

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,677
Are you okay? Do you need some water or
something? No. I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,789
Handsome guy like you, I
bet you get 70% of the women.

22
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,655
Well, here's hoping.

23
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,525
Of course, it helps
your wife died of cancer.

24
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,464
I mean, I'm sorry, but the
sympathy vote’s in your pocket.

25
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,364
Yeah, I appreciate your support.

26
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,804
Listen, Senator, my union
has a hell of a war chest.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,740
Um, I've always been
strong on the union.

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,212
<i>The thing is, you always go on in
your speeches about the workers...</i>

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,875
<i>in Indonesia,
Cambodia, Timbuktu.</i>

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,976
Because I think we
have a— A moral...

31
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,816
My union members are hurting.

32
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:05,120
They don't care about moral this
and moral that. Are you all right?

33
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,854
- Senator?
- Ugh. Hey!

34
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,657
<i>The guys are gonna love that.</i>

35
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,292
Everyone, give him some
room. Give him room to breathe!

36
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:19,272
Back off, please!
Senator, are you all right?

37
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,168
<i>The senator's suffering from nausea,
headache and mental confusion.</i>

38
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,236
Ah, bad sushi is
so hard to diagnose.

39
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,840
<i>You're being childish.</i>

40
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,792
<i>Look, if his case is
as trivial as you think,</i>

41
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,547
<i>it'll take you three
minutes to diagnose.</i>

42
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:11,558
Uh-huh. Three minutes that I could spend
sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.

43
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,288
- You're mad at me.
- Nope.

44
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,093
I never liked
Cameron or Foreman.

45
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,450
You know why I'm forcing you
to fire one of them? Because

46
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,500
you need to prove to me
that you're a team player.

47
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,562
Now, if you did that, you wouldn't
need to go through this exercise.

48
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,077
Fine. I'll hold the senator's
hair while he upchucks.

49
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,408
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

50
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,007
<i>I need you to give a speech at the National
Cardiology Conference, um, next week.</i>

51
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,109
I don't do speeches. I'm shy.

52
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:42,486
<i>Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has
developed a new A CE inhibitor.</i>

53
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,550
I would like you to extol the virtues
of this breakthrough medication.

54
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,788
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals?

55
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,161
Wait a second? Don't
I own that company?

56
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,223
Oh, no, that's right. You do.

57
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,465
Viopril is a significant
improvement over the old version.

58
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,563
It's all there in the study.

59
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,767
I know its price tag is
significantly improved.

60
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:06,371
You can either give one 10-minute
talk and one three-minute diagnosis,

61
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,382
or you can fire
one of your pets.

62
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,785
My understanding was that you
believed in rationality above all else.

63
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,258
Viopril.

64
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,962
<i>I appreciate your
keeping the media away.</i>

65
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,631
<i>We're keeping your staff
away as well. Take it easy now.</i>

66
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:36,152
- I'm in the middle of a campaign.
- The faster we can get you better,
the faster you can get out of here.

67
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,510
Anyone else at the
fund-raiser get sick?

68
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,038
I don't think so, and I don't think that's
it. I've been under the weather for weeks.

69
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,575
Lots of traveling. I'm supposed
to be in the Sudan next week.

70
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,248
Oh!

71
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,319
Helps me concentrate.

72
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,089
Even better than drugs.

73
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,224
Open your mouth, please.

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,529
Ahh.

75
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,537
That's quite a scar.

76
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,335
When I was six, I fell off
the swing and bit my tongue.

77
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,309
Couldn't talk right
for the longest time.

78
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:15,179
Lots of teasing. It just made me fight
harder, speak up for those who can't.

79
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,444
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:22,546
Tongues heal too fast. Your political
consultants have written you a nice story.

81
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,821
<i>In a tight race, the lispers
alone could put you over the top.</i>

82
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,488
You a Republican, or
you just hate all politicians?

83
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:33,659
I just find being forced to
sit through drivel annoying.

84
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,463
You find sincerity annoying?

85
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,629
<i>You're a black kid
from the ghetto...</i>

86
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,038
who made it to Yale Law
and the United States Senate.

87
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,407
<i>That's a sufficiently mythical story.
You don't need to lie about your tongue.</i>

88
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,680
Must've missed it.

89
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,415
What's wrong?

90
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,823
What is it? It's not
the food. It's your brain.

91
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,733
<i>Get an M.R.I. and
a lumbar puncture.</i>

92
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,794
Cancel your travel plans.

93
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,078
<i>The senator's L. P.
Showed no sign of</i>

94
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,913
<i>infection, and the
M.R.I. looks fairly clean.</i>

95
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,943
I guess we can tell him he's
<i>fairly</i> healthy and can go home.

96
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,080
Well, there is something
in Broca's area,

97
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,624
but it's small, low intensity.

98
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,628
Most likely just background
noise. Care to bet your job on that?

99
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,290
What was that? What was what?

100
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:41,460
You got annoyed. That
was clearly an annoyed face.

101
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,696
I get annoyed by glib
remarks about our futures.

102
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,606
Last week you didn't get annoyed.
You made poopie in your pants. It's weird.

103
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,112
It's almost like now you know
you have nothing to worry about.

104
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,170
Chase has nothing
to worry about?

105
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,739
None of you has
anything to worry about.

106
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,751
What happened?

107
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,721
Vogler saw the error of
his ways and repented.

108
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,487
<i>The lesion could be nothing. Also
could be a brain tumor or an infection.</i>

109
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,585
There's only one
way to find out which.

110
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,257
You want to cut into his brain?

111
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,063
Dangerous, I know. Especially since
he's a politician, his brain's all twisted.

112
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,560
But I weighed that against
the risk of him stroking

113
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,937
out before lunch. Call
Surgery. Get it scheduled.

114
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,782
- You're not pregnant.
- Well, I told you that.

115
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,914
There's got to be some
other reason I'm still spotting.

116
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,425
Sure. You <i>were</i> pregnant.

117
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,690
Based on your hormone
levels, you've had a miscarriage.

118
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,663
I haven't even been on a date.

119
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,830
Right. And since it's
physically impossible to

120
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:48,930
have sex without someone
buying you dinner...

121
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,803
<i>I haven't had sex since I
split up with my husband.</i>

122
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,502
- That was almost a year ago.
- Fine. Have it your way.

123
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,511
Immaculate conception.

124
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,777
- Um, what do I do?
- Well, it's obvious.

125
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,818
Start a religion.

126
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,780
In my office.

127
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,528
Afternoon delight. She
just loves the hard wood.

128
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,626
<i>You're not doing a brain biopsy
based on a spot on an M.R.I.</i>

129
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,638
Where'd you get that?

130
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,799
Not on a United States senator.

131
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,039
Oh, just so I'm clear— If he was a janitor,
that would be okay? Do you have a list?

132
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,378
A brain biopsy can cause
permanent neurological damage.

133
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,044
Uh-huh. Whereas tumors are really good
for brains. Make 'em grow big and strong.

134
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,317
- It's my call.
- No, it's not.

135
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,019
- You're pulling rank on patient care?
- It's not my call either.

136
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:51,030
- It's up to you.
- Either it's a tumor or it's an infection
that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up.

137
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,589
Either way, unless we treat it
immediately, it could kill you.

138
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,278
Or it could be nothing. Reading
brain M.R.I.'s is not an exact science.

139
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,328
Well, what caused my s-symptoms?

140
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,273
Wow! Excellent question. Many
doctors wouldn't have gone there.

141
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,401
It could be a transient
ischemic attack.

142
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,073
<i>You could make the argument for
watching carefully for the time being.</i>

143
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,826
<i>Hmm, but you’d only
make that argument if</i>

144
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>you were an administrator
covering your ass.</i>

145
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,277
That's absurd and
insulting. Insulting, yes.

146
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,414
What would the voters think?

147
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,688
If they find out I've
had a b-brain biopsy?

148
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,555
This could leave you
b-b-b-brain damaged,

149
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,931
and you're worried
about NASCAR dads?

150
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,218
It's not a brain tumor.

151
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,484
It's not a bacterial
infection either.

152
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,755
<i>So you biopsied
his brain for nothing?</i>

153
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:58,561
If that were true, would Dr. Wilson's
mouth be contorted into that ugly shape?

154
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,000
It's toxoplasmosis.

155
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,061
You sure?

156
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,575
Which means the Great
Black Hope has full-blown AIDS.

157
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,008
They're gonna love
that in Dubuque.

158
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,353
Toxoplasmosis is a fairly
common fungus you can get...

159
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,550
from eating under-cooked
meat or touching cat feces.

160
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,890
In rare cases, the fungi travel up the
bloodstream and latch onto the brain,

161
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,863
causing a lesion
or inflammation.

162
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,422
So, what's the prognosis?

163
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,999
<i>Toxo usually
responds to treatment,</i>

164
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,302
but it only causes a
lesion in your brain if your

165
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:43,442
immune system is
extremely weak to begin with.

166
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,709
Senator, I'm afraid
you have AIDS.

167
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,544
As I'm sure...

168
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:58,524
No! As I'm sure you know, people
with H.I.V. can live a long time.

169
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,289
- What else could do this to me?
- Theoretically, certain cancers.

170
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,298
<i>If you have toxo in your
brain, you have AIDS.</i>

171
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,466
I do not have AIDS.

172
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,201
I don't sh—sh—shoot up drugs.

173
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,006
I don't s-sleep with...

174
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,070
This is very bad news. I
get that, and I sympathize.

175
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,321
But we gotta speed through
the denial phase because

176
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,414
you need antiretrovirals
and you need them fast.

177
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,952
But—You haven't even
tested me for H.I.V.!

178
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,963
- We will.
- But the toxo drugs
are gonna piss off your fungi.

179
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,090
And when fungi get pissed...

180
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,761
I am not going
to take the pills.

181
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,464
You're afraid
word will leak out.

182
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,709
Trust me. You're not gonna
be president either way.

183
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,678
They don't call it the White
House because of the paint job.

184
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,112
Here's what you're gonna do.

185
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,277
You're gonna give me
the drugs for the toxo only.

186
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,853
You're going to test me for
H.I.V., under a false name.

187
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,586
<i>You are going to
test me for cancer...</i>

188
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,652
and anything else that
could have done this to me.

189
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,257
<i>If I have cancer,
I will deal with it.</i>

190
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,528
But I do not...

191
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,165
have AIDS.

192
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,035
"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals
are pleased to announce...

193
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,455
that Dr. Gregory House
will present the latest

194
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,743
research on our exciting
new ACE inhibitor."

195
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,812
You're making that up.
That's Vogler's company.

196
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:39,450
Press release. "During an address at the
North American Cardiology Conference."

197
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,329
- House never gives speeches.
<i>- But when I really believe in something—</i>

198
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,233
Gosh dang it, I got a chance
to make a difference here.

199
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,237
You made a deal with Vogler?

200
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,964
It's all the rage.
Everybody's doing it.

201
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,843
So, what's the deal? You get to
keep all of us if you flog his products?

202
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,711
One speech. No biggie.

203
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,243
<i>Foreman's doing a bone
marrow biopsy to check for cancer.</i>

204
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,050
Cancer? The senator's got AIDS.

205
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,557
Cancer sounds better
in a press release.

206
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,423
I need you guys to rush
the ELISA test for H.I.V.

207
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,656
Thank you.

208
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,493
For the speech.

209
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,056
When I said rush, I
meant, you know, fast.

210
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,104
- "Stat's" the word you doctors use, right?
- I know it's hard for you.

211
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,105
Double stat?

212
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,402
This may sting a little.

213
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,972
Sorry. It wasn't the shot.

214
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,680
It's, um— My head's killing me.

215
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,416
Senator, we don't
have to do this <i>now.</i>

216
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,823
We can hold off till your
H.I.V. test comes back.

217
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,590
Because you figure it's
gonna come back positive.

218
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,756
In my experience— Patients lie.

219
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,768
Politicians lie more.
Black politicians...

220
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,771
Oh. I don't think black politicians
lie more than white politicians.

221
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,639
- We lie less.
- You figure we're morally superior?

222
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,736
I've got my theories.

223
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,977
No, we— We just
can't get away with it.

224
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:16,489
No one's gonna g-give
us the benefit of the doubt.

225
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,253
<i>No one's gonna cut
us a second chance.</i>

226
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,729
And when it happens, it's
not just a—a bad politician.

227
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,095
It's—It's a bad role model.

228
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,624
It's a—a dis...

229
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,434
<i>Discredit to the race.</i>

230
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,952
You ready? Yeah.

231
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,989
Yeah.

232
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,161
Take a deep breath.

233
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,697
Dr. House, I just wanted...

234
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,105
You're welcome again. I
want you to know how much...

235
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,700
Got it. You're grateful.

236
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,611
Apparently you seem to think it
will mean a lot to me to know that.

237
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,171
Do you know why
people pray to God?

238
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,718
I thought you didn't
believe in God. I don't.

239
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,186
Well, then you better be
making a very good point.

240
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,947
Do you think they pray
to him and praise him

241
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,767
because they want him
to know how great he is?

242
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,350
God already knows that.

243
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,690
Are you comparing me to God?

244
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,403
I mean, that's great, but just so
you know, I've never made a tree.

245
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,662
I thank you because it
means something to me...

246
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,231
to be grateful
for what I receive.

247
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,243
You are the most naive
atheist I've ever met.

248
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,219
Dr. House, you have
a patient in room one.

249
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,587
Thank God.

250
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,186
People pray so that God
won't crush them like bugs.

251
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,501
I'm not gonna crush you.

252
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,097
"Petechial" bruising? I don't
know if I pronounced that right.

253
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,837
Gosh, the Internet is
such a wonderful tool.

254
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,506
It could be leukemia.
Definitely possible.

255
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,914
The more likely
diagnosis is hickey.

256
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,714
Well, it can't be a hickey.

257
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,278
Why is everybody so
ashamed of sex all of a sudden?

258
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,256
I'm not having sex.

259
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,624
I've barely even thought about
sex since my marriage. Ow!

260
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,357
I say you're having
sex, you say you're not.

261
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,366
Either you're
lying or I'm wrong.

262
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,562
- Or there's some middle ground.
- You mean, like, oral?

263
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,105
I mean, you're having
sex without knowing it.

264
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,233
<i>I'm testing you for
booze, drugs and G.H.B.</i>

265
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,710
I don't drink or—What's G.H.B.?

266
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,940
The date-rape drug.

267
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,233
It's positive.

268
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,514
Your "T" cell count is eight,

269
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,075
which means there's a
good chance you'll die.

270
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,782
<i>I'm telling you this because we
need to contact your sexual partners.</i>

271
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,623
I've only had two girlfriends.

272
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,823
Two. After my wife died.

273
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,356
<i>I used c-condoms.</i>

274
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,838
<i>You know the chances of you getting H. I.
V. from heterosexual sex with a condom?</i>

275
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,033
Yes.

276
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,042
<i>Someday there will
be a black president.</i>

277
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,271
Someday there will
be a gay president.

278
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,372
<i>Maybe there'll even be
a gay, black president.</i>

279
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,146
But one combination I do not see
happening is gay, black and dead.

280
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,947
You need to stop lying to me.

281
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,186
It must be miserable, always
assuming the worst in people.

282
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,319
Cut the crap. You're dying.

283
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,558
And you're clever, you're
witty and you are a coward.

284
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,998
You're scared of taking chances.

285
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,923
I take chances all the time.
It's one of my worst qualities.

286
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:24,947
On people?

287
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,841
Wanting to believe the best
about people doesn't make it true.

288
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,789
Being afraid to believe
it doesn't make it false.

289
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,715
Well, that's very moving. It's
a shame I don't vote. Hmm.

290
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,048
This is who <i>I</i> am.
I believe in people.

291
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,351
I'm not hiply cynical, and I
don't make easy, snide remarks.

292
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:48,156
I would rather think that people are
good and be disappointed once and again.

293
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,406
I need to draw some more blood.

294
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,708
Nurse!

295
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,775
The antiretrovirals
aren't working.

296
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,843
That's not surprising.

297
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,647
He's just gonna keep getting
worse. You realize that, right?

298
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,784
Why are you spying on my case?

299
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,055
Why are you giving
that speech next week?

300
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,940
We're both just doing what we have to
do. You don't see a problem with that?

301
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,297
Checking in on a patient?

302
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,996
Yeah, wow. How do I
look myself in the mirror?

303
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,715
You're not the one being asked to
perpetrate a fraud on the American people.

304
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,732
It's a 10-minute speech.
That I've been ordered to give.

305
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,404
Vogler's drug works. Don't care.

306
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,662
Why do you have to make
everything so dramatic?

307
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,472
I'm a very high-strung
little lap dog.

308
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,594
<i>Uh-uh. No pills.</i>

309
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,325
What's going on?

310
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,630
The antiretrovirals
aren't working.

311
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,603
Why not?

312
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,106
Because you don't have AIDS.

313
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,170
<i>The first test was
a false positive.</i>

314
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,679
Happens one time in every 5,000.

315
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,307
You r-ran a second test?

316
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

317
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,388
You're still dying.

318
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:02,559
<i>The only difference is,
now we don't know why.</i>

319
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,802
<i>He's continuing to lose control
of the muscles on his right side.</i>

320
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:20,108
- His brain is getting foggier,
and his "T" cells are still in single digits.
- Why are we doing this here?

321
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,205
So Cuddy can't find us.

322
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,248
<i>Unless we figure out
the underlying disease,</i>

323
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:26,082
<i>this guy's lied to
his last constituent.</i>

324
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,213
- False negative
on the P.C.R. AIDS test?
- Ran it twice.

325
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,220
- Immunoglobulin deficiency?
- No history of respiratory problems.

326
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,227
Idiopathic "T" cell deficiency.

327
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,678
Idiopathic—from the Latin
meaning "we're idiots"

328
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:39,959
'cause we can't figure
out what's causing it.

329
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,096
Give him a whole body scan.

330
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,162
- You hate whole body scans.
- 'Cause they're useless.

331
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,115
Could probably scan
any one of us and find

332
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,175
five different doodads
that look like cancer.

333
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,735
But when you're fourth down
and a hundred to go, in the snow,

334
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,749
you don't call a running play up
the middle, unless you're the Jets.

335
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,411
I hate sports metaphors.

336
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,752
<i>Why did you order
the second AIDS test?</i>

337
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,952
Standard procedure. Oh, well,
that's you— Mr. Standard Procedure.

338
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,518
You suspected the first
test was a false positive?

339
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,611
I knew he was going
to Africa, and I figured

340
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:13,396
he was vaccinated
for Hep "A" and "B."

341
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,457
That could cause
a false positive.

342
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:20,529
- You knew that before you ordered
the first test. What changed?
- I should have ordered both.

343
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,598
You were sure he had AIDS.

344
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,271
Then you talked to him, then
you had doubts. What did he say?

345
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,942
He said he had not
engaged in any risky behavior.

346
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,008
Huh. And you believed him.

347
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,350
He didn't have
any reason to lie.

348
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,981
Everybody lies,
except politicians?

349
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:41,721
<i>House, I believe
you're a romantic.</i>

350
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,229
You didn't just believe
him, you believed <i>in</i> him!

351
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,027
Do you want to come over tonight
and watch old movies and cry?

352
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,830
Dr. Cameron's getting to you.

353
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,714
Well, I guess you can't be around that
much niceness and not get any on you.

354
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,071
Is that why you haven't
put the moves on her?

355
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,736
What makes you think I
haven't put the moves on her?

356
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,013
Oh! Oh, boy! You're in trouble.

357
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,259
You have restored my
faith in the human race.

358
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,664
- You're lying.
- No. I'm not lying.

359
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,171
Just got your results back.
No G.H.B., no nothing.

360
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,696
It means you're having
sex and you're lying about it.

361
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,573
No. And I have a new symptom.

362
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:35,843
I have a rash on my butt.

363
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,745
Do you wanna? Yeah.

364
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,026
- What is it?
- It's a carpet burn.

365
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,189
No. It can't be.

366
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,733
Doctor, I love sex.

367
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,793
I miss it. I haven't
had any in over a year.

368
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:03,366
Well, you managed to keep this appointment,
so you have no short-term memory problem.

369
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,038
Multiple personalities? Do you
find yourself losing chunks of time?

370
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,880
Do you wake up, and
you don't remember falling

371
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:12,574
asleep? No. I just wake
up really exhausted.

372
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,213
- Something upsetting you?
- No.

373
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,392
My ex lives in the
apartment downstairs.

374
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,312
<i>He's always calling me,
always wanting to get</i>

375
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,295
<i>back together, complaining
about mixed signals.</i>

376
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:29,131
<i>"Get out of my life." How
much clearer can you get?</i>

377
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,338
We have a sleep
lab in the basement.

378
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,672
If nothing else, it will get you
away from your ex for a night.

379
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,020
Slightly enlarged lymph
node in his left armpit.

380
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,119
How slightly? Quarter mil.

381
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,130
- Lymphoma?
<i>- Sure.</i>

382
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,757
Or he's had a cold
in the last six months.

383
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:05,464
- What, you got her on speed dial?
- I just follow the scent of arrogance.

384
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:10,373
<i>Another slightly enlarged node over here.
Two more in his neck and one in his groin.</i>

385
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,195
And there's a cyst in his liver.

386
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,675
<i>It looks complex.
Central necrosis?</i>

387
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,773
<i>Spontaneous
bleeding. It's benign.</i>

388
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,377
<i>I was rooting for a really cool tumor.
Instead we're stuck with this crap.</i>

389
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,047
<i>Doesn't matter. Once you
find 'em, you gotta check 'em.</i>

390
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,889
Knock yourselves out.

391
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,951
<i>I just saw Senator
Wright. He looks like hell.</i>

392
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,862
That sushi must've been a
lot worse than you thought.

393
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,890
Mr. Vogler, would you like
a free whole body scan?

394
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,200
<i>A man of your stature should get himself
checked at least three times a year.</i>

395
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,402
Here's a few key points I want
you to cover during your speech.

396
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,246
<i>Fourteen pages.</i>

397
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,077
The audience will be
comatose by paragraph two.

398
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,550
Throw in a joke.

399
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,152
Dr. Chase, we need to talk.

400
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,662
<i>- How do you see this ending?</i>
- What ending?

401
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,064
I can't fire you, so
you have no reason to

402
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:10,726
fear me and, therefore,
no reason to lie to me.

403
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:15,741
You told Cuddy where I was.
You told Vogler what I was doing.

404
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,412
Yeah. So how can
I work with you?

405
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,712
Well, you don't have a choice.

406
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,455
<i>This might hurt a little.</i>

407
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,257
Lie to me.

408
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,231
Okay. It'll feel like
a gentle massage.

409
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,235
House...

410
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:46,466
is a lousy teacher.

411
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,736
You can't lie for beans.

412
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,970
<i>Have you ever told
any really big ones?</i>

413
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,979
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

414
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:58,609
I might be messed up,
but I'm not that out of it.

415
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,121
<i>Strap his arm down.</i>

416
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,432
Am I going to be okay?

417
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,401
I hope so.

418
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,003
I am selling my soul.

419
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,741
Just a little piece. And you
are getting something in return.

420
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,750
I said I was selling it. Didn't
say I was giving it away.

421
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,310
That would be
immoral and stupid.

422
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,447
All they've done
is add an antacid.

423
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,424
Does it work?
That's not the point.

424
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,325
Of course it's the point.
He's not asking you to lie.

425
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,922
He's not asking you to do something
illegal. He's not <i>asking me</i> to do anything.

426
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,968
He's not ordering you. He gave
you a choice. You chose your staff.

427
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,269
I know this isn't easy
for you. You'll suffer.

428
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,603
Vicodin sales in
Jersey will triple.

429
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,700
But you are doing a good thing.

430
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,178
Only you could feel like crap
about doing something good.

431
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:13,181
<i>Kidney and liver cysts are both benign,
and the lymph nodes all came back clean.</i>

432
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,138
<i>His left armpit node has
antibodies for C. D. 1 1.</i>

433
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:18,060
Not enough to indicate lymphoma.

434
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,224
We never tested for
hairy cell leukemia.

435
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,963
<i>No, but we would have picked it up
somewhere else besides one lymph node.</i>

436
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:28,030
- And his spleen isn't enlarged.
- Size isn't everything.

437
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,541
The spleen is the
mother lode for hairy cells.

438
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,411
Let's cut it open.

439
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,880
<i>You can't biopsy his
spleen. It'll bleed like stink.</i>

440
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,818
In the senator's condition, a spleen biopsy
could easily cause sepsis and kill him.

441
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,912
Why do you do this to me?

442
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:46,356
Now if I kill him, I can't tell the judge
I had no idea of the risks involved.

443
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,102
<i>His brain is turning
into mush, and he's at</i>

444
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,827
<i>risk for more infections.
We have to do it.</i>

445
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,694
See? That'll sound
much better in court.

446
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,701
Okay. Go tell our human pincushion
we'll be sticking him one more time.

447
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,234
<i>Cuddy.</i>

448
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,241
Don't you hate doing this?

449
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,935
Yeah.

450
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,685
What's up?

451
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,523
You like me.

452
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,804
Why?

453
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,806
That's kind of a sad question.

454
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,871
I'm just trying to figure
out what makes you tick.

455
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:47,249
I am not warm and fuzzy, and you are
basically a stuffed animal made by Grandma.

456
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,311
I don't think that's
why you're asking.

457
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,951
- I think this is because of the speech.
- God, don't try and pick me apart.

458
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,086
Then why are you asking?

459
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,097
What do you want to hear?

460
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:23,783
Hey, Senator. We need to do
one more biopsy—on your spleen.

461
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,690
I'll have to sign lefty.

462
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,251
My fingers aren't working.

463
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,126
<i>Have you been coughing a lot?</i>

464
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,263
Does it hurt?

465
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,275
It's like I can't get air.

466
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,977
Is that from the toxo?

467
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,642
No. This is—This is new.

468
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,547
You don't need to sign.
We can't do the biopsy.

469
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,428
<i>The senator's breathing
is severely impaired.</i>

470
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,798
His O₂ sat levels are at 89.

471
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,337
<i>His silver stain indicates
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.</i>

472
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:15,272
Another killer fungus. It's
consistent with hairy cell leukemia.

473
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,333
<i>But we can't biopsy his
spleen. Respiratory distress.</i>

474
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,175
<i>His platelets are 20 and dropping.
His blood won't clot worth a damn.</i>

475
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,943
<i>There's gotta be another
way to diagnose hairy cell.</i>

476
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,179
<i>No. His bone marrow's indeterminate.
Spleen biopsy's the only way to go.</i>

477
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,222
You know, when the Inuit go
fishing, they don't look for fish.

478
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,028
Why, Dr. House?

479
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:43,432
They look for the blue heron
because there's no way to see the fish.

480
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:46,199
But if there's fish, there's
gonna be birds fishing.

481
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,503
Now, if he's got hairy cell, what
else should we see circling overhead?

482
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,263
He should have all
sorts of weird viruses.

483
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,705
H.T.L.V. and A.T.L.V.

484
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,477
We can test for
them. Run the titers.

485
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,920
<i>These were your brain
waves at 2:45 a.m.</i>

486
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:05,549
<i>Now, here it comes. There's an
abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep.</i>

487
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,520
This indicates
partial sleep arousal.

488
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,826
Most common type is
somnambulism. Sleepwalking.

489
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,493
That would explain why
I'm so tired when I wake up.

490
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,866
Yes. And also why
you were pregnant.

491
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,863
And the hickeys.
And the carpet burn.

492
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,705
I had sex in my sleep?

493
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,439
Sexsomnia is a
documented disorder.

494
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,210
You said your ex lives
downstairs. I'll kill him.

495
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,084
Okay. But he probably didn't
know that you were asleep.

496
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,520
Sexsomniacs can
act pretty normal.

497
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,957
I'm gonna write you a prescription
for a low-dose antidepressant.

498
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,018
It'll let you sleep better.

499
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:47,088
If you wanna save yourself the $15 co-pay,
you could have sex while you're awake.

500
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,959
- He's my ex. I don't— -
You live in the same building.

501
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:55,064
You haven't had sex with anyone else for
a year. You sleepwalk right into his arms.

502
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,235
Call me crazy, but I'm
sensing unresolved issues.

503
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,843
Negative for H.T.L.V. 1 and 2.

504
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,579
And negative for A.T.L.V.
and everything else.

505
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,383
It's not hairy cell.

506
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,289
Hey. You really gonna
give that speech?

507
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,760
You got an opinion
too? I'm a little surprised.

508
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,925
Frankly, I thought you were too much
of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.

509
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,334
You're welcome. He's
positive for Epstein-Barr.

510
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,395
So what?

511
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,237
It doesn't point to
hairy cell. It's irrelevant.

512
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,289
Hey.

513
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,825
You didn't fall off the
swings when you were eight.

514
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,953
S-S-Six.

515
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,429
Ever.

516
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,763
Give that back.
Uh-uh. We have to talk.

517
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,826
You had an epileptic seizure.

518
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,065
That's how you bit your tongue.

519
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,370
I-I haven't had
a seizure since...

520
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,809
What medication did you take?

521
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,973
No s-s-seizure since I was six.

522
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,645
No dr-dr-drugs s-since I was 10.

523
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,814
Yeah, that's it. Don't worry
about what the question is.

524
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,122
Don't worry that you're starting to
feel dizzy. Just stay on message.

525
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,124
My...

526
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,500
My mother used to call it...

527
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,506
"funny-something."

528
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,065
- Phenytoin?
- Yes!

529
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,203
Okay, okay. You're okay.

530
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,942
It's okay.

531
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,246
Everybody lies.

532
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:57,925
<i>Senator Gary H. Wright of New
Jersey had childhood epilepsy.</i>

533
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,931
He took phenytoin.

534
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,990
That drug, with the
Epstein-Barr virus,

535
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,094
is associated with common
variable immunodeficiency disease.

536
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,369
"T" cells down, "B" cells down. Keeps
you from forming enough antibodies.

537
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,206
See, the antibodies are
basically your defensive line.

538
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:16,078
<i>And your brain is
like the quarterback.</i>

539
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,517
<i>And then the fungi are like blitzing
linebackers plunging up the middle.</i>

540
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,520
Your lungs are like...

541
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,215
Okay, you got two
quarterbacks. <i>C. V. I. D.?</i>

542
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,261
That's a type of immunoglobulin
deficiency. I said that.

543
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,230
<i>Yeah. Well, it was a
stupid idea when you said it.</i>

544
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,243
Then he got the respiratory problem,
and he tested positive for Epstein-Barr.

545
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,099
That's pretty much
a childhood disease.

546
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,024
That's another reason
why Chase's suggestion

547
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:41,799
was idiotic. He got
it when he was a kid.

548
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,365
<i>He didn't get any symptoms
until now. It happens.</i>

549
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,311
It gets triggered by
stress— Like public speaking.

550
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,879
<i>So you're basing your
diagnosis on a virus that's</i>

551
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:53,478
<i>relatively common and a
drug he took 30 years ago.</i>

552
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,749
Start the senator on
I.V. immunoglobulin, stat.

553
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,552
<i>If he gets better, I'm
right. If he dies, you're right.</i>

554
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,264
Dr. House?

555
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,830
You faked that. No.

556
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,169
Say “antiretroviral."
Antiretroviral.

557
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,144
Now, say it three times fast.

558
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,875
We just got your latest blood
results. Your white cells are up.

559
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,850
Your "T" cells are back over a
hundred. That's-That's good, right?

560
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,716
In a week? That's terrific.

561
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:06,451
You'll need medication for the rest of your
life, but other than that, you're fine.

562
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,493
Am I well enough
to run for president?

563
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,359
- Why not run for pope
while you're at it?
<i>- Oh, come on.</i>

564
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,458
Kennedy had Addison's.
F.D.R. had polio. Two of

565
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,491
the best presidents in
the last hundred years.

566
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,366
If they were running today,
they wouldn't stand a chance.

567
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,531
You figure you'd be surgeon
general if you didn't have the limp?

568
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,868
No. There's things I can't do.

569
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:28,880
And like you said, I...
have to live with reality.

570
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,212
Well, then I'm running.

571
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,148
Good for you.

572
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,916
Now, don't get excited.
He's right. I, uh—I won't win.

573
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,549
Then why run?

574
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:47,896
Oh, I see. Your point being, the only way
to make a difference is to win every fight.

575
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,264
But, hey, why listen to me?

576
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,936
I own the company. I'm
certainly not to be trusted, right?

577
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,674
Dr. Greg House, on the
other hand, has a reputation...

578
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,845
<i>for integrity,
among other things.</i>

579
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,122
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Greg House.

580
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,610
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals' extraordinary
commitment to research excellence...

581
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,171
is exemplified by
their new ACE inhibitor,

582
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,242
a breakthrough medical approach that
will protect millions from heart disease.

583
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,465
That's not a speech.

584
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,899
I thought it was pithy.

585
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:01,463
You got enough for a press release
anyhow. Foreman or Cameron.

586
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,448
A few things I
forgot to mention.

587
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,752
Ed Vogler is a
brilliant businessman,

588
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,224
a brilliant judge of people...

589
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,195
and a man who
has never lost a fight.

590
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,791
You know how I know that
the new ACE inhibitor is good?

591
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,500
'Cause the old one was good. The new one
is really the same, just more expensive.

592
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,304
<i>A lot more expensive.</i>

593
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,642
You see, that's another
example of Ed's brilliance.

594
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,376
<i>Whenever one of his drugs
is about to lose its patent,</i>

595
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:49,114
<i>he has his boys and girls alter it
just a tiny bit, patent it all over again,</i>

596
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:52,180
making not just a
pointless new pill,

597
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,624
but millions and
millions of dollars.

598
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,287
<i>Which is good for
everybody, right?</i>

599
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,797
- Except the patients.
- But— who cares?

600
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,856
They're just so damn sick.

601
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,300
God obviously never
liked them anyway.

602
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:10,136
<i>All the healthy people in the room, let's
have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler.</i>

603
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,151
I threw in a joke.

604
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,751
<i>♪♪</i>

605
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,443
I'm sorry.

606
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:24,713
I should've taken an extra couple
of Vicodin and just held my nose.

607
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,878
- I'm guessing you did take
a couple extra Vicodin.
- True.

608
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:36,790
You don't need to worry
about firing anyone. I'm leaving.

609
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,455
Why?

610
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,835
Is this another noble,
self-sacrificing gesture?

611
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,341
Are you trying to
protect Foreman? No.

612
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,278
So this is just,
"Don't fire me. I quit"?

613
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,906
I'm protecting myself.

614
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,181
You asked me why I like you.

615
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,522
You're abrasive and rude.

616
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:14,098
But I figured, everything you
do, you do it to help people.

617
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,259
But I was wrong.

618
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,163
You do it because it's right.

619
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,360
There are only two ways
that I can deal with things.

620
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,699
One is in my control.

621
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,531
That's to leave.

622
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,344
Good-bye, House.

623
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,670
That's some bad hat, Harry.
