1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,973
<i>On your right. On
your right. On your right.</i>

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,133
<i>Back, back, back, back,
back. Come on, buddy.</i>

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,078
Yeah, Dan! Yeah!

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,877
<i>Yea! Yea!</i>

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,283
<i>Back, back, back, back,
back. Watch the winger!</i>

6
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,427
<i>Yeah!</i>

7
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,849
You okay?

8
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,986
Dan? Dan, talk to me.

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,758
Dan. Dan.

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,664
Get a doctor!

11
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,538
- Hey.
- Close the door.

12
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,169
Close the door.

13
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,009
Is Cuddy down the
hall counting to 50?

14
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,918
She knows I'm in here, in
the clinic, as she commanded.

15
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,219
- She just doesn't know I'm alone.
- Well, you've got a full waiting room.

16
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,204
How long do you think
you can ignore them?

17
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:06,228
I'm off at 4:00.

18
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,026
You're doing this to
avoid five minutes of work?

19
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,726
If I go out there, I get assigned
a kid with a runny nose.

20
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,031
That's 30 seconds looking at the nose,
25 minutes talking to a worried mom...

21
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,902
who won't leave until she's
sure it's not meningitis or a tumor.

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,339
Yes. Concerned parents
can be so annoying.

23
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,157
<i>Just tell Cuddy you've
got an urgent case.</i>

24
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,038
You had to leave early.
That would be lying.

25
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:30,016
And that would be wrong. But luckily
the definition of "urgent" is fungible.

26
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,712
Not the definition
of “case" though.

27
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,888
You have no cases?

28
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,019
You have no cases?

29
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,826
<i>You've got handpicked
doctors— specialists—</i>

30
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,800
<i>Working for you, and
they're sitting on their hands?</i>

31
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:51,703
- Cameron's answering my mail.
- Oh, time well spent, I'm sure.

32
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,764
Foreman and Chase?

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,832
Research?

34
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,247
Nine letters. Iodine
deficiency in children.

35
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,480
Cretinism.

36
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,765
So, 4:03 p.m.,
Dr. House checks out.

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,768
Please write that down.

38
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,031
Dr. House. Sorry.
Done for the day.

39
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,006
Plenty of docs here to take care
of you. But we had an appointment.

40
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,408
Nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic,
which means there are no appointments.

41
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,708
<i>You walk in, sign the chart,
and a doctor will see you.</i>

42
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,272
Just not me. Your letter
says that we'd see you.

43
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,718
Not a big letter writer. Here.

44
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,782
<i>When did my
signature get so girlie?</i>

45
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,055
- I can explain.
- See that "G"?

46
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,563
<i>See how it makes
a big loop on top?</i>

47
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,998
Doesn't even look like my
handwriting. Think I have something?

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,469
<i>What's the differential diagnosis for
writing G's like a junior high school girl?</i>

49
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,218
It's impossible to
get to you through

50
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,269
normal channels. They
have called, e-mailed.

51
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,269
Perseverance does not
equal worthiness. Next time

52
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,244
you want to get my
attention, wear something fun.

53
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,281
Low-rider jeans are hot.

54
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,747
Sixteen-year-old male.
Sudden onset of double

55
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,411
vision and night terrors,
with no apparent cause.

56
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,955
<i>The kid's been to two
neurologists, and he—</i> Night terrors?

57
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,820
- As in big scary monsters?
- Yes.

58
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,153
- Where are you going?
- To see the family.

59
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:28,293
- You're going to examine a patient?
- Nine times out of 10,
there's no reason to talk to a patient.

60
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,203
But night terrors in a 16-year-old is a
very good reason to talk to this family.

61
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,207
Good work.

62
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,112
Margins are fine.

63
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,114
No lesions.

64
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,648
Color is good.

65
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,052
How long have you been
having night terrors? Three weeks.

66
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,319
He's afraid to go to bed. He's
exhausted, can barely function.

67
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,886
- What does that tell you?
- Nothing. It's just fun
watching him blink.

68
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,456
Name as many animals as you
can that begin with the letter "B." Go.

69
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:11,303
- Baby elephant?
- Baby elephant is actually
a good answer.

70
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,904
- "B" is a bear of a letter.
- What does that tell you?

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,878
<i>Proves two things: no
neurological damage,</i>

72
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:18,008
<i>and your son is never
gonna be chief fry cook.</i>

73
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,816
In teens, there are two
likely causes of night terrors.

74
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,586
- Posttraumatic stress. Any recent
shoot-outs at your high school?
- No.

75
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,888
- Then, Dave— - Dan.

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,022
If there's no trauma, the
other cause is... sexual abuse.

77
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,170
So who's molesting you? Teacher?

78
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,283
<i>Extra-friendly neighbor? I'd ask if either
of you were involved, but you’d deny it.</i>

79
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,037
We would never hurt Dan.

80
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,509
I say it here, it
comes out there.

81
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,070
This lack of response
is consistent with abuse.

82
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,946
There's no one, okay? I—I swear.

83
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,111
There was trauma. I got hit in
the head during a lacrosse game.

84
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,323
Did you know that
he got hit in the head?

85
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,919
- They didn't mention it. No.
- Yeah. Why bother?

86
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,357
No, no. We took him to
the E.R. after the game.

87
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,960
He was scanned. They tested
him. They said he was fine.

88
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,971
No concussion. It's
gotta be something else.

89
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,531
You hound me for my opinion,
and then you question my diagnosis.

90
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:19,011
Cool. E.R. obviously screwed
up. Kid's got a concussion.

91
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,208
I had double vision before I was
hit. Well, that changes everything.

92
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,081
You need glasses. That's
why you had double vision,

93
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,501
<i>which is why you got hit,
which is why you have a</i>

94
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,851
<i>concussion, which is
why you have night terrors.</i>

95
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,950
You need to see an
ophthalmologist, which I am not.

96
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,499
You enjoyed that. I brought
a reasonable case to your

97
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:38,397
attention, and you shoved it
in my face just to humiliate me.

98
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,333
You're an only child, aren't
you? Why would you say that?

99
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,131
Because everything is about you.

100
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:48,572
This may seem incredibly controversial,
but I think sexual abuse is bad.

101
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,635
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't
being diddled by Daddy—or Mommy.

102
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,737
Anything else is just a bonus.

103
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,992
I'm not an only
child. Interesting.

104
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,326
What? Don't move.

105
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,034
- Did I bore you in there?
- What? Uh, no. Not— Not really.

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,468
Are you tired?

107
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,617
- Sometimes.
- He never sleeps. Of course he's tired.

108
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,142
- Right now. At this moment. Are you tired?
- No. No.

109
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,439
That twitch in your
leg. Did you feel that?

110
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,043
- Didn't hurt.
- His leg twitched. I don't see what...

111
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,881
It's called a myoclonic jerk. It's very
common when you're falling asleep.

112
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,614
Respiration rate falls, and
the brain sometimes interprets

113
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:37,323
this as the body dying, so it
sends a pulse to wake it up.

114
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,586
- So?
- So, he's not asleep.

115
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,390
He's awake.

116
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,454
Admit him.

117
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,869
<i>I recognize that loopy "G."</i>

118
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,929
<i>So, what does the jerk tell us?</i>

119
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,305
Nothing good. The brain's
losing control of the body.

120
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,142
Can't order the eyes to focus, regulate
sleep patterns or control muscles.

121
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,252
A movement disorder or a
degenerative brain disease.

122
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,842
Either way, this kid's gonna be picking
up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.

123
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,887
<i>Maybe not that bad.
Could be an infection.</i>

124
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,979
You wish. No fever,
no white count.

125
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,454
Anyone think this
differential diagnosis might be

126
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:14,494
compromised because we don't
have an accurate family history?

127
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,827
- I took an accurate family history.
- You didn't even take an accurate family.

128
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,996
- His father's not his father.
- Why would you say that?

129
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,128
Thirty percent of all dads don't realize
they're raising someone else's kid.

130
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,333
False paternity's more like 10%. That's
what our moms would like us to believe.

131
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,899
Who cares? If he got it from
his parents, they'd both be dead.

132
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,888
<i>- Can we get on with</i>
<i>the differential diagnosis?</i>
- Fifty bucks says I'm right.

133
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,472
- I'll take your money.
- Hit a nerve?

134
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,007
- Don't worry. I'm sure the guy who
tucked you in was your daddy.
- Make it a hundred.

135
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,886
<i>What about leukoencephalopathy
in a 1 6-year-old?</i>

136
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,255
<i>It doesn't necessarily
have to be that bad.</i>

137
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,352
If we exclude the night terrors,
it could be something systemic.

138
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,659
His liver, kidneys.
Something outside the brain.

139
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:50,954
Yes.

140
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,763
- Feel free to exclude any symptom
if it makes your job easier.
- Night terrors were anecdotal.

141
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:59,568
- He could've had a bad dream.
- No. Parents said he was conscious during
and didn't remember anything afterwards.

142
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,574
- That's a night terror.
- Parents said?

143
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,735
<i>That's a good point.</i>

144
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,076
<i>Before we condemn this kid, maybe we
should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism.</i>

145
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:12,211
I want a detailed polysomnograph. If he's
having night terrors, I want to see them.

146
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,937
I usually don't move
during night terrors.

147
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,945
<i>I'm not restraining
you for them.</i>

148
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,047
E.E.G. revealed
abnormalities in your brain...

149
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,485
Caused nerve
damage in your toes.

150
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,289
What are you doing?

151
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,458
- Fixing it.
- Can I talk to my parents?

152
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,593
Oh, they know all about this.

153
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,195
I'd really like to see them.

154
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,115
Please. I'd really
like them here.

155
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,877
This is gonna hurt, Dan.

156
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,946
Oh. Oh, God.

157
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,298
That's a night terror.

158
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:56,617
<i>We did a C. T., M.R.I., C. B.
C., CHEM-7 and chest X-ray.</i>

159
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,750
<i>All the tests came back normal.
There's nothing to explain his symptoms.</i>

160
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay, but let's pretend
there's something and go

161
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:03,661
from there. Who sees
something on this M.R.I.?

162
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,631
No lesions in the white matter.
No structural abnormalities.

163
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,670
No space-occupying tumors.

164
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,983
He's 16, so he should
have an absolutely

165
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,675
pristine brain. The
smallest thing is abnormal.

166
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,343
Meningeal enhancement.

167
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,972
- My bet is viral meningitis.
- Excellent.

168
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,983
<i>Do you see what he did there?</i>

169
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,997
<i>Took a small clue that
there's a neurological</i>

170
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,817
<i>problem and wasn't
afraid to run with it.</i>

171
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,356
There's no evidence of
meningitis on that M.R.I.

172
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,324
No, there's not. He's
completely wrong.

173
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,418
Then what clue are
you talking about?

174
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,732
<i>He knew that I saw
something on the M.R.I., so he</i>

175
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:39,296
<i>figured there must be
something there and took a guess.</i>

176
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,858
- Clever, but also pathetic.
- So what did you find?

177
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,929
Take a close look at
the corpus callosum.

178
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:52,012
- Looks okay.
- Are we all looking at the same thing?

179
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,547
<i>Two hundred million
interhemispheric nerve fibers.</i>

180
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:57,675
The George Washington Bridge between
the left and right side of the brain.

181
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,048
It's subtle.

182
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,456
There's some bowing. There.

183
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,518
<i>An upward arch.</i>
Are you guessing?

184
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,496
Yes.

185
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,330
- Too bad. You're right.
- He probably just moved.

186
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,995
Nobody stays perfectly
still for the entire M.R.I.

187
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,074
Yeah. Probably got restless
and shifted one hemisphere

188
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:22,566
of his brain to a more
comfortable position.

189
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,908
Something is pushing on it. If
there was bowing, could be a tumor.

190
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,438
Do you see a tumor on this M.R.I.?
No, but I don't see any bowing either.

191
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,043
There's no tumor. Just a blockage
causing pressure causing symptoms.

192
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,556
Today, night terrors. Tomorrow,
he's bleeding out of his eyes.

193
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:41,391
<i>Get him a radionucleotide cisternogram.
I guarantee you'll see a blockage.</i>

194
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,292
Okay.

195
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,868
<i>Easy.</i>

196
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,205
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

197
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,107
<i>All right. Squeeze hard.</i>

198
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,619
All right.

199
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,091
Now I'm injecting a material
that's tagged with a radioisotope.

200
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,997
<i>It's gonna enter your spine
and travel up to your brain.</i>

201
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,969
It'll make you able to
think deep thoughts,

202
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,972
run a hundred miles an hour.

203
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,505
Easy.

204
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,416
<i>Their eyes aren't the same
color, but that fleck in the eyes—</i>

205
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,518
That's maybe a one-in-10
chance if they're not related?

206
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,995
No. House isn't gonna
pay you based on that.

207
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,933
Any excuse we can give the
folks to justify a D.N.A. test?

208
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,134
We could tell them he's
got Huntington's— whole

209
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:59,132
family should be
tested or they'll all die.

210
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,610
Hey.

211
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,546
There's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.

212
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,271
We're gonna put a
shunt into one of the

213
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:12,449
ventricles to give the
cerebrospinal fluid an out.

214
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,147
No more pressure,
everything goes back to normal.

215
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,157
He's lucky to have
you as his doctors.

216
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,859
No formula. Just Mommy's
healthy, natural breast milk.

217
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,632
Yummy.

218
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,799
Her whole face just got
swollen like this overnight.

219
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,105
Mm-hmm.

220
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,444
No fever.

221
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,347
Glands normal. Missing
her vaccination dates.

222
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,079
We're not vaccinating.

223
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,645
Gribbet! Gribbet!

224
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,247
Gribbet!

225
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,020
Think they don't work?

226
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,392
I think some multinational pharmaceutical
company wants me to think they work...

227
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,694
<i>Pad their bottom line.</i> Mm-hmm.

228
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,065
- May I?
- Sure.

229
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,732
Gribbet. Gribbet.

230
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,104
Gribbet.

231
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,076
Yeah. All-natural, no
dyes is a good business.

232
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,272
All-natural children's toys.

233
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,838
Toy companies—they don't
arbitrarily mark up their frogs.

234
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,942
<i>They don't lie about how much they
spend on research and development.</i>

235
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:24,616
The worst that a toy company could be
accused of is making a really boring frog.

236
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,524
Gribbet, gibbet, gibbet.

237
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,427
You know another
really good business?

238
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,727
Teeny, tiny baby coffins.

239
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,298
<i>You can get 'em in frog green,</i>

240
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,804
fire-engine red—really.

241
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,104
<i>The antibodies in yummy Mummy
only protect the kid for six months,</i>

242
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,771
which is why these companies
think they can gouge you.

243
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,577
<i>They think that you’ll spend whatever
they ask to keep your kid alive.</i>

244
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,675
Want to change
things? Prove 'em wrong.

245
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,983
Few hundred parents like
you decide they'd rather let

246
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,348
their kid die than cough up
40 bucks for a vaccination,

247
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,914
believe me, prices
will drop really fast.

248
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,927
Gribbet, gribbet,
gribbet, gribbet, gribbet.

249
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,394
<i>Gribbet.</i>

250
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,295
Tell me what she has.

251
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,960
A cold.

252
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,131
There's a problem.

253
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,335
Complications in surgery?
Surgery went fine. He's in recovery.

254
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,742
But we took a vial of
C.S.F. and tested it. Really?

255
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,781
Turns out the bowing wasn't the
cause of his problems. It was a symptom.

256
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,942
Oligoclonal bands and
increased intrathecal lgG.

257
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,926
Which means multiple
sclerosis. And the

258
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,181
reason it takes three
of you to tell me this?

259
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,985
<i>Because we're having a disagreement
about whether or not it is M.S.</i>

260
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,619
No lesions on the M.R.I. It's early. He's
had the disease for maybe two weeks.

261
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,474
- McDonald criteria requires six months
to make a definitive diagnosis.
- Who cares about MacPhearson?

262
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,433
- I hear he tortured kittens.
- McDonald.

263
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,992
Oh, McDonald. Wonderful
doctor, loved kittens.

264
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,038
The V.E.P. indicates
slowing of the brain.

265
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,073
<i>Without the lesions,
we can't be sure.</i>

266
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,574
Well, if it is, it's gone from
zero to 60 in three weeks,

267
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,611
which would indicate
rapidly progressive M.S.

268
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,011
Not the fun M.S. with the balloons and
the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs.

269
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,210
- We should wait until—
- Start treating him now,

270
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:02,551
maybe he can walk for another couple
of years, maybe live for another five.

271
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,148
Break it to the family.
I'm going home.

272
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,286
<i>It'll take months for a definitive
diagnosis.</i> What'll happen to me?

273
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,228
M.S. is an incredibly
variable disease.

274
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,701
If it is M.S., and we're not
a hundred percent sure.

275
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,238
What do you think
is gonna happen?

276
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,874
There are some medications
to manage the symptoms,

277
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,073
but as the disease progresses, the
problems will become more severe.

278
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,480
<i>Bowel and bladder dysfunction,</i>

279
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,145
<i>loss of cognitive
function, pain—</i>

280
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,711
So it's gonna hurt?

281
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,358
The brain's like a
big jumble of wires.

282
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,985
M.S. strips them of the
insulation, and the nerves die.

283
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,690
<i>Brain interprets it as pain.</i>

284
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:48,030
<i>But by starting treatment, we're gonna
prevent that for as long as possible.</i>

285
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,970
We're looking into a
couple of specialists,

286
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,565
and until we get you squared
away, you'll stay here, okay?

287
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,753
Security checked the videotapes
from all perimeter cameras.

288
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,061
He's still gotta be in the
hospital. Where's Chase?

289
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,692
Main floor. Okay. You take
the cafeteria and administration.

290
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,363
I'll hit the research annex
and work my way back to you.

291
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,700
Dan?

292
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,816
<i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

293
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,956
Dr. Cuddy. Great outfit.

294
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,292
What are you doing
back here? Patient?

295
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,855
No. Hooker. Went to my
office instead of my home.

296
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,678
<i>Dr. House.</i>

297
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,544
Dan's missing. Yeah. I got
that part from the message.

298
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,847
You said I was needed immediately. He
shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.

299
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,615
I agree. He's gonna have
a very nasty headache.

300
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,817
That would also be my opinion
if consulted tomorrow morning.

301
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:55,055
We wanted to keep you informed.
He heard some pretty heavy news.

302
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,593
This is not a toddler wandering
around a department store.

303
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,863
He's 16. You'll find him.

304
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm going home.

305
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,907
So when you say, "Call me if you
need anything," you mean don't call?

306
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,204
No, I mean call me if
I could do something.

307
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,199
I'm bad at search
parties, and I'm bad at

308
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,407
sitting around looking
nervous, doing nothing.

309
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,506
What about his parents?
Should we call them?

310
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,983
Why? Do you think
they're hiding him?

311
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,020
Make sure someone
checks the roof.

312
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,889
Some of the orderlies keep the door
propped open so they can grab a smoke.

313
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,294
<i>Dan. You okay?</i>

314
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,767
There are experimental
treatments. Ongoing research.

315
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,240
<i>Who knows what they'll
discover in a year or two.</i>

316
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,277
This is where I
dropped the ball.

317
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,870
Dan, we're standing on
the roof of the hospital.

318
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,541
Dan.

319
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,644
Dan, you're not on the field.

320
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,882
He doesn't know
where he is. Dan.

321
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,321
Foreman.

322
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,289
Dan.

323
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,463
- Dan?
- Dan, no!

324
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,632
Dr. Foreman.

325
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,270
I assume you found the kid.

326
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,941
<i>He almost walked
off the roof.</i> Suicidal?

327
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,905
No, he thought he was
on his lacrosse field.

328
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,885
Look, I was gonna run
home, shower, change...

329
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,888
Conscious? Yeah.

330
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,551
How'd you talk him down?
Actually, Chase tackled him.

331
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,560
How come you didn't do it?

332
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,062
Right. Well, I am
black, but he was closer.

333
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,624
Come on. You
can ride up with me.

334
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,214
Anybody tell the family
that their boy almost

335
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:26,040
stepped off a roof?
They must be thrilled.

336
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,356
They're not suing, but I think
only because Chase asked...

337
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,906
Why does everybody always
think I'm being sarcastic?

338
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,179
This is great news.
He doesn't have M.S.

339
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,077
Parents should be
thrilled. The mom anyway.

340
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,950
Of course, the dad
probably doesn't know...

341
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:41,323
- Why doesn't he have M.S.?
- He was on the roof, thinking
he was on a lacrosse field.

342
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,262
- Conscious, and therefore not
a night terror. You want some of this?
- Yeah, sure.

343
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,425
He was in an acute
confusional state,

344
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,298
which doesn't fit with a
demyelinating disease like M.S.

345
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,429
Oligoclonal bands— Were real.

346
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:56,032
They just mean something other
than M.S. So, what are they telling us?

347
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,100
That the immune
system is working? Right.

348
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,305
He has an
infection in his brain.

349
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,371
What about sex?

350
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,680
Well, it might get complicated.
I mean, we work together.

351
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,485
I'm older, certainly,
but maybe you like that.

352
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:08,864
I meant maybe he
has neurosyphilis.

353
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,655
- Huh. Nice cover.
- Sorry. R.P.R. was negative.

354
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,362
<i>We don't need
a definitive test to</i>

355
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:16,205
confirm. Sure. Didn't
need one to confirm M.S.

356
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,534
Okay. Let's wait for
you to run titers on 1,400

357
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:20,757
viruses while this kid's
brain turns to mush.

358
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,429
So the fact that he doesn't have M.S.,
it's—it's really not good news after all.

359
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,631
<i>Well, it is if it’s
neurosyphilis.</i>

360
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,766
The likelihood of a false
negative on an R.P.R. test: 30%.

361
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:33,335
Likelihood of a 16-year-old
having sex: roughly 120%.

362
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,891
I'll start him on I.V. penicillin.
<i>We're not gonna wait for that.</i>

363
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,443
The most effective way to deliver the
drug is right into his brain via the spine.

364
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,453
We can't. In a cramped
space like the brain,

365
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,384
increased intracranial
pressure from a high-volume

366
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,333
drug like penicillin could
herniate his brain stem.

367
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,384
It'd kill him. No neurologist in his
right mind would recommend that.

368
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,294
Show of hands. Who thinks
I'm not in my right mind?

369
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:55,232
And who thinks I forget this
fairly basic neurological fact?

370
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,532
Who thinks there's
a third option?

371
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,542
- Very good. What's the third choice?
- No idea. You just asked
if I thought there was one.

372
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,441
The patient has a shunt in his brain.
There'll be no increased pressure.

373
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,042
<i>We can put as much penicillin
into his body as we want.</i>

374
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,054
Excellent. Inject him
through a lumbar puncture.

375
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,087
One of us is gonna do this to you
twice a day for the next two weeks.

376
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,662
- I'm ready. Go.
- He could get syphilis...

377
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,328
even if he's not
sexually active?

378
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,805
Well, it's—it's unusual,
but it's possible.

379
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,800
Okay. Relax.

380
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,753
It's infected, with
a really big hole,

381
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,193
like you stuck a nail in
it to relieve the pressure.

382
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,254
I wouldn't do that. <i>Although
the wound is irregular.</i>

383
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,597
It's not cylindrical. It's shaped
like a triangle. So, not a nail.

384
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,728
- Steak knife?
- Wife's nail file.

385
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,295
Nail file.

386
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,433
Yeah. Pain will make
you do stupid things.

387
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,536
- Something to take the edge off?
- Yeah.

388
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,673
Cheers.

389
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,514
<i>So, you have family
here in Princeton?</i>

390
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,321
No. Here on work?

391
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,589
- No. Why are you— -
Does your penis hurt?

392
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,823
No. What? Should it?

393
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,425
No. Just thought I'd toss you
a really inappropriate question.

394
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,952
Your lawyer's gonna love it.

395
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:39,632
Why would I want to sue
you? I want you to treat me.

396
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,174
- You're from Maplewood,
New Jersey, right?
- Yeah.

397
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,506
<i>Now, why would
you drive 70 miles...</i>

398
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,512
to get treatment for a condition
that a nine-year-old could diagnose?

399
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,984
It's the free-flowing
pus that's the tip-off.

400
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,953
I was in town. <i>Not for
family. Not for work.</i>

401
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,354
You drove 70 miles to a walk-in clinic.
You passed two hospitals on the road.

402
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,917
Either you've got a problem with those
hospitals, or they have a problem with you.

403
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,520
<i>My guess is you've sued
half the doctors in Maplewood,</i>

404
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,656
<i>and the rest are now
refusing to help you.</i>

405
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,464
It's ironic, isn't it? Sort of
like the boy who sued wolf.

406
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,768
<i>You know, I bet we have
a doctor here named Wolf.</i>

407
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,274
How perfect would that be?

408
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,640
- I'm gonna page him.
- Okay. You know what? Thank you.

409
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,975
I'm gonna find a doctor
to take care of this.

410
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,981
I didn't say I
wouldn't treat you.

411
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,382
- We'll drain your knee,
run some lab work. Fix you up.
- Why would you do that?

412
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,387
I'm a people person.

413
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,980
<i>You actually treated him?</i>

414
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,025
All I know is he
sued some doctors.

415
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,425
Who am I to assume they
didn't have it coming to them?

416
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:38,828
The cutest little tennis outfit. My God, I
thought I was gonna have a heart attack.

417
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,129
Oh, my. Didn't see you there. That is so
embarrassing. How's your hooker doing?

418
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,136
Sweet of you to
ask. Funny story.

419
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,080
She was gonna be
hospital administrator, but

420
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,004
just hated having to
screw people like that.

421
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,872
- Heard you found her on the roof.
- You have very acute hearing.

422
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,639
You notify the parents?

423
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,646
In due course, of course.

424
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:58,206
And is there a paternity bet
on the father of the patient?

425
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,583
Doesn't sound like me. Well, it does,
actually, but doesn't mean you're guilty.

426
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,645
You think? <i>I saw the
parents in the lobby.</i>

427
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:08,751
- Smart money's obviously on the father.
- My guy knows a guy who can
get you in for 50 bucks.

428
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,730
Fine. Tell your guy, if I win, you attend
the faculty symposium, and you wear a tie.

429
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,267
And if I win, no clinic
hours for a week.

430
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,667
My guy will call your guy.

431
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,368
She's very good at her job.

432
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,112
The treatments should
start helping soon.

433
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,549
Let us know if it gets easier to
focus on things, remember stuff.

434
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:38,012
Hey, Dan. Isn't Dr. Cameron's
necklace a beauty?

435
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,150
Something South
American, I think.

436
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,194
Yeah. Guatemalan.

437
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,288
It's a cool necklace.

438
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,695
- Thank you so much.
- The kid's in pain.

439
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,863
<i>Don't fight it. Just
let it happen.</i> No.

440
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,965
<i>You'll be dead in
two days. No what?</i>

441
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,306
<i>I give it a day.</i> Dan? You okay?

442
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,538
Dan?

443
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,080
<i>- Night terrors.
- Decomposition once he's in the grave.</i>

444
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,049
<i>- Say good-bye to your mother and father.
</i>- He's hearing voices.

445
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,586
<i>You're dying.
It's all over, Dan.</i>

446
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,052
<i>You're dying. Dying. Dead!</i>

447
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,119
Push two milligrams
I.V. Ativan, stat.

448
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,824
<i>- It's all over.</i>
- Come on, Dan.

449
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,729
Get out of my head!

450
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,527
Auditory hallucination shows
further brain degeneration.

451
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:29,632
Penicillin's not working. So
either it's a bad batch of penicillin,

452
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,700
or our diagnosis is wrong.

453
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,537
Square one.

454
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:39,551
Midnite. <i>L.F.T.'s, B.U.N.
and creatinine are all normal.</i>

455
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:42,087
- Diabetes is out, and no gap.
- There goes metabolic.

456
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,817
- M.R.A. rules out vasculitis.
- "I" for inflammation.

457
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,519
- Too young for anything
degenerative.
- "D," see ya.

458
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,858
"N" for neoplastic.
M.R.I. was clean.

459
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,558
- "I" for inflammation.
- We already did that.

460
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,351
Stupid to have two I's in one
mnemonic. What's the other one?

461
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:56,898
Infection.

462
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:01,115
- Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something.
- But no fevers. White count's elevated,
but within range.

463
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,779
<i>We've tested for anything remotely
possible. Everything's negative.</i>

464
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,540
- C.T. scan rules out subdural.
- Trauma. Later much.

465
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:16,949
<i>You know the problem? "Midnight" is
actually spelled with a "G" and an "H."</i>

466
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,824
If we could just figure out
what those letters stand for.

467
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,525
It's a sick brain, having fun,

468
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,264
torturing him, talking to him.

469
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,801
Scaring the hell out of him.

470
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,049
Get him an E.E.G., left and right
E.O.G., esophageal microphones.

471
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,988
If this thing wants
to talk, let's listen.

472
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,628
<i>We're missing something.
This is screwed-up.</i>

473
00:29:56,695 --> 00:30:00,223
That's why you came up with
the brain talking to the virus thing?

474
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,097
I panicked, okay?

475
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,968
<i>Sounded cool
though. They bought it.</i>

476
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,271
Oh, crap.

477
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,562
Another reason I don't
like meeting patients. If they

478
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,872
don't know what you look
like, they can't yell at you.

479
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,939
Here we go.

480
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,588
How can you just sit there?

481
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,992
If I eat standing up, I spill.

482
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,120
Our son is dying, and
you could care less.

483
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,323
<i>We're going through
hell. You're doing nothing?</i>

484
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,734
I'm sorry. You need
to vent. I understand.

485
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:39,135
Don't be condescending.

486
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,606
<i>You haven't checked
in on him once.</i>

487
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,337
Blood pressure is 110 over 70.

488
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,209
His shunt is patent, well-placed
in the right lateral ventricle.

489
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,385
The E.K.G. shows a normal
Q.R.S. with deep-wave

490
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:52,809
inversions throughout both
limb and precordial leads.

491
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,786
<i>L. F. T. 's are elevated, but
only twice the normal range.</i>

492
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,323
Oh, yeah. And
he's hearing voices.

493
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,553
Go hold his hand.

494
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,060
Go on. I'll bus your tray.

495
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,916
- Got any sample bags on you?
- I don't believe you.

496
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,648
<i>You're gonna run D. N.A.
tests?</i> Their son is deathly ill.

497
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,717
I know. It's terrible.
But the fact is, if I

498
00:31:31,741 --> 00:31:33,852
don't keep busy with
trivial things like this,

499
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,053
<i>I'm afraid I might start
to cry.</i> You're an ass.

500
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:39,030
Yeah? You want
to double the bet?

501
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,404
General Hospital
<i>is on channel 6.</i>

502
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:56,039
Dan's brain's not showing
channel 6 right now. Only mush.

503
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,310
No epileptiform activity.

504
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,750
What are you doing? Waiting
for C.B.C. and CHEM-7.

505
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,723
Good. Run D.N.A. on these.

506
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,160
What's this?
Parents' coffee cups.

507
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,264
I can't believe you. I've had
this conversation once already.

508
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,927
If you've got something else
to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.

509
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:28,238
Dr. House. Hey. Mr. Funsten.

510
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,374
I was wondering when you'd be
back. You got some papers for me?

511
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,887
You've caused me considerable
mental distress. I certainly hope so.

512
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,905
What? Too cheap to
get your lawyer to serve

513
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,983
it for you, or is it just
more fun this way?

514
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,254
I'm obviously prepared
to consider a settlement.

515
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,421
You have gonorrhea.

516
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:50,066
No, I don't. Well, maybe you're right,
but I have the lab result says you do.

517
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,730
Could be a false positive, and
normally I'd run a second test,

518
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,206
but since you're here, I'll just go with
the first. You're just trying to scare me.

519
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,608
It's reportable, you know. Public health
issue. I'll be sure to let my wife know.

520
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,307
Don't bother yourself.
The state will call for you.

521
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,940
<i>If you’re clean, I'm sure
it'll all blow over. No big deal.</i>

522
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,350
There's an easy way to find out.
Get one of your doctors to run a test.

523
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,257
Uh-uh.

524
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,089
These are mine now.
I'll see you in court.

525
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,404
West Nile negative. Not
surprising since not too

526
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:23,444
many mosquitoes passing
through Jersey in December.

527
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,013
No eastern equine encephalitis.
You guys aren't gonna believe this.

528
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,974
What's that? House is right.
The father's not the father.

529
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,944
Dude doubled up on me.

530
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,072
You're not gonna believe this.

531
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,639
The mother's not
the mother either.

532
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,945
<i>It's not a good idea to move
your son in his condition.</i>

533
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,616
- We just want a second opinion.
<i>- We need an answer.</i>

534
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,883
You idiots. You lied to me.

535
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,896
We didn't lie about anything.

536
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,161
- You, on the other hand,
accused us of molesting our son.
- Perfect.

537
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,998
Can we get off my
screw-ups and focus on theirs?

538
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,163
Theirs is bigger. You're
not Dan's parents.

539
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,072
We're his parents. He was
adopted. He doesn't need to know.

540
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,133
- I do.
- Adoption makes us just as much...

541
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,545
Listen. When we were taking his
medical history, were you confused?

542
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,413
<i>Did you think we were looking
for a genetic clue to his condition,</i>

543
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,424
or did you think we
were trying to ascertain

544
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:16,546
who loves him the most
in the whole wide world?

545
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,783
How did you find out about this?

546
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,259
- I sampled their D.N.A.
- We didn't give you any D.N.A.

547
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,762
Your coffee cups
from the cafeteria.

548
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,766
- You can't do that.
- Again, why are we getting
hung up on what I did?

549
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:34,670
- Your medical history is useless.
- No. We gave you a detailed history
of his biological mother.

550
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,903
Her history.
Nonsmoker, good health,

551
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,502
<i>low cholesterol, no
blood pressure problems.</i>

552
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,707
Dan was adopted two
weeks after he was born.

553
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:47,116
<i>- You have his history. There's nothing</i>
<i>you need to know that we didn't tell you.</i>
- Sounds reasonable.

554
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,246
Well, if you want to transfer
your boy, that is your choice.

555
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,019
<i>I still think it's the wrong—</i>
Was she vaccinated?

556
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,096
<i>The biological mother. When she was
a baby, did she get her vaccinations?</i>

557
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:01,156
Dan was vaccinated.
At six months.

558
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,930
Mm-hmm. Do you know why
kids get vaccinated at six months?

559
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,632
<i>Because before that
they are protected...</i>

560
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,301
by their biological
mother's immune system.

561
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,140
So, was she vaccinated?

562
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,680
<i>An infant picks up a
regular old measles virus.</i>

563
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,686
<i>Gets a rash.</i>

564
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:25,383
<i>He's extremely uncomfortable,
has a wicked fever, but he lives.</i>

565
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,326
<i>Here's the kicker. Once
every million or so times,</i>

566
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,693
<i>the virus mutates.</i>

567
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,289
<i>Instead of Dan having
a fever and a rash,</i>

568
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,029
the virus travels to
his brain and hides,

569
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,037
like a time bomb.

570
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,471
In this case, for 16 years.

571
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,099
Sub-acute sclerosing
panencephalitis.

572
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,969
I know. There's only been 20 cases in
the United States in the last 30 years.

573
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:52,381
I suppose you could make an
argument the kid's still in stage I.

574
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,578
Once S.S.P.E.
moves to stage II, it's...

575
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,782
<i>Boom. Stage II
is universally fatal.</i>

576
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,826
I assume it’s impossible to know
when he might move into stage II.

577
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,091
<i>He's already started showing symptoms.
Could be a month. Could be tonight.</i>

578
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,394
Can we treat it?
Ask the neurologist.

579
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,559
Intraventricular interferon.

580
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,587
<i>Not gonna shove a spike
into his brain and drip</i>

581
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,503
<i>interferon without
confirming this diagnosis.</i>

582
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,338
- Tap him.
- We won't get a reliable result
for measles antibodies in his C.S.F.

583
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,344
Not after everything
we've given him.

584
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,210
<i>So the wrong treatment kills
any hope of the right diagnosis.</i>

585
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,045
Why do people lie to me?

586
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,051
Could also kill him.

587
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,556
Your ball, Foreman. Tell me I
don't have to biopsy his brain.

588
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,218
Well, there is one other way.

589
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,787
You sure this isn't gonna hurt?

590
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,855
Yeah. It's just scary as hell.

591
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,060
See, we go through the pupil.

592
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,365
But you won't feel it.
The eye's been paralyzed.

593
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,770
The needle travels
to the back of the eye,

594
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,707
<i>which is where we'll perform
the biopsy on your retina.</i>

595
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,074
<i>So we've confirmed that the
problem is this mutated virus.</i>

596
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,951
The treatment for S.S.P.E.
is intraventricular interferon.

597
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,752
We implant an ommaya
reservoir under the scalp,

598
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,055
which is connected to
a ventricular catheter...

599
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,686
that delivers the antiviral
directly to the left hemisphere.

600
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:14,597
You want us to consent to this? I don't
even understand what you're talking about.

601
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,726
Well, the antiviral...

602
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,439
Look. I'm sorry.

603
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,667
I can explain this as best
I can, but the notion that

604
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:25,876
you're gonna fully understand
your son's treatment...

605
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:30,075
and make an informed
decision is—is kind of insane.

606
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,081
Here's what you need to know.

607
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,055
It's dangerous.

608
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,353
It could kill him.

609
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,416
You should do it.

610
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,735
<i>Did you need something else?</i>

611
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,487
You can't order a $3,200
D.N.A. test to win a bet.

612
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,723
It's not an actual cost.

613
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,523
I don't know if you
know this, but the

614
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:22,666
hospital actually owns
the sequencing machine.

615
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,329
- I'm serious.
- Tell the parents to submit
the bill to insurance.

616
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,235
Insurance is not
gonna pay for a bet.

617
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,675
Should. We don't make
that bet, the kid dies.

618
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,611
<i>If not for the paternity bet, I never
would have taken their D. N.A.</i>

619
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,056
<i>Without their D. N.A., we
never would have discovered</i>

620
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,481
<i>that Dan was adopted,
which was the key to this case.</i>

621
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,520
You just don't want
to pay your end.

622
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,488
<i>Big mistake. My guy knows a guy.</i>

623
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:48,254
<i>Fine. I will let you out of
clinic duty for one week,</i>

624
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,319
after you pay the
3,200 for the P.C.R. test.

625
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,628
Ooh.

626
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,164
Well, now, there's the
hundred you owe me.

627
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,178
Here's a hundred I
won from Cameron.

628
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,805
200 I took off of Foreman.

629
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,651
And 600...

630
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,210
I got from Wilson.

631
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,981
Very bitter.

632
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,953
Hey. Good morning.

633
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,794
Good news on your
E.E.G. Treatment is working.

634
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,960
And your immune
system is responding.

635
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,436
I know it's early, but I
just want to take a look.

636
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:38,675
All right. Let's see what
that brain of yours can do.

637
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,202
Name as many animals as you
can that start with the letter "O."

638
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,340
Ostrich.

639
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,881
<i>Ox. Old elephant.</i>

640
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,786
Well, that's two
better than last time.

641
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,382
How you doing with the
whole adoption thing?

642
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:57,258
- I knew since fifth grade.
- How's that?

643
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,264
<i>Cleft chin.</i>

644
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,926
I have one. My dad doesn't.

645
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:07,632
Looked it up on the Internet.
It's one of those trait things.

646
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,197
That's right. It's
autosomal dominant.

647
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,358
Since neither of your
parents have cleft chins,

648
00:40:13,382 --> 00:40:15,647
it's highly unlikely
you're biologically related.

649
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:21,681
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I've got no problems
with being adopted.

650
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,679
I love my parents.

651
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,427
How's he doing?
He's doing pretty well.

652
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,054
He's a smart kid.

653
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,099
I think he's gonna be fine.

654
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,202
- Hey.
- Thanks.

655
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,838
Wheels, 18. Wheels.

656
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,181
That's some bad hat, Harry.
