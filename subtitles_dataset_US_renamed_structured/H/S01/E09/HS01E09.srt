- I haven't.

What else could it be?

71
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,047
- Guillain-Barré,
which would be reversible.
- Excellent.

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,251
No. The progression of the paralysis
would be symmetric. His wasn't.

73
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,953
- Transverse myelitis.
- Hamilton tested for it. Negative.

74
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,326
And he was negative
for masses and A.V.M...

75

- Chase, intubate him.
- He's D.N.R.

164
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,865
What are you doin'?

165
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,465
You can't do this!

166
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,338
- Bag.
- You can't do this.

167
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,538
Bag!

168
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,113
He had a bad reaction to
some medicine we gave him.

169
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,022
What did you just do?

170
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,054
He saved his life.

171
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,134
<i>He's stable on the
ventilator, oxygenating well.</i>

172
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,544
The I.V.I.G. made him worse,

173
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:31,073
which means multifocal motor
neuropathy was a bad diagnosis.

174
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,813
Okay, what's really wrong with
him? What's wrong with you?

175
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,865
Everyone knows what's wrong with me.
What's wrong with <i>him</i> is more interesting.

176
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,767
You tubed him, and
he didn't want to be

177
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,985
tubed. He has a legal
paper saying just that.

178
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,224
To intubate or not to intubate—
That is the big ethical question.

179
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,563
Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it
and maybe just practice some medicine.

180
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,331
There is no question.
It's the patient's decision.

181
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,338
If the patient is
competent to make it.

182
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:56,035
- If his thyroid numbers
aren't making him sad.
- Oh, my God. You don't believe that.

183
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,910
- His thyroid levels were a little—
- It's nothing. Do not defend him!

184
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,710
- Why did he sign that D.N.R.?
- I-I didn't talk him into...

185
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,049
No. He signed the D.N.R. 'cause he didn't
want a slow, painful death from A.L.S.

186
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,579
- What was happening had
nothing to do with his A.L.S.
- Exactly! It's the I.V.I.G.

187
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:14,890
You screwed up! You're not gonna
let him die because you screwed up.

188
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,655
Technically, your
case. You screwed up.

189
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,361
Is that what this is about— Looking
bad in front of your old boss?

190
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,200
You assaulted that man.
Fine. I'll never do it again.

191
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,631
Yes, you will. All the more
reason this debate is pointless.

192
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:37,249
His lungs are
worse. Any theories?

193
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,345
Oh, I'm sure he just went to the
little boys' room. Come on, people.

194
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,789
- Um, vasculitis?
- Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.

195
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,588
It could be Wegener's
granulomatosis.

196
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,596
Dr. House?

197
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,531
Cuddy sent me a stripper again?

198
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,795
Love that woman. So thoughtful.

199
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,598
Sorry.

200
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,772
There are case reports of Wegener's
hitting both the lungs and the spine.

201
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,370
Well, it's not great, but it's better
than A.L.S. At least it's treatable.

202
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,712
<i>It's a restraining order. You're not to
come within 50 feet of John Henry Giles,</i>

203
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,581
and they've asked the D.A. to
file criminal charges for battery.

204
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,517
Cameron, test the
blood for C-ANCA.

205
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,207
These are criminal
charges. They're not

206
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:21,083
gonna let you take
blood to make more tests.

207
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,994
He has blood left in the
lab. Just add on the C-ANCA.

208
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,795
- Foreman still got you doing bronchoscopic
suctioning for the pneumonia?
- Every four hours.

209
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,254
Well, while you're
down in his lungs, grab a

210
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,635
biopsy. We'll need it
to confirm Wegener's.

211
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,402
- And move the patient
to the second floor I.C.U.
- Why?

212
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:39,105
It's right above the clinic. I'm pretty
sure it's 50 feet in any direction.

213
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,115
It's nice having a court order saying
you don't have to work clinic duty.

214
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,995
Dr. Cuddy! Excuse me.

215
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,332
You paged me. Why the yelling?

216
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,071
His bed is behind that
wall— The plaintiff's.

217
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,306
I can't, you know,
come any closer.

218
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,276
It's right over the
clinic. Very cute.

219
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,218
Can we get the lecture
over with 'cause I've gotta...

220
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,688
Actually, I've got nothing
to do. Take your time.

221
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,351
You need a lawyer?

222
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,918
You don't have a
problem with what I did?

223
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,686
When I hired you, I knew
you were insane. I will

224
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,764
continue to try and stop
you from doing insane things.

225
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,996
But once they're done,

226
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:42,531
trying to convince an insane person not
to do insane things is in itself insane.

227
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,976
So when I hired you, I also set aside
$50,000 a year for legal expenses.

228
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,142
So far you've come
in under budget.

229
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,983
Great. Any chance you
could help me run some tests?

230
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,682
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton.

231
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:00,591
He's flying in from
L.A. You can talk to him.

232
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,995
Dr. Hamilton is flying in
as a friend of John Henry's...

233
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,157
to pull the plug.

234
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:15,164
Yeah. I need a lawyer.

235
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,914
<i>Your Honor, on behalf
of Gregory House,</i>

236
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,507
we have convened an
emergency session of this court...

237
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,749
<i>to bring a motion requesting that
John Henry Giles remain on life support.</i>

238
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,952
Mr. House faces criminal
charges for battery against...

239
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,289
John Henry Giles.

240
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,354
You beat up a guy
in a wheelchair?

241
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:44,371
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube
down Mr. Giles's throat against his will.

242
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,737
A medical tube, saving his life.

243
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,709
Dr. House, please let
your attorney speak for you.

244
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,747
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I was way out of line.

245
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:02,053
<i>So, uh, your client forced
the patient into this position,</i>

246
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:07,389
<i>and now he wants a court order
to force the patient to stay that way.</i>

247
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,158
Without the tube, there's a high
likelihood that Mr. Giles will die.

248
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,394
Well, I assume the patient
knows that. He had a D.N.R.

249
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,266
That's why your client is
facing criminal charges, right?

250
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:23,139
Exactly. And Mr. Giles's death will
violate my client's Sixth Amendment right.

251
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,147
His right to face his
accuser. That's clever, huh?

252
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,912
Your Honor, in <i>Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania v. Hoselton,</i>

253
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,479
<i>the Third District ruled that a defendant
may not use that status to rule against—</i>

254
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,422
Why are you doing this?

255
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,790
It's not gonna keep
you out of jail. No.

256
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,527
Even if you win, the
restraining order and battery

257
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,026
charge stay in place, so
what have you gained?

258
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,532
Time.

259
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,762
To diagnose him?
You can't get near him.

260
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,361
I don't want to be near him.

261
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,375
Well, some doctors have the messiah
complex. They need to save the world.

262
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,537
You've got the Rubik's complex.
You need to solve the puzzle.

263
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,481
Are you done? Or do you have
more references to 1980s' fads?

264
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,314
I'm trying to listen to this.

265
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,581
<i>That D. N. R. may not be valid.</i>

266
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,386
<i>The patient was suffering from depression
brought on by a thyroid imbalance.</i>

267
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,053
The D.N.R. order
was witnessed...

268
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,121
by Dr. House's own
staff, a—a—a Dr. Foreman.

269
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,794
My staff are idiots. I'm sure you
know what it's like, Your Honor.

270
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,428
Sit down.

271
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:31,872
<i>The validity of the D. N.
R. Is a question of fact.</i>

272
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,676
Dr. House should have the opportunity
to make his argument at a full trial.

273
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:40,584
And this poor guy has got to stay on
life support until we can schedule a trial.

274
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,646
- Your Honor— - Dr. House,

275
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,989
<i>I will hold you in contempt
if you don't sit down.</i>

276
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,035
I have a medical issue.

277
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,938
If it pertains to this
case, your attorney...

278
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,864
It doesn't.

279
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,401
Do you have any history of
heart disease in your family?

280
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,165
- Your Honor!
<i>- Your fingers—</i>

281
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,706
They show signs of clubbing,
which indicates a heart problem.

282
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,609
Remember Bart Giamatti? Same
thing—Just dropped dead one day.

283
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,046
- Please see your doctor.
<i>- He's admitted this isn't relevant.</i>

284
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,779
Can we get back to the motion?

285
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,050
- Of course. I-I'm sorry.
<i>- Your Honor,</i>

286
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:20,389
<i>a person's right to control the
treatment of their own body...</i>

287
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,190
<i>is fundamental to
understanding this case.</i>

288
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,892
<i>A long line of cases, both
federal and state, stand to—</i>

289
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,903
Congratulations.
Impressive legal argument.

290
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,462
I watched <i>Matlock</i>
last night. Say no more.

291
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,873
I didn't notice any clubbing on
the judge's fingers. Neither did I.

292
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,934
So the family history thing...

293
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,480
Every family has some
history of heart disease.

294
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,482
And mental illness.

295
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:51,151
Biopsy only shows inflammation.
Start him on Cytoxan.

296
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,818
You're diagnosing Wegener's
based on a little inflammation?

297
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,988
Well, unfortunately, I think we've
exhausted all the tests we can do...

298
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,858
in our capacity as the
doctors that he doesn't

299
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:00,583
want doing tests on
him. Well, you don't...

300
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,539
We'll know I'm right if he
starts walking. We can't

301
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:04,379
do any more tests, but
you want me to treat him?

302
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,896
Medicine's in the pharmacy.
Patient's immobilized in the I.C.U.

303
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,636
Sounds like a simple
geography problem.

304
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,475
Are you asking us to jeopardize our
medical licenses for this treatment?

305
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,199
Can I help you?

306
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,267
Uh, I'm Dr. House. I...

307
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,007
Greg, right? I'm Marty
Hamilton, John Henry's doctor.

308
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,651
We should talk.

309
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,957
<i>Appreciate any list of, uh,
medications— Anything like that.</i>

310
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,687
I've started him on Cytoxan.

311
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,753
For Wegener's, right?

312
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,889
Look, Greg.

313
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,025
I checked you out, you know?

314
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,468
I know you're a good doctor, and you have
to appreciate that I'm a good doctor too.

315
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,099
Why? Wegener's is one of
the first things I looked for.

316
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,905
The biopsy and the blood test
were negative, just like yours.

317
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,242
There's an error rate, Marty.

318
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,372
And there's a time to let go.

319
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,843
Look, I'm gonna take
him off the ventilator, and

320
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,217
John Henry's going to
die. He's accepted that.

321
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,883
<i>Dr. Hamilton. Hey.</i>

322
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,256
How you doin'?
Hey, how you doin'?

323
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,806
- I'm sorry. I should have never
put your patient on I.V.I.G.
<i>- It's not your fault, Eric.</i>

324
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,029
- No, it's mine, <i>Eric.</i>
- That's not what I said.

325
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,503
- Everybody asks about you out in L.A.
<i>- How's the old place doin'?</i>

326
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,767
Oh, this is wonderful.

327
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,156
But before you guys break
out the oil, I should point

328
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,608
out that you can't pull the
plug. I have a court order.

329
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,014
You used to, but...

330
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,209
I have the right to face
my accuser. Judge said so.

331
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:02,517
Not if no one's accusing you. All
the charges have been dropped.

332
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,221
He doesn't have to die.

333
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,034
It's not Wegener's.

334
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,180
If it's Wegener's, his lungs
won't be able to handle it.

335
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,246
Soon as they pull
that plug, he'll die.

336
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,384
That's why they call
it "pulling the plug."

337
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,046
I'm gonna miss you.

338
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,946
- He's still breathing.
- His O₂ sats are holding.

339
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,729
- He's holding his own.
- He's still breathing.

340
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,733
It's not Wegener's.

341
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,642
Wrong again.

342
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,742
<i>He's stable, but one of
his arms is now paralyzed.</i>

343
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,548
The real question is,
why is he still alive?

344
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,885
Do you think he's
just being stubborn?

345
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,619
He's alive because you were
wrong. It's not Wegener's.

346
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:23,754
Yeah. Seem to be doing that a lot lately.
People keep living because of my mistakes.

347
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,288
Progression of the paralysis pretty much
confirmed Hamilton was right. It's A.L.S.

348
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:30,632
- Assuming this is
a progression of his paralysis.
- He can't move his arm.

349
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,003
Yes, his arm is paralyzed.
Yes, his legs are paralyzed.

350
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,908
Why is everyone so gung ho
to connect those two conditions?

351
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,288
You can think I'm wrong, but
that's no reason to stop thinking.

352
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,340
- How about this one? He's not our patient.
- Nope. Not good enough.

353
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,783
He could've suffered a
stroke when he was intubated.

354
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,412
Well, blood clots are
common in paralyzed patients.

355
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,219
The inactivity causes—
<i>Not interested in why.</i>

356
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,023
- Let's get an M.R. angiogram,
check for an embolic stroke.
- He doesn't want you treating him.

357
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,998
- They dropped the court order.
- Yeah, and that girl dropped
the charges against Kobe.

358
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,178
- Doesn't mean he should call her
and see if she's free to get a sundae.
<i>- Good point.</i>

359
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,364
But I can go within
50 feet of him now.

360
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,502
You need me, you have
'em page me. Anytime.

361
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,447
Okay.

362
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,062
- Get out of here.
- Sure. That makes sense.

363
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,570
You hate me for
saving your life.

364
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,698
Well, in fairness to your side, you
were also dying because of me, so...

365
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,938
- You knew I didn't want to be saved.
- That's what's interesting.

366
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,469
Your thyroid was low, but not
enough to cause depression.

367
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,946
So you came here
to tell me that even if I

368
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,508
can't walk, I can still
hear the birds sing,

369
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,578
enjoy a rainbow, the feeling
of sunshine on my face?

370
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,858
Those things are fun.

371
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,760
Okay. Life sucks.

372
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,196
Your life sucks more than most.

373
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:10,100
It's not as bad as some,
which is depressing all by itself.

374
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,968
But do me a favor.

375
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,838
Just let me find out
what's wrong with you.

376
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,539
<i>Then if you still
want to kill yourself,</i>

377
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,746
I'll give you a hand.

378
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,082
- That sound fair?
- Yeah. Sure.

379
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,554
I'll stick around to
indulge your obsession.

380
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,957
It's over. I lost my air.

381
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,019
The session the other
night with those kids...

382
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:41,033
That was a test to see
if I could still play. I can't.

383
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,764
And that's all you
are, a musician?

384
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,137
I got one thing, same as you.

385
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,506
Really?

386
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,977
Well, apparently you know
me better than I know you.

387
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,708
I know that limp.

388
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,875
I know the empty ring finger.

389
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,079
And that obsessive nature
of yours— That's a big secret.

390
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:06,751
You don't risk jail and your career to save
somebody who doesn't want to be saved...

391
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:11,092
unless you got something—
Anything—one thing.

392
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:17,034
The reason normal people got wives
and kids and hobbies— whatever...

393
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,503
That's because they ain't
got that one thing that...

394
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,666
That hits 'em that
hard and that true.

395
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,404
I got music. You got this...

396
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,108
The thing you think about all the time,
thing that keeps you south of normal.

397
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:33,380
Yeah. Makes us great.
Makes us the best.

398
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,614
All we miss out on
is everything else.

399
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:41,219
<i>No woman waiting at home after
work with the drink and the kiss.</i>

400
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:44,195
That ain't gonna happen for us.

401
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,255
That's why God made microwaves.

402
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,267
Yeah.

403
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,326
But when it's over,

404
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,463
it's over.

405
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,840
Yeah.

406
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,154
What're you doin'?

407
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,167
It's not over for me.

408
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,295
Either you're gonna call the
cops again, or we're doing this.

409
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,364
You want to die, you can do it just
as easily inside an M.R.I. machine.

410
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,745
<i>So when I go back to L.A., I'm doing
the Dana lectures again this year.</i>

411
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,755
Wow. Thank you.

412
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,519
Thanks. That's quite
an honor. It's all political.

413
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,322
Don't be modest.
You've earned it.

414
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,487
I got lucky on a couple
studies I was doing.

415
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,158
It all sells tickets. You remember
last year's lectures, don't you?

416
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:58,534
- I remember the cigar bar afterwards.
- The only reason to attend the thing—
cigars and pool.

417
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,039
You enjoy working
with Dr. House?

418
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,746
Not the word I'd use.

419
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,339
We work too hard not
to enjoy ourselves, right?

420
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,415
- Mmm. You seeing anybody?
- Kinda, sorta.

421
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,049
- Serious?
- I don't know. It could be.

422
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,888
You think she'd, uh, enjoy L.A.?

423
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,773
Hamilton offered me a job.

424
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,816
You gonna take
it? I haven't decided.

425
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,628
You already have the most prestigious
fellowship. It's a partnership...

426
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:52,148
Three times the money, car allowance,
moving expense, pension plan,

427
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,229
the chance to work for a
guy who gives a crap what

428
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,161
people think. Why didn't
you just tell him yes?

429
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,426
I made a commitment here. Right.

430
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,489
House would let you
out of it in a heartbeat.

431
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,663
Or he wouldn't, just
to jerk me around.

432
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,761
Would you guys
have taken the job?

433
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,036
Don't need the money. We're
not like you. I don't hate House.

434
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,737
You guys really don't have a
problem with him, with what he did?

435
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,803
He knows we
disagree with his choice.

436
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,578
Choice? Chase, it's not apples
and oranges. It's right and wrong.

437
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,313
And he does it like he doesn't
care. He assaults the guy...

438
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,254
and moves on to the next
differential diagnosis like it's nothing.

439
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,315
What do you want from him?
Hand-wringing? Torment?

440
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,587
You want him to cry himself
to sleep at night? Yeah!

441
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,873
Yeah, I want some
clue that he knows it's a

442
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:33,291
big deal. That it scares
him, that it matters.

443
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,028
Whoa, whoa. What's that?

444
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,262
It was a stroke.

445
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,615
Well done, Cameron.

446
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,340
House called it. The arm
and legs are unrelated.

447
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,312
Oh, you make enough calls,
one of them is bound to be right.

448
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,145
Yeah. He's just
a lucky, lucky guy.

449
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:55,381
<i>Listen, listen. I just think it wouldn't
hurt him to learn a little humility.</i>

450
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,456
So what's the verdict?

451
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,460
Embolus. The arm problem
was caused by a clot.

452
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,019
<i>There's a good chance we
can bust the clot with T. P.A.</i>

453
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:08,397
Do it. See what
happens to his arm.

454
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,774
We found a blood
clot in your brain.

455
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,180
We'd like to start you on
heparin. It's a blood thinner.

456
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,744
- What are the side effects?
- Well, your lungs are kind of
chewed up from the pneumonia.

457
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,415
- Good chance there'll be an effusion.
- Bleeding?

458
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,053
Into his lungs. It's our best chance
to give you back the use of your arm.

459
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,858
I don't need my
arm without my air.

460
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,422
- The damage would likely be minimal.
- No.

461
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,030
It's his call.

462
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,769
Or we could do an embolectomy.

463
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,776
Basically, we go in
and pull the clot out.

464
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,780
He's saying no to drugs, and
you're recommending brain surgery?

465
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,839
Bypasses the risk to the lungs.

466
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,078
- It'll either help your
arm, or— - Or it'll kill me.

467
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:03,884
From your point of
view, it's a win-win.

468
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,254
Okay.

469
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,055
We'll set up the
procedure for today.

470
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,273
We're in your carotid artery.

471
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,210
This is gonna take us all
the way up into your brain.

472
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,441
You all right?

473
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,642
Yes.

474
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,793
<i>The sludge is
blocking the blood flow</i>

475
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:41,921
<i>to the part of the brain
that controls your arm.</i>

476
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,369
All done. You still okay?

477
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,675
I think so.

478
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,735
<i>I don't know. I guess...</i>

479
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,442
it's just with Dr. Hamilton here,
I-I noticed a difference in styles.

480
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,851
His style involves humility?

481
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,185
Another difference
in our styles...

482
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:14,317
I don't care much for
apologies. You can go.

483
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,827
I didn't know you were standing
there when I said that, okay?

484
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,922
It was completely rude. Do
you mean genuine humility,

485
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,593
you know, with all the self-doubt
and the self-questioning,

486
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,536
or Hamilton's polite, patronizing,
"Aw, shucks" humility?

487
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,597
You're both excellent
doctors. Thank you.

488
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,940
And humility is an important
quality, especially if you're wrong a lot.

489
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,980
You've been wrong
every step of the way.

490
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:45,221
Course, when you're right, self-doubt
doesn't help anybody, does it?

491
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,022
We gotta go.

492
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,842
Congratulations, Greg.

493
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,174
Congratulations. Why, Marty?

494
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,406
John woke up. He
can use his arm.

495
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,574
Thank you.

496
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,175
Now, look, I know we've
had our differences,

497
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,415
but I think when a person does
something well, it ought to be recognized.

498
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,423
The phone works.

499
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,393
Next time you want to make me feel
all warm and fuzzy, leave a message.

500
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,895
Don't get me wrong.
I'm overcome with joy.

501
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,591
- Doc.
- Yeah.

502
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,102
- What?
- You just touched my leg.

503
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,603
What, are you gonna
charge me with assault again?

504
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,539
No.

505
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,202
I felt it.

506
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,116
<i>He now has feeling all
the way up to the calf.</i>

507
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,588
This is the way
medicine evolved.

508
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,648
Patients sometimes get better.

509
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,889
You have no idea why, but unless
you give a reason, they won't pay you.

510
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,022
Anybody notice if
there's a full moon?

511
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,157
You're saying he just
spontaneously got better?

512
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,827
No. I'm saying, let's rule out
the lunar god and go from there.

513
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,837
Something he's on is working.

514
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:09,068
The enzyme replacement protocol
is working, reversing the A.L.S.

515
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,302
The timing doesn't
seem suspicious to you?

516
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,835
Do you think Dr. House'll see it that way,
figure it's his medication doin' the job?

517
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,075
I'm sure he will.

518
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,209
It's one of ours. <i>How do we figure
out which drug is doing the trick?</i>

519
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,345
Easy. We just stop all of them.

520
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,322
- One of those drugs is helping him.
- And the rest...

521
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,252
Steroids, antibiotics,
anti-inflammatories...

522
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:29,293
They're toxic, if we
leave him on all of them.

523
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,626
- He'll walk again.
- Yeah. To his own funeral.

524
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,291
But if we stop everything,
he'll get worse. <i>True.</i>

525
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,053
We'll add our medications
back one at a time.

526
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:37,712
When he gets better,
we'll have our answer.

527
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:41,400
- And if he doesn't get better?
- Then we're in trouble.

528
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,965
Not as much as he is.

529
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,102
But I suppose
that was your point.

530
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:53,214
I assume you want me to convince Hamilton
to stop his treatments too. Don't care.

531
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,015
At least five of the medications
are a part of his protocol.

532
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,818
If his stuff was helping, the guy
would be playing tennis months ago.

533
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,223
It's <i>our</i> round of
treatment that's helping.

534
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,387
Right. So <i>that's</i>
what you'll stop.

535
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,954
<i>It shouldn't be more
than 15 or 20 minutes.</i>

536
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,775
So your philosophy
is, if they don't want

537
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,867
treatment, they get it
shoved down their throat,

538
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,736
- but if it might cure their paralysis,
whoa, we better slow down.
- Yeah.

539
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,799
Yes, Doctor, I love it. <i>My old
philosophy used to be live and let live.</i>

540
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:22,644
But I'm taking this needlepoint class,
and they gave us these really big pillows.

541
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,912
- What's your philosophy
on employee relations?
- That's a very tiny pillow.

542
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,715
Great. It sounds like you
know what you're doing.

543
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,347
<i>Greg.</i>

544
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:34,154
- Can I have a word?
- Can it wait for the commercial, Marty?

545
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,990
<i>Say hi to my friend Jimmy.</i>

546
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,692
Pleasure.

547
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,757
Your diagnostic trial...

548
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,065
Seriously, commercial's
in about five minutes.

549
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,072
- That's a dangerous game.
- Only if we're watching in the bathtub.

550
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,270
I need to know exactly what
medications you were giving John Henry.

551
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,404
Forget it. And if Foreman tells you
what John Henry used to be on...

552
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,915
- You're gonna fire him?
- Nope.

553
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,577
I'll make him live out every
day of his two-year contract.

554
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,621
- Foreman asked to leave?
- Not yet.

555
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,385
- But how do you know I made him— - You're
a polite twit, but you're not an idiot.

556
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,657
I need to know what medications
you've taken him off of.

557
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,524
Wait a second.
You're not an idiot.

558
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,236
You need to know what
medications I've stopped...

559
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,242
because...

560
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,903
He's getting worse.

561
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,818
Right now you still
work for me. Come on.

562
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,482
No feeling. No wiggling.

563
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,051
Bad news is John Henry's back where he
started. Good news is Hamilton looks bad.

564
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:47,463
Yeah, it's not whether you win or
lose. It's whether the other guy loses.

565
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:50,077
What was the first thing we put
him on? Steroids, for the pneumonia.

566
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,764
Well, put him back on them. Give
him 24 hours. See what happens.

567
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,830
His lungs aren't great. They might
cause another respiratory collapse.

568
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,967
Sure hope not. I didn't
much like that lawyer.

569
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,443
And get an M.R.I. He
already got one, and an M.R.A.

570
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,913
Well, obviously something
is different now. Do it again.

571
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,974
Chase, take care of the scan.
Cameron, put him on the steroids.

572
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,945
We should probably talk, huh?

573
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,355
Thin cuts. What levels?

574
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,366
T-9 through the cauda
equina, same as the last time.

575
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,271
You really think House would let
Foreman out of his contract? <i>He has to.</i>

576
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,036
If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman
he needs him. House can't handle that.

577
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,284
Oh, my God.

578
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,447
I checked him out.

579
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,756
He's a great doctor.

580
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,561
- You think he's better than I am?
- This about your ego?

581
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,828
Answer the question.

582
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:03,007
It's not gonna change how I think about
myself. Might affect my opinion of you,

583
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,839
but that shouldn't affect
your opinion of yourself.

584
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,077
Now I'm getting confused.

585
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:11,776
If you think he's a better doctor than
I am, then you should take the job.

586
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,581
Otherwise, you should get
him to buy you two or three

587
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,153
more nostalgic lunches
and then politely decline.

588
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:20,420
It's that simple? I should just
ignore the mockery and abuse?

589
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,620
- Oh, how do I abuse you?
- How do you not?

590
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,426
- If I make a mistake— - I hold
you accountable. So what?

591
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,568
Dr. Hamilton forgives.
He's capable of moving on.

592
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:31,231
That is not what he does.

593
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,329
I screwed up his case. He told
me— <i>He never said you were forgiven.</i>

594
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,340
I was there. He said
it wasn't your fault.

595
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,535
- So?
- So, it was.

596
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,444
<i>You took a chance.
You did something great.</i>

597
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,074
You were wrong, but it was still great.
You should feel great that it was great.

598
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,128
<i>You should feel like
crap that it was wrong.</i>

599
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,018
<i>That's the difference
between him and me.</i>

600
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,647
He thinks you do your
job, and what will be will be.

601
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,885
I think that what I do
and what you do matters.

602
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,959
He sleeps better at
night. He shouldn't.

603
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,467
- Arteriovenous malformation.
- Intradural. Compressing his spine.

604
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,640
Causing his paralysis.

605
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,438
How could Hamilton
have missed an A.V.M.?

606
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,445
Well, we missed it too,

607
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,640
'cause it wasn't there before.

608
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,706
Are you saying it
just grew overnight?

609
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,718
No.

610
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,552
It was on the spine.
It wasn't on the M.R.I.

611
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,718
- Same anatomic location.
- It's not there.

612
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,991
- Well, what is there?
- Nothing.

613
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:35,227
Or something that
looks like nothing.

614
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:40,330
<i>- Background noise. Static.</i>
- Scar tissue? Inflammation?

615
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:43,136
If it's inflammation, the
steroids would've shrunk it down.

616
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,434
Revealing the A.V.M.,

617
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,106
which has always been there,
hiding behind its own swelling.

618
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,944
We remove that,
he'll walk again.

619
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,750
<i>♪♪</i>

620
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,132
Dr. House.

00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,337
Cora's meeting me
outside with the limo.

00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,001
I'm bein' discharged.

Fifty bucks says I can

Thanks for stickin'
with the case.

625
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,150
I can't do anything else.

626

You're much more easily
amused when you can walk.

627
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,780
How bizarre.

628
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,189
I'm guessing that you
weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine...

629
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,921
even before your
leg got messed up.

630
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,166
I want you to have this.

631
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,877
Wow.

632
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,210
You can sell it if you want to.
Just promise me you won't play it.

633
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,719
How many of those

634
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,755

Yes.

636

Aren't we all?

637
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:53,002
So, uh, where do you buy these
things? Do they have cane stores?

638
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,473
Ah, don't worry about it. You'll be
jogging before you need a second one.
