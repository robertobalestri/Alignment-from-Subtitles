Great. Now we
gotta go to a hospital.

00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:48,689
Homeless. Admitted 24 hours
ago with a suspected drug overdose.

39
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,459
Her tox screen's clean,
but she's still delusional.

40
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,968
"Homeless." Usually
means crazy, no money.

41
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,971
Cuddy's not gonna be—
We're a teaching hospital.

42
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,473
No ID. Doesn't even
seem to know her name.

43
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,476
I got called in because of
some lesions on her arm.

44
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,219
Homeless always means
no roof. Leads to too

45
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,983
much sun. No, the
lesions were noncancerous.

46
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,575
But I noticed a
twitch. Her wrist.

47
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,454
You feel that?

48
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,617
Sure. I'm human.

49
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,161
Make a fist around my
fingers as tight as you can.

50
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,924
Squeeze. I am.

51
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,366
All right.

52
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,836
Raise your arms
above your head for me.

53
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,767
She's seizing.

54
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,802
Get me some Ativan.

55
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:40,541
She doesn't wanna be
discharged. She's manipulating you.

56
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,679
It's real. Check a finger stick.

57
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:54,795
- Blood sugar's 38.
- I need D-50 I.V. push, stat.

58
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,898
Fake low blood sugar.
Now, <i>that's</i> acting.

59
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,900
The blood sugar was real.

60
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,301
She's probably diabetic.
O.D.'d on her own insulin.

61
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,608
Room 2032. Do you
have her effects out here?

62
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,134
Look, a seizure buys her a place to sleep
while the nice doctors run their tests.

63
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,341
<i>Maybe a few free meals.</i>

64
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,249
Twenty bucks says
there's insulin in there.

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,757
Oh! Wow. Put this back, please.

66
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,419
What about the
twitch? Her arm moved.

67
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,429
Why fake a twitch? In case
the seizure was too subtle?

68
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,432
The twitch could indicate a
tumor, which could indicate...

69
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,765
A need to see a neurologist,
which is why you called me.

70
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,500
Keep an eye on her till 2:00 p.m. Watch
her blood sugar, give her a nice hot lunch.

71
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,599
Then discharge her.

72
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,206
- He's wrong.
- Foreman is wrong?

73
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,217
The neurologist is wrong
about a neurological problem.

74
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,220
He took one look at her
and figured it was a scam.

75
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,222
So you figure he's
not being objective.

76
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,953
House, the woman had a
twitch. She had a seizure.

77
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,690
Both of which Foreman saw?
He just wanted her out the door!

78
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up there, big fella.

79
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,702
Foreman's the guy you
wanna take a swing at.

80
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,401
I just want her to get
some medical attention.

81
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,913
That's not even
close to being true.

82
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,472
It's something else.
Something personal.

83
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,312
Give me the file.

84
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,624
Looks like this'll be fun.

85
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,222
<i>The twitch could be a miniseizure,
unrelated to the diabetes.</i>

86
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,164
Brain tumor?

87
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,168
Glad you could join us, Eric.

88
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,171
What's the differential
for a twitch in the wrist?

89
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,902
The patient's a 30-ish Jane Doe.
I thought I just discharged her.

90
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,274
Well, she's my patient. No
harm in a second opinion.

91
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,280
<i>A blow to the head?
A subdural hematoma?</i>

92
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,441
Read the file. No
evidence of cranial trauma.

93
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,009
- A twitch could indicate a brain tumor.
- Or about a dozen other things!

94
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,079
<i>Come on. There's two things
homeless people are good at—</i>

95
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,318
<i>Getting sick and running scams.</i>

96
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,328
If you're so worried about it being
a brain tumor, get her an M.R.I.

97
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,407
- When she's clear on that,
then you can bounce her out of here.
- Well, you've got her all figured out.

98
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,493
- I've known a lot more
homeless people than you have.
<i>- Yes, you've got that going for you.</i>

99
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,537
How could I have doubted
your medical opinion?

100
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,836
The big question. You're
missing it, all of you.

101
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,172
Oh, geez.

102
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,542
Who is she?

103
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,174
Okay, why are we on this case?
Just because Wilson asked?

104
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,447
<i>- Do I need a better reason?
- Well, most people wouldn't. You do.</i>

105
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,658
The only thing we know for sure about
Jane Doe is that her name isn’t Jane Doe,

106
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,464
<i>which means no medical history.</i>

107
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,472
<i>Allergies, medication,
previous diagnoses, treatment—</i>

108
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,941
We have no baseline, no
context for medical treatment.

109
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,205
Wow. Looks just like insulin.

110
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,047
Vomit. Still moist.

111
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,677
- What do you think? Couple of days old?
- Ugh! You trying to make me hurl?

112
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,347
Yeah. And here's the big finish.

113
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,885
<i>Salty.</i>

114
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,427
Chemical imbalance.

115
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,895
Low magnesium could
cause a twitch. Or high calcium.

116
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,878
Or it's a coincidence. The
point is, we don't know anything.

117
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:21,230
So do the M.R.I. Find out.

118
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,099
The M.R.I. can wait.
Hang a banana bag.

119
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,820
Give her 24 hours to
correct the electrolyte

120
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:26,215
imbalance. We'll
take it from there.

121
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,504
Great. Thanks.

122
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,849
<i>Okay, even if she’s not faking,
what's so fascinating about this case?</i>

123
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,649
At the moment, how much
you <i>don't</i> want me to take it.

124
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,713
That's pretty fascinating.

125
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,363
<i>Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman.</i>

126
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,889
In fact, he's never
looked better.

127
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,660
He doesn't like me. I can tell.

128
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,503
<i>It's okay. He
doesn't like me either.</i>

129
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,806
Who’s James?

130
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,280
<i>Ow!</i> Pain in your head?

131
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,749
Get away from me!

132
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,443
No, no, no, no!

133
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,763
All right, let's cool her out.
One milligram Ativan, push.

134
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,052
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

135
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,057
Hold on.

136
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,990
Aah! Aah!

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,656
She bit me!

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,895
Good news is, she's
negative for HIV and Hep "C."

139
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,994
<i>Yeah? I'm getting a tetanus
shot. She's getting an M.R.I.</i>

140
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:35,031
- There's a two-day wait
for nonemergency M.R.I.'s.
- She's getting an M.R.I.! Then she's outta here.

141
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,246
<i>But Dr. Terhark specifically
said I'd have the M.R.I. at 10:00.</i>

142
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,909
It's almost 11:00, and I haven't
even had the pre-test yet.

143
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,919
<i>Sorry. We're a little backed up.</i>

144
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,421
Excuse me. You're
Dr. Terhark's 10:00?

145
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,426
I'm Angela Whitney. I'm
meeting my decorator at 11:30.

146
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,928
She's coming all the
way from New York.

147
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,430
Dr. Terhark promised
I'd be home in time.

148
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,490
Of course.

149
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,507
She just about
prepped for her M.R.I.?

150
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,279
Mrs. Whitney?

151
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:23,118
You tried to steal
someone else's test.

152
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,124
Dr. Terhark is a
plastic surgeon.

153
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,787
The woman was getting a six-month
checkup on her chin implants.

154
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,531
- I can't believe you authorized this.
- Really?

155
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,660
It sounds exactly
like something I'd do.

156
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,363
She can't have an M.R.I.

157
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,970
The C.T. scan shows she
has a surgical pin in her arm.

158
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,876
<i>The M.R.I. magnet would
have ripped it out of her body.</i>

159
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,210
You like the <i>Alien</i> movies?

160
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,445
You had no medical history.
What were you thinking?

161
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,818
We'll surgically remove the pin, then
do the M.R.I. Does that sound good?

162
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,724
She has an
electrolyte imbalance.

163
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,817
Dr. Foreman, a neurologist,
believes this woman has a brain tumor.

164
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:04,160
- Actually, I— - Hey, don't ever
apologize for a medical opinion.

165
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,257
If he's right and we don't
do this test, the patient dies.

166
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,282
I realize that you have
a specialty of your own,

167
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,361
but does yours have
anything to do with the brain?

168
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,236
His does.

169
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,242
Fine.

170
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,007
- But nothing more
until you find out who she is.
- How are we supposed to...

171
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,072
Hey! He knows more
homeless people than any of us.

172
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,252
Go check out the hood, dog.

173
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,958
<i>I don't know.</i>

174
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,764
I've seen a lot of faces around
here, but I don't think I know her.

175
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,195
Great.

176
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,472
Say, I, uh, like that jacket.

177
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,240
Yeah, uh, it's all
comin' to me now.

178
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,748
<i>I know where she
keeps her stuff.</i>

179
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,847
Just bats.

180
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,952
I thought the lining
would be thicker.

181
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,150
No tumor. Nothing.
Her brain is clear.

182
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,483
Which means that girl had surgery just
so you wouldn't get reamed out by Cuddy.

183
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,786
Not necessarily. There could still
be something neurological going on.

184
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,053
Sure. She's not
conning us. The M.R.I. is.

185
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:44,188
Not wearing a coat in this weather.
That is so wrong. She drew these.

186
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,597
They might give us a clue.

187
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,602
<i>She sign them? Her
name would be a start.</i>

188
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,162
All the mythology, the locations,
they'd all depend on her life experience.

189
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,401
Philadelphia.

190
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,467
Look at that skyline.

191
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,171
<i>It's very evocative.</i>

192
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,009
The Chrysler Building.

193
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,640
- That's a cloud.
- And the Chrysler Building's in New York.

194
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,651
Ehh, I'm getting Philly.

195
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,552
And that cactus, well,
it's a—it's a smashed car.

196
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,217
- It's a car accident.
- A cactus in Philadelphia?

197
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,353
Water. Well, water's
October, right? Obviously.

198
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:20,196
<i>Well, the page number 22,
so that's October 2, 2002.</i>

199
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,293
Ergo, the patient was in a car
accident two years ago last October.

200
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,998
My goodness. Was she okay?

201
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,007
Broke her arm, I think.

202
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,839
They fixed it with this.

203
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,510
<i>Surgical pin.</i>

204
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,881
Better than a wallet. Serial numbers in
case of recall, tied to a patient's name.

205
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,208
That's why you insisted
on the M.R.I.— so you

206
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:43,412
could remove the
surgical pin from her arm?

207
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,036
You didn't think I was gonna do
it to save your sorry ass, did you?

208
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,188
You might wanna
take a look at that.

209
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,198
Her name is Victoria Matsen, or at
least that's the one she used then.

210
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,360
<i>Any hospital with a record of treating
her should be sending that information.</i>

211
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,370
Oh, crap!

212
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,373
Her blood work came back an
hour ago. Magnesium was normal.

213
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,065
Did you change her
banana bag? Stopped the

214
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:04,053
magnesium, started iron
dextran for severe anemia.

215
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,012
She's allergic to iron dextran.

216
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,882
Grab some epi off the code cart.

217
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,783
Respiratory arrest. Call a code!

218
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,816
You're having an allergic
reaction. Can you speak?

219
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,787
She's not getting any air.

220
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,456
Got the epi.

221
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,023
- Sats are down in the 80s and dropping.
- We have about another minute.

222
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,382
<i>Well, we got her
sedated and stabilized.</i>

223
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,080
And you still think there's nothing
wrong with her? Nothing's changed.

224
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,385
You almost killed
her. That's different.

225
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,085
And we know who she is.

226
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,220
So far, we've heard from three
hospitals with records on Victoria Matsen.

227
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,457
Seven visits going
back two years.

228
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,510
<i>- Any home addresses?</i>
- The pin in her arm
went in during an E.R. visit.

229
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,265
She wasn't conscious, so
they didn't get an address.

230
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,820
The other visits, she
gave fake addresses.

231
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:07,282
<i>Any treatment for
neurological problems?</i>

232
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,241
Anything that might
explain the twitch?

233
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,472
Last winter, Jefferson Hospital
in Philly. Got treated for frostbite.

234
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,571
Baby, it's cold outside.

235
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,412
And depression. They
put her on Prozac.

236
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,419
Well, I'd be bummed out too.
Zero degrees, living in a box.

237
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,251
Put her back on it. She cheers
up, she might stop biting people.

238
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,801
<i>There's a billing record
from Hartman Hospital</i>

239
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,056
<i>last year. Two
appointments, ultrasounds.</i>

240
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,289
Doesn't say what for. Pregnant?

241
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,628
Well, only if she was
expecting an elephant.

242
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,894
Appointments were
ten months apart.

243
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,903
<i>Kept the first,
blew off the second.</i>

244
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,802
Abdominal pain.

245
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,137
- Her chart doesn't
say— - Wait a minute.

246
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,643
She goes in the first time.

247
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,433
They look, they can't
find anything. Ten months

248
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:48,390
later, why should she
subject herself to that again?

249
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,781
<i>Why make a second
appointment?</i> She didn't.

250
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,944
The nurse made the appointment.

251
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,648
They were looking— They
were looking for ovarian cancer.

252
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,319
You got all of that from
one canceled appointment?

253
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,991
With Jerry Lauseng,
yeah. He's an oncologist.

254
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,693
<i>Hang on. Her current blood work
doesn't show cancer. C.A. 125 is normal.</i>

255
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,897
<i>And the cancer wouldn't
account for the alleged</i>

256
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,935
<i>twitch or any of her
other alleged symptoms.</i>

257
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,771
Actually, it would.

258
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,779
Neoplastic syndrome
associated with the cancer...

259
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:23,476
could cause her to twitch
like a bunny on crystal meth.

260
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,541
Ultrasound her ovaries.

261
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:32,057
<i>- Did you find a brain tumor on her M.R.I.?</i>
- No. Foreman was wrong.

262
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,561
I'm starting to wonder about
that guy's medical chops. Right.

263
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,029
- Shelley Diamond.
- Yeah.

264
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,657
Dr. House is ready
to see you now.

265
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,774
<i>The little ones are
licking each other again,</i>

266
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>and Harry's got a seeping
wart on his extra toe.</i>

267
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,006
What room should we go to?

268
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,701
You know what? I think I might
be coming down with something.

269
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,373
Hate to give it to
you guys. Sorry.

270
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,384
Oh, yeah. Just walk out.
Like I'm not gonna do anything.

271
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,443
Bye-bye.

272
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,091
Working hard?

273
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,098
This stuff's pretty good.

274
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,101
Calendraica works for
the Council of Genius.

275
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,103
Bad guy is Mr. Fury.

276
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,766
Fairly generic, no special skills,
but apparently very well organized.

277
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,107
<i>You think you work hard.
Try ruling the universe.</i>

278
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,408
You trying to teach
me something here?

279
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,714
We got the flowing dress, the
ring. Think the patient was married?

280
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,778
Maybe it was a bad break-up. Maybe
he dumped her 'cause she was on drugs.

281
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,922
You care about her
personal history? <i>No.</i>

282
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,552
Question is, why don't you?

283
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,129
<i>I hate to cite a cliché,
but Dad on the streets?</i>

284
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,604
- Dad's with Mom.
- They're both living on the streets?

285
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,038
<i>No. On a pension.</i>

286
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,737
So, who pissed you off?

287
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,803
Right now, you.

288
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,588
<i>Your turn. You gonna
tell me why this case?</i>

289
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,090
She's my new girlfriend.
I'm having a tattoo designed.

290
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,593
I was hoping you
could find out her name.

291
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,127
So she's just another sick
person that kindly Dr. Wilson

292
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:19,598
has made sure doesn't get
lost in the big, ugly system.

293
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,601
Yes, I forgot. I need a
reason to give a crap.

294
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,604
You're giving two craps. The
metric system always confuses me.

295
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,572
<i>Dr. House?</i>

296
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:32,942
<i>- Time for Girl Scout cookies already?</i>
- Get me some thin mints.

297
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,176
Since you're too sick
to work in the clinic...

298
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,683
Okay.

299
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,153
I thought you— -

300
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,725
I thought you could do some
teaching. Patient histories.

301
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,989
My specialty.

302
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,463
When you teach, you learn
so much. Don't you think?

303
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,023
It's all about the giving back.

304
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,231
Good old Cuddy. Always thinking.

305
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,674
She assign you a
patient to interview?

306
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,473
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

307
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,036
Then why are you still here?

308
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,350
<i>Why</i> are <i>we on this case?</i> 'Cause
Wilson asked House to do him a favor.

309
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,794
I think House just wants to prove
she's sick so Foreman will be wrong.

310
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,027
- Oh, you boys.
- Hey, I'm just doing my job.

311
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,727
Whoa.

312
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:37,643
Foreman's gonna be so embarrassed
when he finds out she's got cancer.

313
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,650
Ah. I thought you were
too sick to be down here.

314
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:50,178
I had to get away from those
students, so I faked a page.

315
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:54,887
Foreman's parents,
happily married, 40 years.

316
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,020
<i>Mazel tov. Kein ayin hara.</i>

317
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,533
So why does he hate
homeless people?

318
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,196
I mean, if it's an uncle
or a grandparent, you'd

319
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,004
think he'd use it in his
college application essay.

320
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,372
Family struggles beats
a 4.0 G.P.A. any day.

321
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:14,039
- I think he had a 4.0.
- Maybe he's just a snob.

322
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:17,049
You really don't need to know
everything about everybody.

323
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,052
I don't <i>need</i> to watch <i>The
O. C.,</i> but it makes me happy.

324
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,588
Yeah, delirious.
What's the other file?

325
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,021
Wilson, James. Boy
Wonder Oncologist.

326
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,926
You know him?

327
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,301
You know, in some
cultures, it's considered

328
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,763
almost rude for one
friend to spy on another.

329
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:40,239
Of course, in Swedish, the word "friend"
can also be translated as "limping twerp."

330
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,679
Did your pager really just go off, or
are you ditching the conversation?

331
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,274
Why can't both be true? Come on.

332
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,845
<i>Solid, noncystic
mass on the left ovary.</i>

333
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,913
Five-by-three centimeters.

334
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,925
Central necrosis.

335
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,952
The only question is whether
she dies in two months or three.

336
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,964
God. You were right.

337
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,763
There's nothing we can do for her here.
Might as well put her back on the street.

338
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,767
Unless it's not cancer.

339
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,603
- Ah, you're joking.
- Well, hard not to.

340
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,666
Nothing funnier than cancer.

341
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,377
<i>What if it’s a tuberculoma?
She's living out on</i>

342
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,512
<i>the streets, breathing
all kinds of crap 24-7.</i>

343
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,495
The odds are, she's got T.B. Why can't she
have a nice, benign growth to go with it?

344
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,456
A solid mass on her ovary.
Ovarian cancer's way more likely.

345
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,892
You're right. It's
not even close.

346
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,361
Start her on I.N.H.,
rifampin and streptomycin.

347
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,989
But that's the treatment
for a tuberculoma.

348
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,797
And what is the treatment
for advanced ovarian cancer?

349
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,631
Pine box.

350
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:58,148
<i>Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine.
Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine.</i>

351
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:01,619
What are you giving me?
A second dose of antibiotics.

352
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:06,182
If you've got a
tuberculoma, it should help.

353
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,660
I don't have a
tuberculoma, do I?

354
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,530
Probably not.

355
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,202
Hey, listen. I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

356
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,306
I'm sorry I lied to you.

357
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,475
<i>I took too much
insulin on purpose.</i>

358
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,543
I really wanted
a place to sleep.

359
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,656
Were you ever married, Victoria?

360
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,464
But in the comic, it— Well, it's a
comic. Comics are just made up.

361
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,701
So who’s James?

362
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,210
<i>Is he real, or did
you make him up?</i>

363
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,512
He's real.

364
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,642
Can I help you find him?

365
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:13,082
<i>Oh, the— the light's bright.</i>

366
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,253
<i>It's getting brighter—
Oh— Ow! Oh!</i>

367
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,297
Hey, take it easy.
Everything's fine.

368
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:22,096
Mr. Fury wants to hurt
me! Please help me!

369
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,432
Doctor! Wait, wait, wait.

370
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,098
Hold on, hold on.
Please turn off the light!

371
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,664
Please! Oh, God!

372
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,678
All right, hold on, Victoria.

373
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,044
Hold on. Take it
easy. Everything's fine.

374
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,811
- It's burning!
- Everything's fine, Victoria.

375
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,749
It's burning! Hold on.

376
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,947
I'm burning! Take
a sip, take a sip.

377
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,356
It's poison! You gave me poison!

378
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,360
Hold on.

379
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,226
Take it easy.

380
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,123
Hey, turn off that damn light!

381
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,328
<i>Help me, please!</i>

382
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:02,808
Take it easy. Take it easy. The bad guys
can't get you here. I've got you covered.

383
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,606
But Mr. Fury's not the bad guy.

384
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,671
I'm the bad guy. It's
me. I'm the bad guy.

385
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,855
It's not a tuberculoma.

386
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,686
Can't be.

387
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:23,161
I didn't know the biopsy was
back. Her temperature's 105.

388
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,223
The treatment's not
working. It's cancer.

389
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,290
She's dying.

390
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,998
105. <i>Good news.</i>

391
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:36,167
It's a tuberculoma. How do you
figure that? Her temp's through the roof.

392
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,269
<i>The lab results from the biopsy.
It's definitely a tuberculoma.</i>

393
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,948
So, we're right
about the diagnosis,

394
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,547
and the treatment for
that diagnosis is killing her.

395
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,953
Perfect.

396
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,963
<i>The lab checked the
biopsy again, twice.</i>

397
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,966
Well, a tuberculoma doesn't
give you a temperature of 105.

398
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,059
Then it's a tuberculoma
and something else.

399
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,299
The "something else" is
gonna melt her brain. Poach.

400
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,198
Better metaphor.

401
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,642
<i>A fever that high
has to be bacterial.</i>

402
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,546
- Maybe the bowel got nicked in the biopsy.
<i>- I</i> did the biopsy. No nick.

403
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,161
- She could have picked up
an infection on the streets.
- She didn't have a fever when I admitted her.

404
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,981
<i>The Prozac we gave
her could have triggered</i>

405
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:24,122
<i>serotonin syndrome, which
would explain the fever.</i>

406
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,935
- No. Jefferson put her on Prozac
and it wasn't a problem.
- She probably never took it!

407
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,259
Most likely, they saw her one time and
dumped her out of the E.R. with a scrip.

408
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:34,892
- Oh, just like you were gonna do!
- Okay, you two. Grab some scalpels
and settle this like doctors.

409
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,909
<i>Send blood and urine
cultures and get a chest X-ray.</i>

410
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,923
Fine, take her off the
Prozac and put her

411
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:43,067
on Bromocryptene for
the serotonin syndrome.

412
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,468
<i>Might wanna get her in an
ice bath as well, assuming we</i>

413
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:47,842
<i>want her to live long enough
to see those test results.</i>

414
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,476
I said I was sorry.

415
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,513
Your fever's 105. If we
don't bring it down fast...

416
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,650
Foreman, why are
you doing this to me?

417
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,627
I'm saving your life.

418
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,242
No, don't make me go in

419
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:07,723
there, please. Don't
make me do it, please!

420
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,360
I don't wanna go!

421
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,200
Come on. You can do this.

422
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,889
<i>Please!</i>

423
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,057
Seventeen-year-old female
presents with abrasions

424
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:42,300
and apparent trauma
injury to her wrist.

425
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,360
<i>Dr. House?</i> Continue.

426
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,407
You're reading a comic book.

427
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,967
And you're calling attention to
your bosom by wearing a low-cut top.

428
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,749
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were
having a "state the obvious" contest.

429
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,750
I'm competitive by nature.

430
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,753
I thought you were supposed to
be listening to our patient histories.

431
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,040
No, I'm supposed to
be teaching you. If I can

432
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,258
do that without listening,
more power to me.

433
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,850
Seventeen-year-old female...

434
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,555
If this guy's supposed to
have universal power over

435
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:13,024
all gravity, how come
his hair won't stay down?

436
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,033
That's just stupid.

437
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,036
<i>- She fell off her horse</i>
<i>while riding in the county fair.</i>
- No, she didn't.

438
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,598
She fell off the steps of her beach house.
You must have gone to the wrong room.

439
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,900
Hard to believe that
one patient could slip past

440
00:27:24,924 --> 00:27:27,408
Cuddy and get herself
admitted with a sprained wrist.

441
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,914
Two seems almost
impossible. What room?

442
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,042
Room 2106.

443
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,614
Patients lie, but usually
only one lie at a time.

444
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,623
How much does she weigh?

445
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,683
- It's her wrist, not her
weight— - Poundage, ladies.

446
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,060
- And by-the-by, what color's her nose?
- She's thin.

447
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,690
- Flesh tone?
- What does this have to do
with her wrist?

448
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,201
Almost nothing.

449
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,639
She's either under ninety pounds
or she has a red nose. I gotta go.

450
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,732
What's wrong with her?

451
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,607
That would be telling.

452
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,477
Oh, I am just too nice.

453
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,413
It starts with "C."

454
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,414
<i>- Urine cultures are negative.</i>
- So is the chest X-ray.

455
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,985
- I assume there's a positive coming.
- Lumbar punctures reveal
elevated proteins and white counts.

456
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,496
C.S.F. cultures? Still brewing.

457
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,659
Nothing on gram stain.
It looks like meningitis.

458
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,067
<i>We know it's definitely an
infection, and we know where it is.</i>

459
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,333
Well, meningitis
is nice and simple.

460
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,342
Get her in isolation and
start her on Ceftriaxone.

461
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,901
Either she gets
better, or she dies.

462
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,705
Let me know which one happens.

463
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,583
Oh, my God! She was sedated.

464
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,403
<i>- It must have worn off.
- I did it myself a half hour ago.</i>

465
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,419
I'll check the nurse's station.

466
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,989
Calendraica.

467
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,308
She's gonna die out there.

468
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,550
You don't walk out of a room with
10 milligrams of Haldol in your system.

469
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,561
You don't walk at all. It was
10 milligrams! I gave it to her.

470
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:26,065
It doesn't matter! Bacterial
meningitis— highly contagious.

471
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,465
If she is out of the
hospital, we are <i>so</i> liable.

472
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,299
Not to worry. She'll be dead
before she can kill anybody.

473
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,773
Security tape confirms it. She
stole some clothes and she's gone.

474
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,605
Wrong coat. The cape's in
the closet. I had it cleaned.

475
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,776
- Funny.
- You gonna save her?

476
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,787
In her comics, Mr. Fury
lives in Sloan Harbor.

477
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:52,120
The night she came in, she was
at a rave at 1408 Sloan Street.

478
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,024
You've been reading.
My, how you've changed.

479
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,289
<i>You are a doctor.
Do what doctors do.</i>

480
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:01,823
Pick up the phone, dial 911, and a
cop on the other end does what cops do...

481
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,460
<i>and finds the missing person.</i>

482
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:08,371
I assume the rest of you have
doctor things to do. I know <i>you</i> do.

483
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,705
<i>- Cacchi-Ricci Disease.</i>
- Do you even know what that is?

484
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,714
Or are you just guessing
everything that starts with "C"?

485
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:19,343
The kidney problems could result
in weight loss. Cacchi. C-A-C...

486
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,353
Oh, geez, she's
going alphabetically.

487
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,980
Doctor, why are you
wearing that bird pin?

488
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,015
It sets off my eyes.

489
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,161
Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House. What
brings you to the hospital?

490
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,994
My wrist. How did that happen?

491
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:38,094
I was riding the Ferris wheel, and
this huge seagull flew right at me.

492
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,036
How horrifying.

493
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:43,041
<i>I swung my arm at the
bird, but I hit the Ferris wheel.</i>

494
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,508
She's making it all up?

495
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,674
- No, her wrist really does hurt.
- I'm not lying.

496
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:54,845
Of course you are. You have no idea
what happened. You have no memory.

497
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,859
Korsakoff's syndrome.

498
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,745
Her brain is damaged
by excessive drinking or

499
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:04,693
insufficient diet, pretty
obviously the latter.

500
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,528
<i>She has no new
memories, no new ideas.</i>

501
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,534
Can't even process <i>that</i> idea.

502
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,230
So her brain fills the gaps as
best it can using visual clues.

503
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,240
<i>The horse on your shirt
led her to the riding accident,</i>

504
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,004
<i>and the surf scene on your
clipboard led her to the beach.</i>

505
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,671
"Korsakoff" doesn't
start with a "C."

506
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,181
I didn't say "C."

507
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,183
Or did I?

508
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,915
Lesson to be learned— treat everybody as if
they have Korsakoff's. We all lie anyway.

509
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,333
<i>Give her thiamine right away.
She'll bounce back pretty quickly.</i>

510
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,225
And then get her to eat
some cake and ice cream.

511
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,558
Yes?

512
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,565
Did you need to be so
cruel? I think she's crying.

513
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,107
Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House.
What happened to your wrist?

514
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,370
There was this weird
old guy. He had a cane.

515
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,639
See? It's like it
never happened.

516
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,580
Perfect forgiveness.

517
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,153
Pulse is rapid. You got a temp?

518
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,032
Don't know. She's warm, but— Might be
something to look into. She has meningitis.

519
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,958
Sorry. I was more worried about
her heart blowing up. Pulse is 150.

520
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,790
Rhythm regular? Yeah.

521
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,127
Ready? One, two, three.

522
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,758
- Where'd you find her?
- Battlefield State Park.

523
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,427
She narrow complex? <i>Uh-huh.</i>

524
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,940
- She wasn't at Sloan?
- She was just passed out on the grass.

525
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,806
Foreman. I need Foreman.

526
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:29,379
All right. Supraventricular tachycardia.
Get me adenosine, one milligram, I.V. push.

527
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,440
Right away. Thank you.

528
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,925
Hang in there.

529
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,165
<i>Her arrhythmia's stabilized.</i>

530
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:52,330
Doesn't make sense. What would push
her heart rate over 150? Dehydration?

531
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,101
- Fever?
- Unlikely. By themselves,
neither one would do it.

532
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,019
We must be wrong about the meningitis.
Maybe it's structural heart disease.

533
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:01,275
Her heart rate dropped when
you administered the adenosine.

534
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,180
In two seconds.

535
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,480
It's still meningitis.

536
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,852
<i>If it is, with the delay in treatment,
she's— she's got almost no chance.</i>

537
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,289
Start the treatment.

538
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,129
Read the report. I found
her lying on the grass.

539
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:22,133
You should read my reports.
I make up stuff all the time.

540
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,795
What really happened?

541
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,862
Well, since it's you...

542
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,502
I found her lying on the grass.

543
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,648
Wow.

544
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,843
That is a great-looking gun.

545
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,284
It's not a gun. It's a Taser.

546
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,822
It's so cool-looking.
What does it do?

547
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,449
Fire about 60,000 volts?

548
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,825
At least that's what it would take
to jack someone's heart up to 150.

549
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,330
Okay, okay.

550
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:57,358
Let's just say I tell you what happened.
It stays between you and me. Right?

551
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,071
I found her lying on the grass.

552
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,871
Fine.

553
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,538
Don't tell me.

554
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,843
Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.

555
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:15,252
<i>Dr. Wharton to the research lab.
Dr. Wharton to the research lab.</i>

556
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,921
I watch a lot of cop shows.

557
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,934
The good news is, the heart rate
thing is not connected to her condition.

558
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,154
<i>Well, then she's dying,
'cause the meningitis</i>

559
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:34,367
<i>treatment isn't helping
her. She's getting worse.</i>

560
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,074
Well, that brings
us to the bad news.

561
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:40,772
The cop Tasered her.

562
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,873
Jerk. Probably couldn't get
to his real gun fast enough.

563
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,749
First time he hit
her in the thigh...

564
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,947
<i>and she just kept
going, like it was nothing.</i>

565
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,513
Right about here.

566
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,265
She didn't feel the Taser.

567
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,581
Localized numbness?
Yeah, in that one spot.

568
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,746
The diabetes?

569
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,983
I don't think so.

570
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,989
<i>Well, no alcohol. Not
entrapment syndrome.</i>

571
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,895
<i>Can't be a vitamin deficiency.</i>

572
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,957
<i>We can't chase down
every sensory neuropathy.</i>

573
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,039
Is that where she bit you? Yeah.

574
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,974
What the hell!

575
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,286
Can't get angry if
you don't feel anything.

576
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,993
<i>First, there's
localized numbness,</i>

577
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,193
then sensitivity to light,

578
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,632
<i>disorientation, paranoia,</i>

579
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:13,365
ineffectiveness of sedatives,
and then hydrophobia.

580
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,831
Fear of water.

581
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,578
Rabies.

582
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:24,582
There have only been, what,
10 cases in the last 20 years?

583
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:28,677
<i>Yeah, that's because non homeless people,
when they get bitten, they get shots.</i>

584
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,346
There were bats.

585
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,004
She's dying.

586
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,543
There's no treatment.

587
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,604
How much time does she have?

588
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,615
A day. Maybe two.

589
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,380
And if you don't get your shot
in the next, say, three hours,

590
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,719
I'm gonna have to make
another affirmative action hire.

591
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,050
Come on.

592
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,197
<i>Do it.</i>

593
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,870
You want me to talk to her?

594
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,674
And say what?

595
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:32,912
"There's some experimental
treatment that's not gonna work"? No.

596
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,654
"But don't worry, we can
make you comfortable"?

597
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,123
Doesn't matter.

598
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,923
Now she's gonna
die in that room.

599
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,930
Yeah.

600
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,932
That's what you say to her.

601
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,833
Keep that there
and rest for a minute.

602
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

603
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,266
Tell House I need to
go out for about an hour.

604
00:37:57,342 --> 00:38:00,005
She may not have that long.

605
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,407
I don't want her to die alone.

606
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,778
You're going to find James.

607
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,914
I'm gonna try.

608
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,298
Well, I must say, he's
done a lot with the place.

609
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,637
Hello?

610
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,669
Hey.

611
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,466
This is it.

612
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,774
Man. No one's been
in here for a long time.

613
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,119
It's gotta be James.

614
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,523
Maybe there's another address.

615
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,527
That's not James.

616
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,805
Paul.

617
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,777
Paul Furia.

618
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,538
Mr. Fury.

619
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,880
Her husband.

620
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,545
Then who’s James?

621
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,351
Her kid.

622
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:10,241
<i>A w, I just wanna eat you
up. You're so delicious!</i>

623
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,245
Aw, look at me.

624
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:18,249
You're just like your papa.
Look at you! Just like your dad.

625
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,148
<i>Foreman.</i>

626
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,484
Foreman?

627
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,549
They're dead.

628
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:34,397
That car crash two years ago...

629
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,928
She broke her arm,
and they were killed.

630
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,305
She was driving.

631
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,501
James.

632
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,938
No.

633
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:19,307
It's Paul. <i>Paul?</i>

634
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,412
You've come to take me.

635
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,541
No.

636
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,711
I've come to forgive you.

637
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,627
<i>It wasn’t your fault.</i>

638
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,894
I'm so sorry.

639
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,063
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

640
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,370
I know.

641
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,344
<i>It's okay, Victoria.</i>

642
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,404
<i>It's okay.</i>

643
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,098
Oh.

644
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,158
You followed me?

645
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,438
No.

646
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:24,601
You were wearing rain boots today, but
you were parked in the underground garage,

647
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:29,739
so the only reason you'd need boots
was if you were hitting the streets.

648
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,010
I followed you.

649
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,451
Didn't we have a conversation
about friendship? Yeah.

650
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,285
I had some follow-up questions.

651
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,351
I've met your parents
and your brother.

652
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,795
I have two brothers.

653
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,565
Why wouldn't you tell
me— It wasn't relevant.

654
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,970
Why not? Because he's
not in my life anymore.

655
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,299
Well, that's relevant.

656
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,742
This was the last
place I saw him.

657
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,979
Nine years ago.

658
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,925
I don't even know if he's alive.

659
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,939
That's some bad hat, Harry.
