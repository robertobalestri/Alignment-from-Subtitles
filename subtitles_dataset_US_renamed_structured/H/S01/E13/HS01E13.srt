1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,695
It's all about the tongue,
man. You stick it in their mouth,

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,577
but not all the way.

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,579
They like that?
Dude, they love it.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,976
What are you doing? Climbing.

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:25,017
Just deep enough to lick her teeth: slow,
one at a time, like you're painting them.

6
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,062
This girl Rachel,
she's a junior.

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,565
- She's experienced.
- Mom says I gotta be home by 5:00.

8
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:36,070
Just chill, okay? And hop the
fence before someone sees you.

9
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:46,044
Are you sure this is okay?
Dave's mom's a Realtor.

10
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,580
If it's for sale and
empty, it's a clubhouse.

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,950
And if you say
anything, you're dead.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,254
I told them you were cool.
These are very serious dudes.

13
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,387
Come on.

14
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,762
Cub Scout meeting's
down the street, boys.

15
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,668
What a loser. Lame.

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,765
<i>- Gabe's cool, man. He's one of us.
- He better be.</i>

17
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,274
Uh, I'm not thirsty.

18
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,248
- What's this?
<i>- Club business, little man.</i>

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,983
- What shall we ask?
- Put your hands on.

20
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:36,697
O dark spirit, will any of
us die in the year to come?

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,272
- You're moving it.
- Put your hands back. Now.

22
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,975
Who among us will die?

23
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,817
"G,"

24
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,554
"A"...

25
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,497
Oh, man.

26
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,693
"B,"

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,242
"E."

28
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,643
<i>"Gabe." That blows.</i>

29
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,513
That's it. We're
going to the hospital.

30
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,192
No, Mom. I'm too tired.

31
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:41,187
Come on, sweetie. You've had
a fever for almost a week now.

32
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,600
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

33
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,573
Oh, Gabe. Are you okay?

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,168
<i>Are you okay?
Baby, what's wrong?</i>

35
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:02,046
I'm dying.

36
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,692
<i>Twelve-year-old male.
Spiking fever, congested chest,</i>

37
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,961
coughing up green
sputum, pain in breathing.

38
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:59,268
Baffling, though I vaguely recall a
disease called "meunomia"? "Pneumania"?

39
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,099
But his chest X-ray and
C.T. scan show an atypical

40
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:04,573
pattern for pneumonia.
Pneumonia! That's it.

41
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,739
Just a guess here, but
his parents big donors?

42
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,273
No infiltrate, just
enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

43
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,844
Tiny unicorns goring his
bronchial tubes would be cooler,

44
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,655
and the way you're ignoring the question—
Wow, they're extremely big donors.

45
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,120
He's not responding to
cefuroxime, his pulse ox is

46
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,562
dropping much faster than
it should for pneumonia,

47
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,623
and plus he's got
an odd little rash.

48
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,102
Excessive irritation. He's 12.
He's on auto-stroke. On his arm.

49
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,766
Papular lesion, one centimeter,
on top of a long, thin scab.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,074
Ah, you need a dermatologist. If it's
dry, keep it wet. If it's wet, keep it dry.

51
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,344
If it's not supposed to be there,
cut it off. I never could master all that.

52
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,010
There you are.

53
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,419
Were you scared? It's
okay. You're home now.

54
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,423
Fine.

55
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,083
Cuddy.

56
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:59,963
- As a special favor to you— -
No. Admit it. I got you with the rash.

57
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:05,370
The rash is a total snooze, unless
it's connected to the pneumonia,

58
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,699
then it's party time.

59
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,507
Purulent sputum,
dyspnea, rhonchi bilaterally.

60
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,985
What kind of pneumonia causes this
kind of rash? Legionnaire's disease.

61
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,892
Usually means industrial
ventilation systems,

62
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,490
convention centers.
He's 12 years old.

63
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,823
Send off a urine antigen and
check if he's joined the Elks. Next?

64
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,442
Fungal.

65
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:30,330
Excellent. Maybe the
lodge went spelunking.

66
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,492
- Chlamydia pneumonia.
- Twelve-year-olds don't have sex.

67
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
Their mistake.

68
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,401
That's it? Other possibilities?

69
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,054
What if we're thinking
about this backwards?

70
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,911
The rash came first,
caused the pneumonia. Nice.

71
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,367
Rickettsial. Tick bite.
Nymphal ticks are out

72
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,643
now. They're
bloodthirsty little bastards.

73
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,414
- Rash would be more pustular.
- Not always,
and there's only one rash, which fits.

74
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,661
New Jersey, it's most
likely Lyme disease.

75
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:57,685
All right. Let's
keep him on fluids...

76
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,817
and the cefuroxime to be safe.

77
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,886
Biopsy that rash.

78
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,058
And take another history. Even if
we don't learn what's causing this,

79
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,931
we definitely need to know if
twelve-year-olds are getting any action.

80
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,668
- What are you doing now?
- We're collecting fluids from the rash.

81
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,974
Why? They know what
they're doing, Jeffrey.

82
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,346
Oh, great endorsement coming
from the woman who thought

83
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,483
it was a nasty cold. If I
had had him last week...

84
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,678
This isn't helping.

85
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,383
<i>We're checking to see if
your son has a tick bite.</i>

86
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,690
Gabe, have you been camping recently,
playing sports outside, anything like that?

87
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,696
I'm not that good at sports.

88
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,790
- No hanging out anywhere new,
strange places?
<i>- We've been through this.</i>

89
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,132
We don't let him run wild
through the neighborhood, right?

90
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,242
Okay. This might
be a bit delicate.

91
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,245
We need to know if
you're sexually active.

92
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:54,204
I beg your pardon?

93
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,807
- Mr. Reilich, we need to— - No.

94
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,587
Nothing like that.

95
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,354
We've gotta get another C.T.
scan, check his lungs again.

96
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,418
- Third floor, right?
- Yeah, Radiology is...

97
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:11,260
Sorry, medical personnel only.

98
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,170
Where's the machine?
Well, we passed it, actually.

99
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:21,106
A little tension in the room back
there. Thought you could use a break.

100
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,372
Your dad's a pretty...
high-powered guy.

101
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:30,008
Yeah. He was an air force
test pilot. Real <i>Top Gun</i> stuff.

102
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,018
Flew Mach 3.

103
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,077
Hard to deal with sometimes?

104
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,716
Guess I'm more
like my mom. Listen.

105
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,787
I promise to keep my mouth
shut, but I need to know.

106
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:47,027
You definitely haven't had
any sexual contact of any kind?

107
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,035
I wish.

108
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,094
You know what?

109
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,198
Girls like the cool guys
now, but give it a few years.

110
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,709
They start liking
the smart guys.

111
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,075
You'll be all right.

112
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,276
Can you keep a secret?

113
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,344
I have to. It's my job.

114
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,892
I'm cursed. I'm not kidding.

115
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,761
This séance thing the kids
did? It spelled out my name.

116
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,164
Said I was gonna die.

117
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,762
First name and last name? We've got a
Gabe upstairs who's very old, very sick.

118
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,707
No. It's me. I have
the worst luck.

119
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,939
One time I broke this mirror,

120
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,481
the next week my
parents got separated.

121
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,449
My parents split up too.

122
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,251
Every kid feels like
it's his fault. It never is.

123
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,309
So, what about the
rest of the stuff? Any

124
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,589
playing outside your
parents don't know about?

125
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,594
Anything like that?

126
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,359
Maybe you were somewhere
you weren't supposed to be?

127
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,493
<i>Triage nurse, pick
up line 274.</i> Oh, man.

128
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:59,335
Gabe, it's important.

129
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:06,605
<i>A secret club. What's the
secret— they're all morons?</i>

130
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,707
He fell on something in the attic,
scraped his arm, got the rash the next day.

131
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,879
Said it smelled
really moldy up there.

132
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,948
- Fungal pneumonia
without the cave. Clever.
- I'm gonna get a sample.

133
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:25,195
Dr. Chase, you
have a few moments?

134
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,868
Sorry, I've gotta go.

135
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,806
These young doctors. It's like
they don't care about people.

136
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,643
- No manners.
- My fault, probably.

137
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,516
That's an interesting accent
you have there. I'd say Czech...

138
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,680
with about 30 years of Aussie.

139
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,691
You have quite an ear.

140
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,250
You're Chase's dad.

141
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,923
Hard to miss—you know, the big
hug and how happy he was to see you.

142
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,477
Need a consult. With a patient.

143
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,036
Urgent doctor stuff.

144
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,983
<i>Twenty-six-year-old male,
sudden loss of the ability to speak—</i>

145
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,615
Just because <i>you</i> got out of clinic duty
doesn't mean everybody did. To his father.

146
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,922
Differential diagnosis? Chase?

147
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,428
Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out.

148
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,398
Dad say why he was
here? See? <i>You</i> asked.

149
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,765
Dad comes 5,000 miles, you're
more curious than Junior is.

150
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,805
<i>Can’t just be about the divorce.</i>

151
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,934
It's been 15 years, and Mom's been dead for
10 of them. You think Daddy murdered her?

152
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,070
You want to get to the bottom of
this, you're doing it exactly right:

153
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,552
Don't talk to the people
involved. Drag your buddy

154
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:50,811
away from work for some
pointless speculation.

155
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,444
You want to know how two
chemicals interact, do you ask them?

156
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,150
No. They're gonna lie through
their lying little chemical teeth.

157
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,159
Throw them in a
beaker and apply heat.

158
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,593
Even I don't like you.

159
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,154
You know, words can hurt.

160
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
guys. I don't care that you're up here.

161
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:28,552
- You a cop?
- Doctor. I'm treating Gabe Reilich.

162
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,286
- He said he fell over near some pipes?
- Yeah, over there.

163
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,261
- What, here?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:42,262
Any of you guys been feeling
sick lately? Rash, cold, anything?

165
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,334
No.

166
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,676
Oh, crap. He <i>is</i> a cop! Damn it!

167
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,635
<i>He fell on it— Some
weird kind of insulation.</i>

168
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,471
It's old. House
was built in the '60s.

169
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,536
What's it made of? Felt,
fibers of—what, cotton?

170
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,385
Sorry. Forgotten how
funny your dad was.

171
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,083
- Not as funny as you.
- High praise.

172
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,025
I know how protective
kids can be of their parents.

173
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,259
<i>Not cotton. Animal hair.</i>

174
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,595
Get me the C.T. scan.

175
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,971
First, find the name of the
company that made the insulation,

176
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:05,417
and second, tell me what I'm seeing
that makes me want to short their stock.

177
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,649
Uh, enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

178
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,020
<i>- Peribronchial thickening.</i>
- Pleural effusions.

179
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,050
Less obvious, more scary.

180
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,529
Well, the mediastinum
doesn't look right.

181
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,089
Slightly widened.

182
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,658
Oh, God.

183
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,330
It can be transmitted
through infected animal hair.

184
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,890
But the Gram's stain would
have shown— No. The cefuroxime

185
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:30,070
would have killed some
of it, clouded the result.

186
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,942
We've gotta get
this kid on levaquin.

187
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,245
What does he have?

188
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,880
Anthrax. This house
belong to old man Hussein?

189
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,625
Maybe he <i>is</i> cursed.

190
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,507
<i>Anthrax. So, what—you think
there were terrorists in that attic?</i>

191
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,808
It's a naturally
occurring bacteria.

192
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,246
- We believe it was in the insulation.
- How sick is he?

193
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,179
<i>Anthrax is very dangerous,
but we've caught it early.</i>

194
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,982
<i>He's on levaquin. It's the
best antibiotic we have.</i>

195
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,684
Lisa, you buy this? Jeff,
you've helped our hospital a lot.

196
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,434
I wouldn't have assigned
Dr. House to your

197
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,320
case if I didn't have
every confidence in him.

198
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,364
- Then who's this guy?
- Jeffrey!

199
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,386
There's all these weird
diseases that can cause

200
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,390
a rash. What about
Ieishmaniasis or filariasis?

201
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,529
Where'd you hear about those?
Internet. I did some research.

202
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,234
Well, those are very rare conditions.
Oh, and anthrax grows along the interstate?

203
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,777
<i>Leishmaniasis doesn't cause
pneumonia, and filariasis—</i>

204
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,370
Just look into everything.
This is my son, all right?

205
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,552
And I'm gonna stay on
top of you until I know

206
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:44,611
he's safe. I wouldn't
expect anything else.

207
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,219
Everyone's a doctor.

208
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,197
Breathe, baby. It's okay.
Breathe. I need you to breathe.

209
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,986
His breathing—
It's on the inhale.

210
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,697
What does that mean? It
means his airway's closing up.

211
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,104
Is the anthrax doin' it?

212
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:11,543
All right. Hold still, Gabe. This is
gonna be a little uncomfortable.

213
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,312
<i>We've got you. It's okay.</i>

214
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,224
- Nodules in his throat.
- Airway's occluded?

215
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:30,320
- We've got to intubate. Ativan!
- Pushing 3 c.c.'s.

216
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:40,964
Airway's too tight.

217
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:43,465
What's wrong? What's
wrong? No, you're killing him!

218
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,890
Jeffrey! Let them do their job.

219
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,741
Airway's too tight.
Get me a smaller tube.

220
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,645
- We're traching.
- Smaller tube.

221
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,689
- His lips are cyanotic.
- He's not breathing.

222
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,351
Foreman, we're traching.
No. I can do it. I'll get it.

223
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,191
<i>- Foreman, you're not getting through.
- He's not getting air.</i>

224
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,789
- We have to trach him right now.
- No, I can do it.

225
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,266
<i>Betadine.</i>

226
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,432
I'm doing this.

227
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,805
Got it.

228
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,485
He's okay.

229
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,531
<i>Allergic reaction
to the antibiotics?</i>

230
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,820
I don't think so. We
switched him to rifampin,

231
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,797
and there was no
change in the swelling.

232
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,878
We should try another
antibiotic. You really

233
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,704
think he's allergic
to <i>two</i> antibiotics?

234
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,241
I wanna know what
Dr. Chase thinks.

235
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,836
It's possible he's allergic—
Oh! I'm sorry. Not you.

236
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:56,371
Understandable mistake.
The other Dr. Chase.

237
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,722
<i>Boy gets anthrax and happens
to be allergic to two antibiotics.</i>

238
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,228
Hate to step on anybody's toes, but is it
possible your guys got this one wrong?

239
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,732
The rash is classic
anthrax. Except the color.

240
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,495
The rash hasn't turned black
yet. No necrosis, no anthrax.

241
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,061
<i>Necrosis can theoretically
take as long as two weeks.</i>

242
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,205
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

243
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:27,680
<i>Guys, it's not a
competition. It's a diagnosis.</i>

244
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,547
Okay. Who thinks Junior wins?

245
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,086
Four to one. It's not anthrax.

246
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,853
So we start over. What's changed?
What do the nodules tell us?

247
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,891
- Sarcoidosis.
- Excellent. Send an ACE level.

248
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:49,527
<i>If it comes back positive,
put him on methotrexate.</i>

249
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:54,472
<i>We ran some tests and the
results point toward sarcoidosis.</i>

250
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,237
It makes the body's
tissues swell up.

251
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,145
It seems to have gone after Gabriel's
skin and lungs and given him this fever.

252
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,978
Doctor.

253
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,383
We don't know what causes it.

254
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,392
But you're sure he has this one? We
have a world-renowned doctor consulting.

255
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,328
- He's convinced this is sarcoidosis.
- Is it treatable?

256
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:23,063
Very, actually. See, this is I.V.
methotrexate. It's an anti-inflammatory.

257
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,162
It should make all the swelling
go down and, uh, get you all better.

258
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,333
Stop.

259
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,302
My God, it's black.

260
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,148
Necrosis.

261
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,870
It's definitely anthrax,
and it definitely <i>can't</i>

262
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,348
be anthrax. It doesn't
cause throat nodules.

263
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:47,291
Only explanation is, this kid's
got anthrax <i>and</i> sarcoidosis.

264
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,920
Right— Two incredibly
rare diseases...

265
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,524
- just happening to strike at once.
- Unless you've got a better theory.

266
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,659
Anthrax plus an
allergic reaction.

267
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>Call the</i> Lancet, <i>because that's
one bizarre allergic reaction.</i>

268
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,866
Come on. There's no reason
you <i>both</i> can't be wrong.

269
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,377
<i>It's not allergy, but it's
not coincidence either.</i>

270
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,640
Disease number one set
off disease number two.

271
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,450
Anthrax weakened
his immune system.

272
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:11,616
<i>And triggered a
dormant sarcoidosis.</i>

273
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,246
Keep him on antibiotics
for the anthrax, and start the

274
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,713
methotrexate for the
sarcoidosis. See what happens.

275
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,849
Fine.

276
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,894
Better go with him. Make sure he
doesn't snap and hurt somebody.

277
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,897
<i>Yeah, but y-you're treating
him for both diseases.</i>

278
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,839
We're covering all
the bases. What—throw

279
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:35,135
everything against the
wall and see what sticks?

280
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,142
Works for spaghetti.

281
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,230
A-Are you being
funny? Apparently not.

282
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,739
You know why I give
money to this hospital?

283
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,242
It's the only way to
get attention. See this?

284
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,711
Is this a magic trick? 'Cause I
am a total David Copperfield fan.

285
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,202
Although I thought that
tornado of fire— that seemed a

286
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:18,945
little fake. Pain in the wrist.
It won't go away for months.

287
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,633
Six doctors' brilliant
conclusion is to take it

288
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:24,184
easy. I write a check,
name goes on a plaque,

289
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,626
and 48 hours later I've got two M.R.I.'s, a
bone scan and a diagnosis: carpal tunnel.

290
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,630
I'm in surgery that afternoon.

291
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:36,260
Fascinating story. Have you
thought of adapting it for the stage?

292
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,772
I love my— Look at
me. I love my son.

293
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,955
I love him more than anything
else in the world. Start paying

294
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:44,119
attention to this case, or I'm
gonna make things miserable...

295
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,154
Go to your son's room.
Not until you get your ass...

296
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,306
There's a problem.

297
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,624
- What is it?
- I don't know.

298
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,450
Skin lesions are
spreading all over his body.

299
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,012
They're opening up, and the
fatty tissues are oozing out.

300
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,789
He'll be septic in a matter
of days. Death by dermatitis.

301
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,353
- Where's Robert?
- Uh, he has clinic duty this morning.

302
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,452
No, he doesn't. I
rescheduled you guys so you'd

303
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:44,392
be free. Yeah, but he
re-rescheduled himself.

304
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,903
It doesn't hurt yet. Keep going.

305
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,448
You page me?

306
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,450
No, I don't need you. Come on.

307
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,316
<i>We all need help now and
again. You're getting a consult.</i>

308
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:07,653
- Okay. We've got new skin lesions,
bigger and uglier. What would cause that?
- My hand hurts.

309
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,910
What if his body
worked so hard attacking

310
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:12,357
the anthrax that it
started attacking itself?

311
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,798
- Autoimmune.
- Wouldn't present this aggressively.

312
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:19,134
- It's not likely, but it is possible.
- What, in a twelve-year-old male?

313
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:24,041
- This isn't about me, is it?
- Gabe's dad found Ieishmaniasis and filariasis
on the Internet yesterday.

314
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,170
- They didn't fit then,
but now they kind of do.
- Sure,

315
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:30,444
except for the nodules, and we're
not working out of Calcutta General.

316
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,975
- Multiple neurofibromatosis.
- You think this is neurological?

317
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,615
The only reason you're thinking autoimmune
is because you're a rheumatologist.

318
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,353
If you were a proctologist,
you'd think rectal cancer.

319
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,861
Gotta go with Senior.

320
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,989
- He literally wrote the book on this one.
- Autoimmune is a big universe.

321
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,035
It could be anything from
scleroderma to Churg-Strauss.

322
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,780
Whatever it is, we should start him
on steroids, keep the swelling down.

323
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,535
A hundred milligrams of cytoxan—
It treats most autoimmunes.

324
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:58,066
<i>Well, give it to him now before the
fat starts dripping out his eyeballs.</i>

325
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,345
Hey, my fingers are numb.

326
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,475
Your watch is on too tight.

327
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,052
You're messing with my
head. Your relationship with

328
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:18,691
your dad is messing with
your ability to do your job.

329
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,791
Only because you made my
dad part of my job. Good point.

330
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,269
You haven't seen him in years, he flies
across the Atlantic to see you— Pacific.

331
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:30,332
- You breeze by him like he's a Hare Krishna
at the airport, don't ask why he's in town.
- It's probably a conference.

332
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,345
Probably.

333
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,088
I was hoping to do this
through sheer manipulation,

334
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:38,282
but if you insist on
talking, fine. Talk.

335
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:44,553
- What did he do to you?
- How would you feel if I interfered
in your personal life?

336
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,856
I'd hate it—that's why I
cleverly have no personal life.

337
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,420
I'm gonna biopsy
his skin lesions.

338
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:56,993
Good thinking. Prove your dad
wrong. That'll solve everything.

339
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,114
Who extubated him? I did.

340
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,556
Temperature's down two degrees,
and the swelling's almost gone.

341
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,560
And his skin looks better too.

342
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,290
Cytoxan is working.

343
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:27,595
- Feeling better, Gabe?
- Yep, a lot.

344
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,864
<i>Dr. Chase, can you
and I have a word?</i>

345
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,141
<i>Your diagnosis is wrong.
No autoimmune disease.</i>

346
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,451
The swelling's probably
just down because we've got

347
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:41,874
him on steroids. It's masking
whatever's really wrong.

348
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,699
A.N.A.'s are unreliable.
Phospholipid antibodies

349
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:47,614
are negative, so no lupus.
Same for Churg-Strauss.

350
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,621
You're arguing with
a rheumatologist.

351
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,716
There's about 20 distinct autoimmune
diseases— Why are you here?

352
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,287
S.L.E. conference.

353
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,592
You were in New York
last year for the scleroderma

354
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:02,597
conference. I didn't
hear anything from you.

355
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,696
Just wanted to say hi this
time. You said it. You're still here.

356
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,841
I miss you.

357
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,506
I was 15 years old when you walked
out. Now you're walking back in?

358
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:18,517
I left your mother.
I didn't leave you.

359
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,109
Mum was living on gin and
tonics. How was I supposed

360
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:23,682
to take care of her? She
wasn't your responsibility.

361
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,885
I know! She was yours.

362
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,798
I'm sorry she died. I'm sorry
you had to deal with that.

363
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,831
But she was falling
apart long before...

364
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,805
I've got to talk to House
about this treatment.

365
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,342
But the patient's
getting better.

366
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,349
In spite of the cytoxan.

367
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:54,012
On the other
hand—getting better.

368
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,022
Cytoxan makes him more
susceptible to infection.

369
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,355
The anthrax could relapse
and be more resistant. Better!

370
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,760
You want a negative test for every
autoimmune disease known to man?

371
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:08,767
- Fine. I'll get 'em.
- Be home by midnight
or you can't have the car this weekend.

372
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,729
You guys talk? Did he
tell you why he's here?

373
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,299
The S.L.E. conference.

374
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:34,018
Going back to the conference?
Afternoon panel. I hope I can stay awake.

375
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,292
I hope you can get in.
You're not registered.

376
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,261
I get it. You had
to make up a lie.

377
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,308
Can't just tell your kid
you're here to see <i>him.</i>

378
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,936
I mean, what father does that?

379
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,886
That little blue dot
under your collar— it's

380
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,610
a tattoo for guiding
radiation treatment.

381
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:04,714
I was looking for it after I saw what you
had for breakfast: brown rice, vegetables.

382
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:10,661
It's a macrobiotic diet— popular with
Hollywood starlets and... cancer patients.

383
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,991
Lungs. Stage IV.

384
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,363
- You look good.
- I'm not.

385
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:25,173
Came to the States to go to
Sloan-Kettering and see Dr. Wilson.

386
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:29,306
- What'd he say?
- Three months.

387
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,350
But you haven't told Robert.

388
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,683
You don't want to burden him,
because you were such a lousy dad.

389
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,188
I'd prefer you not tell him.

390
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,829
Yeah. That's better.

391
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,923
I'll get to see his face when
he reads his dad's obituary.

392
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,629
It's not your business.

393
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,333
I suppose it isn't.

394
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,243
You sure do a lot of tests.

395
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,621
If we figure out exactly
which autoimmune

396
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,313
condition it is, we can
get you better quicker.

397
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,191
Was that your dad before? Yeah.

398
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,560
That's so cool. Do you
guys work together a lot?

399
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,293
Not really.

400
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,494
When can I go home?

401
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,834
We'll see.

402
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:30,171
Looks like you got your
appetite back. That's a good sign.

403
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,973
Want some water? Yes.

404
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,241
- Ah!
- Here you go.

405
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,182
Whoops. That's all
right. Water's cheap.

406
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,590
- Oh, God.
- What?

407
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,224
I can't— I can't move my hand.

408
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,132
<i>Can you squeeze my
fingers for me, Gabe?</i>

409
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,878
<i>He's getting worse. Now his entire
right hand and forearm are paralyzed.</i>

410
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,576
And his fever's back. It's up
over 105. If we don't stop the

411
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,117
nerve deterioration quickly,
he'll be paralyzed for life.

412
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,888
Well, luckily, at this rate that
should only last about a week.

413
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,419
- Okay. So— - I told you we
should get him off the cytoxan.

414
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,956
This is toxic neuropathy.
We've been shoving drugs

415
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,265
into his system for a
disease he doesn't have.

416
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:35,205
- Well, it could be neurological.
- What kind of brain process
would cause a paralyzed hand,

417
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,800
skin lesions and
swollen throat nodules?

418
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:43,110
Robert was right. You said
multiple neurofibromatosis.

419
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,320
Are you saying that for
the chance at a beautiful

420
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,551
family moment, or is there
some medicine involved?

421
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,884
- Mm-mmm. Fits better.
- Too bad.

422
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:54,051
I was hoping for the other reason.
I was gonna go get my camera.

423
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,960
Get a C.T. scan—his
brain this time.

424
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,905
<i>You'd think three copies
would be enough, right?</i>

425
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,171
One's always been
more than enough for me.

426
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,509
Why didn't you tell me that
Rowan Chase was in to see you?

427
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,947
Excuse me.

428
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,578
Ethics, confidentiality—
Does any of this ring a bell?

429
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,047
You could have covered
yourself, called me in

430
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,489
for a consult. It is a
juicy piece of gossip.

431
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,893
You know what happened? I got all
focused on his cancer and lost perspective.

432
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,057
You can't tell Chase, but
I can. What should I do?

433
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,251
This is where I give
you advice and pretend

434
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,467
you're gonna listen
to it. I like this part.

435
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,439
Did Rowan ask you not to
tell? I promised I wouldn't.

436
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,532
My fingers were crossed,
though, so I'm wide open.

437
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,995
I was wrong. This is
the musing-out-loud part.

438
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,273
Do I actually need to
be here? Telling him.

439
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,148
Now, that's got real entertainment
value. Mm. He might even cry.

440
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,948
On the other hand, there
is the do-unto-others thingy.

441
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,014
Well, then I should definitely tell him.
I'd wanna know. You wanna know everything.

442
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,822
There's also the
keeping-your-promises thingy.

443
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:06,388
Oh, you never run out of thingies— like
that blonde thingy you were chatting up.

444
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:10,129
She's the hospital accountant. We
were going over billing procedures.

445
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,366
Double-entry bookkeeping?

446
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,542
What are you gonna do?

447
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,339
Billing procedures. They're
so complicated, aren't they?

448
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,530
You know, parents are never
as bad as kids think they are.

449
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:48,506
If you like my dad
so much, ask him out.

450
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,509
I'd make an excellent
stepmom. I'm very lenient.

451
00:31:56,415 --> 00:32:00,785
He's your father. You
never see him, and he's here.

452
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:04,345
Unless he's done some unspeakable
thing, you should lighten up.

453
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,688
Great. Thanks for the tip.

454
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,694
Okay.

455
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,460
He beat your mom. He beat you.

456
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,528
What did he do?
Really, don't push it.

457
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:27,043
All this hate. It's toxic.

458
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,749
Then stay away.

459
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,887
There's nothing there.

460
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,421
<i>No masses, no
fibrous tangles, nothing.</i>

461
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,467
It's not neurofibromatosis.

462
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,766
Drs. Chase are 0 for 3. Even
when they agree, they're wrong.

463
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,195
So, next, what else could
cause neural damage as

464
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:57,799
- well as all the nodules?
- Berger's disease.

465
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,271
He's never been
out of the country.

466
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,289
Have his parents? They
could have brought it back.

467
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:05,593
- I don't think so.
- It doesn't matter. His lesions are in the
wrong place. His feet are the one clear spot.

468
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,178
- Kid's dad mentioned Ieishmaniasis.
- Yeah, and filariasis.

469
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:14,522
- But the throat nodules still don't fit with that.
- That's two diseases pretty much
exclusive to Southeast Asia.

470
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,967
What if the anthrax didn't
set off the second disease?

471
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:28,029
- We're back at coincidence again?
- No. What if something else
was the trigger?

472
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,041
- Nothing else happened.
- We happened.

473
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:30,873
Antibiotics?

474
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,545
We've been through
this. It's not an allergy.

475
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,205
I gotta pee.

476
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,628
- What did the C.T. scan tell you?
- Nothing.

477
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,670
Ow! Scale from one
to 10— how painful?

478
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,640
Not half as painful as when I punch you
in the face. Don't do that. It'll hurt <i>you.</i>

479
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,371
- Carpal tunnel surgery
obviously didn't work.
- Who are you?

480
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:11,542
The little ones call me Uncle Greg.
Your dad never had carpal tunnel.

481
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,712
You mentioned two obscure diseases to
Dr. Chase. How did you know about them?

482
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:20,919
- I read about them on the Internet.
- What did you search for—"Diseases from Asia
that don't match my son's symptoms"?

483
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,223
- You head about them <i>in</i> Asia.
- I've never been there.

484
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,390
Well, you probably just forgot.
Let me refresh your memory:

485
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,868
some remote, dusty village,
close quarters, at least a year?

486
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,098
- Starting to come back?
- I'm calling Dr. Cuddy.

487
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,766
Excuse me, what does
this have to do with our son?

488
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,072
Your dad's pissed
off. He should be.

489
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,406
Comes here expecting
us to do an extra-good job

490
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,105
because he gives a whole
lot of money to this hospital.

491
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,480
Don't talk to my son like that!

492
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:47,346
Just telling him my
job and my obligation...

493
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,186
Stop! What's going on?

494
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,061
There's only one thing
you guys have gotta do.

495
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,965
<i>Tell the truth, or
your son will die.</i>

496
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,731
How long were you in Asia?

497
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,039
Jeff, it's a simple question.

498
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,109
Two years, in India.

499
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,786
Why would you lie about
something like that? It was '87 and '88.

500
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,831
This, uh...

501
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,563
This guru— I-I thought
he had some answers.

502
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,405
I went to his ashram...

503
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:48,277
and, um, ended up with
no money and no answers.

504
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,850
I was embarrassed. I
didn't want anyone to know.

505
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,187
No.

506
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,685
No. You were a test pilot.

507
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,524
I'm so sorry, Gabe.

508
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,028
What does this have
to do with my son?

509
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,724
Clue number one: If I
were Jesus, curing this

510
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:19,567
kid would be as easy
as turning water into wine.

511
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,342
Demonic possession?
Close, but no wafer.

512
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,182
Clue number two:
Rheumatology Rowan was

513
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:29,355
almost right. It causes
autoimmune symptoms.

514
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,858
- Leprosy?
- Yeah, that's real big
in the Jersey suburbs.

515
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:37,453
It's leprosy. Run a Fite
stain. It'll be positive.

516
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,897
Daddy hung out on the
wrong kind of Indian ashram.

517
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,992
But it's obviously dormant in the
dad. How could the kid catch it?

518
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,504
It's not dormant in
the dad. It's just slow.

519
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,133
Damaged his ulnar nerves. Was
misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.

520
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,168
Never trust doctors.
Run a Fite stain.

521
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,307
<i>No wonder he got anthrax. The
leprosy weakened his immune system.</i>

522
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,911
Vicious circle: The leprosy made
him vulnerable to the anthrax,

523
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,353
and the anthrax treatment
put the leprosy in overdrive.

524
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:10,123
- But the antibiotics we gave him—
they cure leprosy.
- Yeah. That's where the trouble starts.

525
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,892
<i>The antibiotics hit
the nerve strands.</i>

526
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,662
<i>They kill the leprosy bacteria, and
the corpses get tossed into the system.</i>

527
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,001
<i>And as fascinating as our
bodies are, they're also stupid.</i>

528
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,167
They produce antibodies
to beat dead bacteria.

529
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,837
And these aren't
the polite antibodies.

530
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,938
They're the ones that won't
sit still, kick during nap time.

531
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,381
<i>They attack his
neural and fat cells,</i>

532
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,943
<i>causing inflammation and
all the rest of his symptoms.</i>

533
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,285
So the cure's killing him.

534
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,793
<i>I want you to call down
to Carville, Louisiana,</i>

535
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:43,226
<i>home of the last leper
colony in the Lower 48.</i>

536
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,422
Get 'em to send up
some thalidomide.

537
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,074
Thalidomide?

538
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,934
<i>Twelve-year-olds don't have
sex, right? So he can't be pregnant.</i>

539
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,992
Make the call.

540
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,101
I need to speak to your boy.

541
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,369
Hmm.

542
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,980
Why does everybody
need to know my business?

543
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,788
People like talking
about people.

544
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,695
Makes us feel superior,
makes us feel in control,

545
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,429
and sometimes, for some people,
knowing some things makes them care.

546
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,217
I tell you my dad left,
my mum drank herself

547
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,668
to death, you gonna
care about me more?

548
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:33,610
Cameron would. Me, I
just like knowing stuff.

549
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,645
I know you hate your dad.

550
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,981
- Now, I'm gonna tell you
something— - I don't hate him.

551
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,290
I loved him until I figured out that
it hurts a lot less to just not care.

552
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,194
You don't expect him to turn up to
your football match, no disappointments.

553
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,158
<i>You don't expect a call
on your birthday, don't</i>

554
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:58,225
<i>expect to see him for
months, no disappointments.</i>

555
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:04,942
You want us to go make up— Sink a
few beers together, nice family hug?

556
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,450
<i>I've given him enough hugs. He's
given me enough disappointments.</i>

557
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,189
Okay.

558
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,996
- That's it?
- That's it.

559
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,886
<i>Breathe.</i> -

560
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,853
Breathe again.

561
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,921
Breathe again.

562
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,935
Are you gonna have to
tell my friends I'm a leper?

563
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,404
You had the antibiotics.
You're not contagious anymore.

564
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,499
Well, what if they
already caught it?

565
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:15,673
Leprosy is incredibly hard to
catch. Even your mum didn't get it.

566
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,445
Right. I want
you to make a fist.

567
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,543
It's still kinda stiff.

568
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,920
It'll get back to normal in a month
or two. Your skin, two or three weeks.

569
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,516
<i>Security 12, call 3662.</i>

570
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,757
You haven't asked
about your dad.

571
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,790
He lied about everything.

572
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:40,237
<i>He lied to my mom.
He lied to his boss.</i>

573
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,297
He's just a liar.

574
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,743
He loves you.

575
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:50,439
I don't love him.

576
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,112
Yeah, you do.

577
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,452
Nothing you can do
about it. He's your dad.

578
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:06,987
It doesn't matter what he
does. You're gonna love him.

579
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,536
Here. Thanks.

580
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,940
<i>Hey!</i>

581
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,197
When's your flight?
You got time for a drink?

582
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,290
Wish I did.

583
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,303
<i>Dr. Chase?</i>

584
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,471
I got it.

585
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:02,551
You're gonna be gettin'
down to Oz anytime soon?

586
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,215
Not too long. Next
autumn, I hope.

587
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,228
I'll call ya.

588
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,960
Well, you're all set.

589
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:28,009
I'll see ya. Yeah.

590
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,014
I'll see you.

591
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:39,145
That's some bad hat, Harry.
