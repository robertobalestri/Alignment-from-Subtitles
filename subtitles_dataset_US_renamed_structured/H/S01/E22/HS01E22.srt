1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,941
- I gotta go.
- No, no. He'll be here.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,835
I'm sure he's just
running a little late.

3
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,746
He's canceled two
exams. He's not gonna...

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,946
He's scared of you. Sure.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,216
The ex-boy toy. Yeah,
that makes sense.

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,520
- He wasn't scared before.
- Right.

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,936
You think being afraid of me is
a symptom of a serious ailment?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,555
Sudden mood swings, infantile
regression, abdominal pain.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,532
He's passed out twice. Yeah, I
think it might be a medical problem.

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,194
- He's 20 minutes late. I'm out of here.
- Please.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,466
He'll be here. Why?

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,701
Because he loves you and
does everything he's told?

13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,233
Because I didn't tell
him you'd be here.

14
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:55,383
- He likes to see.
- Yes, he does.

15
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,626
Stace?

16
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,791
- What's going on?
- Hey.

17
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,956
Hi. I'm Greg House.
You must be Matt.

18
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,557
- Mark.
- Mark Warner. Don't get up.

19
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,630
Sorry. Parent
conferences. Hi. It's okay.

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,804
- Wow. Greg House.
- Yeah. Wow.

21
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,811
<i>No, I haven't been avoiding you. I
just didn't want to waste your time.</i>

22
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,076
The other doctors checked me
out. They said it was just stress.

23
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,622
College season. Kids,
parents—They're all over me.

24
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:24,646
Makes sense to me.

25
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,030
- Greg.
- What do you want me to do?
- You said you'd check him out.

26
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,353
He says he's healthy.
What's to check out?

27
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,326
Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad
you two got a chance to catch up.

28
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,261
- Looks like you're having fun.
- Oh, he's good.

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,932
If you can fake sincerity, you
can fake pretty much anything.

30
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,869
I can't tell you how
much I like your fella.

31
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:44,836
Yeah, me too.

32
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,999
You know, I thought
you'd be all sarcastic.

33
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:51,535
<i>Bitter, you know,
because Stacy married me.</i>

34
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,549
We should do things together. Maybe throw
a ball around or something. Guy stuff.

35
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,176
- We could go for a run together.
- Ah! It's Oscar Wilde.

36
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,652
Wow. This pissing contest
is really turning me on.

37
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,849
He needs to go to the
hospital. Here's to women.

38
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,061
Can't live with 'em,
you can't kill 'em and tell

39
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:07,293
the neighbors they're
stripping in Atlantic City.

40
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,626
Damn straight.

41
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,595
- I'm definitely taller.
- I have more hair.

42
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,163
And I think that—Whoa.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,210
Mark?

44
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,013
- Someone call 911 for a wagon
to Princeton Plainsboro?
- Garçon!

45
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,802
<i>What happened?</i>

46
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,345
It's okay, ladies and gentlemen.
Nothing to worry about.

47
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,719
- Unless you had the veal.
- You dosed him.

48
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,753
I told you I'd check him
out. I was a little worried

49
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:39,535
they were gonna get
here before he passed out.

50
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,358
Would have been
tougher to get him to drink.

51
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,728
I'll give you a
ride. We can talk.

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,468
<i>A tummy ache, cranky—
No apparent source.</i>

53
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,777
Any thoughts?

54
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,304
Foreman, you're gonna contribute,
or are you too tired from stealing cars?

55
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,761
I'm being House. It's funny.

56
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,984
I know. You made milk
come out of my nose.

57
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,050
<i>Morning. You guys got
the file. What's wrong?</i>

58
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,564
Previous tests revealed nothing that would
cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.

59
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,260
Then we're done. What do
you think? Ball game? Zoo?

60
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,154
I don't care. I just want
to hang with you guys.

61
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:56,879
What about drugs?

62
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,431
His tox screen on admission showed
a massive amount of chloral hydrate.

63
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,840
Yeah. Sorry. That was me.

64
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,276
I had to dope him
up to get him in here.

65
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,144
Guy doesn't think
he's sick. Who does?

66
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,515
His wife. The woman
you used to live with.

67
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,646
That's her Indian name. On
her driver's license it's Stacy.

68
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,656
I assume you have a point.

69
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,723
You believe her over the patient
himself. That's why we're taking this case.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,629
The truth? I hear voices all
the time telling me to do stuff.

71
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,360
<i>- It's crazy, huh?</i>
- What happened to "everybody lies"?

72
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,663
I was lying.

73
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,316
Do the things—the blah, blah, blah,
blah. All that stuff the other docs did.

74
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,502
If that's negative,
ultrasound his belly.

75
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,808
If that's negative, C.T. his abdomen
and pelvis with and without contrast.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,940
- Did I miss anything?
- Kitchen sink.

77
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,611
Well, we could certainly
give that— Oh, you minx!

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,858
What you're thinking is, you're going
to save him, be a hero and win her back.

79
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,394
It's always impressive, that
level of twisted narcissism.

80
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,659
She's married. Big
clue I lost the game.

81
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,293
You can't be within 50
feet of Stacy Warner.

82
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,303
Thought she wanted
me to treat him.

83
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,362
Treat the husband,
stay away from the wife.

84
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,135
But what if they get close to
each other? What do I do then?

85
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,144
Hey. You have to treat
this like a regular case.

86
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,978
Be yourself— Cold,
uncaring, distant.

87
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,177
Please, don't put
me on a pedestal.

88
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:25,022
We C.T.'d your abdomen. Nothing
that would explain the stomach pain.

89
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,356
- What's the next move?
- Leaving.

90
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,419
How many more tests do I need?

91
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,375
How many more doctors need to clear
me before we can get back to our life?

92
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,891
- Just one.
- House.

93
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,336
<i>It must be awkward being treated by a
man who used to be involved with your wife.</i>

94
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,269
It's awkward being in a hospital
when there's nothing wrong with me.

95
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,043
M.R.A.'s were clean, which
means he's probably fine.

96
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,416
He doesn't seem paranoid.
He shows no signs of...

97
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,012
No. It means we have no
idea what's wrong with him.

98
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,835
Ben Goldstein says his schedule's
locked. He can't do it before tomorrow.

99
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,260
No. Today. Call him,
tell him I'll make it work.

100
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,422
You're cutting him open?

101
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,694
Oh, hold it. There's no
need for exploratory surgery.

102
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,632
Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.

103
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,900
No, I just think it's premature
and maybe irresponsible...

104
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,283
to do exploratory surgery
before we know he's actually sick.

105
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,243
No, it's "premature" to put
him on a list for hospice care.

106
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,077
And it's "maybe irresponsible" to imply
my actions are not rationally supported.

107
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,412
All we have is his wife—
Who says his stomach hurts.

108
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,723
Works for me. The patient doesn't even
think he's sick. Why would he consent to...

109
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,585
His wife's a lawyer.
She's very convincing.

110
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,649
Call Goldstein. Surgery is on.

111
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,064
<i>Retract.</i>

112
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,544
Insert.

113
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,681
Leslie versus Leslie
<i>seems to be right on point,</i>

114
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,651
but I'm sure they're going
to try to distinguish it by...

115
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,951
Sorry. They'll try to distinguish
it relying on the minority opinion.

116
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,493
Double milk, no sugar.

117
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,461
I like sugar now.

118
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,779
Some people would
be annoyed by that.

119
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,415
You know why people sit in waiting
rooms? This is gonna be good.

120
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:38,322
People think the closer they're sitting to
the operating room, the more they care.

121
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,953
That's why I'm here. I'm not
moving until everybody sees me.

122
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,228
Are you doing
anybody besides Mark?

123
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,537
It's a medical question. Because
if I am, his paranoia isn't paranoia.

124
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,805
It's a justified response and
therefore not a legitimate symptom.

125
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,971
Knew you'd understand.

126
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,881
On the other hand, if it
was really just a medical

127
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,726
question, you would have
sent one of your people.

128
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,861
Why just push my buttons
when you can push theirs too?

129
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:10,323
Hey, Dr. Mandingo, go ask the
wife if she's been messin' around.

130
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,953
But you're asking
because if I am... unfaithful,

131
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,020
I might sleep with you.

132
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:23,996
The answer's no. I don't sleep around.
Make sure you note that in his file.

133
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,005
Mrs. Warner.

134
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,565
The surgery went well. He's in
Recovery. You can see him now.

135
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,112
Goldstein found nothing
but a distended bladder.

136
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,180
Neurogenic bladder
isn't causing the pain.

137
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,089
It also doesn't cause
personality changes.

138
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:49,027
On the other hand, it would completely
account for Cameron's diagnosis.

139
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,860
The patient's
completely healthy.

140
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,367
Get me the video of the surgery.

141
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:11,039
Dr. Mandingo, you're
needed at the plantation house.

142
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,943
Well, don't
everybody talk at once.

143
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,487
There's nothing there.

144
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,992
Stop looking at the suspiciously
empty bottle and look at the screen.

145
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,531
Here's why I get the big bucks.

146
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,658
This is nothing.

147
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,362
An enhanced version of nothing.

148
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:40,669
<i>This... is the problem.</i>

149
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,871
- Unbelievable.
- Tremors in the muscle fiber.

150
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,882
That's not peristalsis.

151
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,214
<i>- That's abdominal epilepsy.</i>
- Means there's some sort
of neurological problem.

152
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,915
A time bomb in his brain.

153
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,085
I forget. Who said
it was nothing?

154
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,230
<i>I saw a very small, diffuse abnormality
in the brain waves. Probably white matter.</i>

155
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,298
Means his axonal
nerves are dying.

156
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,437
Explains the neurogenic bladder.
Enough nerves die, he dies.

157
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,640
<i>Global axonal nerve death.</i>

158
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,774
Likely causes are
encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

159
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,115
Early onset
Alzheimer's. The worst.

160
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,417
He won't die right
away. He'll just want to.

161
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,515
I'll check the blood for
Alzheimer's protein markers.

162
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,494
Last I heard, Alzheimer's had a genetic
component. Did the patient have parents?

163
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,122
Parents died in a car
crash. No history of dementia.

164
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,067
Send C.S.F. for C.B.C. and viral
serologies to rule out encephalitis...

165
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,468
and get tau proteins to
check for Alzheimer's.

166
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,063
And this still
feels a little light.

167
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,635
I took a complete medical history. Check
out their house. Take Sparky with you.

168
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,113
- They live in Short Hills. Two hours away.
- You can expense the tolls.

169
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,412
You're not interested
in a medical history.

170
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,975
You're a Peeping Tom
trying to spy on your ex.

171
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,988
Her secret diary—
That's the main thing.

172
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,492
But as long as you're there, take
a peek in the medicine cabinet.

173
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,810
Check for toxins, heavy
metals— anything that might

174
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,155
explain this other than
encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

175
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,396
And get receipts for the tolls.

176
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,281
Making lunch? I
assume that's for Mark.

177
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,946
We know about his parents.
What about further back?

178
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,388
Grandparents, uncles, aunts. How
was their health? Greg hates fishing.

179
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,359
He's got a theory.

180
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,691
Most likely candidate
right now is Alzheimer's.

181
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,596
No. There's been no memory loss.

182
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,472
I mean, he forgets where he
left his keys, but who doesn't?

183
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,602
Any family history?

184
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,943
Of... whacked-outness?

185
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,974
His sister voted for Nader,
twice. That's about it.

186
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,458
You were with House
when it happened—to his leg?

187
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh.

188
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,157
You're interested in him.

189
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,257
We went on one date.

190
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,393
It didn't go very well.

191
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,374
Our first date didn't
either. I was never

192
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,564
gonna see him again.
A week later, I moved in.

193
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,167
<i>Five years. What
would you like to know?</i>

194
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,938
What was he like before his leg?

195
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,017
Pretty much the same.

196
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,989
He's clear. No Alzheimer's.

197
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,556
Yeah, that's what I figured.

198
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,443
Serious mountain bike. Hasn't
been used in a while though.

199
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,005
<i>He switched to yoga.
Brand-new yoga mat and tape.</i>

200
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,123
Man's getting older. Or it
might indicate back pain.

201
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,519
Wife would have mentioned it.
Yoga's good for picking up the ladies too.

202
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,080
Not when you do it
in your own home.

203
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,889
Change could be just a
change, not a symptom.

204
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,792
Chase.

205
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,563
"Dear 'House' boys, a snack
for your highly illegal search.

206
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,196
Hope you like oatmeal
raisin. Love, Stacy."

207
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,039
Whoa. In a desk drawer, hidden
in the back under some papers.

208
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,045
Secret stash.

209
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:43,516
Amphetamines. Regular
use could lead to neurotoxicity.

210
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,247
Explains the axonal nerve
damage and the personality issues.

211
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,051
On the other hand,
"Prescribed to W. Brown."

212
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,149
Fake name. Fake prescription.

213
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,286
Could be, but the prescribing
doc, his name's real.

214
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,223
This guy's just had
his license pulled for

215
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:59,492
writing illegal prescriptions
to high school kids.

216
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,557
Mark's a high school
guidance counselor.

217
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,468
<i>And Mr. Brown's birth date
makes him 17 years old.</i>

218
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,702
Do you think maybe these were confiscated
by a high school guidance counselor?

219
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,146
Anything else? Um, yeah, he
switched from mountain biking to yoga.

220
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,147
- Could indicate— -
He's getting older.

221
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,779
What did the C.S.F.
say about encephalitis?

222
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:19,242
Said no. Champagne tap.

223
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,876
<i>No red cells, no
white cells. Serology's</i>

224
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,798
negative. Which means
we're back to Alzheimer's.

225
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,587
I told her he didn't have it.
The marker tests were negative.

226
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,287
Well, then you should have
told her <i>that.</i> He could still have it.

227
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,854
PET scan will reveal any changing
metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex.

228
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,765
Run him through and
check his memory.

229
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,868
We're going to inject a
chemical marker called F.D.D.N.P.

230
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,897
Then I'm gonna ask
you a series of questions.

231
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:43,637
Test my memory.

232
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,702
Yeah, but first we're gonna map
out some specific brain functions.

233
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,806
You know, check out the engine
before we take the car for a drive.

234
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,551
Checking up on me?

235
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,492
- I like all the pretty lights.
- Yeah.

236
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,243
Okay. Here we go.

237
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,836
<i>Your full name?</i> Mark Warner.

238
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,742
- Is your mother living?
- No.

239
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,183
Limbic system's intact.

240
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,381
Okay, say you find a stamped
envelope on the street. What do you do?

241
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,914
- Find a mailbox and mail it.
- Geez. What a guy.

242
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,526
His frontal lobe is working
way better than mine.

243
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,589
Do you remember
when you got married?

244
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,964
<i>Three years ago
this July. Who is that?</i>

245
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,868
What? Could be a problem
with his long-term memory.

246
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,270
- Big church wedding?
- Is that House?

247
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,072
He remembers voices. This
serves no diagnostic purpose.

248
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,635
I thought you skimped
on the limbic system there.

249
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,080
Emotional reactions. I
just want to be thorough.

250
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:00,244
<i>Did the atheistic bride
wear a pretty white dress?</i>

251
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,187
Was she thinking of you? Is that
what you medically need to know?

252
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,851
What jewelry did
your bride wear?

253
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:09,555
She never wears any jewelry, except
the cross her mother gave to her.

254
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,394
No underwear either,
at least not that day.

255
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,526
<i>I remember 'cause she ripped
her pretty white dress off in the car.</i>

256
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,797
That the sort of answer
you're looking for, Doctor?

257
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,772
I think I upset him.
You gotta stop this now.

258
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,621
I remember the honeymoon
was in Paris. I remember

259
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,279
'cause we didn't leave
the room for two weeks.

260
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,281
- You want the details on that?
- A little defensive.

261
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,944
It's not paranoia if
someone's out to get you.

262
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,230
Here we go.

263
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,502
He's sick, paranoid, and you
keep hammering him about me?

264
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,433
The questions were
designed to define the

265
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,477
operational parameters
of his limbic system.

266
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,412
Elevate the words all
you want. You were just

267
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:02,413
screwing with him. Low,
even by your standards.

268
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,677
Medical screwing.
It's what I do.

269
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,346
Then you run away like a 12-year-old.
Go hide on the roof like you always do.

270
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,652
I haven't been up
here in five years.

271
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,864
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

272
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:33,907
It's not Alzheimer's.
It's not encephalitis.

273
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,449
It's not environmental.
It's not immunological.

274
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,178
Every test is
negative every time.

275
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,982
He's perfectly healthy,

276
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,853
but his brain is dying.

277
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,399
It never occurred to me...

278
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,631
that you couldn't
figure out what's wrong.

279
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,612
I haven't given up.

280
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,758
So what do we do?

281
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,039
We wait.

282
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,745
For what?

283
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,804
Something to change.

284
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,547
It's one of the great tragedies
of life. Something always...

285
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,080
Something always changes.

286
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,369
Nurse?

287
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,362
Nurse!

288
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,244
What happened? What's wrong?

289
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:19,775
My toes—They were
numb, tingling, then nothing.

290
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,616
No pain. Nothing.

291
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,747
It's okay. They're going
to take care of you.

292
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,985
I'm scared, Stacy. Hold my hand.

293
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,864
What?

294
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,971
What's happening?

295
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,945
Time marches on. He's paralyzed.

296
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,290
His symptoms mimic a peripheral
nervous system under attack.

297
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,772
But he's experiencing
significant paresthesias,

298
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,661
and he can't move
his hands or toes.

299
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,666
It's peripheral.

300
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,328
Guillain-Barré syndrome
attacks there, not the brain.

301
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,133
No. No. I already did
an indirect Coombs' test.

302
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,197
No agglutination, no antibodies.

303
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,140
Initiative. Like that.

304
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,269
Start him on I.V. immuno...

305
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,747
No antibodies means he doesn't
have Guillain-Barré, period.

306
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,114
Period? More like dot, dot, dot.

307
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,676
<i>What if he has the virus but
isn't producing those antibodies?</i>

308
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:32,123
Come on. The chances of that— Didn't
ask about the Vegas line. I said "what if."

309
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,593
It would mean he's sick, and his
body's not doing anything about it.

310
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,597
So we either fight
it for him or it's fatal.

311
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,656
Fatal sounds very bad to me.

312
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,226
Well, without the antibodies, we can't even
test for it. Don't know if we're right.

313
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,664
Treatment isn't all that dangerous.
Plasmapheresis and I.V.I.G.

314
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:55,545
If it works, we're right. If he
dies... it was something else.

315
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,645
So the paralysis might
not be permanent.

316
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,850
That's our hope, but the
brain's tricky. You never know.

317
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,594
What was that? What?

318
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,601
- With the head. The look.
- He just wants to talk to me.

319
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,730
- Well, if it was medical,
he should be talking to me.
- I'll be just outside the door.

320
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,036
Leave! Go talk to him.

321
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,442
- You're going to leave me anyway.
<i>- No. That's not gonna happen.</i>

322
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,449
You left him, and he had a
limp. If I can't walk or hold you?

323
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,543
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going to talk to him.

324
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,420
- If I can't feed myself?
- Mark, what you're feeling—
It's not real. It's the virus.

325
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,955
- Mark? What is it?
- Mark?

326
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,260
His throat's closing up. He
can't breathe. Code blue! Hurry!

327
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,131
He's having a reaction to
the I.V.I.G. I need epi, stat.

328
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,102
<i>- I can't get the scope in his throat.</i>
- Stop that.

329
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,685
He's having an allergic
reaction. He's crashing.

330
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,785
No, he's not.
Look at his vitals.

331
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,836
<i>O</i>₂<i>sats are within range.</i>

332
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,472
I'm betting the only
abnormal sign is sweaty palms.

333
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,983
Push two milligrams Ativan.

334
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,931
No allergic reaction.
Just a panic attack.

335
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,939
<i>Something obviously
freaked him out.</i>

336
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,843
Can we talk now?

337
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,581
<i>You couldn’t just
come into the room?</i>

338
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,415
He's had five visitors drive down.
I didn't recognize any of them.

339
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,649
Six more have sent him
flowers, candy and a teddy bear,

340
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,156
which I'm sure he
finds very comforting.

341
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,693
But I didn't recognize any
of the names on the cards.

342
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,127
Shockingly, Mark has friends,
and I have some new ones.

343
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,290
No, it's not shocking
that you have new friends,

344
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,267
but it is shocking that you
apparently dumped all your old ones.

345
00:23:56,335 --> 00:24:01,137
- I haven't.
- No, I didn't think so.

346
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,506
I just think you didn't tell any of
them that you were down here.

347
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,807
Now, why would that be?

348
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,581
What are you up to? It's
gonna take a little while.

349
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,850
Why would you not
tell your oldest friends...

350
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,299
that you were taking Mark
to Princeton Plainsboro

351
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,382
Teaching Hospital
to try to save his life?

352
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,792
I've been busy. I haven't
kept track of who knows what.

353
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,957
See, my old friends are telling me
to be careful. They seem to think...

354
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,194
He. And he sent me the bear.

355
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,760
Figures.

356
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:36,070
He seems to think
that I'm not over you...

357
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:41,043
and that it might be dangerous
for me to spend time with you.

358
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:45,551
I'm thinking your friends
might have similar concerns,

359
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,711
and so you didn't tell
them you'd be here with me.

360
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,278
What's your point? That
I'm still in love with you?

361
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,349
I should abandon my dying
husband, and we should head for Rio.

362
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,820
No.

363
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:02,027
Greg, I appreciate what you're doing
for us, but I think maybe Wilson's right.

364
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,833
Maybe you should
just stay away from me.

365
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,901
<i>♪♪</i>

366
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,773
What's up?

367
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,112
Love the bear. It's adorable.

368
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:54,585
My wife's gonna kill me. We're
having company. She cooked.

369
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,986
I got Mark's latest blood work.

370
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,924
He's not responding
to treatment.

371
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,495
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,122
I was happy.

373
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,898
He's my patient.

374
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,135
I'm sure he's a good guy.
He's probably a great guy.

375
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,609
He's apparently a much
better guy than I am.

376
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,080
And some part of
me wants him to die.

377
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:32,982
I'm just not sure if it's
because... I want to be with her,

378
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,722
or it's because I
want her to suffer.

379
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,939
Hey. Is it okay if I talk
to Stacy for a minute?

380
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,172
I'll be just outside, honey.

381
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,153
You two are good together.

382
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,525
You know nothing about Mark.

383
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,655
He took you to Paris.

384
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,722
That's good enough for me.

385
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,795
We never went to Paris.

386
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,804
Your honeymoon. It's
been your dream city.

387
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:27,813
You wanted to go since you were 16.
He actually took you. No, I had to work.

388
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,750
We spent the night in New York. Then
we went back to Short Hills. What is it?

389
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,914
When did Mark switch from
mountain biking to yoga?

390
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,151
About a month ago.

391
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,716
The same time he started
getting sick. What does that mean?

392
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,285
We have two more symptoms.

393
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,617
The patient was asked
a series of questions

394
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:50,833
to determine the
functionality of his brain.

395
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,601
- You grilled him about Stacy.
- Whatever.

396
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,371
Yeah, the point is, he told us everything
we need to know to diagnose him.

397
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,504
That is, if we use your fancy
PET scan as a lie detector.

398
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,572
<i>See, it's a very
creative process, lying.</i>

399
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:08,019
<i>Now, telling the truth is a
much simpler process. See here.</i>

400
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,542
Question nine. This is
where Mark gives a long,

401
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:12,888
rambling answer about
taking Stacy to Paris.

402
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,329
What does the PET scan say?

403
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:17,191
Minimal involvement. Just
the frontal and temporal lobes.

404
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,426
He said he went to Paris, and
the PET confirms it. So, what?

405
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,298
They didn't go.

406
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,304
They didn't go to Paris, and yet
Mark's brain apparently thinks...

407
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,103
that he really did spend 40
francs on a tour of the bastille.

408
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:34,271
So we have an intermittent syndrome
that presents with abdominal pain,

409
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:37,145
polyneuropathy, paranoia...

410
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,618
and delusions.

411
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:44,214
Now, here's the thing about
Acute Intermittent Porphyria.

412
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,748
It'll jump you in a dark alley, beat
the crap out of you, leave you bleeding.

413
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,523
But it wears gloves,
so no fingerprints.

414
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:54,294
Doesn't show up in blood
tests, urine tests, nothing...

415
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,598
unless you catch it red-handed
in the middle of an attack.

416
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,833
But there are other
symptoms of A.I.P.

417
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,341
- Such as?
- Light sensitivity.

418
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,401
Yeah. One of the true
tragedies of this condition...

419
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,642
is it makes you want to stick your
cool new mountain bike in the garage...

420
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,116
and take up an indoor
sport like, say, yoga.

421
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,120
<i>Start the treatment.
Hematin and glucose.</i>

422
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:18,419
<i>If you give him Hematin now
and you’re wrong, he dies today.</i>

423
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,086
<i>There's only one way to confirm A. I.
P.— Urine sample made during the attack.</i>

424
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,789
And there's no way to predict
when he'll have another attack.

425
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,355
Sure there is.

426
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,869
Acute Intermittent Porphyria
has very specific triggers.

427
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:35,032
Barbiturates, alcohol, high levels
of protein will set off an attack.

428
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,703
Which trigger do you think set
off Mark's? Not the faintest idea.

429
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,009
That's why I'm gonna give
him the combo plate. All of it.

430
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,881
<i>So if he has this, and you trigger an
attack, the attack makes him worse, right?</i>

431
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,353
Yeah. But then we'll know
what it is and we can treat it.

432
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:57,558
But if I don't have this thing and
you give me that shot, what happens?

433
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,121
No idea. If we don't
know what's messing up

434
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:03,193
your brain, we don't
know how you'll react.

435
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,001
Okay, I—I need a
minute with my husband.

436
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,377
He doesn't want the trigger.

437
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:51,042
He wants to wait, see if we can
come up with another explanation.

438
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,847
If it is A.I.P., how much
time does he have?

439
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,755
No idea. Next
attack could be fatal.

440
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,453
Could be six months from now.
Could be five minutes from now.

441
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,293
I want you to test him. Fine.

442
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,856
I'll send for an
H.M.B.-synthase mutation.

443
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,732
Genetic test. Lab will
get back to us in a month.

444
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,362
Give him the cocktail,
set off an attack.

445
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,964
No. Why not?

446
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,135
Because he doesn't want me to.

447
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,702
I'm not gonna sue you.
I'm not gonna report you.

448
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,714
He might. He's paralyzed.

449
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,546
Either you cure him, or he
won't be writing any letters.

450
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,779
I'm not gonna do it. Why not?

451
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,220
You keep asking me that
question. My answer doesn't change.

452
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,258
I gave him the
parameters. It's his call.

453
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,255
You want him to die. I
diagnosed him. I did my job.

454
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,587
You want somebody to
tie him down and force him

455
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,133
into treatment, you're
way better at that than I am.

456
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,397
Is that what this is? Payback
for your leg? How many

457
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,469
times have we been
over this? I saved your life.

458
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,773
Yeah, maybe. You're gonna kill
my husband to teach me a lesson?

459
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,490
No. He's gonna die 'cause he's
too stubborn to make the right choice.

460
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,676
Now we're in your territory.

461
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,910
I'm respecting your
husband's decision. I

462
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,597
don't see why you've
got a problem with that.

463
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,590
Because it's crap.

464
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,592
Because you browbeat patients,
intimidate them, lie to them.

465
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,652
If you think you're right, you
don't give a damn what they think.

466
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:13,961
I did what you do all the time.
The only difference is, I did it to you.

467
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,867
He'll never forgive you.

468
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,838
Yeah. <i>He</i> will.

469
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,783
Still no change. He's
not getting worse?

470
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,029
No. No change at all.

471
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,388
<i>And that's consistent
with A. I. P., right?</i>

472
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,798
Until he has another attack,
his condition's stable. Yeah.

473
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:53,498
<i>- Mark, you've got to.</i>
- I don't want to take that test,
not until they're sure.

474
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,064
- You don't know Greg.
- Not like you do.

475
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,241
I only met him
when he drugged me.

476
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,906
Boy, are my ears burning.

477
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,007
- What's that?
- Cocktail hour.

478
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,019
<i>Just 'cause you can't hoist a few
doesn't mean you should be left out.</i>

479
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,853
- Get away from me.
- Mark, if this is what he thinks
is wrong with you...

480
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,235
You trust his judgment more
than mine? His medical judgment.

481
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,319
And you'd bet my
life on that? I would.

482
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,090
I don't.

483
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,826
Smart.

484
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,391
It's too bad you're paralyzed.

485
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,606
Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman.

486
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,383
Leave the room. It's not your
problem. You need the consent from him.

487
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,785
But, Doc, he ain't right in the
head. Then you need a court order.

488
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,791
Okay. Then get one. We'll
wait here. I won't do nothin'.

489
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,588
Oh! Love the Musketeer thing.

490
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,635
- I got goose bumps.
- Give me the syringe.

491
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:01,537
<i>Please. If you’re right,
this may be his only shot.</i>

492
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,270
So what's your plan? You take
the big dark one, I've got the little girl,

493
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,142
<i>and the Aussie will run like a
scared wombat if things turn rough.</i>

494
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,256
I can't do it.

495
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,459
You son of a bitch!

496
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,731
See what I did there?

497
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,955
- When does it happen?
- If he had A.I.P.,
should've already happened.

498
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,346
- Everyone's different.
<i>- This is not good.</i>

499
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,579
He could have an
embolism, tachycardia, stroke.

500
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,643
<i>What's happening?</i>
Two milligrams of Ativan.

501
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,087
Is that an attack?

502
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,458
- Here.
- No. You'll pollute the sample.

503
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:59,123
- Chase, get urine from the catheter.
- It's not an attack! He's stroking.

504
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,098
He needs Ativan!

505
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,864
<i>This is not a stroke. The
delta-wave burst is just a vasospasm.</i>

506
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,176
Catheter's out. There's no
way to collect the sample.

507
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,805
Heart rate's in the
40s. Bradycardia.

508
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,365
- We're losing him.
- Hold him down.
- Give him something!

509
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,003
<i>No painkillers.</i> You were wrong.

510
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,821
Straight from the bladder.
That's as fresh as it gets.

511
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,725
Would you give him
the Ativan already?

512
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,322
He doesn't need
to be awake for this.

513
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,188
It's still yellow.

514
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,418
Move.

515
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,588
- What?
- You think another light's
gonna make the difference?

516
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,327
Organic chem— More
light, more oxidation.

517
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,392
<i>Does that ring any bells?</i>

518
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:24,139
<i>Start the patient on 150 milligrams
glucose, 75 milligrams Hematin.</i>

519
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,836
Hey. Hey.

520
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,940
You wanna thumb wrestle?

521
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,008
Come on. Oh!

522
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,221
He's still a maniac. I know.

523
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,179
Dr. House?

524
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,242
How's he doing?

525
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,023
Never better.

526
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,920
I thought...

527
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,764
you were too screwed
up to love anyone.

528
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,826
I was wrong.

529
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:56,770
You just couldn't love me.

530
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,436
That's good.

531
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,273
I'm happy for you.

532
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,730
<i>♪♪</i>

533
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,027
<i>♪♪</i>

534
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,654
You fixed him.

535
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,762
<i>De nada.</i>

536
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,770
Thank you.

537
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,497
You were right.

538
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,406
He's gonna be fine.

539
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,467
No. About me.

540
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,281
I'm not over you.

541
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,213
You were—You were the one.

542
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,223
You always will be.

543
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,253
But I can't be with you.

544
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,431
So I'm the guy,

545
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,500
but you want the other guy,

546
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,706
who, by definition,
can never be the guy.

547
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,917
What's so great about you is
you always think you're right.

548
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:52,082
And what's so frustrating about you
is you are right so much of the time.

549
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,061
You are brilliant,

550
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,462
funny, surprising, sexy.

551
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:10,503
But with you, I was lonely. And
with Mark, there's room for me.

552
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,946
Okay.

553
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,855
I want to run something by you.

554
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,797
I will not have sex
with you! Not again.

555
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,391
It was miserable
that first time.

556
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,562
All that desperate
administrative need.

557
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:17,041
Stacy's husband is going to need
close monitoring at the hospital,

558
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,600
and since we can
definitely use her back here,

559
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,841
I've offered her a
job— General counsel.

560
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,917
Did she say yes?

561
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:30,012
She said only if it
was okay with you.

562
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,058
Yes or no?

563
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,194
Fine. Good.

564
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:05,705
That's some bad hat, Harry.
