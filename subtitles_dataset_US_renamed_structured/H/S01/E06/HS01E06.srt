1
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,476
<i>No. You killed the
cat. Cut off his head.</i>

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,671
<i>Need to take a look at this.</i>

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,647
<i>Mom? Mom.</i>

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,741
<i>Mom, it's okay.</i>

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,049
Just a couple of
questions before I can

7
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:23,655
authorize extending
her disability benefits.

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,319
I don't like her. She's fat.

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,290
I could lose a little weight.

10
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,032
You all right?

11
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:43,771
- Actually, before she signs—
- I killed the cat. Lots of blood.

12
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,572
It's okay.

13
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,675
I have a couple of questions
about some of these dates.

14
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,687
- The first diagnosis—
- Schizophrenia.

15
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,849
<i>Dr. Walters, May 1 1, last year.
The letter's in the medical file.</i>

16
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,860
And April 6— That was
the last day she worked?

17
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:03,364
<i>But she received unemployment
benefits for that week.</i>

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,867
We fixed that. I know we
did. We returned the money.

19
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,770
That's the canceled check.

20
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,399
<i>Not the real one,
you know. It's a copy.</i>

21
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,410
And you're the dependent?

22
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:22,313
No. That's my little brother.
I'm 18 Just helping out.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,055
You're all set.

24
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,988
Just need a signature.

25
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,755
<i>Hey! I'm talking to you!</i>

26
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,264
<i>The cat's first. Now
it's your turn, Lucy.</i>

27
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,562
Shut up. Shut up, shut up!

28
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,002
<i>It's okay. She just— She
just needs a little water is all.</i>

29
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,064
I'll go get it.

30
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,171
Just hold on, okay? Just...

31
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:58,742
When she comes back, sign it and we're
gonna be done. We need this, okay? Please.

32
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,423
Okay.

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,516
The voices...

34
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,584
The voices aren't real.

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,692
<i>What?</i>

36
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,437
Mom? Mom.

37
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,541
Mom? Mom! Mom!

38
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,600
<i>Thirty-eight-year-old Caucasian</i>

39
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:07,779
<i>woman. Status:
post-respiratory arrest in the field.</i>

40
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,982
<i>Intubated, oxygenating poorly.</i>

41
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:22,267
<i>Dr. Gregory House, please
call Dr. Cuddy at extension 373 1.</i>

42
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,397
<i>This is a good hospital?</i>

43
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,934
Depends what you mean
by "good." I like these chairs.

44
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,416
How is she? Stable. Okay.

45
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,316
Your Mom had a small
pulmonary embolism...

46
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,288
A blood clot that got stuck in
her lungs, blocked the oxygen.

47
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,554
But the pain started in her leg.
Where the clot started— her calf.

48
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,357
It's called a deep vein
thrombosis. Basically, a bigger clot.

49
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,365
It never hurt there before.
I would have noticed.

50
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,352
A piece of that broke off,
went up the vein, through

51
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:56,245
her heart and blocked
the blood flow to her lungs.

52
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,999
No blood flow, no oxygen. Okay.

53
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,067
Is your Dad here? I have
some things I need to talk

54
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,031
to him about. Uh, my
Dad's running a little late.

55
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,847
He's dead. Just talk to
me. I take care of her.

56
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,079
All right. Your mom's blood
alcohol was .12.10:30 in the morning.

57
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,020
I gave it to her. Two ounces
of vodka. It cools her out.

58
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,217
But that's the first since
Monday. That was three days ago.

59
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,658
I've been real careful.

60
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,925
She hears voices. She's
schizophrenic. That explains the D.V.T.

61
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,747
The alcohol makes her pass out.
She's immobile for long periods of time.

62
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,429
That doesn't happen.
She's not an alcoholic.

63
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:33,983
She only drinks when
you give it to her?

64
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,444
We put her on blood thinners. You
can probably take her home tomorrow.

65
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,379
It's not the alcohol. It's
gotta be something else.

66
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,576
Of course it's the alcohol.

67
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,119
Hello!

68
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,816
This guy's a
professional doctor.

69
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,951
Plays golf and
everything, I bet.

70
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,929
<i>He's not gonna tell you your
mom's an alcoholic without proof.</i>

71
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,976
I'm sure he scoped for varices, checked her
esophagus, ran all kinds of blood tests.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,902
Doctors like this, they don't make
assumptions. They do the work.

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,681
I'd be happy to refer you the case,
Dr. House. You seem so interested.

74
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,766
What case? It's over.
You're sending her home.

75
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,777
- How old is she?
- You're a doctor?

76
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,278
Own my own stethoscope.

77
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,247
Did I ask you how
old she was? I forget.

78
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,719
A 38-year-old woman with no
previous symptoms or history...

79
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,550
presents with deep
vein thrombosis.

80
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,385
How did she get it?

81
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,290
Oral contraceptives, smoking,
diabetes, obesity. What's the point here?

82
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,888
A D.V.T. is a D.V.T. Put her on
I.V. Heparin to prevent future clots.

83
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,492
- What's the big mystery?
- Fine. You're all sleepy. You need a clue.

84
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,629
She's 38 years old.

85
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,572
She's 20 years too young to
get a deep vein thrombosis.

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,236
I treated a 12-year-old girl once, a
soccer player. She got kicked in the leg.

87
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,338
There was no trauma. None of
the risk factors. You took a history?

88
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,444
I have some notes. They're
not mine, but reliable,

89
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:53,217
I think, for the purposes
of this discussion.

90
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,579
As for the immobility,
well, she's real active

91
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:58,020
right now, of course.
Paranoia keeps her limber.

92
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,959
- Paranoia?
- Oh, yeah. She's schizophrenic.

93
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,464
And her kid wrote this,
so it might be a little biased.

94
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,592
You know, having to take
care of his nutso mom and all.

95
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,000
You think there's a connection?

96
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,507
<i>- Do we include schizophrenia</i>
<i>in the differential for D. V. T.?</i>
- Well...

97
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,599
The answer is no.

98
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,543
Abnormal dopaminergic pathways
in the brain do not cause blood clots.

99
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,342
Schizophrenia is not
the cause of D.V.T.

100
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,399
<i>On the other hand, we
don't really know anything</i>

101
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,350
<i>about schizophrenia,
so maybe it is connected.</i>

102
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,352
Well, schizophrenia
explains one mystery...

103
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,355
Why you're so fascinated by a
woman with a bump in her leg.

104
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,019
It's like Picasso
deciding to whitewash a

105
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,862
fence. Thanks. I'm more
of a Leroy Neiman man.

106
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,862
And it is only about the D.V.T.
She's 38 years old. She shouldn't...

107
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,716
Right, solve this one,
and you're on your way to

108
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,475
Stockholm. We don't
even know how to treat it.

109
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,434
Come on. Fumigation
of the vagina?

110
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,437
A little louder. I don't
think everyone heard you.

111
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,416
Two thousand years ago,
that's how Galen treated

112
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,498
schizophrenics. The Marcus
Welby of ancient Greece.

113
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,771
Oh, clearly you're not
interested. Oh, I'm interested.

114
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,297
I'm interested in how voices
in the head could be caused by

115
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,714
malposition of the uterus.
There's a better place for it?

116
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,718
Now, what do we got? We've got
lobotomies, rubber rooms, electric shocks.

117
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,345
My, Galen was so primitive.
Where are you going?

118
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,516
Going to see the
patient. That all-important

119
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,756
human connection.
Thought I'd give it a whirl.

120
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,260
You won't talk to
patients because they lie,

121
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,763
but give you a patient
with no concept of reality...

122
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,557
If it wasn't for Socrates,
that raving, untreated

123
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,510
schizophrenic, we wouldn't
have the Socratic method...

124
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,971
The best way of teaching everything,
apart from juggling chain saws.

125
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,475
Without Isaac Newton, we'd be floating on
the ceiling. Dodging chain saws, no doubt.

126
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,273
And that guitar player in that
English band. He was great.

127
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,406
You think I'm interested
because of the schizophrenia.

128
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,915
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

129
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,943
Galen was pretty sure
about the fumigation thing.

130
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,380
Pink Floyd.

131
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,062
<i>- Mom, this is Dr. Gr—</i>
- Gregory House.

132
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,065
Nice to meet you.

133
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,068
Would it be all right if we
spoke alone for a while?

134
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,536
Well, you're gonna need me to...

135
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,937
I've got your case
notes, Doctor.

136
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,942
There's a cafeteria downstairs.

137
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,944
Get yourself whatever you want,

138
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,825
as long as there's enough
left over for a Reuben

139
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,457
sandwich, dry, no
fries, hold the pickles.

140
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,916
Should run you
about 5.80 with tax.

141
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,581
I'll page you when we're done.

142
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,425
No...

143
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,728
pickles.

144
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,863
Nice kid.

145
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,810
How much do you really drink?

146
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,352
He's really talking
to a patient?

147
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,356
I don't know who I am anymore.

148
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,359
It's a blood clot. What's
so fascinating about that?

149
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:50,193
He likes crazy people.
He likes the way they think.

150
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,199
They think badly. That's
the definition of crazy.

151
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,031
Why would he like—
They're not boring.

152
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,094
He likes that.

153
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,609
And the meds?

154
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,009
Baseball. I like baseball.

155
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,176
Very nice. Very sad.

156
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,682
My boy and me, we
went to see a game.

157
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,192
Not "Mets." Meds. Medicine.

158
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,955
You take what he
tells you to take.

159
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,461
No one believes me.

160
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,131
I do.

161
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,209
I thought he liked rationality.

162
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,220
He likes puzzles.

163
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,415
Patients are puzzles?
You don't think so?

164
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,015
I think they're people. Yeah.

165
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,655
Well, he hates them, and
he's fascinated by them.

166
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,329
Tell me you can't
relate to that sentiment.

167
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,974
You told Luke it never
hurt before. Just rough.

168
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,512
They didn't hurt.

169
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,571
Didn't?

170
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,382
Don't lie to him, Limpy.

171
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,386
Lively Lucy never lies to Lucas.

172
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,445
<i>Look what I do to him.</i>

173
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,061
<i>Radiation therapist to Oncology.</i>

174
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,427
Learn anything from
the "human connection"?

175
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,432
Yeah. The Mets suck.

176
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,063
Also, for the last two
months, she hasn't shaved

177
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,836
her legs. Because of the
tremors, she cuts herself.

178
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,127
The tremors aren't new.
She must always cut herself.

179
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:40,567
Exactly.

180
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,575
Something changed
in the last two months.

181
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,934
I'm thinking the amount
of blood when she cut

182
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,273
herself. So let's start
with some blood work.

183
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,237
Collect and send for
clotting studies, P.T.,

184
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:51,045
P.T.T., factor five,
protein "C" and "S."

185
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,245
The whole shebang. Good luck.

186
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,820
No pickles, and it's cold now.

187
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,502
- If it's a Reuben,
that's the way he likes it.
- Everyone, this is Luke.

188
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,398
Allison Cameron. It's
nice to finally meet you.

189
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:02,505
Yeah. Save it. We're busy.

190
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,296
Luke, give us another half hour with
your mom. We need to do some tests.

191
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,071
Nice kid.

192
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,117
<i>Take her off the psych meds. That way we'll
know what's what on the physical side.</i>

193
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,600
And who knows, we
might get more out of her.

194
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,640
Don't worry. No pickles.

195
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,010
Happy birthday.

196
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,484
Okay. Whose?

197
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,825
I was going through your mail,
and it was on a form. Happy birthday.

198
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,299
Oh.

199
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,845
No! No blood! Not mine!

200
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,847
For the test.
Dr. House told us...

201
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,215
You're gonna steal
it! Sell it! No! No blood!

202
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,722
No! No blood! No! No blood!

203
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,724
Haldol, five milligrams, stat.

204
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,125
No! No! No!

205
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,722
No! No!

206
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,632
No! No! Oh, no!

207
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,364
N-No!

208
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,442
No.

209
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,744
<i>Well, good news. The lab
says it's not strep, so we're done.</i>

210
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,757
Wait a second.
No, <i>really</i> not strep.

211
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:41,226
The boys in the lab, sure, they're
hard drinkers, but they're pros, you know.

212
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,854
Plus, your kid actually has
none of the symptoms for strep.

213
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,866
It was quicker running the test
than arguing with you. My point is, go!

214
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,869
I just wanted to ask
your opinion, Doctor.

215
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,368
She's having a birthday
party next week, and

216
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,915
she's upset that I'm
getting a sugarless cake.

217
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,875
The other kids hate it.
This is why you're here.

218
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,878
Sugar is the leading
cause of obesity in America.

219
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,881
You want a doctor to scare
her about the dangers of sugar.

220
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,884
She needs to get her
weight under control.

221
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,557
Well, you know, I feel
sorry for those other

222
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:10,390
kids, Wendy, who don't
have a mom like yours...

223
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,894
A mom who knows that sugar causes heart
disease, appendicitis and athlete's foot.

224
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,897
That's not fair. Oh,
yes, it is. No, I get it.

225
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,401
You want her to slim down a little so
she can wear pretty clothes like yours.

226
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,402
Love the bracelets.

227
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,405
Hey, what about matching
outfits? You could be twins.

228
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,873
She can't be your daughter.

229
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,467
It's impossible! You
look way too young.

230
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,479
Happy birthday.

231
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,481
Get the kid a damned
ice cream cake.

232
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,677
<i>Dr. Wyland to Obstetrics.
Dr. Wyland, Obstetrics.</i>

233
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,915
- You drugged her.
- Actually, I didn't.

234
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,600
I've taken her off all medication.
Your guy Foreman gave her Haldol.

235
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,288
We needed blood for tests. I
assumed that was the only way to get it.

236
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,423
He knocked her out. Look, I have
a cane, and I know how to use it.

237
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,490
I hired you. You work for me.

238
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,195
Okay.

239
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,295
Can I go now, boss?

240
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,409
The Haldol changes her.

241
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,811
<i>She says it makes her soul
numb. Don't give it to her.</i>

242
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,287
"If there be rags enough,

243
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,189
he will know her name and be
well pleased remembering it."

244
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,428
You okay?

245
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,488
Old days.

246
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,569
"For in the old days,

247
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,572
"though she had young men's
praise and old men's blame,

248
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,609
among the poor, both old
and young gave her praise."

249
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,108
Oh!

250
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,444
Help! Somebody help!

251
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:58,797
<i>So, when I said no psych meds, I'm just
curious— which word didn’t you understand?</i>

252
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,801
The Haldol had nothing
to do with the bleed.

253
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,736
You know that. I used it
purely as a chemical restraint.

254
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,966
<i>Oh, great. Well,
that's good to hear.</i>

255
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,284
So she won't experience
any of those pesky little

256
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,670
side affects you get when
your motives aren't pure.

257
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,975
Oh— Those side
effects are so rare!

258
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,813
What, passing out, increased confusion,
depression? That's not gonna happen.

259
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,828
That's not gonna screw
up our diagnosis, 'cause

260
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,946
you just used it to
restrain her. I'm so relieved.

261
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,956
She spit in my face.

262
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,959
<i>That must have been
so frightening for you.</i>

263
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,986
<i>What was I supposed to do, tie her
down? Yeah. Anything but give her drugs.</i>

264
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,964
<i>That's basically my point.</i>

265
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,594
The clotting studies. Pretty fast.
Did you promise to date the entire lab?

266
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,036
No, I save that for emergencies.

267
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,473
I told them she bled out two units
and if it happened again, she'd die.

268
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,478
If it had happened at
home, she would have died.

269
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,310
The E.R. doc, he was
gonna send her home.

270
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,783
<i>- I used my best judgment.</i>
- It turns out your best judgment
is not good enough.

271
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:55,310
- Here's an idea—next time, use mine.
- I think they're choosing a movie.

272
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,153
Why did the patient bleed out?

273
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,819
The clotting studies
so far are normal.

274
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,829
Well, cover your ears if you
don't want me to spoil the ending.

275
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,560
Everything was normal,
except for a prolonged P.T. time.

276
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,128
- Which means what?
<i>- Usually it means whoever</i>
<i>drew the blood didn't do it right.</i>

277
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,538
Oh, that's right, 'cause
you drew the blood.

278
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:19,068
- But you were precise because you knew
the tube was purely for the P.T. study.
- That's right.

279
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,582
And I'm right with you. I trust
this result, for two reasons...

280
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,208
"A," because you
<i>are</i> a good doctor,

281
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,015
and "B," because five
milligrams of I.V. Haldol...

282
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,023
makes for a spectacularly
cooperative patient.

283
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,691
The prolonged P.T. time makes me
think she's got a vitamin "K" deficiency.

284
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,663
<i>Vitamin "K" would explain
the bleed, but not the clot.</i>

285
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,099
Without vitamin "K," protein "C" doesn't
work. Without protein "C," she clots.

286
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,104
Clotting and thinning
all at the same time.

287
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,539
What about another drug interacting with
Heparin, an antibiotic like ampicillin?

288
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,544
That would cause the bleed.
Clever, but she's not on ampicillin.

289
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:55,048
Two months ago, she complained of
a sore throat, and he got her ampicillin.

290
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,459
- Which she refused to take.
<i>- He just</i> said <i>she didn't take it.</i>

291
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,681
What is it, everybody lies except
for schizophrenics and their children?

292
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,713
It's more likely than malnourishment.
Why not scurvy or the plague?

293
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,350
Gee, I wish my idea was
as cool and with-it as yours.

294
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,624
What is yours, by the way?
Do you have one? Alcohol.

295
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,497
Simple. It causes immobility,
which explains the D.V.T.

296
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:19,767
It also causes cirrhosis, which explains
the bleed and the prolonged P.T. time.

297
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,741
- Let's ultrasound the liver.
<i>- Three theories.</i>

298
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,074
Check out her place
for ampicillin and diet.

299
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,080
Then ultrasound her liver.

300
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,311
Let's find out who's right
before she bleeds to death.

301
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,490
101.

302
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:59,144
So House says the kid is sensitive,
thinks he takes good care of her.

303
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:02,409
<i>But if we don't find anything, why let
him know we did it in the first place?</i>

304
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,416
What's the point?

305
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:09,217
Why not just make old Foreman
lift the key from the kid's backpack?

306
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,633
Looks like Luke sleeps
in the living room.

307
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,472
Nothing in there.

308
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,484
<i>He lays out her clothes?</i>

309
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,682
Enough organization, enough lists, you
think you can control the uncontrollable.

310
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,817
Fix her meds, fix her clothes,
maybe you can even fix her.

311
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,562
Pick that up on
your psych rotation?

312
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,608
Trifluoperazine,
Thorazine, Clozarile.

313
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,975
<i>Whew. They tried everything.</i>

314
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:10,312
The ampicillin—
Never touched it.

315
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:14,548
There goes Cameron's theory. Oh, God,
I hope it's not a vitamin "K" deficiency.

316
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,423
Damn.

317
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,432
<i>Breakfast, lunch and dinner.</i>

318
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,434
<i>House was right.</i>

319
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,939
That's the only
thing she'll eat. Yeah.

320
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,942
The problem is, you can't
actually live on this stuff.

321
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,946
I checked it out. I looked on the
box. All the nutritional values are solid.

322
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,948
There's plenty of
protein and calories.

323
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,043
Yeah, vitamin "A" and "C," but no
"K." That's why your mom got sick.

324
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,752
So what's the plan then?
Load her up with vitamin "K."

325
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:57,160
That's it? If it all checks out, you
can take her home in a couple of days.

326
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,458
Oh, God, you're
upset about something.

327
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,469
You're gonna open up to me
now, aren't you? It's all my fault.

328
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,543
Here we go.

329
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,606
Okay, I'm gonna say
this once: You have done

330
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,604
a very good job taking
care of your mother.

331
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,692
If this was all she'd
eat, then what else could

332
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,880
you do? Gosh, just being
a kid is a full-time job.

333
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,946
Shut up! I'm 18. I should be
able to take care of my mom.

334
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,556
I almost killed
her. Good example.

335
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:33,565
Just the time it takes to express those
ridiculous, self-centered teenage ideas.

336
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,692
I don't envy your schedule.

337
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,404
No pickles.

338
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,601
My mom doesn't like 'em either.

339
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,667
Smart woman.

340
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,814
Before she got sick, I didn't
like how bossy she was.

341
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:52,477
Always telling me what
to do, the right way to do it.

342
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,949
Never thought I'd miss that.

343
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,652
Oww.

344
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,354
You should get that looked at.

345
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,366
I still don't buy a vitamin "K"
deficiency. House was right.

346
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,369
That usually makes you
happy. Less work for us.

347
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,964
The kid feeds his mom a steady diet of
booze, and the problem is too many burgers?

348
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,975
The kid's in a tough situation.
You do what you gotta do to survive.

349
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,479
Feeding alcohol to an alcoholic
is not a survival technique.

350
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,879
Where I come from, if
it works— Yeah, right.

351
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,942
I'm rich. I couldn't possibly understand
what this kid is going through.

352
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:32,592
Just because you're drinking pricier stuff
doesn't mean you don't have a problem.

353
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,594
You've seen someone
stagger down that road?

354
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,597
No way vitamin "K"
is the whole story.

355
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,138
It's not broken.

356
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,140
See this, right here?

357
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,283
It's the epiphyseal
plate, otherwise known

358
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,508
as the "growth plate."
What's wrong with it?

359
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,241
Amazing thing, this bone.

360
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,341
If you know how to read it, it can
tell you how old someone really is.

361
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,649
- Exactly how old.
- Great.

362
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,554
Mmm, not even 15.

363
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,558
Almost though.

364
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,390
<i>Two weeks away. Maybe a month.</i>

365
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,162
Last week. I was 15 last week.

366
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,032
Happy birthday to both of us.

367
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,936
If you're gonna lie
though, go big. Go 21.

368
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,941
That way you won't need your
crazy mom to help you buy vodka.

369
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,501
Uh, great. Thanks for the tip.

370
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,653
Now, when I bring my
mom home, is there anything

371
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:32,813
I need to know about
taking care of her?

372
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,821
I suppose your biggest
worry isn't the booze.

373
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,824
You're 15, basically no mom.

374
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,237
If Child Welfare let
kids get away with that,

375
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:41,570
they wouldn't need
those nice foster homes,

376
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,529
and that would make them sad.

377
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,497
They'd put her someplace too.

378
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,556
My life is working.

379
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,103
Not the word I'd use.

380
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,732
Most 15-year-old kids are doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

381
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,742
You know, they're huffing
glue, catching crabs.

382
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,438
If you turn me in, I'll sue you.

383
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,707
That's privileged information.

384
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,306
Oh, relax. It's not
even your X-ray.

385
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,489
She's awfully calm.

386
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,548
House wrote new orders.

387
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,427
There's a little bit of
scarring. Not much.

388
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,433
Not enough to— It's cirrhosis.

389
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,594
Oh, but she doesn't drink.

390
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,661
Congratulations. You win.

391
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,299
Actually,

392
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,512
no one wins.

393
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,515
Tumor. Cystic?

394
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,949
<i>Solid mass.</i>

395
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,078
<i>Cancer.</i>

396
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:46,926
<i>The vitamin "K" caused the
D.V.T. and aggravated the liver,</i>

397
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,928
but the tumor's the
real reason for the bleed.

398
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,157
The tumor's the problem.

399
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,700
<i>Mrs. Palmero, I'm Dr. Wilson.</i>

400
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,397
I'm afraid I have some bad
news from your ultrasound.

401
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,405
You have cancer.

402
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,340
It's big. 5.8 centimeters.

403
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,139
We do nothing, she dies
from liver failure within 60 days.

404
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,646
- She needs a transplant.
<i>- That's</i> gonna happen.

405
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:46,114
- She's 38 years old. She's a mother.
- She's a schizophrenic mother with no money,
on the public dole, in fact,

406
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,586
who knocks back vodka every
time a breeze blows her way.

407
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,920
Mickey Mantle had a whole bar
named after him. He got a transplant.

408
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,926
Yeah, well, Lucy
can't switch-hit.

409
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,360
Plan "B" — Surgery
to resect the tumor.

410
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,326
Joe Bergin does the
gamma knife thing. Laser

411
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,229
cauterizes while it
cuts, saves more liver.

412
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,996
The tumor's way too big.
He won't even consider it.

413
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,436
Not a big risk-taker, Bergin. Won't
even drink milk on its expiration date.

414
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,270
He has no discretion. 5.8 centimeters
is past the surgical guidelines.

415
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,178
Would he do it at 4.6?

416
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,684
Why don't we just say
it's zero? Then we don't

417
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,276
need him at all. Tumors
grow, they don't shrink.

418
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,344
This one does.

419
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,725
Ninety-five percent ethanol.

420
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,058
The ethanol dehydrates
the tumor cells.

421
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,121
Literally sucks them dry.

422
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,934
It shrinks the
tumor temporarily.

423
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,993
How temporarily?

424
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,830
Well, if we're lucky,

425
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,703
just long enough
to fool the surgeon.

426
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,984
<i>Dr. Shopius, report
to Psych Exam.</i>

427
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,289
<i>Dr. Shopius, Psych Exam.</i>

428
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,295
Good morning, Dr. House.

429
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,297
Good morning, Dr. Cuddy.

430
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,299
Love that outfit.

431
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,995
It says, "I'm professional,
but I'm still a woman."

432
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,504
Actually, it sort of
yells the second part.

433
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,507
Yeah, and your big
cane is real subtle too.

434
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,705
Gotta go. Those running noses aren't
just gonna start walking on their own.

435
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,304
The clinic can wait.

436
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,941
How long? Maybe we
could catch a movie.

437
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:28,112
You should know by now my
doctors have no secrets from me.

438
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,490
I don't believe it.

439
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,049
Who came running to Mommy?

440
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,119
It doesn't matter who. The point
is, I know exactly what you did.

441
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,323
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

442
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,337
Somebody knows about a bad
thing you did. That's a big field.

443
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:49,637
But somebody you think might've
told me. That narrows it down quite a bit.

444
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,644
Someone who views me
as a maternal authority figure.

445
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,045
<i>A young person perhaps? How am
I doing? Think I'm gonna get there?</i>

446
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,051
Presumably hospital business.
How many patients— <i>It's Cameron.</i>

447
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,053
She found out about my birthday.

448
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,519
I thought she told you and
I'd have to stand here and

449
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:06,058
smile while you gave me a
sweatshirt or a fruit basket.

450
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,526
You know, made me feel
that deep sense of belonging.

451
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:13,157
Actually, I was just gonna remind you,
you owe me six clinic hours this week.

452
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,224
Oops.

453
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,076
Hi, this is Dr. Cuddy.

454
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:28,137
I need all the charts on
Dr. House's current patients.

455
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,886
I've tried everything. Mm-hmm.

456
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:39,186
"Pulling the tongue, ice packs
on the throat, hitting yourself,

457
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,489
the groin pinch."

458
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:46,156
Well, you've certainly covered
all the normal medical bases.

459
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,167
Uh, how are you
hitting yourself though?

460
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,897
Is it with an open hand
or a fist? Open hand.

461
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,906
Uh-huh. Well, that's— that's
how they teach it at Harvard Med.

462
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,965
How hard though?

463
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,837
I'm sorry. I missed that.
Could you do that again?

464
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,507
Uh...

465
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,517
That's—That's very good.

466
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,519
It's hiccups.

467
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,021
I need to speak with
you now. Mm-hmm.

468
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,023
I need to go pee-pee.

469
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,889
Dial it up a notch and
repeat. I'll be back.

470
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,572
Ooh. Girl in the boy's bathroom.

471
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,574
Very dramatic.

472
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,634
It must be very important,
what she has to say to me.

473
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,249
Yesterday your patient's
tumor was 5.8 centimeters.

474
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,842
Today it's 4.6. How
does that happen?

475
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,355
Well, at a guess, I'd say, "That
Dr. House must be really, really good.

476
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,357
Why am I wasting
him on hiccups?"

477
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,416
I wash before and after.

478
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,328
You also requisitioned
20 c.c.'s of ethanol.

479
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,334
What patient was that for?
Or are you planning a party?

480
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,393
Do me a favor.

481
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:03,269
I was gonna say
leave, but that works.

482
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,412
- You shrunk the tumor.
- Only way to get the guy
to do the surgery.

483
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,109
Fraud was the only way?

484
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,119
<i>There is a reason that
we have these guidelines.</i>

485
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,122
I know. To save lives.
Specifically, doctors' lives.

486
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,125
And not just their
lives, but their lifestyles.

487
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,629
Wouldn't want to operate on anyone really
sick. They might die and spoil our stats.

488
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,290
Bergin has a right to know
what he is operating on. <i>True.</i>

489
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:29,605
I got all focused on her right to live
and forgot. You do what you think is right.

490
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,513
You really didn't know?

491
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,209
No, I didn't.

492
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,218
And, frankly, I'm angry.

493
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,220
Which I'm guessing
is the correct response.

494
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,699
- Of course, I'll know better once
you tell me what you're talking about.
- Your birthday.

495
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,658
Oh.

496
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,661
Anger was a bad guess.

497
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,162
Well, normally, I'd put on
a festive hat and celebrate

498
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:01,826
the fact that the Earth has
circled the sun one more time.

499
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,836
I really didn't think it was
gonna make it this year,

500
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,305
but darn it if it wasn't the little
planet that could all over again.

501
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,741
It's a birthday. It's an
excuse to be happy.

502
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,802
You think that's lame?

503
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,373
Why are you here?
Did you buy me a pony?

504
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,411
I'm just waiting
for the surgery.

505
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,119
Yeah, well, go scrub in.

506
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,064
All right, we're
done. Close her up.

507
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:51,746
The tumor didn't just walk itself into a
bar and order up a double shot of ethanol.

508
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,252
Someone shrunk it down.

509
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,756
I'm sorry. It was
very, very wrong.

510
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,418
House is lucky I
didn't just close her up.

511
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,428
He tries it again,
that's what happens.

512
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,487
I'll pass it on.

513
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,368
<i>It looks like the
surgeon got it all,</i>

514
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,132
<i>but she's gonna have to
have some chemotherapy.</i>

515
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,640
<i>What kind is it?</i>

516
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,506
<i>Luke, stop writing.</i>

517
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,653
If you stop for a second,
it's not all gonna fall apart.

518
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,155
Give yourself a
break once in a while.

519
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,159
The fact is, your Mom's gonna have
an extra drink every now and then.

520
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,252
No. No. She won't. She doesn't.

521
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,263
Fine.

522
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,290
There are some things you
just can't fix. That's all I'm saying.

523
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:46,737
That's how you'd handle it,
something like this? You'd just give up?

524
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,041
No.

525
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,304
I'd do it just like you.

526
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,680
It's an infusion. She's gonna
have a drain in her abdomen.

527
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,118
You're going to have to
check for possible infection.

528
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,122
<i>Lucas Palmero?</i>

529
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,682
<i>Trina Wyatt, Child Services,
State of New Jersey.</i>

530
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,694
Can I help you?
This is a private room.

531
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,697
He's only 15 years old, a minor.

532
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,699
He's in a tough
living situation.

533
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,701
We're just here to help.

534
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,567
I don't need your help. Fifteen?

535
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:24,303
Lucas, you're gonna have
to come with us right now.

536
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,038
Where are you taking him?

537
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,513
Until the determination is made,
he'll be housed at Children's Services.

538
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:33,143
I don't want to be
"housed." I live with my mom.

539
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,710
<i>Not for the next few days.</i>

540
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,053
Come on. Let's not
make this difficult, huh?

541
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,926
<i>Mom?</i>

542
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,986
Mom?

543
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,123
I love you.

544
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:54,334
When the Mets
lost, you remember?

545
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,398
Yeah.

546
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,735
I remember.

547
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,371
I love you.

548
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,070
Cuddy didn't say anything about pushing
Bergin to finish the surgery? Not a word.

549
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,072
Some kind of mind game.
She's waiting for me to crack.

550
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,371
Well, either that or she's
just being nice. Yeah, right.

551
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,777
You said you wouldn't call.
You're a real bastard, you know.

552
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,412
Yeah, I get that a lot.

553
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,117
I don't think Mom's crazy.

554
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:58,768
"For in the old days, though she had
young men's praise and old men's blame,

555
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:03,172
among the poor, both old
and young gave her praise."

556
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,409
You called Social Services.

557
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,419
It was you.

558
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,012
N— No. No.

559
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,648
It's okay, it's okay. I get it.

560
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,995
He'll have an easier time
dealing with the system.

561
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,500
Sure, he won't be with his real
mother, but his real mother's sick.

562
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,059
Someone needs
to take care of him.

563
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,405
I'm not gonna live here.

564
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:39,843
What would his future have been,
taking you to chemo and back on the bus?

565
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,881
And even if the cancer's
in complete remission,

566
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,884
he'll still have a mother
who hears voices.

567
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,410
Talk no more.

568
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,422
Talk no more.

569
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,517
"Look what I do to him, Limpy."

570
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,120
You said that.

571
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,461
I checked the phone records.

572
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,894
Only one call from this room.

573
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,906
Smart, because they
charge you two bucks a call.

574
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,772
<i>It was to Social Services,
the State of New Jersey.</i>

575
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,973
<i>You're his mother. You
couldn't do it to him anymore.</i>

576
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,209
Good for you.

577
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,314
<i>Schizophrenics can
make rational decisions.</i>

578
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:28,952
On the small stuff, yeah— When
to sleep, what to drink, you know.

579
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,724
"No lemonade, but I'll take
some hemlock if you've got it."

580
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,731
Huh. Your man Socrates.

581
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,930
But giving up your son because it's better
for him, it's so sane, it's so rational.

582
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,940
Self-sacrifice is not a
symptom of schizophrenia.

583
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,942
It excludes the diagnosis.

584
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,945
She's not schizophrenic? Look, she's
36 years old when she first presents.

585
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,447
It's a little late, but
within the parameters.

586
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:53,144
The internist sends her to a shrink.
One shrink sends her to the next.

587
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,884
She tells them all she's
not crazy. The drugs don't

588
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:56,564
work. And why would they
if she's not a head case?

589
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,353
She got clearer when I
took her off the psych meds.

590
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,130
You think <i>I'm</i> crazy. Well,
yeah, but that's not the problem.

591
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,291
Didn't we just leave
your office? I like to walk.

592
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,696
<i>♪♪</i>

593
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,802
<i>♪♪</i>

594
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,529
Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters? Hi.

595
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,464
My name is Greg
House. I'm a doctor...

596
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:19,097
Oh, is that the time? I'm—Yeah. I'm
sorry. My watch must have stopped.

597
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,733
Uh, listen, you treated a patient about 18
months ago, a woman named Lucille Palmero.

598
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,801
I wondered if you
recalled running any tests...

599
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,741
at all.

600
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:34,249
Oh, how terribly foolish of
me, Doctor. Is it that late?

601
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,983
Yes, I'm calling from London, you
see? Must have got my times mixed up...

602
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,964
<i>I have a headache.
It's my only symptom.</i>

603
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,434
I go to see three doctors. The
neurologist tells me it's an aneurysm.

604
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,699
The immunologist
says I've got hay fever.

605
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,707
<i>The intensivist
can't be bothered.</i>

606
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,651
<i>Sends me to a shrink, who
tells me that I'm punishing</i>

607
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,253
<i>myself 'cause I want to
sleep with my mommy.</i>

608
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,476
Maybe you're just not
getting enough sleep?

609
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,772
<i>Pick your specialist,
you pick your disease.</i>

610
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,285
If it's not schizophrenia, what
else presents with psych symptoms?

611
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,947
- Porphyria.
- The Madness of King George.

612
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,287
What about that copper thing?
What's it called? It's genetic.

613
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,224
The body accumulates
too much copper.

614
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,762
Oh, um, uh, Wilson's Disease?

615
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,764
<i>Yeah. Very rare.</i>

616
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,766
Nice. I like it.

617
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,962
- If any of us did this, you'd fire us.
- Well, that's funny.

618
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,063
I thought I encouraged you to
question. You're not questioning.

619
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,574
You're hoping. You
want it to be Wilson's.

620
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,907
Boom. Give her a couple
of drugs, she's okay.

621
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,003
<i>July 1 7. An appointment
with a Dr. Karn.</i>

622
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,775
<i>She didn't keep it.
She never kept another</i>

623
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,641
<i>appointment with a
shrink he made after that.</i>

624
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,914
Karn is not a shrink. I looked
him up. He's an ophthalmologist.

625
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,421
Now why would she
want her eyes checked?

626
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,822
Wilson's presents with
cataracts, I think. Yes, it does.

627
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:52,159
It also causes slight cirrhosis, which
Dr. Chase so eagerly attributed to alcohol.

628
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,665
So what are we still doing here?

629
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,360
<i>Lucy!</i>

630
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,994
I don't think you're crazy.

631
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,869
Neither do I.

632
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,274
But I'm crazy. Come
on. Lean over here.

633
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,335
Come on.

634
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,681
That's it.

635
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,844
Put your hands on the bar
here and your chin in here.

636
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,854
Thank you.

637
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,288
You're gonna see
a bright light, okay?

638
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,293
Your body might be
accumulating too much copper.

639
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,728
If it is, this should help us see
something called Keyser-Fleischer rings...

640
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,866
<i>Copper-colored circles
around your corneas.</i>

641
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,799
<i>Wow.</i>

642
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,068
I guess we should start
treating her for Wilson's.

643
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,234
That's what I'd do.

644
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,254
<i>"I will talk no more of
books or the long war,</i>

645
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,915
<i>"but walk by the
dry thorn until I have</i>

646
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,956
<i>found some beggar
sheltering from the wind...</i>

647
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,331
<i>"and there manage the talk
until her name come round.</i>

648
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:08,806
<i>If there be rags enough, he will know her
name and be well pleased remembering it."</i>

649
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:15,375
"For in the old days, though she had
young men's praise and old men's blame,

650
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,816

and young gave her praise."

651
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,186
Hi, Mrs. Palmero.
Ready to go home?

652
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,298
Almost.

653
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,596
Mom?

654
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,109
How are you?

655
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,944
I'm good.

656
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,953
Oh!

657
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,546
Oh...

658
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,559
Oh, you really need a haircut.

659
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,110
Dr. House.

660
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,180
Luke, we're making
Dr. House wait.

661
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,782
That's okay. We're
just here for the music.

662
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,192
Luke, come on.

663
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,065
I'm being discharged.
I heard a rumor.

664
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,843
<i>Thank God I had cancer, huh?</i>

665
00:41:56,047 --> 00:42:00,542
- It's terrible having everybody
think you're nuts.
- Really?

666
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,156
I called to thank you.
Did you get my message?

667
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Yes.

668
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,228
You're welcome.

669
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,623
I'm never thanking
you. You turned me in.

670
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:20,830
I told you we were doing okay.
It was none of your business.

671
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,306
Look, I don't care
how you were living.

672
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,037
I just wanted
you out of my life.

673
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:30,543
That's why I had Dr. Cuddy
call Social Services.

674
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,400
You okay?

675
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,402
You were right.

676
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:55,736
It wasn't the D.V.T. It was
the schizophrenia. I know.

677
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,140
She's not nearly as
interesting anymore.

678
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,637
<i>Isn't it your birthday
around now?</i>

679
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,344
That's some bad hat, Harry.
