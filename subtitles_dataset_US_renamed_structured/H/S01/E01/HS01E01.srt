1
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,215
Why are you late? You're
not going to like the answer.

2
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,649
I already know the
answer. I missed the bus.

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,653
I don't doubt it. No
bus stops near Brad's.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,155
You spent the night, the alarm
didn't work— or maybe it did.

5
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,658
I didn't sleep with him. Girl,
either there's something...

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,660
I missed the bus!

7
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,706
There's something either very wrong
with you or something very wrong with him.

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,666
There's nothing wrong with him.
Please tell me you know that for a fact.

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,668
Melanie, I gotta go.
You're lying, aren't you?

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,069
I wouldn't lie to you.
Good morning, guys!

11
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,074
Good morning, Miss Rebecca!

12
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,906
Everybody's in their seats? Yes.

13
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:22,942
Okay. Sydney, why don't you
tell us what you did this weekend?

14
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,951
<i>She look—</i>

15
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,283
Come on, Sydney.
We know you're not shy.

16
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:31,621
How come we always have to tell you what
we did, and you never tell us what you did?

17
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,595
Okay.

18
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,756
<i>I had a really great weekend.</i>

19
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,858
- But you can't tell
Miss Melanie, okay?
- What did you do?

20
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,460
I made a new friend.

21
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,473
It's so much fun to
make new friends, isn't it?

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,008
Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,772
Did you tell your mom and
dad about your new friend?

24
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,014
Absolutely.

25
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,108
You should never keep
anything from your parents.

26
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,313
And I told mine...

27
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,819
Wha— -

28
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,064
Ca— Ba...

29
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,471
Ha— Ba—Cra...

30
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:30,551
C—A— L...

31
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,977
<i>H— E— "The!"</i>

32
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,920
<i>We know that word. "The."</i>

33
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,984
<i>Twenty-nine-year old female.
First seizure one month ago.</i>

34
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,351
<i>Lost the ability to speak.
Babbled like a baby.</i>

35
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,754
<i>Progressive deterioration
of mental status.</i>

36
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,759
<i>You see that? They all assume
I'm a patient because of this cane.</i>

37
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,763
So put on a white coat like the rest of us.
I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.

38
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,766
You see where the administration
might have a problem with that attitude?

39
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,768
People don't want a sick doctor.

40
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,771
That's fair enough. I
don't like healthy patients.

41
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,434
The 29-year old female— The
one who can't talk? I like that part.

42
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,103
She's my cousin.

43
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,613
And your cousin
doesn't like the diagnosis.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,615
I wouldn't either.

45
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,174
Brain tumor. She's
going to die. Boring.

46
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,522
No wonder you're such
a renowned diagnostician.

47
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,234
You don't need to actually know
anything to figure out what's wrong.

48
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,194
You're the oncologist. I'm just
a lowly infectious disease guy.

49
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,196
Yes. Just a simple
country doctor.

50
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,698
Brain tumors at her
age are highly unlikely.

51
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,962
She's 29. Whatever
she's got is highly unlikely.

52
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,014
The protein markers for the three most
prevalent brain cancers came up negative.

53
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,313
That's an H.M.O. lab.
Might as well have sent

54
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,635
it to a high school kid
with a chemistry set.

55
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,644
No family history.

56
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,646
I thought your
uncle died of cancer.

57
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,012
Other side. No environmental
factors. That you know of.

58
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,449
And she's not responding
to radiation treatment.

59
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,987
None of which is even
close to dispositive.

60
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:18,856
All it does is raise one question:
Your cousin goes to an H.M.O.?

61
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,123
<i>Come on. Why leave all
the fun for the coroner?</i>

62
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,461
<i>What's the point of putting together
a team if you’re not gonna use them?</i>

63
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:31,301
You've got three overqualified
doctors working for you, getting bored.

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,034
<i>It's a lesion.</i>

65
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,062
And the big green thing in the middle
of the bigger blue thing on a map...

66
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,166
is an island.

67
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,211
I was hoping for something
a bit more creative.

68
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,941
Shouldn't we be speaking to the
patient before we start diagnosing?

69
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,915
- Is she a doctor?
- No, but...

70
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,295
- Everybody lies.
- Dr. House doesn't like
dealing with patients.

71
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,255
Isn't treating patients
why we became doctors?

72
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,258
No. Treating illnesses is
why we became doctors.

73
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,591
Treating patients is what
makes most doctors miserable.

74
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,927
So you're trying to eliminate the
humanity from the practice of medicine?

75
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,560
If we don't talk to them, they can't
lie to us, and we can't lie to them.

76
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,264
Humanity's overrated.

77
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,384
- I don't think it's a tumor.
- First year medical school—if you hear
hoof beats, you think horses, not zebras.

78
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,240
Are you in first year
medical school?

79
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,342
No. First of all, there's
nothing on the CAT scan.

80
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,350
Second of all,
if this is a horse,

81
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,130
then her kindly family
doctor in Trenton makes the

82
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:28,030
obvious diagnosis, and it
never gets near this office.

83
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,649
Differential diagnosis, people.

84
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,627
If it's not a tumor, what are the
suspects? Why couldn't she talk?

85
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,096
<i>Aneurysm, stroke or some
other ischemic syndrome.</i>

86
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,656
- Get her a contrast M.R.I.
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

87
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,396
- Mad cow?
- Mad zebra.

88
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,165
<i>Wernicke's encephalopathy.</i>

89
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,105
No. Blood thiamine
level was normal.

90
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,472
The lab in Trenton could have
screwed up the blood tests.

91
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,172
I assume it's a corollary if
“people lie" that "people screw up."

92
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:58,549
Redraw the blood tests and get her
scheduled for that contrast M.R.I. ASAP.

93
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,951
Let's find out what kind of
zebra we're treating here.

94
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,033
<i>Radiology, please call the page.</i>

95
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,297
<i>Radiology, please call the page.</i>

96
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,838
I was expecting you in
my office 20 minutes ago.

97
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,412
Really? Well, that's
odd because I had no

98
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:29,258
intention of being in your
office 20 minutes ago.

99
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,957
You think we have
nothing to talk about? No. I

100
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:32,828
just can't think of
anything I'd be interested in.

101
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,287
I sign your paychecks.
I have tenure.

102
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,288
Are you gonna grab my cane now, stop
me from leaving? That would be juvenile.

103
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,779
I can still fire you if you're not doing
your job. I'm here from 9:00 to 5:00.

104
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,637
Your billings are practically
nonexistent. Rough year.

105
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,642
You ignore requests for consults.
I call back. Sometimes I misdial.

106
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,645
You're six years behind on
your obligations to the clinic.

107
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,648
See? I was right. This
doesn't interest me.

108
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,651
Six years times three weeks—
You owe me better than four months.

109
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,210
It's 5:00. I'm going home.

110
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,222
To what?

111
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,281
Nice.

112
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,896
Look, Dr. House, the only
reason why I don't fire you...

113
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,899
is because your reputation is still
worth something to this hospital.

114
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,198
Excellent. We have a point of
agreement— You're not gonna fire me.

115
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,205
Your reputation won't
last if you don't do your job.

116
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,436
The clinic is part of your
job. I want you to do your job.

117
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,776
But, as the philosopher Jagger once
said, "You can't always get what you want."

118
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,023
You're not my doctor.
Are you Dr. House?

119
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,218
Thankfully, no. I'm Dr. Chase.

120
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,227
Dr. House is the head
of diagnostic medicine.

121
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,595
He's very busy, but he has
taken a keen interest in your case.

122
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,566
We inject
gadolinium into a vein.

123
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,422
It distributes itself throughout
your brain and acts as

124
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:04,202
a contrast material for the
magnetic resonance imager.

125
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,314
Basically, whatever's in your
head lights up like a Christmas tree.

126
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,180
- It might make you feel
a little light-headed.
<i>- Dr. Cameron.</i>

127
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,847
I'm sorry. I have to stop
you. There is a problem.

128
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,447
You pulled my authorization!

129
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,584
Yes. Why are you yelling?

130
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,651
No M.R.I.'s, no
imaging studies, no labs.

131
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,755
You also can't make
long distance phone calls.

132
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:28,477
- If you're going to fire me,
have the guts to face me.
- Or photocopies. You're still yelling.

133
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,369
I'm angry! You're
risking a patient's life.

134
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,272
- I assume those are two separate points.
- You showed me disrespect.

135
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,652
You embarrassed me. And as long
as I work here, you have no legal...

136
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,611
Is the yelling
designed to scare me?

137
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:43,116
Because I'm not sure what it is I'm
supposed to be scared of. More yelling?

138
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,118
That's not scary.

139
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,485
That you're going to hurt me? That's scary.
But I'm pretty sure I can outrun you.

140
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,493
Oh, I looked into that
philosopher you quoted—Jagger.

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,394
<i>And you’re right, you can't
always get what you want.</i>

142
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,366
But as it turns out, "If you try
sometimes, you get what you need."

143
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,404
So, because you want
me to treat patients,

144
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,498
you're not letting
me treat patients?

145
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,406
I need you to do your job.

146
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,519
Do the M.R.I. She folded.

147
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,979
I've got to do four
hours a week in this

148
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,619
clinic until I make up
the time I've missed.

149
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,863
2054. I'll be caught up in 2054.

150
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,769
You better love this
cousin a whole lot.

151
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,837
All right, Rebecca, I know you may
feel a little claustrophobic in there,

152
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,140
<i>but we need you to remain still.</i>

153
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,343
<i>Okay, we're going to begin.</i>

154
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,122
I don't feel so good.

155
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,789
<i>It's all right.
Just try to relax.</i>

156
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,462
Rebecca?

157
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,566
<i>Rebecca?</i>

158
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,286
Rebecca?

159
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,755
Get her out of there. Oh,
she probably fell asleep.

160
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,156
She's exhausted. She was
claustrophobic 30 seconds ago.

161
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,068
She's not sleeping. We
gotta get her out of there.

162
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,205
It'll just be another minute.

163
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,905
If she's having an
allergic reaction to the

164
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,589
gadolinium, she'll be
dead in two minutes.

165
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,030
Hold her neck. All right.

166
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,334
Oh, she's ashen.

167
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,374
She's not breathing. Epi.5.

168
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,774
Come on.

169
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,778
I can't ventilate.

170
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,351
Too much edema. Where's
the surgical airway kit?

171
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,375
<i>Yep. Coming.</i>

172
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,055
Good call.

173
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,610
<i>We'll get that tube out
of your throat later today.</i>

174
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,377
Just get some
rest for now, okay?

175
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,781
Told you. You
can't trust people.

176
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,789
She probably knew she
was allergic to gadolinium.

177
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,985
Figured it was an easy way to get
someone to cut a hole in her throat.

178
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,928
Can't get a picture. Gonna
have to get a thousand words.

179
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,524
You actually want me to talk
to the patient, get a history?

180
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,887
We need to know if there's
some genetic or environmental

181
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:57,934
cause that's triggering
an inflammatory response.

182
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,939
I thought everybody lied.

183
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,204
Truth begins in lies.

184
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,268
Think about it.

185
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,775
That doesn't mean
anything, does it?

186
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,122
<i>12:52 p.m. Dr. House checks
in. Please write that down.</i>

187
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,124
Do you have cable
TV here somewhere?

188
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,126
<i>General Hospital</i>
starts in eight minutes.

189
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,128
No TV, but we've got patients.

190
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,630
Can't you give out the aspirin
yourself? I'll do paperwork.

191
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,676
I made sure your first case was an
interesting one. Cough just won't go away?

192
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,679
Runny nose looks a funny color? Patient
admitted complaining of back spasms.

193
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,745
Oh? I think I read about
something like that in the

194
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,834
<i>New England Journal of
Medicine.</i> Patient is orange.

195
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,138
The color? No, the fruit.

196
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,645
You mean yellow. It's
jaundice. I mean orange.

197
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,908
Well, how orange? It's
probably— Exam room one.

198
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,143
<i>Dr. Kahn, you're
needed in pediatrics.</i>

199
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:50,220
I was playing golf and my cleats got stuck.
It hurt a little, but I kept playing.

200
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,418
The next morning, I
could barely stand up.

201
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,691
Well, you're smiling, so I take
it that means this isn't serious.

202
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,924
What's that? What are you doing?

203
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,900
Painkillers.

204
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,870
Oh, for you. For your leg.
No, 'cause they're yummy.

205
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,066
<i>You want one? Make
your back feel better.</i>

206
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,544
Unfortunately, you
have a deeper problem.

207
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,911
Your wife is having an affair.

208
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,042
- What?
- You're orange, you moron.

209
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,348
<i>It's one thing for
you not to notice,</i>

210
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,392
but if your wife hasn't
picked up on the fact that her

211
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,633
husband has changed colors,
she's just not paying attention.

212
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,666
By the way, do you
consume just a ridiculous

213
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,492
amount of carrots
and megados vitamins?

214
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,321
<i>Carrots turn you yellow,
the niacin turns you</i>

215
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,089
<i>red. Find some finger
paint and do the math.</i>

216
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,100
And get a good lawyer.

217
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,140
Deep breath.

218
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,733
It's cold.

219
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,904
He's been using his inhaler?

220
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,914
Not in the past few
days. He's, um, only 10.

221
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,746
I worry about children taking
such strong medicine so frequently.

222
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,720
What happened to your leg?

223
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,780
Your doctor probably was concerned
about the strength of the medicine too.

224
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,157
She probably weighed that danger
against the danger of not breathing.

225
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:05,790
Oxygen is so important during those
prepubescent years. Don't you think?

226
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,801
<i>Okay, I'm gonna assume nobody
has ever told you what asthma is.</i>

227
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,235
Or if they have, you had
other things on your mind.

228
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,832
A stimulant triggers cells
in your child's airways...

229
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,469
<i>to release substances that inflame the
air passages and cause them to contract.</i>

230
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,912
<i>Mucus production increases,
the cell lining starts to shed.</i>

231
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,507
But the steroids— -

232
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,248
<i>the steroids stop
the inflammation.</i>

233
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,650
The more often this happens...

234
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,354
What? The more often
this happens, what?

235
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:38,421
Forget it. If you don't trust
steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors.

236
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,696
<i>My mother passed
away four years ago.</i>

237
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:47,035
She had a heart attack, and my father
broke his back doing construction...

238
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,371
<i>♪♪</i>

239
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,435
It's House. It's
urgent. I'm sorry.

240
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,579
You couldn't have knocked?

241
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,679
Steroids. Give her steroids.
High doses of prednisone.

242
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,801
You're looking for support for a
diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis?

243
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,249
Inflammation of blood
vessels in the brain is

244
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:17,679
awfully rare, especially
for someone her age.

245
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,605
- So is a tumor. Her sed rate is elevated.
- Mildly.

246
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,074
That could mean
anything. Or nothing.

247
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,078
Yeah, I know. I have no
reason to think that it's vasculitis.

248
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,080
Except that it could be.

249
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,753
If the blood vessels are
inflamed, that's gonna look

250
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,627
exactly like what we saw on
the M.R.I. from Trenton County,

251
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,984
and the pressure is gonna
cause neurological symptoms.

252
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,921
- We can't diagnose that without a biopsy.
- Yes, we can.

253
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,254
We treat her. If she gets
better, we know we're right.

254
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,693
- And if we're wrong?
- Then we learn something else.

255
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,196
Why steroids?

256
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,203
Just part of your treatment.

257
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,068
You haven't had many visitors.

258
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,233
No boyfriend? Three dates.

259
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,608
I wouldn't have stood by
him if he were vomiting all day.

260
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,011
What about work? You
must have friends from work.

261
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,881
Pretty much everybody
I like is five years old.

262
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,620
The nurse said you're
stopping my radiation.

263
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:13,118
We're just trying some
alternative medication.

264
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,560
So where's your family from then? Steroids
aren't an alternative to radiation.

265
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,825
The tests weren't
really conclusive.

266
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,833
We're treating
you for vasculitis.

267
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,893
It's the inflammation of
blood vessels in the brain.

268
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,906
I-It's not a tumor?

269
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,965
I don't have a tumor?

270
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,737
You should have told her the
truth— It's a long shot guess.

271
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,250
Thank you. If House
is right, no harm.

272
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,684
If he's wrong, I've given a dying
woman a couple days' hope.

273
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,417
False hope. If there was any other type
available, I would have given her that.

274
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,266
<i>Why are you
smelling Billy's pants?</i>

275
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm not. Looked like you were.

276
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,833
- I was smelling the floor.
- Oh.

277
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,740
Do you have any
pets in this class?

278
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,109
No. But we used to have a gerbil,
but Carly L. dropped a book on it.

279
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,114
Careless.

280
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,141
- Do you need to smell it?
- No. I'm smelling for mold.

281
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,154
I don't need to smell it.

282
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,751
You could smell our parrot.

283
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:19,454
You said you didn't have
any pets in this class.

284
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,517
A parrot is a bird.

285
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,290
Listen, Jackson's
not the father...

286
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,562
<i>Parrots are the primary
source of psittacosis.</i>

287
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,294
It's not the parrot.

288
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:32,270
And psittacosis can lead to nerve
problems and neurological complications.

289
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,603
How many kids were
in the class? Twenty.

290
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,109
How many are home
sick? None, but...

291
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,085
None. But you figured
that five-year-olds are more

292
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:42,808
serious about bird
hygiene than their teacher?

293
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,962
<i>Have you been through her
home? She lives in Trenton.</i>

294
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,215
I can go up to her room tomorrow
morning, ask her for the key.

295
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,349
Would the police call for permission before
dropping by to check out a crime scene?

296
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,180
It's not a crime scene.
As far as I know,

297
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:56,157
she's running a meth
lab out of her basement.

298
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,144
She's a kindergarten
teacher. And if I were a

299
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:00,324
kindergarten student I
would trust her implicitly.

300
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,661
Okay. I'll give you
a "for instance."

301
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,639
<i>The lady back there...</i>

302
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,142
who made your egg
salad sandwich...

303
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,043
Her eyes look glassy.
Did you notice that?

304
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,549
<i>Now, hospital policy is
to stay home if you’re sick.</i>

305
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,313
But if you're making $8.00 an hour, then
you kind of need the $8.00 an hour, right?

306
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,346
<i>And the sign in the
bathroom says that</i>

307
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,824
<i>employees must wash
after using the facilities,</i>

308
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,804
but I figure that somebody
who wipes snot on a sleeve

309
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,488
isn't hyper concerned
about sanitary conditions.

310
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,055
So what do you think—
Should I trust her?

311
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,763
I want you to check the patient's home
for contaminants, garbage, medication.

312
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,549
I can't just break
into someone's house.

313
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,569
Isn't that how you got
into the Felkers' home?

314
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,171
Yeah, I know.

315
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,276
Court records are sealed. You
were 16. It was a stupid mistake.

316
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,084
But your old gym teacher has a big
mouth. Should write a thank-you note.

317
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,557
- I should thank him?
- Well...

318
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,626
I needed somebody around
here with street smarts.

319
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,364
Okay? Who knows when they're
being conned, knows how to con.

320
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,029
I should sue you.

321
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,302
Pretty sure you can't sue
somebody for wrongful hiring.

322
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:20,074
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire
me for not breaking into some lady's house.

323
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,126
Doing research. People
are fascinating, aren't they?

324
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,425
Why are you giving
Adler steroids?

325
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,628
Because she's my patient. That's what you
do with patients— you give them medicine.

326
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,636
You don't prescribe
medicine based on guesses.

327
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,797
At least we don't since
Tuskegee and Mengele.

328
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,808
You're comparing
me to a Nazi? Nice.

329
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,071
I'm stopping the treatment.

330
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,651
She's my patient.
It's my hospital.

331
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,653
I did not get her sick.

332
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,629
She is not an experiment.
I have a legitimate

333
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,157
theory about what's
wrong with her.

334
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,159
With no proof.

335
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,159
There's never any proof.

336
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,841
Five different doctors
come up with five

337
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,789
different diagnoses based
on the same evidence.

338
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,164
You don't have <i>any</i> evidence.

339
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:18,534
And nobody knows anything, huh? Then
how is it you always think you're right?

340
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,507
I don't. I just find it hard to
operate on the opposite assumption.

341
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,511
And why are you so
afraid of making a mistake?

342
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:29,037
Because I'm a doctor. Because
when we make mistakes, people die.

343
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,106
Oh, come on.

344
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,111
People used to have more
respect for cripples, you know.

345
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,116
They didn't really.

346
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:48,199
So how you feeling?
Much better, thanks.

347
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,896
<i>Are you Dr. House? I
thought he was a he, but—</i>

348
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,496
No.

349
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,599
Don't eat too much, too fast.

350
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,667
Thank him for me.

351
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,270
Right.

352
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,926
Should I discontinue
the treatment, boss?

353
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,986
You got lucky.

354
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,358
Cool, huh?

355
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,572
<i>Okay, once again.</i>

356
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,243
Good.

357
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,745
Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?

358
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:38,512
Well, you might run into him
at the movies or on the bus.

359
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,610
Is he a good man?

360
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,350
He's a good doctor.

361
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,756
Can you be one
without the other?

362
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,626
Don't you have to care about
people? Caring is a good motivator.

363
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,799
He's found something else.

364
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,561
Feel this, both sides?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

365
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,631
Okay, squeeze.
Harder. All right.

366
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,609
He's your friend, huh?

367
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,805
Yeah.

368
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,314
Does he care about you?

369
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,613
I think so. You don't know?

370
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,917
As Dr. House likes to
say, "Everybody lies."

371
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,784
It's not what people
say. It's what they do.

372
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,288
Yeah. He cares about me.

373
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,994
<i>I can't see.</i>

374
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:38,144
I can't... see.

375
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,919
A little help in here!

376
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,766
<i>Your chest will
be sore for a while.</i>

377
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,806
We needed to shock you
to get your heart going.

378
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:14,611
Okay, can you arrange
these to tell a story?

379
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,162
<i>She couldn't put them in order.</i>

380
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:34,325
Could the damage have been caused
by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?

381
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,235
No. I gave her the same test
five minutes later. She did just fine.

382
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,831
The altered mental status is
intermittent, just like the verbal skills.

383
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,842
So what now?

384
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,970
Given the latest symptoms, it's clearly
growing deeper into the brain stem.

385
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,413
Soon, she won't be able to walk.

386
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,918
She'll go blind permanently, and
then the respiratory center will fail.

387
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,920
How long do we have?

388
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,866
If it's a tumor, we're talking a month
or two. If it's infectious, a few weeks.

389
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,453
If it's vascular, that'll probably
be fastest of all. Maybe a week.

390
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,656
We're gonna stop all treatment.

391
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,377
I still think it's a tumor. I think
we should go back to the radiation.

392
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,336
She didn't respond
to the radiation.

393
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,339
Well, maybe we didn't
see the effect until

394
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,602
after we started steroids.
No, it's not a tumor.

395
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,644
<i>Those steroids did something.
I just don't know what.</i>

396
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,942
So we're just gonna do nothing?
We're just gonna watch her die?

397
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,441
Yeah, we're gonna
watch her die. Specifically,

398
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:26,543
we're gonna watch
how fast she's dying.

399
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,214
<i>You just told us— Each
diagnosis has its own time frame.</i>

400
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,487
When we see how fast it's
killing her, we'll know what it is.

401
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,495
And by then, maybe there's
nothing we can do about it.

402
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,622
<i>There's got to be
something we can do.</i>

403
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,563
Something better
than watching her die.

404
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,124
Well, I got nothing.

405
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,194
How about you?

406
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,576
Bastard.

407
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,579
Oh, Cameron. I need you for
a couple of hours. What's up?

408
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,632
When you break into
someone's house, it's better

409
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,583
to have a white chick
with you. Adler's house?

410
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,799
Why don't we just ask
her for her keys? For all we

411
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:03,213
know, she'll be running a
meth lab out of her basement.

412
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm tired a lot.

413
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:10,154
Any other reason why you think you
might have chronic fatigue syndrome?

414
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,255
It's kind of the
definition, isn't it?

415
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,357
It's kind of the
definition of getting older.

416
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,001
I had a couple headaches
last month, a mild fever.

417
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:20,031
Sometimes I can't sleep, and
I have trouble concentrating.

418
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,200
Apparently not while researching
this stuff on the Internet.

419
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:27,076
I was thinking it also
might be fibromyalgia.

420
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,283
Excellent diagnosis.

421
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,251
Is there anything for that?

422
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:39,280
You know, I think
there just might be.

423
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:43,261
I need 36 Vicodin
and change for a dollar.

424
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,648
Exam room two.

425
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,424
House doesn't
believe in pretense.

426
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,791
Figures life's too short and too
painful. So he just says what he thinks.

427
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,326
Nothing interesting
in the garbage.

428
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,163
"I say what I think" is just another
way of saying "I'm an assho"...

429
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,506
Well, if you wanted to be judged
for your medical prowess only,

430
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,008
maybe you shouldn't have
broken into someone's home.

431
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,067
I was 16.

432
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,605
Don't know about ticks, but
her dog's definitely got fleas.

433
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:42,346
I managed to make it to
17 without a criminal record.

434
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,359
Yeah?

435
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:51,363
Well, you obviously didn't
grow up in my neighborhood.

436
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,867
That's right. You stole a loaf of bread
to feed your starving family. Right?

437
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,868
You always eat during break-ins?

438
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,372
Am I supposed to respect their food
more than I respect their DVD players?

439
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,873
You want some? <i>No.</i>

440
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,307
<i>You gonna go
hungry until she dies?</i>

441
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,674
No. <i>You know what?</i>

442
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,976
After centuries of slavery,
decades of civil rights marches...

443
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,951
and, more significantly, living like a
monk, never getting less than a 4.0 G.P.A.,

444
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,272
you don't think it's kind
of disgusting I get one of

445
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,616
the top jobs in the country
because I'm a delinquent?

446
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,451
We'll eat, then we'll
tear up the carpet.

447
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,698
You went to Hopkins, right?

448
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,666
Yep.

449
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,000
So you went to a better school than I
did. You got better grades than I did.

450
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,006
So how did you get the job?

451
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,474
You stab a guy in a bar fight?

452
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,052
<i>Nothing.</i>

453
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,487
It's not a tumor. She's
getting worse too fast.

454
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,014
<i>- She can't stand up.</i>
- No toxins? No medications?

455
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,754
Nothing that would
explain these symptoms.

456
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,819
Family history of
neurological problems?

457
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,229
Not that I could tell from
her underwear drawer.

458
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,734
<i>You said "nothing that would
explain these symptoms."</i>

459
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,430
What did you find that <i>doesn't</i>
explain these symptoms?

460
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:10,766
Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat
this patient under false pretenses.

461
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,936
<i>Adler's not his cousin.</i>

462
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,090
That's ridiculous. Ask her
yourself. Can we get ba...

463
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,606
- She's not Jewish.
- Rachel Adler's not Jewish?

464
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:22,177
I had ham at her apartment.

465
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,281
Dr. Foreman, a lot of
Jews have non-Jewish

466
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:26,453
relatives, and most of
us don't keep kosher.

467
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,249
<i>I can see getting through
high school without</i>

468
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,138
<i>learning a thing about
Jews, but medical school?</i>

469
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,599
Okay, maybe she’s Jewish, but
she's definitely not your cousin.

470
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,032
<i>Really? This guy is—</i>

471
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,765
<i>You don't even know her name. You
called her Rachel. Her name is Rebecca.</i>

472
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,068
Yes. Yes, her name is Rebecca.

473
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,109
I-I call her Rachel.

474
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,546
You idiot! Listen, he's...

475
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,606
Not you. Him.

476
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,450
<i>- You said you didn't find anything.</i>
- Everything I found was in my...

477
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,921
- You found ham.
- So?

478
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,322
Where there's ham, there's pork.

479
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:03,226
Where there's pork,
there's neurocysticercosis.

480
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,821
Tapeworm? You think
she's got a worm in her brain?

481
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,476
It fits. Could have been living there
for years. Never occurred to me that...

482
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,423
Millions of people eat
ham every day. It's quite

483
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,232
a leap to think that's
she's got a tapeworm.

484
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,800
Okay, Mr. Neurologist,
what happens when you

485
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,402
give steroids to a person
who has a tapeworm?

486
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:21,140
<i>They— They get a little better,
and— and then they get worse.</i>

487
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,777
Just like Rebecca Adler did.

488
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,989
In a typical case, if you
don't cook pork well enough,

489
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,558
<i>you digest live tapeworm larvae.</i>

490
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,866
<i>They've got these little hooks,</i>

491
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,316
they grab onto your bowel, they
live, they grow up, they reproduce.

492
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,710
Reproduce? There's only one
lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.

493
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,145
That's because this
is not a typical case.

494
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,173
Tapeworm can produce
20,000 to 30,000 eggs a day.

495
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,186
<i>Guess where they go? Out.</i>

496
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,188
<i>Not all of them.</i>

497
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,962
<i>Unlike the larvae, the
egg can pass right through</i>

498
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,717
<i>the walls of the intestines
into the bloodstream.</i>

499
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,059
<i>And where does the
bloodstream go? Everywhere.</i>

500
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,328
As long as it's healthy, the immune
system doesn't even know it's there.

501
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,992
<i>The worm builds a wall,
uses secretions to shut down</i>

502
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,532
<i>the body's immune
response and control fluid flow.</i>

503
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,404
It's really very beautiful.

504
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,035
As long as it's healthy.
So what do we do?

505
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,047
Call a vet, nurse the
little guy back to health?

506
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,050
It's too late for
that. It's dying.

507
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,521
<i>And as it dies, this parasite loses the
ability to control the host's defenses.</i>

508
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,582
<i>The immune system wakes up, attacks
the worm, and everything starts to swell.</i>

509
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,686
<i>And that is very
bad for the brain.</i>

510
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,391
<i>It could still be a
hundred other things.</i>

511
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,661
<i>The eosinophil count was normal.</i>

512
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,567
- It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.
- Proving nothing.

513
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,768
No, no, no, no. It— Don't you see? It
fits. It's perfect. It explains everything.

514
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,676
- But it proves nothing.
- I can prove it by treating it.

515
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,713
No, you can't.

516
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,376
I was just with her. She doesn't
want any more treatments.

517
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,943
She doesn't want any more experiments.
She wants to go home and die.

518
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,505
Would you excuse us, please?

519
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,746
I'm Dr. House.

520
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,379
It's good to meet you.

521
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,759
You're being an idiot.

522
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,924
You have a
tapeworm in your brain.

523
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,867
It's not pleasant, but if we don't do
anything, you'll be dead by the weekend.

524
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,239
Have you actually seen the worm?

525
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,279
When you're all better,
I'll show you my diplomas.

526
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,110
You were sure I
had vasculitis too.

527
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,117
Now I can't walk and
I'm wearing a diaper.

528
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,210
What's this treatment
gonna do for me?

529
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,689
I'm not talking about a
treatment. I'm talking about a cure.

530
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,750
But because I might be
wrong, you want to die.

531
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,186
What made you a cripple?

532
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,092
I had an infarction.

533
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,604
A heart attack?

534
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,107
It's what happens when
blood flow is obstructed.

535
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,690
If it's in the heart,
it's a heart attack. If

536
00:34:37,714 --> 00:34:39,253
it's in the lungs, it's a
pulmonary embolism.

537
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,213
If it's in the brain, it's a stroke.
I had it in my thigh muscles.

538
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,875
Wasn't there something
they could do?

539
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:48,114
There was plenty they could do,
if they'd made the right diagnosis.

540
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,088
<i>But the only symptom was pain.</i>

541
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,283
Not many people get to
experience muscle death.

542
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,056
Did you think you were dying?

543
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,723
I hoped I was dying.

544
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,801
So you hide in your office,
refuse to see patients...

545
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,498
because you don't like
the way people look at you.

546
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,771
You feel cheated by life, so now
you're gonna get even with the world.

547
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,779
But you want me to fight this.

548
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,781
Why?

549
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,818
What makes you think I'm
so much better than you?

550
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,979
What, you're scared
you'll turn into me?

551
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,320
I just want to die
with a little dignity.

552
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,690
There's no such thing.

553
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,026
Our bodies break down. Sometimes when
we're 90. Sometimes before we're even born.

554
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,033
But it always happens, and
there's never any dignity in it.

555
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,004
I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe
your own ass. It's always ugly. Always.

556
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,035
We can live with dignity.
We can't die with it.

557
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,855
No treatment.

558
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:11,200
Maybe we can get a court
order, uh, override her wishes,

559
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,205
claim she doesn't have the
capacity to make this decision.

560
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,207
But she does.

561
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,210
<i>But we could claim that the illness
made her mentally incompetent, right?</i>

562
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,712
A pretty common result.
That didn't happen here.

563
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,547
<i>He's not gonna do it. She's
not just a file to him anymore.</i>

564
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,552
He respects her.

565
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,316
So because you respect
her, you're going to let her die?

566
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,091
I solved the case.
My work is done.

567
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,228
<i>Patients always want proof.</i>

568
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,493
We're not making cars here.

569
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,933
We don't give guarantees.

570
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,595
I think we can
prove it's a worm.

571
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,643
It's noninvasive. It's safe.

572
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,874
I'm not completely sure, but— Yeah,
yeah, yeah. What's the damn idea?

573
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,381
Have you ever seen a
worm under an X-ray?

574
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,385
A regular, old, no-contrast,
hundred-year-old-technology X-ray?

575
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:04,583
They light up like shotgun
pellets, just like on a contrast M.R.I.

576
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,956
Which is the same thing as a CT
scan, which we did, which proved nothing.

577
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,962
The worm's cyst is the same
density as the cerebrospinal fluid.

578
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,589
We're not gonna see
anything in her head.

579
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,124
But Chase is right. He's
right. We should X-ray her.

580
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,138
But we don't X-ray her
brain. We X-ray her leg.

581
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,589
Worms love thigh muscle.
If she's got one in her

582
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:24,870
head, I guarantee you
there's one in her leg.

583
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,224
Hold still, Rebecca.

584
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,234
This here...

585
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,237
is a worm larva.

586
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,899
So, if it's in my
leg, it's in my brain?

587
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,240
Are you looking for a guarantee?

588
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,836
It's there. Probably
been there six to 10 years.

589
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:05,179
- Do I have more?
- Probably.

590
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,677
It's good news.

591
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,746
- What do we do now?
- Now we get you better.

592
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,151
Albendazole.

593
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:22,264
- Two pills?
<i>- Yeah. Every day,</i>
<i>for at least a month, with a meal.</i>

594
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,893
- Two pills?
- Yeah.

595
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,437
Possible side effects
include abdominal

596
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:30,272
pain, nausea, headaches,
dizziness, fever...

597
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,276
and hair loss.

598
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,543
We'll probably make you keep taking the
pills even if you get every one of those.

599
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,797
Why did you hire me?

600
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,614
- Does it matter?
- Kinda hard to work for a guy
who doesn't respect you.

601
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,664
- Why?
- Is that rhetorical?

602
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,335
No. It just seems that way
'cause you can't think of an answer.

603
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,343
Does it make a
difference what I think?

604
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,409
I'm a jerk. The only thing that matters
is what <i>you</i> think. Can you do the job?

605
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,785
You hired a black guy because
he had a juvenile record. No.

606
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,791
It wasn't a racial thing.

607
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,793
I didn't see a black guy.

608
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,022
I just saw a doctor...

609
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,030
with a juvenile record.

610
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,033
I hired Chase 'cause his
dad made a phone call.

611
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,228
I hired you...

612
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,430
because you are
extremely pretty.

613
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,442
You hired me to get into my pants? I
can't believe that that would shock you.

614
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,444
It's also not what I said.

615
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,707
No, I hired you
because you look good.

616
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,272
It's like having a nice
piece of art in the lobby.

617
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,785
- I was in the top of my class.
- But not <i>the</i> top.

618
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:51,345
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.
Yeah. You were a very good applicant.

619
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,358
But not the best. Would
that upset you? Really?

620
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,647
To think that you were hired
because of some genetic gift

621
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:58,839
of beauty instead of some
genetic gift of intelligence?

622
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,298
I worked very hard
to get where I am.

623
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,301
But you didn't have to.

624
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,304
People choose the
paths that gain them the

625
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:07,567
greatest rewards for
the least amount of effort.

626
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,440
That's a law of nature, and you
defied it. That's why I hired you.

627
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,445
<i>You could have married rich.
You could have been a model.</i>

628
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,040
<i>You could have just shown up and people
would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff.</i>

629
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:21,484
But you didn't. You worked
your stunning little ass off.

630
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,987
Am I supposed to be flattered?

631
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,490
Gorgeous women do
not go to medical school...

632
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,550
unless they're as damaged
as they are beautiful.

633
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,562
Were you abused
by a family member?

634
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,427
- No.
- Sexually assaulted?

635
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,626
No!

636
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,566
But you are damaged, aren't you?

637
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,336
<i>♪♪</i>

638
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:45,173
I have to go.

639
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,010
I followed her.

640
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:55,486
- Oh.
- I couldn't stop thinking
about what that doctor said.

641
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,516
I told you not to listen
to him. He's an idiot.

642
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
I was orange!

643
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,792
- I don't want to know what you found out.
- You don't care?

644
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,795
I'm your doctor.

645
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,798
You've been good to me and good
to this hospital. Of course I care.

646
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:11,324
<i>But I don't see how this
conversation can end well for me.</i>

647
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,668
Either your wife is having an
affair, or she's not having an affair,

648
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:17,675
and you have come here because
you rightly think I should fire him.

649
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:21,804
But I can't. Even if it
costs me your money.

650
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,213
The son of a bitch is
the best doctor we have.

651
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,723
Feeling any better?

652
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,725
I can't complain.

653
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,125
As you know, the
hospital has certain rules.

654
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:41,064
And as you also know,
we tend to ignore them.

655
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,610
But I think this one's gonna be a
little obvious unless we get your help.

656
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:47,002
<i>If anyone asks, you have 1
1 daughters and five sons.</i>

657
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,803
Hi! Look who's here!

658
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,710
It's so good to see
you guys. I missed you.

659
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,381
Is this for me?

660
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,508
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

661
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,650
<i>Oh, I love you guys.</i>

662
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,692
I wanted to thank Dr. House,
but he never visited again.

663
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,092
He cured you.
You didn't cure him.

664
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:16,258
Okay, I want a hug and a kiss from every
single one of you! Get up here right now!

665
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,238
- There.
- Hold on.

666
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,536
<i>She's converted.</i>

667
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,239
You said she was your cousin.

668
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,247
Why would you lie?

669
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,113
It got you to take the case.

670
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,953
You lied to a friend to save a stranger.
You don't think that's kind of screwed up?

671
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,786
You've never lied to me?

672
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,383
I never lie.

673
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,020
Oh. Right.

674
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,027
- Why do we do this?
- Because we're doctors.

675
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,433
If we make mistakes, people die.

676
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,100
Dr. House?

677
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,200
<i>You have a patient.</i>

678
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:06,047
He says he needs a refill.

679
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,213
Got change for a dollar?

680
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,529
That's some bad hat, Harry.
