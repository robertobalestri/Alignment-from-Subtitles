1
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,475
What do you say now?

2
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,748
I don't know.

3
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,586
You said your dad wouldn't
be home for an hour.

4
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,559
I know, but it—You don't
know— Don't you love me?

5
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,358
Of course. You know I—
Then, come on. Let's do it.

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,422
All right.

7
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,843
Where are they? Nightstand.

8
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,821
Gentlemen, start your engines.

9
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:03,591
I so want this car!

10
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,724
Whoo-hoo!

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,200
Whoo-hoo!

12
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,794
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

13
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,290
Oh, my God! You're bleeding.

14
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,656
Look out!

15
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,354
What lie are they telling you?

16
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:38,483
I'll check on it. Okay. Yes...

17
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,995
Come on.

18
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:45,328
Okay, thank you.

19
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,698
Okay, pharmaceuticals
were delivered this morning.

20
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,704
But Shipping accidentally sent
the box with Vicodin to Research.

21
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,206
Hmm. That's a tough one.

22
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,335
If only we had some way to communicate
with another part of the building.

23
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,680
Sixteen-year-old M.V.A. victim.

24
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,429
He's been in and out of
the hospital for three weeks

25
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,093
with internal bleeding.
No one can find the cause.

26
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,019
Internal bleeding after a car
accident. Wow, that's shocking.

27
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,420
Let me talk to Shipping.
I speak their language.

28
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,085
It's been three weeks— Your hospital
doesn't have my pain medication.

29
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,652
Shipping says it's
going to be an hour.

30
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,664
This is Dr. Cuddy.
What's going on?

31
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,667
The crash didn't cause the bleed.
Right—the bleed caused the crash.

32
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:24,330
Blood got on the road, got all
slippery— Anyone here got drugs?

33
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:30,105
She saw his blood, she got distracted,
and she crashed his dad's Porsche.

34
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,770
- Dad'll love that.
- He was...

35
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,404
- Don't talk.
- It's gonna be an hour.

36
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,608
Thank God you took control.

37
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,618
<i>- If you can't wait one hour to
get—</i> - Kid's got hemolytic anemia.

38
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,551
Kid? How old?

39
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,022
He must have inherited it.
He's gonna die. My condolences.

40
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,856
Wasn't inherited. The problem's
outside the red blood cells.

41
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,590
This is impossible. A 16-year-old
does not get hemolytic anemia.

42
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,794
Give her back the file. You have
bigger problems to tend to, like my meds.

43
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,167
Elevated indirect bilirubin,
low serum haptoglobin...

44
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,763
- He's got meningitis.
- Uh, no.

45
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,403
- Artificial heart valve.
- No.

46
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,476
Get everyone in my office.

47
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,047
<i>Kid's gonna be dead
in a matter of days...</i>

48
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,059
if we don't figure out why his
red blood cells are disintegrating.

49
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,637
So, differential diagnosis,
people. Well, it's not environmental.

50
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,893
Dad hired a company to clean the
house, maid washed all the clothes...

51
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,900
and bought hypoallergenic
sheets and pillows.

52
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,902
- You want us to recheck?
- No.

53
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,980
If it's environmental, he'll get
better just from staying here.

54
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,439
- It could be an infection.
- No fever. No white count.

55
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,170
- Well, he's 99.2.
- Barely above normal.

56
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,236
<i>But above. His body's
reacting to something.</i>

57
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,291
<i>We could account for the lack of
fever and white count if it’s lupus.</i>

58
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,945
<i>Drugs will fit just as much as lupus.
Meth will cause hemolytic anemia.</i>

59
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,954
<i>A</i> lot <i>of meth.</i>

60
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,081
<i>Also doesn't exactly
seem like the type.</i>

61
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:54,185
Because his dad drives a Porsche?
Rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.

62
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,196
Didn't mean to offend you. <i>Okay!</i>

63
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,131
So it's infection,
lupus, drugs or cancer.

64
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,601
- Cancer?
- Why not? Great meeting.

65
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,867
Shouldn't we narrow it
down before we finish?

66
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,965
My leg gave us till 11:15.

67
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,374
I'll talk to Wilson about
lymphoma, A.N.A. for lupus,

68
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,776
radioimmunoassay for drugs,

69
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,782
and you test for whatever
you thought it was.

70
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,318
<i>I've got a date
with the pharmacist.</i>

71
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,718
That's already done, and...

72
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,155
Come on! Come on,
come on, come on.

73
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,216
Yeah.

74
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,827
Excuse me.

75
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,335
You know, there are
other ways to manage pain.

76
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,139
Like what? Laughter?

77
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,010
Meditation? Got a guy
that can fix my third chakra?

78
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,174
You're addicted.

79
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,378
If the pills ran my life,
I'd agree with you, but

80
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:53,687
it's my leg that's busy
calendaring what I can't do.

81
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,688
You're in denial.

82
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:00,090
Right. I never had an infarction in my
leg. No dead muscle, no nerve damage.

83
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,595
Doesn't even hurt.
Actually, it kinda tickles.

84
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,597
And chicks dig this...

85
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,599
better than a puppy.

86
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,602
It's not just your leg.
You wanna get high.

87
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,604
You're doing, what,
80 milligrams a day?

88
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,606
No. That's way too much.

89
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,609
Moderation is the key.
Unless there's pain.

90
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,111
It's double what you were
taking when I hired you.

91
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,045
'Cause you're twice as annoying.

92
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,049
I can't always be
here to protect you.

93
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,051
Patients talk. Doctors talk.

94
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,555
About how big your ass has
gotten lately? Not me. I defend it.

95
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,614
You got back.

96
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,062
You can't go a week without the drugs.
No, I don't wanna go without the drugs.

97
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,070
It'll hurt. No, you <i>can't.</i>

98
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,073
If you're just getting off
pain medication, it will hurt.

99
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,076
You won't be having a
great time, but you'll make it.

100
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,578
If you're detoxing,
you'll have chills, nausea.

101
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,241
Your pain will
magnify five, ten times.

102
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,251
You won't make it. Well,
I guess we'll never know.

103
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,297
I'll give you a week off clinic duty if
you can go a week without narcotics.

104
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,313
No way. I love the clinic.

105
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,985
You love the pills. Two weeks.

106
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,893
The pills don't make me high.
They make me neutral. A month.

107
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,892
You're on, mister.

108
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,171
Drugs could cause this? Cocaine and
meth are very hard on the blood system.

109
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,171
Has he had any erratic
behavior? No, but...

110
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,777
She was in rehab
in the ninth grade.

111
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,947
<i>She's supposedly clean now,
but—</i> She obviously cares for him.

112
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,082
Yeah, what she cared
about was the car.

113
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,684
<i>Anniversary present for my wife.</i>

114
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,754
We drove it up north to
watch the leaves change.

115
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,766
She was dead a year later.

116
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,302
<i>Cancer.</i> I'm sorry.

117
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,599
Mr. Foster, we're gonna
test Keith for drugs.

118
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,609
I—I don't do drugs.

119
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,407
It's not that we
don't trust you, but...

120
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,814
<i>His hair will tell us any drugs
he's taken over the past 60 days.</i>

121
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,877
<i>It's kind of like
rings on a tree.</i>

122
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,453
Negative.

123
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,164
<i>- Have you been sick?</i>
- No, nothing.

124
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,864
- Have you been out of the country?
- We went to China,
but we got all our shots before we left.

125
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,873
<i>It could be an infection.</i>

126
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,432
<i>We're going to give him a
gallium scan just to be safe.</i>

127
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,479
<i>We inject a radioactive
isotope into his bloodstream,</i>

128
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,572
<i>and we check to see if there's
inflammation anywhere in the body.</i>

129
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,049
<i>Has he ever complained
of any joint pain?</i>

130
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,986
Sensitivity to light? Rashes?

131
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,354
- No, no. Nothing.
- Any relatives who've ever
been diagnosed with lupus?

132
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,689
I don't even know what that is.

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,696
In simple terms, the body
becomes allergic to itself.

134
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,908
The immune system attacks healthy cells in
the circulatory system and destroys them.

135
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,924
Would it be treatable?

136
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,094
It can be manageable.

137
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,107
<i>We can test for the antibodies.</i>

138
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,770
<i>Ninety-five percent of patients
with lupus have positive A. N.A.</i>

139
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,280
Not cloudy. Negative.

140
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,786
<i>What about bruising? Never complained
of tenderness under his arms or his groin?</i>

141
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,515
<i>I'm not sure he'd
tell me if he did.</i>

142
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,081
I guess I don't really know
what's going on in his life.

143
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,822
- He's a teenager.
- Yeah.

144
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,792
What type of cancer
did your wife have?

145
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,704
Pancreatic.

146
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,798
It's his lymph nodes
we're concerned about.

147
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,311
<i>We're going to do a biopsy
to check for lymphoma.</i>

148
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,978
Can you feel this? No.

149
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,540
Good.

150
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,993
I have cancer, don't I?

151
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,620
We're just testing.

152
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,463
That's what they told my mom.

153
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,703
Definitely not cancer.

154
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,771
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

155
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,510
Negative for drugs. A.N.A. was
negative. Gallium scan was clear.

156
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,518
Yeah, I got that
from the "nothing."

157
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,850
- Where's his hematocrit?
- Thirteen.

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,039
Drops any lower, he's
not gonna have enough

159
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,255
red blood cells to bring
oxygen to his body.

160
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,645
<i>He'll suffocate with his lungs
working perfectly.</i> You okay?

161
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,726
Excuse me,
someone? Help. Please!

162
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,292
Polite for a dying kid.

163
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,864
How long has it been?

164
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,875
I'm fine.

165
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,912
There's something in
my eye. Up at the top.

166
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:45,468
Which eye?

167
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,673
This one. What's happening?

168
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,875
It's all right. Just
look down for me.

169
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,381
It's clear. There's
nothing in it.

170
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,480
- It's getting worse.
- Is it fuzzy or...

171
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,582
No, it's dark.

172
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,951
I can't see.

173
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,504
<i>It's a retinal clot
in the left eye.</i>

174
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,978
Coumadin would dissolve
the clot, fix his eyesight.

175
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,982
You can't use blood thinners.
He's got internal bleeding.

176
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,349
Fix the eye, you'd kill everything
else. Surgery's out for the same reason.

177
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,150
We have two hours
to figure this out. Either

178
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:30,049
we restore the blood
flow, or he loses the eye.

179
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,963
Forget the eye. Tell him to use the
other one to look on the bright side.

180
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,022
The clot tells us something.

181
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,263
Could help us figure out what he
has, which could mean he gets to live.

182
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,568
<i>Differential diagnosis, people.</i>

183
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,404
How does internal bleeding
suddenly start clotting?

184
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,707
It makes no sense.
They're opposing processes.

185
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,647
It can happen in lupus. Increased
platelet count can cause blood clots.

186
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,048
A.N.A. was negative.
It's not lupus.

187
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,417
This is true. But why
are you the one saying it?

188
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,549
What are you doing here? I
thought we'd ruled out cancer.

189
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,560
I was lonely.

190
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,653
Well, go see Cuddy.
She needs a friend.

191
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,062
That's funny. She said
you might need one.

192
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:16,000
That's why you're here. She wants you to
keep an eye on me. Make sure I don't cheat.

193
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,597
<i>No, I wanted to make sure you don't
start firing shots from the clock tower.</i>

194
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,107
I'm fine...

195
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,110
What's going on?

196
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,408
He hasn't had
Vicodin in over a day.

197
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,673
- Does your leg hurt?
- You ever been shot?

198
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,119
There's gonna be side effects.
Insomnia, depression, tachycardia.

199
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,282
Withdrawal symptoms.
Not applicable.

200
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,351
The only side effects I'm gonna have
are some pain and 30 days of freedom.

201
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,790
Am I the only one who's
concerned about a dying kid?

202
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,199
If it's not lupus, what else?

203
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:53,331
Most likely candidate for throwing
a clot is infection or cancer.

204
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,500
Checked the biopsy
twice. It's not cancer.

205
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,340
It's not an infection. Gallium
scan didn't reveal anything.

206
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,472
Okay. What hides
from a Gallium scan?

207
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,853
Cardiac. Right.

208
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,914
Clot flicks off, travels through the
arteries, then gets backed up in the eye.

209
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,362
I'm sorry. I wasn't paying
attention. What happened?

210
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,994
It's an infection in his heart.

211
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,062
Great.

212
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,405
Echocardiogram for the heart and
I.V. antibiotics for the infection, stat.

213
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,450
Is it my birthday?

214
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,493
<i>I'm not lonely. My leg hurts.</i>

215
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,797
- She's a real masseuse.
- She's $500 an hour, minimum.

216
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,396
She's hot, so she's a hooker?
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

217
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,522
The envious, jealous,

218
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:03,204
I-never-got-any-in-high-school
kind of logic. Hello!

219
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,609
She's a legitimate masseuse.

220
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,670
Come on.

221
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,616
God! She's beautiful.

222
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,347
Because she's beautiful, I should do
it? What kind of pathetic logic is that?

223
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,707
The envious, jealous,

224
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,790
I'm-married-and-I-can't-do-anything
logic. Hello.

225
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,022
Hi. Uh, listen, I'm sure you're really
good at whatever it is you do, but...

226
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,963
<i>Déme su mano.</i> Huh?

227
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,631
- Hey, no, no. Let go of my hand.
- She doesn't speak English.

228
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,603
Shh.

229
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,871
Ow!

230
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,433
Ow—Ahh.

231
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,912
Ahh.

232
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,309
Oh, my God.

233
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,782
<i>Bueno.</i>

234
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,294
Take off your clothes.

235
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,794
Not a fan of the Stroganoff?

236
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,398
I'm not hungry. Well, the
antibiotics can cause nausea.

237
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,465
So can the food.

238
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,579
Shouldn't you be
looking at my eye?

239
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,615
The blood clot
isn't life-threatening.

240
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,412
We're focusing on figuring
out the cause of your problems.

241
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,319
So the—So the blindness
will be permanent, won't it?

242
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,268
Thank you. Bye.

243
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,879
I had a massage.

244
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,383
Looks like you had a
masseuse. Help the pain?

245
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,885
I'm fine. I know.

246
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,218
Kid's echo was normal. No signs
of any vegetations on heart valves.

247
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,054
Never met a diagnostic
study I couldn't refute.

248
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,060
And the antibiotics
aren't doing anything.

249
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,063
So double the
dosage. 70 milligrams.

250
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,065
That'll box his
kidneys for sure.

251
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,067
Oh, you're right.
Save the kidney.

252
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,070
The guy we transplant
it into will be grateful.

253
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,073
Also, I have an idea for his eye.
Nothing we can do about his eye.

254
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,507
He's got a clot in the
retina— Put it in a memo.

255
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,512
If we remove some of the liquid
from the eye itself, the vitreous humour,

256
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,572
it might make some extra
room around the retinal artery.

257
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,316
If the artery expands, the clot might
move on its own. That's very creative.

258
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,822
Why didn't you
mention this before?

259
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,882
I didn't think of it before.

260
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,292
You should've.

261
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,781
This is going to hurt.

262
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,285
Your eye is numb.
You'll only feel pressure.

263
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,703
Give it a minute.

264
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,756
I can see.

265
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,254
I can see you.

266
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,756
I heard. Congratulations.

267
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,850
Don't. I haven't brushed
my teeth in two days.

268
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,461
I'm so scared they're not gonna
find out what's wrong with you.

269
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,336
No biggie. I'm fine.

270
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,468
I feel so bad about
all this. It's all my fault.

271
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,775
No. No, it's not.

272
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,806
But your father—he hates me.

273
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,478
He's just pissed about his car.

274
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,895
Help! Help! Help!

275
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,203
What's wrong?

276
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,799
A.S.T. is 859. We're
getting him to the I.C.U.

277
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,887
A.L.T. and G.G.T. are in
the tank. Our antibiotics...

278
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,574
Would not have caused this.
She must have given him drugs!

279
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,482
- I wouldn't do that!
- It's not drugs!

280
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,179
<i>His liver is shutting
down.</i> What?

281
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,917
<i>What does that mean?</i> It means
he's all better. He's ready to go home.

282
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,482
What? <i>What do
you think it means?</i>

283
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,028
You can't live without
a liver. He's dying.

284
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,724
What is your problem?
Bum leg. What's yours?

285
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,290
Hey, we don't have
time for this. Let's go.

286
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,771
His son's dying, and
you're mocking him?

287
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,106
It was a dumb question.

288
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,702
No, it wasn't.

289
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,040
You're right. It wasn't.

290
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,218
Is proving Cuddy
wrong worth all this?

291
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,670
- You know, House shouldn't even be here.
- Because he said something inappropriate?

292
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,336
<i>If we sent him home every time he
did that, we wouldn't need this office.</i>

293
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,410
He's in pain.

294
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:15,780
- What does the man
have to do to piss you off?

295
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,716
- He's been without pain relief
for over 70 hours.
- Exactly!

296
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,276
He's detoxing. Can't you
see he's out of his mind?

297
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,345
<i>That's what they
said about Manson.</i>

298
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,926
Do you wanna continue
talking about me,

299
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,462
<i>or should we discuss what
the liver damage tells us?</i>

300
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,625
I was born in a log
cabin in Illinois...

301
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,636
Hemolytic anemia
doesn't cause liver damage.

302
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,569
Add the fact he's
coughing blood,

303
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,267
you've got three of the indicators
of organ-threatening lupus.

304
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,037
It's moving too fast.

305
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,638
Could be hepatitis "E."

306
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,459
There's only been one case of
hep "E" originating in the U.S. since...

307
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:54,545
His history says he's been in and out
of the country four times in the last year.

308
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,384
You really think
he's got hep "E"?

309
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,050
No. I think lupus
is way more likely.

310
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,924
All right, then let's start him on
I.V. cytoxan and plasmapheresis.

311
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,759
<i>No, we should rule out hep "E."</i>

312
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,765
You just said it wasn't hep "E."

313
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,878
<i>I said lupus is way more likely, but if
we treat for lupus and it is hep "E" —</i>

314
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,599
He's toast. <i>Exactly.</i>

315
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,606
But there isn't a
treatment for hepatitis "E."

316
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,353
Either he'll get better on his
own or he'll continue to deteriorate.

317
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,937
Yeah. I went to
medical school too.

318
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,005
Start him on solumedrol.

319
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:27,019
- If he's got hep "E,"
that's only gonna make him worse.
- Not as much.

320
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,021
It's Goldilocks, people.

321
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,295
Won't hurt him so
much that it'll kill him, and

322
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,549
it won't hurt him so
little that we can't tell.

323
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,822
It'll hurt him... just right.

324
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,830
<i>And if it does nothing—</i>

325
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:41,356
We'll know it's not hep "E"
and can start treating for lupus.

326
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,959
Now watch me do it while
drinking a glass of water.

327
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,063
What do we tell the dad?
"We think your kid has

328
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,269
lupus, so we're gonna
treat him for hepatitis 'E.'

329
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,557
And, oh, yeah, if it
really is hep 'E, ' we're

330
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:52,675
not actually giving
him hep 'E' medication.

331
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,510
<i>So it's gonna make him worse,
not better."</i> Think he'll go for that?

332
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,049
- So you want us to lie?
- No.

333
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:02,020
- I want <i>you</i> to lie.
- Why me?

334
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,079
Because he trusts you.

335
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,661
<i>- This is a mistake.</i>
- This is a lawsuit.

336
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,663
Hep "E" is possible.

337
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,165
House always pulls these
stunts, and he's right more often...

338
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,207
He's delaying treatment
because of a one-in-a-million

339
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:18,079
chance that even he
doesn't think is the problem.

340
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,038
I don't wanna lie
to him. Then don't.

341
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,041
And get fired? Oh, like he's
gonna fire you. He loves you.

342
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,373
I've gotta do something.

343
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,380
- Kid needs treatment.
- Treat him for lupus.

344
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,541
<i>That</i> will get you fired.

345
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,676
You really think
House is losing it?

346
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,914
Yeah.

347
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,848
He's fine. He knows
what he's doing.

348
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,741
Okay.

349
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,385
We're recommending a
drug called solumedrol.

350
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:48,018
For hepatitis? Did that
show up on his blood tests?

351
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:52,465
The tests are never
100% accurate.

352
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,262
Well, then all the other
tests could be wrong too.

353
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,270
This could still be an
infection or cancer. Um...

354
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:01,273
They don't fit any of the
most recent symptoms.

355
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,139
Well, what, just hepatitis does?

356
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,873
I know, I know, I know—
You can never be sure.

357
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,842
When Wendy was in the hospital,

358
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,122
a doctor told us there was this
aggressive experimental treatment...

359
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,592
which might extend her
life by two or three years.

360
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,977
Well, we figured if there was
any hope at all that we could

361
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:27,262
have her with us a little
while longer, it'd be worth it.

362
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:31,327
Three weeks later, she was gone.

363
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,765
I don't think it's hepatitis.

364
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,440
I think your son has lupus.

365
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,384
<i>I think it's broken.</i>

366
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,443
What did you do?

367
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,390
Accidentally closed
the car door on it.

368
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,653
No. Door would've
broken the skin.

369
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:58,323
This looks like something
hard and smooth smashed it.

370
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,332
I want my lawyer.

371
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,335
The brain has a gating
mechanism for pain.

372
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,964
Registers the most severe
injury and blocks out the others.

373
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,373
<i>Did it work?</i> Well,
my hand hurts like hell.

374
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,980
Yeah. I feel much better. <i>Huh.</i>

375
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,983
<i>Don't splint it.</i>

376
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,488
I want to be able to bang it against the
wall if I need to administer another dose.

377
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,251
Just tape it up.

378
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,930
Why did you tell Cameron
to lie to Mr. Foster?

379
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,159
Make it tight. Answer me.

380
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:39,205
Nothing I can say is
gonna change how you feel,

381
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,250
and nothing can come out of your reaction
that is gonna change what I plan to do,

382
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,209
so I prefer to say nothing.

383
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,711
So that was just
you saying nothing.

384
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,714
Uh-huh.

385
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,842
- The guy is furious.
- And scared.

386
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,853
So what are you gonna do? The
father's insisting on the lupus treatment.

387
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,288
Yeah, Cameron told me,
and I told her to tell him no.

388
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,293
Well, you can't just sit
back and let the kid die.

389
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,522
Neither can the father.
<i>So that's your plan?</i>

390
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,621
You're gonna play
chicken with the kid's life?

391
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,531
Well, he's the dad.
I should win easily.

392
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,967
Take the week off.

393
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,471
Why, 'cause I lied to a patient?

394
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,974
I take risks.
Sometimes patients die.

395
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,977
But not taking risks
causes more patients to die,

396
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,284
so I guess my biggest problem is I've been
cursed with the ability to do the math.

397
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,411
I told him that we wouldn't
treat him for the lupus until...

398
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:32,083
- What'd he say?
- He said he wanted to transfer Keith
to another hospital.

399
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,170
He's not stable enough. He'd never make it
through the door. That's what I told him.

400
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,823
And that's when he caved.

401
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,060
Yeah. He agreed
to do it your way.

402
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,898
Two plus two equals four.

403
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,468
If it is hepatitis "E," we
should see a marked

404
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:53,354
decline in liver function
tests within the hour.

405
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,357
Why bother explaining it to me? It's
not like I have any choice in the matter.

406
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,078
If there's no hep "E," we'll start
treatment for lupus immediately.

407
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,086
Ouch.

408
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,145
- Keith? What's wrong?
- What's happening?

409
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,157
No, get off.

410
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,683
Keith, it's Dr. Chase.
Where does it hurt? Jules, no!

411
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,854
- He's hallucinating.
- Is this from the medicine?

412
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,148
We haven't started the medicine.

413
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,476
Keith, you're in the hospital.
Keith, there's nothing on you.

414
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,868
- Hey. Hey. Keith.
- Keith! Keith! Keith!

415
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,462
Hey. You okay, buddy?

416
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,937
Um, I think I wet the bed.

417
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:33,008
Oh— Don't worry about it.
It's fine. Let's get you up.

418
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,652
<i>- Oh, God!</i>
- He's had a major bleed.

419
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:41,490
<i>- Bright red blood per rectum.</i>
- I didn't—I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

420
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,571
He's going into
hypovolemic shock.

421
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,657
- Pressure's 60, heart rate's 140.
- We need an angiography, stat!

422
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,545
<i>Angiography revealed major
upper and lower G. I. bleeding,</i>

423
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,377
severe hemodynamic
compromise and liver failure.

424
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,941
<i>He's also hallucinating. Thinks he's
being tortured by someone named Jules.</i>

425
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,954
Hallucinations are a
symptom of psychosis,

426
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,456
which is the fourth
diagnostic criterion.

427
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,458
It's official. This is lupus.

428
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,461
Who’s Jules?

429
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,861
Any mention of her
in the medical history?

430
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,390
It doesn't matter <i>what</i> he's hallucinating
about, it matters <i>why!</i> It's lupus.

431
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,402
Well, there's no
need to get snippy.

432
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,029
<i>This kind of lupus takes
years to get to this point.</i>

433
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,505
It's been a week. <i>Yeah.</i>

434
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,739
And a 16-year-old kid
shouldn't have hemolytic anemia

435
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:32,705
or be bleeding out of
every orifice, but he is.

436
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,388
<i>We had an opportunity to
treat this. Instead, we diddled</i>

437
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:37,716
<i>around with hepatitis
"E," and now it's too late.</i>

438
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,548
He needs a new
liver. We screwed up.

439
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,521
You're saying <i>I</i> screwed up.

440
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,691
- Yes.
- Then why don't you just say that?

441
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,941
- You gonna blame this on her?
- Did you agree with my recommendation
to treat for hep "E"?

442
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:56,197
- No, I didn't.
- And she made herself quite clear.

443
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,090
And then she went and lied to
the father. That's why you're angry.

444
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,035
Yeah. I trusted you.

445
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,667
You always trust me.
That's a big mistake.

446
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,768
Lupus is a bad diagnosis.

447
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,439
- It's the best diagnosis we've got.
- That doesn't make it good.

448
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,950
<i>No. It just makes it this
kid's only chance to live.</i>

449
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,016
Put him on the transplant list.

450
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,287
And make sure Cuddy knows.

451
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,353
See if she can do anything
to get him close to the top.

452
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,988
Cafeteria.

453
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,990
Stay away from the sushi.

454
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,083
And what happened to your hand?

455
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,420
Got stuck in a drawer.

456
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,989
Yeah, right. You're
going through withdrawal.

457
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,764
No, I am going through pain.

458
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,772
Pain causes nausea.

459
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,935
I took this job to work with
you, not cover your ass.

460
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,904
Your Vicodin.

461
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,581
And your solution
is to give me drugs.

462
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,587
That's interesting. No.

463
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,988
Now I'm covering <i>my</i> ass.

464
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,687
Take your pills
before you kill this kid.

465
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,968
Lupus is normally
treated with medication.

466
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,699
But in Keith's case, the
disease is too advanced.

467
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:18,733
Because you lied. Because House
wanted to play games with my son's life.

468
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,605
There's no way to really
tell what progression

469
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,250
the disease may have
taken— You're right.

470
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,677
And I'm sorry.

471
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,584
So what do we do?

472
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,590
He needs a new liver.

473
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:37,095
<i>There are over 15,000
patients on the transplant list.</i>

474
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:40,030
But how many are about to bleed
to death unless they get a new liver?

475
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,567
In Jersey? I'd say, uh, 20.

476
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,541
Two thousand patients die
each year because a donor

477
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,281
liver can't be found.
That's almost five a day.

478
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,001
So he's screwed.

479
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,842
I'll see what I can do.

480
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,242
- Could I donate part of my liver?
- Sorry. You're a different blood type.

481
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,444
So we just wait? I'm afraid so.

482
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,784
And hope for someone to die.

483
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,948
Who’s Jules?

484
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,524
Dr. House, you should get
back to your office— <i>Jules.</i>

485
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,964
- There's no Jules in the history.
- It was a hallucination.

486
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,968
Of what? Our cat.

487
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,470
<i>- Does this matter?
- No. I'm sorry.</i>

488
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,554
<i>We'll continue the transfusions
and the treatment for the</i>

489
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:23,618
<i>anemia and liver failure
while we're waiting for a donor.</i>

490
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,908
- How long can he wait?
- Not long.

491
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,257
- I don't think this is lupus.
- It's lupus. Come on, let's just go...

492
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,217
Your fourth diagnostic
criterion for lupus is psychosis.

493
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,617
This is just a kid
missing his cat.

494
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,952
He was being attacked by an
animal that wasn't in the room.

495
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,221
That's psychosis. There's a difference
between psychosis and hallucination.

496
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,930
So if he was imagining
a fake cat, it'd be

497
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:44,733
lupus, but since it
was a real cat, it's not?

498
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,822
- Take your damn pills.
- Psychosis requires...

499
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,958
There is no cat.

500
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,266
Jules is dead.

501
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:58,001
You have a dead family pet
and you never mentioned it?

502
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,068
Nice family history.

503
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,361
Family history's asking
about family members,

504
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,276
meaning people
related to the patient.

505
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,114
How did the cat die? Can
you get him outta here?

506
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,747
- Dr. House, come on, let's—
- What happened to the cat?

507
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,983
Old age.

508
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,960
<i>- She was 15 years old.</i>
- When?

509
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,757
About a month ago.

510
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,128
- Does this have anything to
do with— - Where'd she sleep?

511
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,030
With Keith. This
is not a cat allergy.

512
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,966
And it's not lupus.

513
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,004
Where is Jules?

514
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,511
Four years of college,

515
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,513
four at med school,

516
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,515
two years of residency,

517
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,518
another four of subspecialty
training, and where do I end up?

518
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,155
Talking instead of digging.

519
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,384
Come on. The
ground's frozen solid.

520
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,567
<i>What's that?</i>

521
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,022
Out of the way!

522
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,925
We have the liver.
Prep O.R. four.

523
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,616
All right, Keith, start
counting backward from ten.

524
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,681
Ten,

525
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,627
<i>nine,</i>

526
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,323
eight...

527
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,696
Scalpel.

528
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,236
Stop the gases.

529
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,775
What the hell are
you doing, House?

530
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,363
Saving a 16-year-old
kid from a lifetime of

531
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:49,110
immunosuppressant
drugs and a very nasty scar.

532
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,775
<i>This kid doesn't
have lupoid hepatitis.</i>

533
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,842
He has acute
naphthalene toxicity.

534
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,116
Naphthalene? Y-Y-You're
talking about mothballs.

535
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,918
Nope. Termites.

536
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,126
They create naphthalene
to protect their nests,

537
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,519
which I'm assuming
is rather large and

538
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:07,325
inside all four walls of
his bedroom at home.

539
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,868
And your assumption
is based on what?

540
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,133
The autopsy I just
conducted on his pet cat.

541
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,972
- Call Cuddy. And Security.
- You are not removing that kid's liver.

542
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,807
Now!

543
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:26,644
Have you completely
lost your mind?

544
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,449
No, but I have been
feeling a little sick lately.

545
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,013
Ah-choo!

546
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,224
There's no way we can do
this surgery now. Ya think?

547
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,163
You've already cost him
his liver. Don't kill him too.

548
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,167
Why are you so eager
to cut into a healthy kid?

549
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,170
Healthy? He's in the toilet. He
just needs some chicken soup.

550
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,332
I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub.
We're doing this transplant.

551
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:50,197
No, you're not.

552
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,352
You said it. If Keith's
symptoms had an environmental

553
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,675
cause, they would have
disappeared as soon as he got here.

554
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,204
They've only gotten worse.

555
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,809
If the food here wasn't one step below
Riker's Island, he would've gotten better.

556
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,524
- He's lost 14 pounds— - Sure.
This is nothing but a dietary thing.

557
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,216
Naphthalene is a
gas, a fat-soluble gas.

558
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,226
Kid breathes it in, it
gets stored in his fat cells.

559
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,593
Outside the hospital, his body
burned protein and carbs for energy.

560
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,427
And the naphthalene
stayed in fat.

561
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:18,266
<i>But once the car accident put him in
the hospital and he started losing weight,</i>

562
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,635
<i>his body had to get its
energy somewhere else.</i>

563
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,300
<i>It started to burn fat.</i>

564
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,307
<i>The floodgates opened.</i>

565
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,436
<i>The poison poured
into his system.</i>

566
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,947
So getting away from the
poison is what poisoned him?

567
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,950
Getting away from his dad's
meat loaf is what's killing him.

568
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,680
You wanna explain to me
why you stopped the surgery?

569
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,746
Oh, my God! My God.

570
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,250
- I want him locked up!
<i>- Hey!</i>

571
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,421
Take it easy.

572
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,133
Your cat did not die of old age.

573
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:04,739
It died of massive internal
bleeding and acute liver failure...

574
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,910
<i>caused by naphthalene poisoning.</i>

575
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,815
The exact same
thing your son has.

576
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,458
You lie to me, you
mess up my son's

577
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,485
surgery, and now you
expect me to trust you?

578
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,996
Give me 24 hours. We'll
pump your son full of calories...

579
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,956
That liver is going to
somebody right now.

580
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,157
We're doing that surgery.

581
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,101
You do the surgery, you'll
be killing a mother of four.

582
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,934
Father of three.

583
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,770
- I was guessing.
- Like you are now?

584
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,434
Naphthalene poisoning
is the best explanation

585
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,408
we have for what's
wrong with your son.

586
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,815
<i>It explains the internal bleeding,
the hemolytic anemia, the liver failure.</i>

587
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,285
It also predicts
what'll happen next.

588
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,415
<i>If you do the surgery, he's gonna
lay on that table for 14 hours...</i>

589
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,258
<i>while his body continues to burn fat
and release poison into his system.</i>

590
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,991
Either way, I did you a favor.

591
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,091
He's awake now. You've
got a chance to say good-bye.

592
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,667
I think you should
trust Dr. House.

593
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,223
Give the liver to the other guy.

594
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,606
Watch out.

595
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,431
I.N.R.'s down and his
red count is climbing.

596
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,395
Means you made the right call.

597
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,169
His liver is healing.
He's gonna be just fine.

598
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,627
You made it a week.

599
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,629
And won my prize.

600
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,631
Congratulations.
Cuddy's a sucker.

601
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,133
I would've done it
for two weeks off.

602
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,135
Yeah, it was a piece of cake.

603
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,636
You learn anything?

604
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,565
Yeah.

605
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,632
I'm an addict.

606
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,277
<i>Uh—</i>

607
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,287
Okay.

608
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,849
I'm not stopping.

609
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,297
There are programs.

610
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,299
Cuddy would give you the time.

611
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,495
You could get on a different pain
management regimen. I don't need to stop.

612
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,773
You just said...

613
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,901
I said I was an addict. I
didn't say I had a problem.

614
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,071
I pay my bills. I make
my meals. I function.

615
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:26,180
Is that all you want?
You have no relationships.

616
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,617
I don't want any relationships.

617
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:32,123
- You alienate people.
- I've been alienating people
since I was three.

618
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,625
Oh, come on! Drop it.

619
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,161
You don't think you've
changed in the last few years?

620
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,460
Well, of course I have. I've—I've
gotten older, my hair's got thinner.

621
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,434
Sometimes I'm bored. Sometimes I'm lonely.
Sometimes I wonder what it all means.

622
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,868
<i>No, I was there.</i>

623
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,600
You are not just a regular
guy who's getting older.

624
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,541
You've changed. You're miserable,
and you're afraid to face yourself.

625
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,272
Of course I've changed!

626
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,879
And everything's the leg?

627
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,948
Nothing's the pills? They
haven't done a thing to you?

628
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:11,461
They let me do my job.

629
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,158
And they take away my pain.

630
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,065
How'd it go?

631
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,567
He admitted he's
addicted to the narcotics.

632
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:54,128
Well, admitting you have a problem is
the first— And he says it's not a problem.

633
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,408
Maybe it's not.

634
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:59,410
What do I know?

635
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,743
What are you gonna do?
Nothing. Done enough damage.

636
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:06,751
Better hope he never finds out that
that was your idea. He'd never believe it.

637
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,268
That's some bad hat, Harry.
