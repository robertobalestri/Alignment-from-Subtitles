but it didn't work."

163
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,017
- No. Then-Then I— -
"Next, tried steroid enemas.

164
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,085
<i>Oral corticosteroids—
5-A.S.A., 6-mercaptopurine."</i>

165
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,358
- I'm impressed.
- By my medical history?

166
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,900
By how well your
last doctor charted.

167
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,334
It's one thing to have to go
to the bathroom every hour,

168
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,236
but when the kids
sit on my lap, it's...

169
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,399
<i>The store sent me home.
They're gonna fire me.</i>

170
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,444
Can't you put me back on 5-A.S.A.?
Maybe it'll work this time. <i>Not likely.</i>

171
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,278
I'm giving you a prescription.
It's cheap, which is good,

172
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,283
because your insurance
company won't pay for it.

173
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,359
- "Cogaritis"?
- Cigarettes.

174
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,396
One twice a day.
No more, no less.

175
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,864
<i>Studies have shown
that cigarette smoking...</i>

176
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,595
is one of the most effective ways
to control inflammatory bowel.

177
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,036
<i>Plus it's been well established
that you look 30% cooler.</i>

178
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,564
- Are you kidding me?
- About the looking cooler, yeah.

179
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,407
- The rest is true.
- Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

180
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:22,210
Pretty much all the drugs I
prescribe are addictive and dangerous.

181
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,877
The only difference with this
one is it's completely legal.

182
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,988
Merry Christmas.

183
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,787
<i>I was talking to the nurse—
Arsenio. Do you know him?</i>

184
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,024
Not really. He can take
pictures with his phone.

185
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,555
Cool. That woman from
the lab was interesting too.

186
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,762
She studied astrophysics
before becoming a nurse.

187
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,796
You know the staff better than I
do. I love to hear all about people.

188
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,003
- Yet you live in a monastery.
- It's where I serve our Lord
and the world best.

189
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,844
Our Lord maybe. The rest of
the world, on the other hand,

190
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,681
- would probably get more out of feeding
the homeless or— - Healing the sick?

191
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,711
As an example, yeah. <i>Did
you always want to be a doctor?</i>

192
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,851
Always. You always want to be a
nun? <i>My parents died when I was six.</i>

193
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,556
I was raised in a foster
home run by the Church.

194
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,658
When I was 18, I went to the monastery,
where they let me take my vows.

195
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,932
<i>I've known no other life,
and I haven't wanted to.</i>

196
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,532
<i>Okay, Sister. We need
you to lie as still as possible.</i>

197
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,600
<i>If you get scared,
just let us know.</i>

198
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,475
As Jonah said from
inside the whale,

199
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:30,813
<i>"When I had lost all hope, I
turned my thoughts to the Lord."</i>

200
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,445
- Well, she's got God on her side.
<i>- I don't believe in God.</i>

201
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,006
You're not even
a little agnostic?

202
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,900
<i>Is it supposed to smell funny?</i>

203
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,827
Someone ralphed in there this
morning. We cleaned it up, but...

204
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,974
It's normal, Sister. It's
just a few more minutes.

205
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:45,296
Mm.

206
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,494
I believe in a higher order
that's in control of what happens,

207
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,367
<i>but not one, anthropomorphic
entity called "God"...</i>

208
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,682
that's concerned with the
everyday workings of you and me.

209
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,471
What else is there to control but
the everyday workings of you and me?

210
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,511
It's always about you, Foreman.

211
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,422
What are you talking
about— The trees, the fish?

212
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,458
<i>Should they be the ones
that think it's all about them?</i>

213
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,542
<i>What about you, Chase?
Do you believe in God?</i>

214
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:11,056
I believe Sister Augustine has no vascular
pathology, which means no Churg-Strauss.

215
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,525
Which means House made a
mistake. No, not necessarily.

216
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:17,394
It could be something else— thyrotoxicosis
or a carcinoid. I don't get you.

217
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,195
You don't believe in God, but you're
willing to put complete faith in one man?

218
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,601
<i>Please. The smell.</i>
Let's get her out of there.

219
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,108
I'm coming, Sister. I gotcha.

220
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,609
Please. The smell. I'm comin'.

221
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,908
I'm gonna be sick.
There's no smell.

222
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:38,247
No. God. Oh! It’s
Jesus. It’s Jesus!

223
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,753
He's coming for me!

224
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,289
He's burning me with his touch!

225
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,222
Let's get her on some Ativan.

226
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,126
The smells, religious visions— It's
symptomatic of temporal lobe swelling.

227
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,790
- We don't want her
to— - She's seizing.

228
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,561
- Jaw block!
- Help me get her on her side.

229
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,269
- Religious visions?
- Yeah. And next comes...

230
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,814
Patient tested positive
for herpetic encephalitis.

231
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,482
- What's that tell us?
- Her immune system
is severely compromised.

232
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,080
Oh, I know. Prednisone
compromises the immune system.

233
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:21,423
- Isn't that the medicine that you gave her
for that thing she doesn't have?
- Yeah, that— Hey.

234
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,659
- I'm thinking that's a trick question.
- Her immune system
is severely compromised.

235
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,077
Two doses of prednisone
wouldn't do that.

236
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,636
Are you hanging your
diagnosis on an adverb?

237
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,732
- In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce that
I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.
- You're gonna admit negligence?

238
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,801
Unless you leave the room. If
you stay, you'll have to testify.

239
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,406
Five, four,

240
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,077
three, two...

241
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,120
So, there I was
in the clinic, drunk.

242
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,246
<i>I opened the drawer,
closed my eyes,</i>

243
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,484
<i>take the first
syringe I can find—</i>

244
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,193
So, what are the options for a
compromised immune system?

245
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,804
Mixed connective tissue
disease. It'd explain

246
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,394
why she was feeling
better on the prednisone.

247
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,494
Sure. She was feeling better right
up to the moment it almost killed her.

248
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,267
<i>On the other hand, it
explains the symptoms—</i>

249
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,866
Swollen hands, pulmonary
problems, cardiac problems.

250
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,843
<i>It all fits.</i> Except her
A.N.A. was normal.

251
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,642
- So redraw the blood.
- But the treatment is corticosteroids...

252
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,992
Prednisone—and we can't go
there because of the encephalitis.

253
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,078
Then we'll treat it with
something that modulates

254
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:20,976
the immune system
but doesn't suppress it...

255
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,852
Hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

256
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,049
There's no protocol
for putting a patient in a

257
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:28,691
high-pressure oxygen room
to treat auto-immune problems.

258
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,128
Oh, you people. Always
with the protocols.

259
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,330
Prep the nun and
discontinue the prednisone.

260
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,003
I am both amused and annoyed...

261
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,569
that you think I should be
less stubborn than you are.

262
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,247
You are aware of the
Hippocratic oath, right?

263
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,405
The one that starts,
"First, do no harm," then

264
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,585
goes on to tell us no
abortions, no seductions,

265
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,353
and definitely no cutting of those
who labor beneath the stone?

266
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,360
Yeah. I took a read
once. Wasn't impressed.

267
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,489
Hyperbaric treatments could cause
oxygen toxicity—lung and eye damage.

268
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,057
Every treatment has its dangers.
Which is why we only treat...

269
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,763
if we're convinced the patient
actually needs the treatment.

270
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm convinced. You're not.

271
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,040
Question is, what are you
gonna do about it? Hmm?

272
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,173
I have an opening Thursday
at 3:00. Do you have a fourth?

273
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,846
Is he any good?

274
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,911
Can I call you right back? Okay.

275
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,815
What's up?

276
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,596
The pressure will force the oxygen
into your system, saturate your blood.

277
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,726
<i>It will enhance white cell
activity, reduce the inflammation.</i>

278
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,931
And that will help with this
mixed connective tissue disease?

279
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,169
<i>We'll be doing about 10
treatments, and then we'll reevaluate.</i>

280
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,610
<i>The last treatment with prednisone
caused the seizures, right?</i>

281
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,547
How confident is
Dr. House about this?

282
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,416
<i>That you reacted so strongly
to the prednisone let us know...</i>

283
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,597
that you had an underlying
problem with your immune system.

284
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:05,080
<i>I guess it was a
blessing... of sorts.</i>

285
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,158
So, who's your favorite
reindeer, Nurse Arnold?

286
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,166
Rudolph. I would've
thought it was Vixen.

287
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,601
What are you implying? Nothing.

288
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,299
<i>But I saw you at the
Christmas party with Dr. Riles...</i>

289
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,808
<i>and Dr. Jorkins
and Nurse Crandall.</i>

290
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,901
<i>I was just doing some
Christmas dancing.</i>

291
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,472
This is a chapel,
a house of prayer.

292
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,677
House of prayer? Huh.

293
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,686
That explains the
good reception.

294
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,814
Also why nobody's ever here.

295
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,019
I need to talk with
you, Dr. House.

296
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,222
Sister Augustine believes
in things that aren't real.

297
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,796
I thought that was a job
requirement for you people.

298
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:52,362
She's been known
to lie to get sympathy.

299
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,703
She's a hypochondriac.

300
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:58,734
So you're warning me that I may
be treating a nonexistent ailment.

301
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,303
Sore throats, joint pains.

302
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,248
There's always something wrong,
and there's never a reason for it.

303
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,343
Mother Superior
plays right into it...

304
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,116
Lets Augustine off work duties,

305
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,953
treating her as
fragile, special.

306
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,823
That must make you angry.

307
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,886
It bothers me.

308
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,432
It's not really in
Augustine's best interests.

309
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,470
You want some?

310
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,532
I shouldn't.

311
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,374
I guess you gotta be good at reading
people to be a good infirmarian, huh?

312
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,477
Mm. Mm-hmm.

313
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,182
So, we've got pride,
anger, envy, gluttony...

314
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,755
That's four out of seven
deadly sins in under two minutes.

315
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,820
Do you people keep records of
these things? Is there a "Cathlympics"?

316
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,992
They say you have a
gift. <i>They</i> like to talk.

317
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,596
- You hide behind your intelligence.
- Yeah. That's pretty stupid.

318
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,665
And you make jokes because
you're afraid to take anything seriously.

319
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,007
Because if you take
things seriously, they matter.

320
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,172
<i>And if they matter—</i> When
things go wrong, I get hurt.

321
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,342
- I'm not tough. I'm vulnerable.
- I barely know you.

322
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,615
And I don't know if I'm
right. I just hope I am.

323
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,088
Because the alternative is...

324
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,625
<i>you really are as miserable
as you seem to be.</i>

325
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,657
You know, from the way
you're looking at me right now,

326
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,700
I'd say you just
hit number five.

327
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,402
Lust.

328
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,581
<i>Dr. Brown, I love you too.</i>

329
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,427
<i>How are you
feeling?</i> A little weak.

330
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,160
- That's from the oxygen.
- My mouth is dry.

331
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,601
<i>Okay. Well, uh, I'll get
you some of your tea.</i>

332
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,607
Mixed connective tissue disease?
Her A.N.A. is barely elevated.

333
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,407
Thanks for checking up on her.
Good to know you got my back.

334
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,143
O₂ sat's down to 83. Pulmonary
problems, breathing problems.

335
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,242
Irritation from the
oxygen is typical.

336
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,220
She comes in with a rash, and
you put her into cardiac arrest.

337
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,450
That well just never
runs dry, does it?

338
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,016
If there was no underlying problem, why
is she still having the rapid heart rate?

339
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,772
<i>Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis
caused by you giving her prednisone.</i>

340
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,992
Her reaction is a
symptom, not an error.

341
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,277
There's always an explanation,
isn't there? Yes, there is.

342
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,616
And if this one
doesn't work, we'll find

343
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,280
another. But never one
involving you screwing up.

344
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,296
One that fits all the facts.

345
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,672
Look, we obviously have a
difference of opinion, and that's fine.

346
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,486
But, unfortunately, I've
used up all the time I

347
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,389
budgeted today for banging
my head against a wall.

348
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,850
I'm gonna do you the biggest
favor one doctor can do for another.

349
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,715
I am gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

350
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,187
You're off the case.

351
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,718
We're gonna treat the symptoms.
Not the underlying condition?

352
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,268
There is no underlying
condition. What's her status?

353
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,405
The sister's
breathing is labored.

354
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,881
Pneumonitis from the
hyperbaric chamber.

355
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,317
<i>Put her on 40% oxygen until her O</i>₂<i>sats
increase.</i> B.U.N. and creatinine's rising.

356
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,946
A.L.T. and A.S.T.
twice the normal range.

357
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,618
Could be from the hypotensive
episode. Let's follow them with labs.

358
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,356
She still has the rash and
joint pain she came in with.

359
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,178
<i>Order a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory.</i> When we were

360
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:41,009
looking at the differential
diagnosis with Dr. House,

361
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,935
<i>we were considering—</i> I don't need to
hear what Dr. House was considering.

362
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,440
All of this woman's symptoms can be
traced to Dr. House's considerations.

363
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,044
<i>Okay.</i>

364
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,603
Let's just get this
patient healthy.

365
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,411
I want her going out the
front door and not the back.

366
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,353
Hey, it's not like
I betrayed him.

367
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,932
Cuddy would have found out about
the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

368
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,118
You did what you
thought you had to.

369
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,510
<i>Can't get enough
of this place, huh?</i>

370
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,247
Came for my stethoscope.

371
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,341
So I shouldn't read too much into
the fact that you were looking for it...

372
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,409
in the drawer with the
epinephrine syringes in it?

373
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,582
Okay. Yeah, I'd like
to clear my reputation.

374
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,219
Oh, right. I forgot how much
you care about what people think.

375
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,128
Prescribing cigarettes
for inflammatory bowel?

376
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,291
That's, uh—They cause
lung cancer, you know.

377
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,131
You know why they have
ribbons for breast cancer,

378
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,969
colorectal cancer, prostate
cancer— And not for lung cancer?

379
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,008
They ran out of colors?

380
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,635
It's because people
blame lung cancer patients.

381
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,646
They smoke. They screwed
up. They deserve to die.

382
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,808
The reason people die
from lung cancer is guilt.

383
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,717
Huh. Well, guilt
does a lot of damage.

384
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,054
You said that with
great significance.

385
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,958
You're not here to find your stethoscope.
You're not here to clear your reputation.

386
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:19,192
<i>You're here because you're having
doubts. You might have screwed up.</i>

387
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,860
I'm here because, if I'm right,
Cuddy is killing that patient.

388
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,301
<i>Okay. But if you’re wrong?</i>

389
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,707
Then she's saving her. <i>Fine.</i>

390
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,219
<i>You're gonna have to go through
every record of every patient...</i>

391
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,735
who's been through this
clinic in the last two days.

392
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,976
And you're gonna have to hope
that those records can be trusted.

393
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,245
Which, by the way, yours can't.

394
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:53,091
These pills will help your kidneys
function a little better, Sister.

395
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,040
Get your wrist?

396
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,243
What's that?

397
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,679
104.

398
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,740
<i>Is that good?</i> It's fine.

399
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,955
You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

400
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,695
I have to get this. Excuse me.

401
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,531
My mother's been
dead for 10 years.

402
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,639
But she's always
with you in spirit.

403
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,800
What do you know about
the nun? Which one?

404
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,311
The cute one. I
think she likes me.

405
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:43,110
- The sick one, obviously.
- Her parents died when she was a child.

406
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,777
<i>She's been with the Church
ever since.</i> What's she lying about?

407
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,320
- Why do you say that?
- I always say that.

408
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,084
And the old nun thinks the
sick nun is a big fat nun liar.

409
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,921
You know nuns. What do
you think? I don't know nuns.

410
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,986
You hate nuns. You can't hate
someone if you don't know them.

411
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,622
Know any Nazis? Maybe
I hate them on principle.

412
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,897
I have a theory about what
makes good boys good.

413
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,303
It's not because of
some moral imperative.

414
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,706
Good boys have the
fear of God put into them.

415
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,836
Catholic Church specializes
in that kind of training...

416
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,904
To make good boys
afraid of divine retribution,

417
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,109
so they'll do what
their daddies tell them...

418
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,228
Like, for example,
going into medical school

419
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,086
when it's the last
thing they wanna do.

420
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,089
What do you think?

421
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,288
I think, if she did have a
secret, her boss would know.

422
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,359
Did you paint or put in
new carpets recently? No.

423
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,632
Any way she could
have got access to drugs?

424
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,782
We lock all our
medications in the infirmary,

425
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,767
and we don't keep
prescription drugs here.

426
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:48,109
Why haven't you asked Sister
Augustine about these things directly?

427
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,116
<i>I've found that when you want
to know the truth about someone,</i>

428
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,948
that someone is probably
the last person you should ask.

429
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,648
Ah. And have you been
speaking to Sister Eucharist?

430
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,352
She ratted out her fellow
sister pretty quickly. <i>Oh.</i>

431
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,657
<i>If I were you, I'd have her
repeat a year of nun school.</i>

432
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:06,062
Well, becoming a nun
doesn't make you a saint.

433
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,566
<i>Becoming a doctor
doesn't make you a healer.</i>

434
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:12,469
And just because we live in a monastery,
and we spend most of our time in prayer,

435
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,406
doesn't mean we don't
find time for drama.

436
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,340
So, what is the
sick one's drama?

437
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,143
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic
foster care until she came to us.

438
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,913
- Tea?
- Sure.

439
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,718
Do all of you lie?

440
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,370
<i>It's a good strategy; it's simpler
when you all tell the same lie.</i>

441
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,364
She has not spent her
entire life as a good Catholic.

442
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,367
<i>When she had a cardiac arrest, I
had to open her blouse to do C. P. R.</i>

443
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,427
And I learned two things:
nuns can have nice breasts,

444
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:49,999
<i>and she has a tattoo on
her shoulder— Of a skunk.</i>

445
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:54,171
<i>Now, maybe it's the
sacred skunk of Joseph,</i>

446
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,512
but, as far as I know, Catholic
foster care and monasteries...

447
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,382
do not keep tattoo
parlors in their refectories.

448
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,149
We consider that
our life begins...

449
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,748
when we put on our
habits and take our vows.

450
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,419
- What happens before then— - Is
irrelevant to you, but it's relevant to me.

451
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,867
Sister Augustine went into foster
care when she was six years old,

452
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,532
but she left when she was 12.

453
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,475
She lived on the streets.
She got into drugs.

454
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,938
When she was 15,
she became pregnant.

455
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,948
Tried to self-abort.

456
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,951
She lost the child.
She became ill.

457
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,953
We took her in
when she came back.

458
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,549
If we had thought it was medically
relevant, we would have told you.

459
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,653
It's not.

460
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,571
This tea is delicious.
Local herbs?

461
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,841
Any change with the medication?
Yes. She's getting worse.

462
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:03,212
Lung function's deteriorating. B.U.N.
and creatinine continuing to rise.

463
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,774
She's starting to run a fever,
and the rash is spreading.

464
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,129
At this rate, she's not gonna make
Christmas. Maybe House is right.

465
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,532
Maybe there is an underlying
condition that explains the symptoms.

466
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,151
Something we haven't
considered. Like what?

467
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,353
It could be a metabolic
disorder. Specifically?

468
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,362
Might be genetic. Specifically?

469
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,807
I'm just saying— You're just
saying you think House is right.

470
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,357
Might <i>be right.</i> Of
course he might be right.

471
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,268
<i>It might be the hand of God at
work. Don't say it's something else...</i>

472
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,636
<i>unless you've got
something concrete to offer.</i>

473
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,138
What's this, hemlock?

474
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,511
I'm gonna do you the biggest
favor one doctor can do another.

475
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,516
I'm gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

476
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,650
It's figwort tea—
Great for that little

477
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:42,878
pick-me-up we're all
looking for in the morning.

478
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,551
Opens the lungs, increases the
blood pressure, stimulates the heart.

479
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,528
Unfortunately, if you then get injected
with even .1 c.c. of epinephrine...

480
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,156
Instant cardiac arrest.

481
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,544
- Still, what the hell, it tastes great.
- Sister Augustine...

482
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,060
Has been drinking it
religiously, so to speak.

483
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,130
And if you take the cardiac
arrest out of the equation...

484
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,406
All the rest of the
symptoms can be explained

485
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,406
by a severe long-term
allergic reaction.

486
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,640
Well, that's what Cameron
said in the beginning.

487
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:12,310
<i>Yes, she did. Well done.</i>

488
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:17,584
But your unwillingness to stick by
your diagnosis almost killed this woman.

489
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,216
Take a lesson from Foreman—
Stand up for what you believe.

490
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,925
Okay. Let's go figure
out how to save a nun.

491
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,024
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

492
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,436
<i>Because it's been
untreated for so long,</i>

493
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,063
it's gone from a simple "watery
eyes, scratchy throat" allergy...

494
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,439
to a whopping "I'm gonna
kick your ass" allergy...

495
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,380
Compromising her immune
system, diminishing her

496
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:40,502
ability to heal and breaking
down her organ systems.

497
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,016
- So, what's the source?
<i>- The dish soap.</i>

498
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,109
No. The symptoms persisted
days after the dish-washing episode.

499
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,766
It's gotta be something
she's been exposed to

500
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,431
here in the hospital as
well as the monastery.

501
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,617
What about the tea? It
caused her arrhythmia.

502
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,626
Could be, but
it's not definitive.

503
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,538
- We'll skin-test for allergens.
- Not yet. She's too reactive.

504
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,540
She tests positive to everything.
We need to stabilize her...

505
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,659
Isolate her from all possible
allergens— Give her system a rest.

506
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,669
Get her in a clean room. Okay.

507
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,914
Then gradually introduce
allergens and see how she responds.

508
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,806
When she reacts to something,
we'll know that's what's killing her.

509
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,212
There you go. No
television, no books.

510
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,544
- Not even my Bible?
- I'm afraid not.

511
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,982
This room has filtered
air, filtered water.

512
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:22,920
<i>You even have silk sheets—
Very decadent and hypoallergenic.</i>

513
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,457
You should be
feeling better here.

514
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,123
We'll be back to check
on you in a little while.

515
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:35,395
Can the other sisters
come in and pray with me?

516
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,433
It'd be better if you
don't have any visitors.

517
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,099
Once we isolate what's
causing your allergy,

518
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,109
<i>then we can be
a little more lax.</i>

519
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,754
I-I can pray with you.

520
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,554
I don't wanna die.

521
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,787
Why has he left me?

522
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,797
I was in seminary school.

523
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,140
They asked us once what
our favorite passage was.

524
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,375
I chose First Peter,
chapter one, verse seven.

525
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,451
"These trials only test your faith to
see whether or not it is strong and pure.

526
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,823
Your faith is being tested, as
fire tests gold and purifies it."

527
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,294
"And your faith is far more
precious to the Lord than mere gold.

528
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,695
"So if your faith remains
strong after being tested,

529
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:44,396
"it will bring you much
praise and glory and honor...

530
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,806
on the day of his return."

531
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,001
He hasn't left you.

532
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,072
The only thing in the way of you
knowing he's there is your fear.

533
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:02,850
You have a choice—faith
or fear. That's the test.

534
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,083
Choosing faith doesn't
mean I won't die.

535
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,319
But it will affect how you
experience your death...

536
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,987
and, therefore, your life.

537
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,825
It's up to you.

538
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,890
Why did you leave
seminary school?

539
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,230
That test.

540
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,899
You passed. I didn't.

541
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,540
We'll call you if anything
changes. Will she be all right?

542
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,623
As long as she's not
exposed to anything that

543
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,548
can aggravate her
allergy, she'll be fine.

544
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,943
I need some help in here!

545
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,584
Screw the procedure!
She's in anaphylactic shock!

546
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,891
No way. She's in a damn
clean room. You kidding me?

547
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,897
Get in here!

548
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:50,595
<i>- . - 1 c. c. of epi.
- We've got to intubate.</i>

549
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,104
<i>I got it. Get the ambu bag.</i>

550
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,319
I'm in.

551
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,956
Breathing's stabilized.

552
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,804
It's a clean room.

553
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,181
<i>How do you get an allergic
reaction in a clean room?</i>

554
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:42,144
Maybe it was the preservatives
in the I.V.? Checked that.

555
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,780
Latex tubing? Checked
that. Checked everything.

556
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,556
Well, it could be mast cell
leukemia. It can cause anaphylaxis.

557
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:55,124
<i>I checked the blood levels, and it's not
eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylaxis.</i>

558
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,329
Maybe it's just divine will.

559
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,895
It's not my will.

560
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,878
You do realize, if you're wrong—
About the big picture, that is...

561
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:11,883
You're going to burn, right?

562
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,112
What do you want me to
do— Just accept it, pack it in?

563
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,644
Yeah. I want you to accept that
sometimes patients die against all reason,

564
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,657
and sometimes they get
better against all reason.

565
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,216
No, they don't. We just
don't know the reason.

566
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,991
I think the nuns would
agree with you on that.

567
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,142
I just wanted to say that I know
that you did everything you could.

568
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,542
I don't need verification from you
to know that I'm doing my job well.

569
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,514
That's your problem, not
mine. I was just being nice.

570
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,347
Yeah, well, you don't
need to always do that.

571
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,686
Merry Christmas.

572
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,666
Sister Augustine's
been extubated.

573
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,203
Good. She's requested to
check out, against medical advice.

574
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,209
She wants to go
back to the monastery.

575
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,541
Well, talk her out of it.

576
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,912
I think I may have
talked her into it.

577
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,098
Room's paid up for
the rest of the week.

578
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,537
<i>Might as well stick around.</i>

579
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:43,871
This illness... is
a test of my faith.

580
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:48,141
If it's his will to take me, it
doesn't matter where I am.

581
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,944
<i>I can accept that.</i>

582
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,417
Does anybody believe
anything you say?

583
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,255
You're not accepting.

584
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,658
You're running away.

585
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,887
Just like you always do.

586
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,795
You ran away from the
monastery to get laid.

587
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:10,866
You ran away from the real world
when getting laid didn't work out so good.

588
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,736
<i>Now things aren't working
out again, so off you go.</i>

589
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,743
Why is it so difficult for
you to believe in God?

590
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,145
What I have difficulty with is
the whole concept of belief.

591
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,683
Faith isn't based on
logic and experience.

592
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,187
<i>I experience God
on a daily basis...</i>

593
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:33,089
and the miracle
of life all around...

594
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:37,027
The miracle of birth,
the miracle of love.

595
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,826
He is always with me.

596
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:44,131
Where is the miracle in
delivering a crack-addicted baby?

597
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,535
Hmm?

598
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,041
Then watching her mother abandon
her 'cause she needs another score.

599
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,236
<i>Miracle of love.</i>

600
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,109
You're over twice
as likely to be killed...

601
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,150
by the person you
love than by a stranger.

602
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,414
Are you trying to talk
me out of my faith?

603
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,321
<i>You can have all the faith you
want in spirits and the afterlife...</i>

604
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,189
and heaven and hell.

605
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,990
But when it comes to
this world, don't be an idiot.

606
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,600
'Cause you can tell me that you put your
faith in God to get you through the day,

607
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,694
but when it comes time to cross
the road, I know you look both ways.

608
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,538
<i>I don't believe he is inside
me and is going to save me.</i>

609
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:28,342
I believe he is inside
me whether I live or die.

610
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,405
Then you might as well live.

611
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,751
You got a better shot
betting on me than on him.

612
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,318
When I was 15,

613
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,885
I was on every kind of
birth control known to man...

614
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:47,296
And I still got pregnant.

615
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:52,269
I blamed God. I hated
him for ruining my life.

616
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,272
<i>But then I realized something.</i>

617
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:59,971
You can't be angry with God and
not believe in him at the same time.

618
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,776
No one can. Not
even you, Dr. House.

619
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,913
How'd it go? She
has God inside her.

620
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,189
It would have been
easier to deal with a tumor.

621
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,492
Maybe she's allergic to God?

622
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,480
We've looked everywhere for an allergen
that could be causing this reaction...

623
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,598
except one place—inside her.

624
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,041
On her medical history, she didn't
mention any surgery. She had one.

625
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,547
Can we get her records? What hospital was
it at? She didn't have it at a hospital.

626
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,708
Order a full body scan.
What if she refuses?

627
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,311
Tell her I'm looking
for a miracle.

628
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,424
No Piercings. No fillings.

629
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,155
No surgical pins in
the arm. No implants.

630
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:53,027
It's clean as a whistle.
What's House looking for?

631
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,263
- What is that?
- Don't know.

632
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,931
Lock on it. Get a
3-D representation.

633
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,944
Oh, my God.

634
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:16,446
The copper cross—a form of birth
control pulled off the market in the '80s.

635
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,219
- So she's allergic to copper.
- Rare, but it happens.

636
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,123
Wouldn't she know
she had an I.U.D.?

637
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,685
She had an abortion.
I.U.D. must have been left in,

638
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,857
embedded in the endometrial
tissue where it couldn't be detected.

639
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,061
So, all we have to do
is remove the I.U.D.

640
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,434
Then the symptoms
should subside.

641
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,204
I got this I.U.D. when I was 15.
It-It's been more than 20 years.

642
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,371
Prolonged exposure to an
allergen with minimal symptoms.

643
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:45,941
But at some point. all it takes is one last
contact to cause a full-blown reaction.

644
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:49,351
Just like a balloon filled with
air— One last breath, it explodes.

645
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:53,723
The first time I got the rash was when
I was washing the copper cookware.

646
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:58,752
And all your subsequent symptoms
came from ingesting food prepared in it.

647
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,322
Dr. House found his miracle.

648
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,334
I doubt he'll
interpret it that way.

649
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,663
You told me your
favorite passage.

650
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,731
Would you like to hear mine?

651
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,036
"Celebrate and be glad,

652
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:17,048
because your brother was
dead and is alive again."

653
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,085
The prodigal son.

654
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,451
He'll be waiting for
you when you're ready.

655
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,521
We'll schedule your
surgery for tomorrow.

656
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,500
The sixth circle of hell.

657
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,299
Confined in a sweat box with a bloody
nose, and all the tissues are soggy.

658
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,636
I think that's the seventh.
No. The seventh is...

659
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:46,644
God, you must be fun at parties. I
think we both know the flaw in that theory.

660
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:50,204
How's the sister? Heart rate
is normal, kidneys functioning.

661
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,908
You know how it is
with nuns. You take out

662
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,661
their I.U.D.'s, they
just bounce right back.

663
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,052
Great. Told you
I didn't screw up.

664
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:00,887
You screwed up. I gave
her .1 c.c. of epinephrine.

665
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,959
Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you
off the case, you would have killed her.

666
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,000
You wanna come over
for Christmas dinner?

667
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,504
You’re Jewish. Yeah.
Hanukkah dinner.

668
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,335
What do you care? It's
food. It's people. No, thanks.

669
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:21,946
Maybe I'll come to your place. Your wife
doesn't mind being alone at Christmas?

670
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,778
I'm a doctor. She's
used to being alone.

671
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,277
I don't wanna talk
about it. Neither do I.

672
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,317
You did good with the nun.

673
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:40,127
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

674
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:44,329
Merry Christmas,
Dr. House. Dr. Wilson.

675
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,605
Good night.

676
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,799
That was sweet.
