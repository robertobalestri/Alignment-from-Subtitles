1
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,997
Visualizing?

2
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,439
All right. You're up, tiger.

3
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,603
You feel all right?
You look a little pale.

4
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm fine. Does
your neck still hurt?

5
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:51,380
It'll be fine. Maybe you should
do the two-and-a-half instead.

6
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,330
I'm gonna do the three. Well, it's
better to nail the two-and-a-half than...

7
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,791
I'm gonna nail the three.

8
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,793
All right.

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,423
Well, let's show these senior citizens what
a well-coached 12-year-old can do, huh?

10
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:25,247
<i>Next diver, two-time National
Junior champion, Mary Carroll.</i>

11
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,807
Damn it.

12
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:52,335
You can do this. Come
on, just... see it. See it.

13
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:09,562
Big jump. Pike out. Rip it.

14
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,987
Call 911. We need an ambulance.

15
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,319
- I saw the light on.
- It's daytime.

16
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,420
It's a figure of speech.

17
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,488
Always so literal.

18
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,568
- Got a new cane.
- Yeah.

19
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,005
Guy in the store
said it was slimming.

20
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,771
Vertical stripe.

21
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,905
- Why are you here?
- Vogler is dead.

22
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,881
What? What happened?

23
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,943
Again with the literal
translation. Vogler, the idea.

24
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,955
Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags.
"Bow down before me."

25
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,957
He is gone from the hospital.

26
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,925
So things can go back
to the way they were.

27
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,258
The way they were
was kind of weird.

28
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,959
Hmm. Weird works for me.

29
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,264
What are you saying? Literally.

30
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,273
- I want you to come back.
- Why?

31
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,408
Please unclench.

32
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,883
You're not on the clock, and when you
do that, I clench and it's a whole thing.

33
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,250
Could you look at your pager?

34
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,794
It's no big deal. Some sort
of epidemic. Not my area.

35
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,662
- You should go. It's important.
- What I'm doing now is important.

36
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,932
- Why do you want me back?
- 'Cause you're a good doctor.

37
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,799
- That's it?
- That's not enough?

38
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,679
Not for me.

39
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,485
Go deal with your plague.

40
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,661
<i>You are in a quarantined area.</i>

41
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,292
<i>Please remain calm and stay in
line. A doctor will see you shortly.</i>

42
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,805
<i>When you see a doctor, you
will receive a blue or yellow form.</i>

43
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,775
<i>Patients with blue forms must
immediately exit to the parking lot.</i>

44
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,335
<i>Dr. House. Need you here.</i>

45
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,281
Sorry. Lot of sick people.
I might catch something.

46
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,284
A judge at the campus
pool center collapsed.

47
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,684
L.P. revealed a virulent
form of bacterial meningitis.

48
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,245
Great. You got it diagnosed.
You don't need me.

49
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,987
2,500 people at the
pool center were exposed.

50
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,038
They're being bused to all
the neighboring hospitals.

51
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,258
That's a problem with
resources, not diagnostics.

52
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,926
I—I'd be completely lost,
get in everyone's way.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,232
Joe. Dr. House
doesn't have a blue slip.

54
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,171
No one leaves the quarantine
area without a blue slip.

55
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,142
You are a doctor at
this hospital. Act like one.

56
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,144
And...

57
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,339
take these.

58
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,548
102.

59
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,117
You win a trip to
the second floor.

60
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,186
Next.

61
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,533
All right. No fever. No rash.

62
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,062
You're fine. Take
these two pills.

63
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,406
And show this blue slip to
Security on your way out.

64
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,036
Next.

65
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,944
Take these. Go home.

66
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,711
Talk to your daughter. What?

67
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,273
Your pants, your
blouse, your scarf are all

68
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:02,279
freshly dry cleaned.
Everything except your jacket.

69
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,519
It's got a smudge on it.
Probably two days old.

70
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,570
Which means you didn't
know the jacket had been worn.

71
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,564
So either your husband
is a cross-dresser,

72
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,759
or your daughter's been borrowing
your clothes without telling you.

73
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,064
She probably wants to
look older to get into bars.

74
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,129
I don't have a daughter.

75
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,540
Next.

76
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,276
<i>So I have it?</i> Take the
yellow form to the second floor.

77
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,284
You're gonna be
fine. I'm gonna die.

78
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,947
It's treatable— As long as
you go to the second floor.

79
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,956
Next.

80
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,387
Yow.

81
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,589
Fever? Does that mean I have it?

82
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,132
Do you have a rash?

83
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,168
Come on.

84
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,764
It's from my new bathing
suit. I've had it a week.

85
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,898
Yeah.

86
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,808
Does your neck hurt? If
it does, you hit the trifecta.

87
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,573
It's nothing. I pulled it trying
to do a three-and-a-half tuck.

88
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,673
Where are your parents?
We live in Chicago.

89
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,945
I'm here with my coach.

90
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,085
I wanted to see
what you were writing.

91
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,020
Go like this.

92
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,965
Ow.

93
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,464
Go like this.

94
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,443
<i>Take these pills.</i>

95
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,741
Blue slip will get
you out of here.

96
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,946
Next.

97
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,384
You're coming with me.

98
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,184
<i>Proceed to the second
floor for further examination.</i>

99
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,725
You're gonna need a
C.T. scan. Second floor.

100
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,727
Take the elevators,
follow the parade.

101
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,956
Next.

102
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,000
<i>- Maybe it's something systemic.</i>
- Or maybe it's meningitis.

103
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,235
<i>She's had the rash a week. If it was
this meningitis she'd be dead by now.</i>

104
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,242
You guys figure we're
done down there?

105
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,074
The 800 people milling around
are just waiting for the bathroom?

106
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,878
Twelve-year-old female. Fever,
rash, neck pains. Not meningitis.

107
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,884
It's the definition
of meningitis.

108
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,251
Sure. Pus in the spinal canal makes it
hurt to move your head up and down,

109
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,153
but her neck only hurts
moving side to side.

110
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,419
- Oh, side to side.
- Doesn't fit.

111
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,087
The three of you, lobby, now.

112
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,306
<i>Those little pills you're
passing out so efficiently...</i>

113
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,390
aren't gonna do
Miss Louganis squat.

114
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,435
You just don't want to
deal with the epidemic.

115
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,436
That's right. I'm
subjecting a 12-year-old...

116
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,871
to a battery of dangerous and
invasive tests to avoid being bored.

117
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,609
Okay, maybe I would
do that. But I'm not.

118
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,840
<i>If it turns out she's
got meningitis,</i>

119
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,645
you're right, you win; but if we
go back downstairs and she dies...

120
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,515
your face will be so red.

121
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,922
You have one hour.

122
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,892
Get a lumbar puncture.
Some brain infections

123
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,751
can be pretty clever
at hide-and-seek.

124
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,424
I'll get on her blood
work. No, you won't.

125
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,798
You, sir, will research all the
causes in the universe of neck pain.

126
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:05,532
- The list is, like, two miles long.
- Start with the letter "A."

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,632
And put her on rifampin. <i>Rifampin
is for meningitis. You just said—</i>

128
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,643
<i>In case I'm wrong.</i>

129
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,474
It has happened.

130
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,989
Brenda, I need a
C.B.C. Chem 7 in 2046.

131
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,228
Hold on. Excuse me. Excuse me.

132
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,428
Hey, there's a line here.
That's why I said excuse me.

133
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,836
Brenda, I need a bed
and a— We all need stuff.

134
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,931
Push me again.

135
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,885
Brenda, I need a bed and a
nurse for a lumbar puncture.

136
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,606
No beds, no nurses for at least
four hours. I've only got one.

137
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,157
Your patient only has an hour to live
unless she gets a lumbar puncture?

138
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,583
Cuddy only gave us an
hour to work on the patient.

139
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,450
Back of the line.

140
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,471
<i>Do not leave the quarantine</i>

141
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:01,519
<i>area until you have
been seen by a doctor.</i>

142
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,292
<i>When you see a doctor, you
will receive a blue or yellow form—</i>

143
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,767
<i>This novocaine will numb
you for the lumbar puncture.</i>

144
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,669
Sorry this has to
be so public, Mary.

145
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,038
Normally I'm in a bathing suit
with 5,000 people staring at my butt.

146
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,043
I can block this out.

147
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,675
These kids are all very mature. Travel
around the country from event to event.

148
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,318
Okay, I want you to hold
your knees and tuck your head.

149
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,618
- Like a dive?
- Exactly.

150
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,821
Good. Great. Don't
forget to breathe.

151
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,996
All right.

152
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,035
<i>Sorry.</i>

153
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,268
Geez. Coach, help me out here.

154
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,378
Play a little defense before
I poke the wrong thing.

155
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,907
Okay, here we go.

156
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,483
- Ow. I feel it. Ow. I feel it. I fee—Ow.
- Try to relax, Mary. Try to relax.

157
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,421
Relax.

158
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,534
What letter are you up to? "A."

159
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,596
Torture combing through
all that stuff, ain't it?

160
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,541
- Real dull. Awful.
- It's no problem.

161
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,135
Well, thank goodness.

162
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,875
A lot of people would
resent having to do this.

163
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:38,625
<i>If you receive a blue
form, please exit the area.</i>

164
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,093
<i>If you receive a yellow form,
please proceed to the second floor.</i>

165
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,096
Where's the 12-year-old
girl that was here?

166
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,928
Needed the gurney. She
just had a lumbar puncture.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,697
She's not supposed to be moved.
Sorry. We needed the gurney.

168
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,443
Hey.

169
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,039
- Hey.
- You okay? How's your head feeling?

170
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,278
She's got a headache
and she's dizzy.

171
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,911
She shouldn't have been moved
after the procedure. I'm sorry.

172
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,086
I'm fine. What
did the test show?

173
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,218
No meningitis and
no other infections.

174
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,891
But you're not carrying a blue
form. I have something else, don't I?

175
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,402
Something's causing your symptoms.
We're gonna keep you here overnight.

176
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,666
I know it's a little crazy in here,
but hopefully it'll settle down...

177
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,537
<i>and we'll be able
to get you a room.</i>

178
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:35,240
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not usually
all emotional like this. I just—</i>

179
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,112
You're doing great. Your
folks land in a few hours.

180
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,280
<i>I just— I haven't
slept. I'm so tired.</i>

181
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,083
Oh, my God. My eye's bleeding.

182
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,755
<i>What is it? What's happening?</i>

183
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,096
Oh, don't worry.

184
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,662
The antibiotic we gave you in case you
had meningitis can turn your tears reddish.

185
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,605
That's not blood.

186
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,818
But that...

187
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,821
That's blood.

188
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,623
That's going into my stomach?

189
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,962
The lavage showed
blood in your G.I. tract.

190
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,093
We need to find
where it's coming from.

191
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,103
You won't feel it.

192
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,995
I'm gonna numb the
back of your throat, and

193
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,039
Dr. Foreman is gonna
give you a sedative. Open.

194
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,772
- Ugh.
- Swallow.

195
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,837
Now lay on your side for me.

196
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,547
And... here we go.

197
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,624
- Yell fire or something.
- People, this area is highly contagious.

198
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,891
Please step back.
Highly contagious.

199
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:02,129
All right. Try to relax, Mary.
This shouldn't take too long.

200
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,694
I don't see any
tears or lesions.

201
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,977
<i>All right. I'm in the stomach.</i>

202
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,206
It's not bleeding.

203
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,292
There was more than a tablespoon of
blood in the mouth, so it's gotta be there.

204
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,478
Maybe her small intestine.

205
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,886
Thirty feet of digestive tract,
it could be anywhere in there.

206
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,357
We're not gonna
see it with this.

207
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,321
Believe it or not,
this is a camera.

208
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,529
You swallow it, and it goes all
the way through your system.

209
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,170
The antennae pick up
the signal from the pill.

210
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,709
Then we look at the
video of your intestines,

211
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,541
see where the blood is
coming from, and fix it.

212
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,707
All right? Water?

213
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,717
Down the hatch.

214
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,562
<i>Think I've seen this movie.</i>

215
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,534
The ending's kind of dark.

216
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,537
You want one?

217
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,433
How come <i>you</i> did the endoscopy?

218
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,773
- He asked for help.
- Her blood pressure was high.

219
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,040
Foreman is not your boss.

220
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,377
<i>When I tell you to do something—</i>

221
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,383
Whoa. Hold it there.

222
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,318
<i>Back it up a couple of frames.</i>

223
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,090
Oh, yeah. That's
your money shot.

224
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,093
I don't see anything.

225
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,329
Really? "Ginormous"
thing on the right side

226
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,598
of her intestine. That
doesn't intrigue you?

227
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,945
Does "ginormous" mean
really big, or really, really small?

228
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,801
- 'Cause I don't see anything.
- There? The Dieulafoy?

229
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,806
<i>Well, we can burn off
the swollen blood vessel,</i>

230
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,071
but it still doesn't account
for her other symptoms.

231
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,168
No, but it does
tell us something.

232
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,271
Though I have no idea what.

233
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,442
Could be a precursor to
intestinal intussusception.

234
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,784
Precursor isn't causing all
her other symptoms. What else?

235
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,018
You, in the lobby now.

236
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:09,358
I hurt my leg. I have a note. <i>You
had your hour— three, actually.</i>

237
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,762
Dr. Chase, I told you to
tell us when our time was up.

238
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,268
She has intestinal
bleeding. <i>She'll wait.</i>

239
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,999
Two more buses just arrived.
We need you downstairs.

240
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,032
No, you need more nurses, but
you cut back on the nursing staff,

241
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,477
so now you've got doctors doing
what nurses should be doing.

242
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,481
That's true.

243
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:33,384
I wonder if that has anything to
do with you costing us $100 million.

244
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,057
<i>Attention. If you do
not have a blue form,</i>

245
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,894
<i>you will not be allowed to
leave the quarantine area.</i>

246
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,899
Go. Be free.

247
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,286
If it's not the intussusception,
what about stomach cancer?

248
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,914
<i>Does she have any
abdominal pain? No.</i>

249
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,237
Then it's not stomach cancer.
Have you ruled out sepsis?

250
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,219
The L.P. and blood
smears showed no signs of

251
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,574
infection. Here. Take these
two pills and you can go.

252
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,604
Well, the lab's working at double their
capacity. Maybe someone screwed up.

253
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,674
No fever, no neck pain.

254
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,296
<i>Take the elevator to the third floor—</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wrong form.

255
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,315
- No fever, no neck pain. She's fine.
- Smell her hair. No chlorine.

256
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,884
Which means she wasn't at the pool, which
means she's come to a quarantined area...

257
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,898
because she's an
idiot or she's insane.

258
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:23,096
<i>No one is that stupid. East
wing, psych ward. Bye-bye.</i>

259
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,373
Neck pain could be a
symptom for bone cancer.

260
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,410
You up to the B's? Well done.

261
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,935
That would account for all her
meningeal symptoms—rash, fever.

262
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,675
You're fine. Take
these two pills.

263
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,774
Get a sample of her bone marrow.

264
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,910
From here? Break time.

265
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,354
- I need more than 15 minutes.
- Use Chase's break too.

266
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,918
Go.

267
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,229
You should just fire Chase.
What, and miss out on all this fun?

268
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,580
So you're gonna torture him
for a while and then fire him?

269
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,070
That's cold. You don't
think he has it coming?

270
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,403
Hey, I said fire
him. That's cold.

271
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,602
All he did was
save his job. What?

272
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,077
He completely screwed you over.

273
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,741
Right rudder.

274
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,613
Bank, bank, bank.

275
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:16,054
Good coffee? The rest of this
hospital is busting its tail and you're...

276
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:20,287
- What are you doing?
- Trying to think of anything except
the produce department at Whole Foods.

277
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:26,492
I am working. It got hot. Stop
acting like a 13-year-old. Sorry.

278
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,433
You just don't usually see breasts
like that on deans of medicine.

279
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,165
<i>Oh, women can't be heads of
hospitals? Or just ugly ones?</i>

280
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:36,471
<i>No, they can be babes. It's just
you don't usually see their fun bags.</i>

281
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,580
Your 3:00 interview for
Dr. Cameron's position is in your office.

282
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,889
Not interviewing today.
I don't know if you've

283
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:45,982
heard, but there's
this big-time epidemic.

284
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:50,649
Many sick people. Puking in the
hallways. It's crazy. We can reschedule.

285
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,522
No, you won't. You will
interview this person.

286
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,756
<i>And if he can put two sentences
together, you will send him to the lobby...</i>

287
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,764
where he will do his job.

288
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,823
Unlike the two of you.

289
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,431
Come on. You know I can't do a
bone marrow aspiration in the hallway.

290
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,441
And I can't give you
a procedure room.

291
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,853
I just need something at least
close to a sterile environment.

292
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,005
I need ten more nurses.

293
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
Brenda, listen.
Listen. She'll die.

294
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,551
At least she'll have a bed
then. Put that over there.

295
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,495
<i>Are there dead people
in those cabinets?</i>

296
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,832
I hope that's who's in there.

297
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,342
Just be calm. Relax.

298
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,786
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

299
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,224
Hang on.

300
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:04,024
Hang on.

301
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,487
<i>You know, I really admire
the way you don't care what</i>

302
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>anyone thinks. You just do
what you want, the way you want.</i>

303
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,220
So you went to Hopkins for
both undergrad and med school?

304
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,840
- That's right.
- He's in a band.

305
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:26,680
- You're into music?
- Totally.

306
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,721
What kind of music do you play?

307
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,555
<i>Mostly blues, you know,
James Cotton, some original stuff.</i>

308
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,858
- Oh, dude, you are so hired.
- Really?

309
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,923
- Not a chance.
- Why?

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,595
Tattoo.

311
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,941
Wow. I thought you'd be the last person
to have a problem with nonconformity.

312
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:51,273
Nonconformity. Right.

313
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,245
I can't remember the last
time I saw a 20-something

314
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,157
kid with a tattoo of an
Asian letter on his wrist.

315
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,150
You are one wicked freethinker.

316
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,447
You want to be a
rebel? Stop being cool.

317
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,579
Wear a pocket protector
like he does, and get a haircut,

318
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,523
<i>like the Asian kids who don't leave
the library for 20-hour stretches.</i>

319
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,583
They're the ones who
don't care what you think.

320
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,654
<i>Sayonara.</i>

321
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,966
So, should I go through all the
résumés looking for Asian names?

322
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,434
Actually, the Asian kids
are probably just responding

323
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,740
to parental pressure,
but my point is still valid.

324
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,343
So when do they think
you're getting out of here?

325
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,351
They don't know.

326
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,149
You don't look sick.
Better hope you're not.

327
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,589
- This equipment looks
like it's 100 years old.
- Just got it out of storage.

328
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,991
<i>It is the previous generation,
but it works just fine.</i>

329
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,996
Could you, uh— Could
you guys give us a second?

330
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,690
If it's good news,
you can tell them.

331
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,965
Okay. We're, uh, we're
pretty sure it's not cancer.

332
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,268
- Hey, that's great.
- I'll call your parents.

333
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,089
Well, we still can't
release her. We still

334
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,970
don't know yet exactly
what's causing the...

335
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,717
Mary?

336
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,668
What's wrong?

337
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:08,720
She's having an absence
seizure. Mary? You okay?

338
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:13,555
She looks fine. I need some help over
here. Push two milligrams Ativan, stat.

339
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,207
Are you sure it was
an absence seizure?

340
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,375
<i>Absolutely. She was
totally unresponsive...</i>

341
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,044
and unaware of what
was going on around her.

342
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,190
Do you mind?
We're trying to work.

343
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,602
We should get back out there.
Cuddy's gonna be looking for us.

344
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,186
Looking, but not finding.
Did you do an E.E.G.?

345
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,990
Seizure frequency's
increasing. They—They're

346
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,926
almost constant now.
Five in the last half hour.

347
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,865
Which tells us— It's
definitely in her brain.

348
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,404
- And it's getting worse.
- And?

349
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,303
Good Lord. Are you having
a bowl movement or a baby?

350
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,834
<i>- Could be barbiturate withdrawal.</i>
- No, it can't be drugs.

351
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,811
She's tested at every
meet she competes at.

352
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:10,713
A bleed in the brain
could cause seizures.

353
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,911
Rat poison? Could
also cause the neck pain.

354
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,454
You think she's eating off
the floor of her folks' garage?

355
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,456
Doesn't have to be.

356
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,822
Who would poison a 12-year-old?

357
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,059
Well, let's see now.
There's the 18-year-old

358
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,523
has-been that she beat
out to make the Nationals,

359
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,533
the has-been's parents, jealous
siblings, sociopathic swim fan,

360
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,298
and then there's just your plain
old garden variety whack job.

361
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,243
Hey.

362
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,511
- You know what a hemorrhoid is?
- No.

363
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,748
Well, Google it. And try some
raisin bran instead of the doughnuts.

364
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,422
Do a C.T. scan. Check
for intracranial bleeding.

365
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,053
Not a chance. Radiology's
totally swamped.

366
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,141
If our patient's bleeding into her brain,
she's gonna be dead in eight hours.

367
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,465
She could be, but a meningitis
patient will be without a C.T. scan.

368
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,529
- When I was in med
school, I had this old

369
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:09,033
professor— - Who touched
you in the naughty place?

370
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:15,043
Before the C.T. scan was introduced,
he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.

371
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,049
Hmm.

372
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,915
Ancient, but if there's
enough bleeding it might work.

373
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,717
<i>Okay, do what the guy who
didn't specialize in neurology said.</i>

374
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,258
It was my idea.

375
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,454
Nyah, nyah, nyah. You've
still gotta cover "Q" to "Z."

376
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,733
Sorry I'm late. I
was taking a dump.

377
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,108
<i>I'm guessing I'm better off
interviewing right after than right before.</i>

378
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,573
Dr. Petra Gilmar,
Dr. Gregory House.

379
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,399
You actually speak four
languages, or are you just

380
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:56,418
banking on never being
interviewed by anyone who does?

381
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,356
<i>It's true, and I can
swear in two more.</i>

382
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,361
Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?

383
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:06,365
Did you fall for him and can't handle
it, or was it the other way around?

384
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:09,844
- Yes, well, pretty much
every fellowship ends that way.
- No, it was nothing like that.

385
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,928
- You Jewish?
- Yes.

386
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,940
Is it true what they say
about Jewish foreplay?

387
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,201
- Two hours of begging?
- I heard four.

388
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,335
Well, actually, I'm
only half Jewish.

389
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,206
Look, I know you like to
play games with people.

390
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:27,276
I know you like to say outrageous
things and study how they react.

391
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,151
What you should know about me
is that I grew up with four brothers.

392
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,954
Keep your hands to yourself, I'm okay
with anything that comes out of your mouth.

393
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,556
Uh, well, that's, uh, great.
I think that's all we need.

394
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,863
Thank you for
coming by. Thank you.

395
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:59,649
- That's our Hitler!
- No way.

396
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,711
Are you kidding? Her
background's perfect.

397
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,732
She's smart, she can obviously
deal with your insanity...

398
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,748
You see her shoes? <i>Her shoes?</i>

399
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,871
What, did your horoscope in <i>Vogue</i> tell
you to avoid women wearing green shoes?

400
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,421
The eyes can
mislead, a smile can lie,

401
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,763
but the shoes
always tell the truth.

402
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,986
They were Prada.
Means she has good taste.

403
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,099
They were not Prada.

404
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,696
You wouldn't know Prada if
one stepped on your scrotum.

405
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,402
Okay. Well, they were
nice. Pointy. <i>Exactly.</i>

406
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,036
They were stylish,
and very painful to wear.

407
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,104
<i>Only an incredibly
shallow, insecure woman...</i>

408
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,618
<i>would rather be in pain all daylong than
wear a decent-looking, comfortable shoe,</i>

409
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,662
and that's exactly the type
I don't need around here.

410
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,621
<i>No. Someone who can
handle a lot of pain...</i>

411
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,681
is exactly the type you do need.

412
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,606
Excuse me.

413
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,963
What are you doing?

414
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm "ultrasounding" your head.

415
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,463
You're still having seizures. This
should help us figure out what's going on.

416
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,970
Blue form to the security guard.
You're not gonna be happy with anyone.

417
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,414
So what, your advice is...

418
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,282
hire someone I'm not
happy with and be happy?

419
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,364
No, my advice is much more
subtle. Stop being an ass.

420
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:20,018
<i>You always find some tiny
little flaw to push people away.</i>

421
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,004
Oh, now it's people. I thought we
were talking about fellowship applicants.

422
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,657
You have a history of this.
<i>Well, when I do decide...</i>

423
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,868
to push you away, I hope
there's a small person kneeling

424
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,744
behind you, so you fall
down and hurt your head.

425
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,670
Take these. There's water over
there. Blue form to the guard.

426
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,673
And you're done.

427
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,836
You had the perfect
person, and you blew it.

428
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,845
You saw the shoes.

429
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm not talking about her.
You're talking about Cameron.

430
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,784
I'm talking about every woman
you've ever given a damn about.

431
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,821
Cameron is so not perfect.

432
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,822
Well, nobody's perfect.

433
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,824
Mother Teresa? Dead.

434
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,723
Angelina Jolie?

435
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,490
No medical degree.
Now who's being picky?

436
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,122
You're gonna wind
up alone, House.

437
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,610
You were right. There's a
significant bleed in her temporal lobe.

438
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,569
But no poisons.

439
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,936
Did tox screens on her blood, urine,
and hair. Nothing. Did them twice.

440
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,885
He's a little dehydrated. Put him on a
saline drip and give him some orange juice.

441
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,437
<i>I need an operating
room and a neurosurgeon.</i>

442
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,414
Given the current crisis,
I'm tempted to say no,

443
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,473
<i>but since you've been
so sweet to me today—</i>

444
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,042
Our little mermaid is
bleeding into her temporal lobe.

445
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,022
- How fast can you have her prepped?
- Twenty minutes.

446
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,787
You'll have a surgeon
in the room in ten.

447
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,608
Mr. and Mrs. Carroll?
Are you Dr. House?

448
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,309
- This is Dr. Foreman.
- Is Mary all right?

449
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,318
The operation went well.

450
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:56,585
The intracranial pressure's been relieved,
and the swelling's already going down.

451
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,954
Oh, thank God.
Well, what happened?

452
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,391
I mean, did she bang her
head at a meet, or did she...

453
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,914
No, nothing like that.

454
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:06,262
Then why is she bleeding?
Is she gonna be all right?

455
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,558
I'm sorry. We still don't know.

456
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,991
<i>No toxins, no tumor,
no bone cancer.</i>

457
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,672
<i>Renal failure could cause the
rash, fever, and muscle pain.</i>

458
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,441
Maybe it's some sort of genetic
kidney disorder. <i>No family history.</i>

459
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,629
- And no blood in her urine or uremia.
- Not yet.

460
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,797
You want to do a differential based
on symptoms that might happen?

461
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,841
- You got a better idea?
- Stop it.

462
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:53,603
Stop looking for things we don't
know and focus on what we do know.

463
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,580
What do we actually know,
besides what's up there?

464
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,519
Come on. How hard can it be to
tell me what you already know?

465
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,524
- She's 12.
<i>- She spends a lot of time in pools—</i>
<i>exposure to chemicals.</i>

466
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,569
<i>- She travels a lot.</i>
- But never out of the country.

467
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,586
<i>What else?</i>

468
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,064
Come on!

469
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,883
We're gonna put you right here.

470
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,883
We're missing something.

471
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,584
What? Well, if I knew
that, it wouldn't be missing.

472
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,387
<i>Maybe she's adopted and
we've got the wrong history.</i>

473
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,763
No. She's got her mom's eyes
and a red patch of hair just like Dad.

474
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,098
<i>What about an allergic reaction?</i>

475
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,071
That could explain the
rash and muscle pain,

476
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,935
but probably not the
bleeding or seizures.

477
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,305
That's a lot of balloons.

478
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:02,245
- You think she's allergic to polyester?
- Not unless she's been competing
in the nude all these years.

479
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,547
Then what are you thinking?
What do the balloons mean?

480
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,057
What if the rash isn't a rash?

481
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,060
What are you talking about?

482
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,461
Who gave her the balloons?
Some of the girls from her team.

483
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,185
<i>They've been visiting
her pretty regularly,</i>

484
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,044
but none of them are
sick. What about the guys?

485
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,628
- None of them are sick either.
- Which guys visited her?

486
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,639
Uh...

487
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,766
Actually, none.

488
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,411
She's cute. She's nice.

489
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,972
She's a kick-ass diver.

490
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,645
You'd think the guys would be falling
all over themselves to get close to her.

491
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,656
She's 12. The youngest
guy on her team is 16.

492
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:49,127
- Okay, so maybe they're just not
interested, or— - They're avoiding her.

493
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,263
There any cell fragments
in her blood smears?

494
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,860
<i>No. Red blood cells were intact.</i>

495
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,311
Check 'em again.

496
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,613
<i>Blood looks like it's been
put through the blender now.</i>

497
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,683
You done yet? <i>You were right.</i>

498
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,322
The rash wasn't a rash. She's
bleeding into her skin. It's purpura.

499
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,730
Thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura?

500
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,359
Starts with "T."
You were so close.

501
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,336
<i>What could have set it off?</i>

502
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,339
She had no traces of
E. coli in her cultures.

503
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,705
She's obviously not
menopausal, so no estrogen.

504
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,370
There is one other
possible cause.

505
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,411
Oh, God.

506
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,658
<i>Pregnancy causes...</i>

507
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,751
all kinds of chemical
and biological changes...

508
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,659
in a woman's body...

509
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:01,166
Or a girl's body,
as the case may be.

510
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:08,935
In extremely rare cases, everything
goes haywire. It's called T.T.P.

511
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:14,446
Blood starts clotting like crazy and clogs
the vessels in your brain and kidneys.

512
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:19,951
Red blood cells end up getting
shredded as they squeeze past the clot,

513
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,953
like a fat guy in a crowded bar.

514
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,423
I'm sure you know
what that's like.

515
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,687
I mean, you're only 12, but
you're all grown up, right?

516
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,027
Travel on your own,
hang out in hotel rooms...

517
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,795
getting room service
with your teammates.

518
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,599
Maybe someone sneaks in a couple of
beers. You start playing spin the bottle.

519
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,732
Next thing you know you're waking
up with nothing on but your socks.

520
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,641
It wasn't like that.
Of course not.

521
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,704
- You wanted it.
- Yeah. I did.

522
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,273
He turned out
to be a jerk, but...

523
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,546
Actually, under New
Jersey law, the term is felon.

524
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,322
I knew what I was doing.

525
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,492
We're gonna have to do
something called plasmapheresis.

526
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,121
Cleans the antibodies
from your blood.

527
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,826
We're also gonna have
to terminate the pregnancy.

528
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,739
You gonna tell my parents?

529
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,399
Someone should.
Rock, paper, scissors?

530
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,776
They don't need to know.

531
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,077
I'll be all right.

532
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,175
Of course you will.

533
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:29,517
I mean, if you're old enough
to bleed out of your vagina,

534
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,818
<i>then obviously you’re
mature enough...</i>

535
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,622
to handle a simple thing like an
abortion without Mommy and Daddy's help.

536
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,624
You gonna tell my parents?

537
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:50,340
Under New Jersey
law, you're the boss.

538
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,520
Your daughter has T.T.P.

539
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,988
Don't worry. It's
curable. She'll be fine.

540
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,788
Well, wait. I mean, what
does T.T.P. stand for?

541
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,939
Some really big words that
you've never heard before...

542
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,898
and, when we're done,
will never hear again.

543
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,900
Have a nice day.

544
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:20,598
- Well, when can we take her home?
- Uh, in a few days.

545
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,870
She needs some minor surgery
to remove the underlying cause...

546
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:27,845
before we can do the...
another really big word.

547
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,381
<i>What's the underlying cause?</i>

548
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,912
- She has an abnormal growth
in her abdomen.
- What kind of surgery?

549
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,956
It's— It's very simple.

550
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,321
We do it here all the time.

551
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,657
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Actually, no.

552
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,197
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,992
We're almost done.

554
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,964
Hang in there.

555
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,906
<i>You're doing good.</i>

556
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,043
Feeling okay?

557
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,045
Yeah. You should be.

558
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:36,911
- Your platelets count's up.
- How's your neck?

559
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,817
Looks good. Anything
else we can get you?

560
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,379
No, thanks.

561
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,823
Okay.

562
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:52,423
Yeah.

563
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,328
Can I see my mom and dad?

564
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,266
Plasmapheresis is
working. She's gonna be fine.

565
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,271
I know.

566
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,519
Hi. I've got these.

567
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,965
I can't even tell you
how much I appreciate...

568
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,703
the opportunity
to meet with you.

569
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,451
- The moment I
heard you had another

570
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:18,846
fellowship opening, I—
- There is no opening.

571
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,985
House.

572
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,921
- You have to hire someone.
- I know.

573
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,250
Position's been filled.

574
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,321
- Why am I interviewing for a position
that's already been filled?
- Exactly.

575
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,205
I called to confirm the
interview this morning.

576
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,173
You figure if you keep
arguing, I'm gonna cave,

577
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,176
admit it's all a
lie and hire you?

578
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,415
Do you need your
parking validated?

579
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,803
I don't wanna
interview anyone else.

580
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,805
You're interviewing?

581
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,899
I thought you'd just have them
send a head shot along with their C.V.

582
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,912
Ha.

583
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,472
That's good, and why
I need you around...

584
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,711
To keep me in my place.

585
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,447
I can't come back.
I told you that.

586
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,080
- Wasn't listening.
- Right.

587
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,392
You want me to listen to
you more? I can do that.

588
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,330
Right.

589
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,491
I already accepted a
position somewhere else.

590
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:47,069
- With who?
- Yeuell—atJefferson.

591
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,165
- Unaccept it.
- Why?

592
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,772
Because Yeuell is boring.

593
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,783
He's pedantic and preachy.

594
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,480
Because he's short.

595
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,819
Because I want you to come back.

596
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,289
Not good enough.

597
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,833
Want more money?
A car allowance?

598
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,532
Better parking space?

599
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,011
Dinner.

600
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,812
And not just a meal
between two colleagues.

601
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,182
A date.

602
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:46,256
You'll come back to work...

603
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,856
if I go out on a date with you?

604
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,334
Yes.

605
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,066
Okay.

606
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,077
It's a deal.

607
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,511
See you tomorrow morning.

608
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,258
Don't be late.

609
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,260
I won't.

610
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,599
That's some bad hat, Harry.
