1
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:09,737
Where are those projections?
Three, six and nine are in their folders.

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,279
Can I have some more—
Excellent. Tea's at your seat. Hello.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,248
Oh, hold on.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,114
Ben Federman
again, another pre-call.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:22,782
We did the pre-call. Is
this the post pre-call call?

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,435
<i>The board's gonna want specifics
with the push into the Asian markets.</i>

7
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,394
Ben, there are no
specifics about Asia.

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,987
We came up with that as a
Hail Mary at 3:00 in the morning...

9
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,055
to placate the board
about international.

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,492
Carly, I'm just giving you
a heads-up about Asia.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,471
There is no Asia.

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,874
Let's talk about Asia.

13
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:45,140
We're in the preliminary stages of forming
a strategic alliance with Credit Lyonnais.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,479
Within three months, you won't be able to
walk four feet in Kangham, South Korea...

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,485
without seeing one of
our beautiful models...

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,785
smiling at you from billboards and
drugstore windows, inviting you in.

17
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:59,486
<i>That's incredible news, Carly. We'd
hoped to hear something about Asia.</i>

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,155
Had no idea plans
were so far along.

19
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,994
Well, you know Asia.
Nothing's done until it's done.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,593
<i>Carly, I was wondering,</i>

21
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,214
<i>could you walk us through what you
were thinking for other Asian territories?</i>

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,640
Absolutely. India has
over half a billion women.

23
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,611
In terms of spending power, it's the single
largest potential market in the world.

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,288
Um, we have retained a local firm to ensure
that cultural differences are respected.

25
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,353
Um, however, I can't go into the specifics
of my plan with you until tomorrow.

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,365
Right now I have a
meeting and I need the room.

27
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,765
We were just getting started.

28
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,032
I know and I do
apologize. It's last minute,

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,993
<i>but the meeting is with
three state department</i>

30
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:47,597
<i>officials to smooth
the way for China.</i>

31
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,042
China? This is just incredible.

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,546
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

33
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,147
What is it? I need a doctor.

34
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,812
I can't move my leg.

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,458
32-year-old female, paralysis and
severe pain in her right quad. Go.

36
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,898
- How'd she get to you?
- She's the C.E.O. of Sonyo Cosmetics.

37
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,334
Three assistants and 15 V.P.'s
checked out who should be treating her.

38
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,430
Who da man? I da
man. I always suspected.

39
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,999
Dr. House, I know the chances are
very slim, but I'm sure you recognize...

40
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,205
that she may have what
you had, a clot in her thigh.

41
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,339
A bit of a long shot.

42
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,442
- What about a disk herniation?
- I don't know, Eric.

43
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,784
If her disk were herniated, she'd
present with pain elsewhere, wouldn't she?

44
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,014
- Yeah, I suppose.
- You're right.

45
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,959
<i>A clot's also the most
deadly, right, Robert?</i>

46
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,829
True. The clot breaks off,
she could stroke and die.

47
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,800
<i>Dr. House, I believe
that they're right—</i>

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,031
- Stop talking.
- What?

49
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,506
You read one of those
negotiating books, didn't you?

50
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,069
<i>Getting To Yes.
Fifty Ways to Win an</i>

51
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:33,172
<i>Argument. Hitchhiker's
Guide to Being a Pal.</i>

52
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,496
In five seconds, you
just manipulated these

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,741
two into agreeing
with your point of view.

54
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,151
Fellas, this is known as
soft positional bargaining.

55
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,691
It's not gonna work.

56
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,226
Dr. House, are you saying
that she doesn't have a clot,

57
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,422
or are you saying that
if she does have a clot,

58
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,727
she doesn't need blood
thinners and an angiogram?

59
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,670
<i>Chase, put her on blood
thinners. Do an angiogram.</i>

60
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,298
When that comes back
negative, M.R.I. the spine.

61
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,036
If that's clean, cut her
open and biopsy the leg.

62
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,242
Excellent suggestion.
Read less, more TV.

63
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,285
<i>It's rare for an individual
to make a donation...</i>

64
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,262
<i>significant enough to
impact an organization</i>

65
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,688
<i>as large and
unwieldy as a hospital.</i>

66
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,285
This donation does
come with one string,

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,522
that he be made
chairman of the board.

68
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,328
I think that's a reasonable request. I
think he should have the right to know...

69
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,269
<i>what it is we do
with his $ 100 million.</i>

70
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,933
Please welcome our new chairman
of the board, Edward Vogler.

71
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,206
Thank you.

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,941
Thank you.

73
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,382
When I was 18,

74
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,545
my dad loaned me
$20,000 for a college tuition,

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,025
which he would have known was a mistake
had he known I wasn't actually in college.

76
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:57,724
I took his money and invested in
a friend who had a little business.

77
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,734
And when my dad found out
what I had done with his money,

78
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,260
he and I didn't
talk much after that.

79
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,272
But my friend's
business took off,

80
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,936
and I used the profits from that to
buy another company and another.

81
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,606
And I must have been pretty
good at it, had a good eye,

82
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,014
because before I knew it, people
were making offers for my company.

83
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,712
And about a year
ago, I went public,

84
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,018
and overnight I was
worth a billion dollars.

85
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,524
So, I went to see my dad.

86
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,996
I'll admit. I wanted a little payback. You
know, kind of shove the win in his face.

87
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,397
So, I drove upstate, and
sat in the kitchen I grew up in,

88
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,903
and, uh, he had no reaction.

89
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,901
It wasn't his fault. He
didn't even know who I was,

90
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,344
because his Alzheimer's
had taken a turn for the worse,

91
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,212
despite the best drugs
and care out there.

92
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,842
And that is why I'm here.

93
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,185
What if my contribution to this
hospital is the difference between...

94
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,124
no cure and a cure for cancer?

95
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,391
The difference between a man
not recognizing his wife of 35 years...

96
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:08,731
and being able to look at her and
say, "Good morning, honey. I love you."

97
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,173
<i>If there's a disease
out there killing people,</i>

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,143
I am writing you a
blank check to fight back.

99
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,179
So, things are
going to change a lot.

100
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,826
We're gonna have to
ask you for the cell phone.

101
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,661
Do what you need
to do. I'm okay.

102
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,861
I'm pretty sure my X-ray machine
can take your phone in a fight.

103
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,929
It'll fry it.

104
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,441
Fine.

105
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,242
<i>- How old is she?</i>
- Thirty-two.

106
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,442
Wow. And she's already the
C.E.O. of a public company.

107
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,214
She's a workaholic.
Okay, Carly, hold still.

108
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,518
<i>The X-ray machine is
gonna pass over your leg.</i>

109
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,252
Okay. What'd you
do with your time off?

110
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,385
Snowboarding in Gstaad.

111
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,395
Switzerland.

112
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,340
Do you ski or board? You
can come with if you like.

113
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,028
Maybe we should start with a
drink before we go around the world.

114
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,265
Oh, you wanna
have a drink with me?

115
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,308
Oh, very
aggressive. I like that.

116
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,841
I wanna run this
place like a business.

117
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,860
What, you want to put more
vending machines in the hallway?

118
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,752
Maybe a roulette wheel?
Nice one. But I'm serious.

119
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,416
The product that you're selling is
good health. It shouldn't be a tough sell.

120
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,927
If you don't wanna sell, it means you
don't care if people get your product.

121
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,556
You care if people are healthy,
or are you too proud for that?

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,460
Who's that?

123
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,939
Oh, that's just
one of our doctors.

124
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,777
Aren't, uh, doctors
supposed to wear lab coats?

125
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,180
<i>- He's different.</i>
- Everyone's buddy.

126
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,345
- No, not exactly.
- Then why does he get away with it?

127
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,256
It's just a coat.
He's very good.

128
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,295
Hmm.

129
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,332
<i>- Say "Ah."</i>
- Ah.

130
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,802
Now really belt it out, like
you're gonna throw up. Ahh!

131
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,705
Perfect.

132
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,039
Okay, that's it.

133
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,603
We should know in a couple of days
what's growing in your son's throat.

134
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,511
Hello?

135
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,022
- He can't talk.
- Excuse me?

136
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,217
- He had knee surgery.
- Right?

137
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,988
About a year ago, and
then he couldn't talk.

138
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,190
Right. Yeah, well, that happens.

139
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,793
You know, it's very dangerous
operating so close to the vocal cords.

140
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:00,830
<i>Okay. Well, we'll send your kid's culture
to the lab and somebody will call you.</i>

141
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,172
Boo!

142
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:11,711
Just wanted to see if your
dad, you know— Bizarre.

143
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,551
I need you to
wear your lab coat.

144
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,026
I need two days of
outrageous sex with someone

145
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,528
obscenely younger than
you, like half your age.

146
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,723
Wear the coat.

147
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,734
Man, oh, man, someone got
spanked real good this morning.

148
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,532
A guy gives $100
million to cure cancer.

149
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,004
A pretty small concession
to wear a lab coat.

150
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,201
Cure cancer?

151
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,268
Is the hospital getting out of the
dull business of treating patients?

152
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,523
You know that's not what he's
doing. I know exactly what he's doing.

153
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,675
He's using us to
run clinical trials.

154
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,186
Oh, shame on him,
saving lives like that.

155
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,120
It's unethical.

156
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,318
<i>Oh, are you coming in too? I
thought I had you convinced.</i>

157
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,884
Clinical trials save
thousands of lives.

158
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,953
He's using patients
as guinea pigs.

159
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,693
Pharmaceutical
companies do that every day.

160
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,442
Are we a pharmaceutical
company? We're gonna

161
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,012
wind up pressuring
desperate patients...

162
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,232
into choices that are
bad for them, good for us.

163
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,764
We're gonna compromise patient
care. Who the hell am I talking to?

164
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,209
Suddenly ethical lapses
are a major concern for you?

165
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,770
What's interesting is it
suddenly doesn't bother you.

166
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:20,051
So, if you ignore ethics to
save one person it's admirable,

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,282
but if you do it to save a
thousand, you're a bastard.

168
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,621
All he's done is taken
your game and gone pro.

169
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,597
He's not gonna kill a few patients.
He's gonna kill this hospital.

170
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,862
It took him three
seconds to size you up.

171
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,733
And surprise, he
doesn't like you.

172
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,933
Wear the damn coat.

173
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:51,412
Hello. I'm, uh, Dr. Foreman.
I work with Dr. House.

174
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,419
Our initial tests
say you're fine.

175
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,581
<i>We think you had a clot,
but it resolved on its own.</i>

176
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,184
So, we're gonna keep you overnight to be
safe, and you can go back home tomorrow...

177
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,786
or back to work.

178
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,492
Hey, are you okay?

179
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,829
Get in here! I need a line
in her. I.V. morphine, stat!

180
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,396
You get any read on the
new chairman of the board?

181
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,686
- Yeah, he took your parking space.
- It's not necessarily bad news.

182
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,953
Do you ever watch
<i>Gilligan's Island</i> reruns...

183
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,928
<i>and really, really think they're
gonna get off the island this time?</i>

184
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,100
We should introduce
ourselves. It couldn't hurt.

185
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:45,469
Make him a Bundt cake. A patient hit a 10
on the pain scale. What would explain that?

186
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,683
There was no clot in her leg.
The angio was totally clean.

187
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,403
What about the muscle biopsy?

188
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,706
No neurogenic or
myopathic abnormalities.

189
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,614
<i>She was also negative for trichinosis.
No toxoplasmosis or polyarteritis nodosa.</i>

190
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,084
Robert, what was her
sedimentation rate?

191
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,155
Normal, Allison.

192
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,056
Therefore, no inflammation,
no immunologic response.

193
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,719
Do you mind sharing
that number with me?

194
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,786
Fifteen, Allison.

195
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,128
- Are you mocking me?
- Duh, Allison.

196
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,227
<i>I'm just suggesting we look outside
the box. What if her sed rate is elevated?</i>

197
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,399
Well, let's go further outside the
box. Let's say the angio revealed a clot.

198
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,773
<i>And then let's say
we treated that clot,</i>

199
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,988
and now she's all better and
personally thanked me by performing...

200
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,913
My Aunt Elyssa
lives in Philadelphia.

201
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:31,918
Oh, it's story time.
Let me get my "baba."

202
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:36,081
Her normal temperature is
96.2, not 98.6 like you and me.

203
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,522
If her temperature were
98.6, she'd have a fever.

204
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,588
I'm just wondering if you think we could
apply the same logic to Carly's sed rate.

205
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,926
It's absurd.

206
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,528
I love it.

207
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,301
<i>If 15 is high for Carly,
then she has inflammation.</i>

208
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,674
<i>Which could, in turn, mean
cancer. I'll talk to Wilson.</i>

209
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,842
Next time, skip Aunt Elyssa.

210
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,383
<i>You're probably talking
about a primary bone cancer.</i>

211
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,715
It could be tricky to detect.
We'll need a bone scan.

212
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,948
That's why I'm talking
to an oncologist.

213
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:14,017
Sure. I've nothing better to do besides
departmental meetings and budget reports.

214
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,689
New chairman of the board,
you know. Oh, I hadn't heard.

215
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,632
Right. Clinical trials.
Completely unethical.

216
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,883
And a very bad omen
for you. There's not much

217
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:24,967
money in curing African
sleeping sickness.

218
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,133
No. I have seen every
scary movie ever made.

219
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,267
Six-year-old twins in front
of an elevator of blood.

220
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,574
Boys' choirs. <i>Those</i>
are bad omens.

221
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,741
This is much more mundane.
A billionaire wants to get laid.

222
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,047
Billionaires buy movie
studios to get laid.

223
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,053
They buy hospitals
to get respect.

224
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,249
And the reason you
want respect? To get laid.

225
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,657
Okay then. Just gotta
think like a billionaire.

226
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,389
Let's see. There'll be big,
scary changes and then,

227
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:54,560
"Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner to
discuss your future on my G5 private jet."

228
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,933
Come on. You know
how good you have it here.

229
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,303
Yes, I'm the big poobah,
the big cheese, the go-to guy.

230
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,774
You do the cases you wanna
do when you wanna do them.

231
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,368
You're not gonna have
that anywhere else. Relax.

232
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,090
I've been through three regime changes
in this hospital. Every time same story.

233
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,674
Just keep your head
down. That's all I'm saying.

234
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,243
And put on your coat. It itches.

235
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,779
So, you gonna do this
bone scan for me, or what?

236
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,019
Yes.

237
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:35,906
Dr. Simpson, did you
hear? New management.

238
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,376
I'm thinking of
switching to orthopedics.

239
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,438
How much do you guys get for a
massage now? Without the happy ending.

240
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,043
Dr. House, what do you want? Do you
remember a guy named Van Der Meer?

241
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,452
Not a big talker.
You fixed his A.C.L.

242
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,601
No, not according to my
medical malpractice premiums.

243
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,687
Didn't get hypotensive
during surgery?

244
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,560
No strokes? Maybe
some connectivity loss?

245
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,361
What, you're gonna get
involved now? I'm not involved.

246
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,665
A guy brought his son into
the clinic. I didn't touch the son.

247
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,448
I'm not taking any responsibility
there. The son's fine. Can't shut him up.

248
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,170
Dad show any symptoms of
cortical disease? Wernicke's?

249
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,044
No. Nothing.

250
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,049
That's why we settled because
we couldn't find anything.

251
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,395
The guy got over a million dollars.
Don't tell me he's complaining.

252
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,911
He's not saying boo.

253
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,370
Your father wants to know
when you'll be back from your trip.

254
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,762
E-mail back it's taking
longer than I thought.

255
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,699
He doesn't need to see me like
this. What about your brother?

256
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,704
- No.
- Hello. I'm Dr. Wilson. I was...

257
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,138
- Um, Robin, I'm gonna need a minute.
- Oh.

258
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,872
Thank you.

259
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,051
There are two
Dr. Wilsons in this hospital,

260
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,851
one in ophthalmology
and one in cancer.

261
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:01,952
My eyes are fine, so I'm guessing
you're here to tell me that I have cancer.

262
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,691
There is no cancer in your bone.

263
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,699
You're not smiling.

264
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,817
There's something
called referred pain. You

265
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,697
could have cancer in
one part of your body...

266
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,036
<i>that presents in another.</i>

267
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,076
Given your age and your family
history, I'm thinking your colon.

268
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,237
Great.

269
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,845
I was at Columbia when my
mom died. Now there's a blast.

270
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,683
Cleaning up her vomit, and
then running to my econ final.

271
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,882
<i>Look.</i>

272
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,869
If I'm a short-timer, give me drugs.
I'll go back to work. I'll die there.

273
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:37,989
Whoa. There's a very quick test to
see if you even have it— a colonoscopy.

274
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:41,159
I know how you do that test.

275
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,898
If you have colon cancer,
we can treat it. It's early.

276
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,499
That's what they told my mom.
She was dead six months later.

277
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,174
You're a smart person about
to make a very bad decision.

278
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,797
You know, cancer
treatment's come a long way

279
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,393
in 12 years, but if
you don't do this now...

280
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,852
I don't wanna be looked at.

281
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,125
There is another way.

282
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,634
We could do a
virtual colonoscopy.

283
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,230
<i>Basically, we do a C. T. scan
of your colon. It's noninvasive.</i>

284
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,435
But it's very expensive. I'm
assuming that's not a problem.

285
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,316
Say yes.

286
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,922
<i>Dr. Becker—</i>

287
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,689
Mr. Van Der Meer.

288
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,955
What?

289
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:49,328
Relax. Ricky's gonna be
just "finkf." Strep throat.

290
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,895
<i>Here's a prescription for an antibiotic.
He should be all better in a few days.</i>

291
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,932
Although, this
might sting a little.

292
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,088
I wanna see you again real soon.

293
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,027
<i>Virtual colonoscopy was clean.</i>

294
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,156
No colon cancer.

295
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,410
What happened to our regular,
old-fashioned colonoscopy?

296
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,337
She was uncomfortable doing any more tests.
I had to convince her to do that one.

297
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,466
Do you get that often? Women would
rather die than get naked with you?

298
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,807
She's scared.

299
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,043
But not of tests. Just
embarrassing ones.

300
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,846
Yeah.

301
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:47,689
It's not an inflammatory process. It's
not a clot, because Chase's angio says so.

302
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:52,391
And it's not cancer,
because her tush is perfect.

303
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,300
Anybody else got an Aunt
Elyssa with weird stuff?

304
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,736
<i>Maybe it's worth looking into—</i>

305
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,037
I thought you said
Carly's angio was clean.

306
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,546
It was clean.

307
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,888
You guys see the problem here?

308
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,186
There's no indication
of any abnormalities.

309
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,195
No lesions, no
spurs, no mastis...

310
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,757
Her toes are screwed
up. They're backwards.

311
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,167
<i>You guys know how much surgery
it's gonna take to swap 'em back?</i>

312
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,001
What are you talking about?

313
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,203
Well, either she literally has two
left feet, or you angioed the wrong leg.

314
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,012
That's impossible. It can't
be— Or maybe it was Jenny.

315
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,788
<i>How come some
resident signed this</i>

316
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,046
<i>radiology report? Were
you even in the room?</i>

317
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,183
- I'll redo her angio—
- You'll do nothing!

318
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,224
Foreman, you do the angiogram.

319
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,481
I can't believe I did that.

320
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,878
Why do we have to
redo the angiogram?

321
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,392
There was a shadow on
the first test result. <i>Shadow?</i>

322
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,719
A shadow means there
could be a blood clot, right?

323
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,424
I read <i>Conn's Current Therapy.</i>

324
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,301
A real page-turner. No, it
wasn't that kind of shadow.

325
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,106
My chest hurts. <i>It's
from the tracer I injected.</i>

326
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:49,012
You might also get a little nauseous
or have a metallic taste. All normal.

327
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,142
I'm a runner. I
shouldn't feel like this.

328
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,517
Carly, I'm looking at
your vitals right now and...

329
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,579
I can't breathe. Carly?

330
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,985
My chest.

331
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,297
My chest.

332
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,999
Respiratory arrest. Call code.

333
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,301
- What do you got?
- She's drowning.

334
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,093
<i>Foreman did a thoracentesis
to drain the fluid from her lungs.</i>

335
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,688
<i>She's stable. They sent the fluid to
the lab. It'll be back in a few hours.</i>

336
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,496
<i>You'll be happy to know Chase's mistake
didn't cost her. Angio revealed no clot.</i>

337
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,738
I'm thrilled.

338
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,940
<i>Okay, see, now you’re
just being stubborn.</i>

339
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,676
<i>It's cold. It's a perfectly good
excuse to wear your lab coat.</i>

340
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,684
Carly needs a heart transplant.

341
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,714
Thoracentesis
revealed a transudate?

342
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,950
I haven't gotten it back yet.

343
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,290
Her MUGA scan, what
was the ejection fraction?

344
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,127
<i>Maybe you could treat it
surgically.</i> I haven't done the MUGA.

345
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,496
How do you know she
needs a heart transplant?

346
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,536
I got my aura read today.

347
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,072
It said someone close
to me had a broken heart.

348
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,574
Since when do I need the
secret pass code to talk to you?

349
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:06,009
I can't tell you anything.
Professional responsibility.

350
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,138
Like that matters to you.

351
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,183
Not my professional
responsibility, yours.

352
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,776
New regime. You gotta
keep your head down too.

353
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,452
Now that's good thinking, because
I was gonna go right to Cuddy...

354
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,423
and rat you out as soon
as you were done talking.

355
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,869
I'm not saying you want to.
I'm saying you'd be obligated to.

356
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,328
Because of my
position on the board?

357
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,901
Because of my position on
the transplant committee?

358
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,240
Hey, you brought this up for a
reason. You need to talk to me.

359
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,674
I can't.

360
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,779
You sure you're
doing the right thing?

361
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,251
I've come up with a few
really great rationalizations.

362
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,255
Sorry to interrupt.
We have a problem.

363
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,518
<i>Thoracentesis
revealed a transudate.</i>

364
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,857
We did an echo. She's in
severe congestive heart failure.

365
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,194
She needs a heart transplant.

366
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,867
- We'll get her on the list immediately.
- She's already on the list.

367
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,608
Come in.

368
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,845
Thanks.

369
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,976
What is a department
of Diagnostic Medicine?

370
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,880
That's Dr. House's department.

371
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:27,415
<i>They deal with cases that
other doctors can't figure out.</i>

372
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,622
It's a financial black hole.

373
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,892
The department costs
us three million a year...

374
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,457
to treat one patient a week.

375
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,545
He saves one patient per
week. <i>What about everyone else?</i>

376
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,009
His department's not going to
find the cure for breast cancer.

377
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,440
- Uh, maybe not, but— -
Are you sleeping with House?

378
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,241
What? No. <i>But you did. Right?</i>

379
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,043
A long time ago?

380
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,175
That's an incredibly
inappropriate question.

381
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,353
If your judgment is
compromised by a prior

382
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:56,655
or current relationship,
that is my business.

383
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,191
I respect him. That is
all you need to know.

384
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,693
He's still not wearing the coat.

385
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,525
Well, I told him—
<i>I'm sure you did.</i>

386
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:09,193
And yet he's not wearing it. I'm just
wondering if that's a reflection on him...

387
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,294
or on you.

388
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,852
You're Dr. House.

389
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,356
I found a picture online of you at a
conference. You need a heart transplant.

390
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,226
- I run. I work out—
- You cut yourself.

391
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,564
Probably highly ritualized.

392
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,158
You play the same Sarah McLachlan
song over and over while you do it.

393
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,533
Probably works better
than antidepressants.

394
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,653
- I don't understand
how that— - You're a

395
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:50,075
high-powered bulimic.
You make yourself throw up.

396
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,759
<i>You had to find the
most efficient way to vomit</i>

397
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:56,480
<i>without revealing the
telltale signs of bulimia,</i>

398
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,144
which is all, ooh, very
unseemly for a C.E.O.

399
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:05,157
So, you found a common antidote
to accidental poisoning to do the job...

400
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,159
Ipecac.

401
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,355
Which is great if your kid's
just swallowed a bottle of aspirin,

402
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,830
but really, really
bad if it's a habit.

403
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,068
It causes muscle damage.

404
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,297
It caused the pain in your leg.

405
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,273
And destroyed your heart.

406
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,403
How often do you do it?

407
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,421
Three times a week.

408
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,109
In about an hour, there's
gonna be an emergency

409
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,188
meeting of the
transplant committee...

410
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,961
to discuss where you fall on the list
should a new heart become available.

411
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:52,733
Problem is, I am required to tell
the committee about your bulimia.

412
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,283
It's a major psychiatric
condition. Ranks right

413
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,970
up there with suicidal.
Makes you a very bad risk.

414
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,276
So, you're here to tell me I
have just a few hours to live?

415
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,044
Unless I lie to the committee.

416
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,320
But if they find out, I
lose my medical license.

417
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,191
This would be a very good
time to offer me a bribe.

418
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,822
You know, how much is your life
worth? How much is my job worth?

419
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:25,098
Why are you here doing this
to me? What do you want?

420
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,631
I wanna know what's right.

421
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,734
Am I worth it?

422
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,413
You think I'm pathetic.

423
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,349
<i>Has a good job.
Everything in the world.</i>

424
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,252
But she just doesn't like
the way that she looks.

425
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,620
Oh, stop hiding!

426
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,819
<i>I'm asking you if you wanna live
or die? You can't even say that.</i>

427
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,761
What do you want
me to do? Cry? <i>Yes.</i>

428
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,288
I want you to tell me that your life is
important to you, because I don't know.

429
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:04,438
Because that's what's on
the table right now— your life.

430
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,321
I don't wanna die.

431
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,633
I don't.

432
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,801
<i>This 32-year-old female
was admitted by my staff...</i>

433
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,609
because of paralysis
and pain in her right thigh.

434
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:47,381
The patient rapidly deteriorated and
now has severe congestive heart failure.

435
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,422
Pressors and vasodilators have not
improved her condition whatsoever.

436
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:54,358
<i>Pulmonary function tests show
an F. E. C. of over three liters,</i>

437
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:58,158
<i>with F. E. V.-1 of at
least 90% of predicted...</i>

438
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,930
and preserved F.E.D./F.E.C. ratio
and preserved D.L.C.O. as well.

439
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:08,872
<i>Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19%
with no focal wall motion abnormalities.</i>

440
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,004
<i>Heart catheterization revealed
clean left, right and circumflex arteries.</i>

441
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,278
<i>And a subsequent biopsy
revealed irreversible cardiomyopathy.</i>

442
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,649
Which is why we're here.

443
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:24,451
<i>Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused
by your time and date stamps.</i>

444
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:28,221
It appears that you put Carly on the
transplant list before you did these tests.

445
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,263
I had a hunch.

446
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,961
You don't have
hunches. You know.

447
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,599
Look, if the tests had
come back differently,

448
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:39,247
obviously I would have
taken her off the list.

449
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,206
But on the long shot...

450
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,978
<i>On the long shot that I was
right, I didn't want to waste time.</i>

451
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,616
Is there any exclusion
criteria we should know about?

452
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,050
CAT scan revealed no tumors, and
Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.

453
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,493
What about any other criteria?

454
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,897
- No atherosclerotic vascular disease.
- Are there any...

455
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:12,666
No pneumonia, no bacteremia.
No hep "B" or "C" or any other letters.

456
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,832
Substance abuse. Any history...

457
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,841
No alcohol. No drugs.

458
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,107
Any psychiatric conditions? History
of depression? <i>She's a little blue.</i>

459
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,116
But turns out she needs
a heart transplant, so...

460
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,121
Dr. House, if you subvert
or mislead this committee,

461
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,095
you will be subject
to disciplinary action.

462
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,536
Dr. Cuddy, do you have
reason to think that I would lie?

463
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:50,167
I simply want you to
answer the question.

464
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,644
Is there anything on the
recipient exclusion criteria...

465
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,877
that would disqualify your
patient from getting a heart?

466
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,960
No.

467
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,038
Beautiful organ donor weather.

468
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,041
You lied, didn't you?

469
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,509
I never lie. Big mistake.

470
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,445
Then you should have voted
against putting her on the list.

471
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,814
- You're my friend.
- Oh, geez, have some backbone.

472
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,819
If you think I'm
wrong, do something.

473
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,048
Wait. You're getting mad
at me for sticking up for you?

474
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,116
You value our friendship more
than your ethical responsibilities.

475
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,992
Our friendship is an
ethical responsibility.

476
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,966
What is it?

477
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,872
My patient's getting a heart.

478
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,555
<i>He's not gonna fire you.</i>

479
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,988
<i>I'd fire you. Bye-bye.</i>

480
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,024
I screw up, the patient
dies, I'll never get another job.

481
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,997
So stick your head between your
legs and go lick your wounds in Gstaad.

482
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,359
Well, I like it here.

483
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,887
You guys don't think it's weird House knew
the patient needed a heart transplant...

484
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,880
before we did any heart tests?

485
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,074
That's House. He knows things.

486
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,015
<i>But usually he's
putting it in our face.</i>

487
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,213
Telling us how
cleverly he figured it out.

488
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,189
This time nothing.
Just had a hunch.

489
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,394
That is weird.

490
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,092
Cauterize that one bleeder.

491
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,096
Okay, ready for the donor heart.

492
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,942
They just stopped Carly's
heart, and your dumb patient...

493
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,947
They're all— Oh, the guy who
can't talk. Mr. Van Der Meer.

494
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,109
He's scheduled an appointment
to see you. Oh, goody.

495
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:53,186
I wanted you to know Chase is
worried you're going to fire him.

496
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,092
It's bad enough that
screw-ups cost lives.

497
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,323
Now we've got Vogler,
screw-ups cost jobs.

498
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,490
I want Chase scared.

499
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,160
I want him doing everything
he can to protect his job.

500
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,112
Dr. House, if you were in
his position, wouldn't you

501
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,148
be more likely to perform
well if you were reassured...

502
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:11,542
Oh, will you stop it with the
book? Why are you doing this?

503
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,614
I'm not doing anything.
You're manipulating everyone.

504
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,385
People... dismiss me.

505
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,949
Because I'm a woman.
Because I'm pretty.

506
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:30,484
Because... I'm not aggressive.

507
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,732
My opinions shouldn't be rejected
just because people don't like me.

508
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,496
They like you.

509
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,704
Everyone likes you.

510
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,471
Do you?

511
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,764
I have to know.

512
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,363
No.

513
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,710
Okay.

514
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,493
Five hours, 23
minutes. That's fast.

515
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,091
Is that good or bad? It depends.

516
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,468
Either surgery went really
well, or it ended really abruptly.

517
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:52,375
Textbook. She'll outlive us all.

518
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,480
Thank you.

519
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,781
<i>Triage nurse,
pick up line 274 1.</i>

520
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,954
So, sing for me.

521
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,565
Oh, no, no, no,
no. Come on, look.

522
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,631
When you had your
surgery, you were intubated.

523
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,502
The surgeon stuck a
tube down your throat.

524
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,735
Now, it never happens and it's
never caught, but it happened.

525
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:27,336
Your vocal cords were paralyzed. I
treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox.

526
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,678
Ironically, a substance that tightens
every other corner of your face.

527
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,777
<i>It actually loosens the tongue. I
have healed you. You can talk.</i>

528
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,627
Oh, well.

529
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,663
Boo!

530
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,832
Okay.

531
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,995
You don't have to say anything.
It can be our little secret.

532
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,529
If you can talk, blink twice.

533
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,810
But you're not going to,

534
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,162
because you think you
won't be entitled to the

535
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:05,442
money you won in the
settlement with Simpson.

536
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,553
Yesterday, I would have said
you had to give the money back.

537
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:15,720
<i>Today, hospital's
come into a lot of money.</i>

538
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,729
Mum's the word.

539
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,327
Hey.

540
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,336
Hey.

541
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,105
I know the cardiologist has
given you some guidelines,

542
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,339
a schedule of medication
and a strict diet.

543
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:11,941
<i>Just what somebody with
an eating disorder needs.</i>

544
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,747
So I thought I'd
get you started.

545
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,288
Fried chicken from
the Carnegie Deli.

546
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,092
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

547
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,095
Actually, I got it downstairs.

548
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,702
Why did you fight for me?

549
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,468
You risked so much,
and you hardly know me.

550
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,248
You're my patient.

551
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,752

Just wanted to stop
by and introduce myself.

I'm Edward Vogler, new
chairman of the board.

559
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,519
In a way, I guess that
makes me your boss.

560
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:01,723
I am sorry about the lab coat thing.
My dry cleaners just destroyed it.

561
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:07,124
That was my very first heart transplant
committee meeting. Very exciting.

<i>Trust me, Six Flags—
Way more exciting.</i>

563

Your patient's very lucky
to have such a passionate

564
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,699
doctor. Stands up for
what he believes in.

565
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,741
Sweet of you to say.

566
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,141
Yeah. Afraid you've
been duped though.

567
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,511
The nurse found this
in the patient's purse.

568
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,154
Oh, my. If only I'd known.

569
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,659
Tough being a doctor,
having all that power.

570
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,661
The power to play God.

571
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:40,756
Yes. I don't envy the transplant
committee their responsibility.

572
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,599
They basically would have
been forced to kill that poor girl.

573
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,763
I'm not sure I could
have done that.

574
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,865
This is not a game
to me, Dr. House.

575
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:55,903
No. It's actually more like
we're dancing right now.

576
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,006
So let's get to the
point. You don't like me.

577
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:01,712
I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna
like you. It's nothing personal.

578
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,449
I don't like anybody.

579
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,457
But none of that
really matters, does it?

580
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,255
Because you've got
money, and I've got tenure.

581
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:13,560
You need full board approval
to get rid of me. I've got Cuddy.

582
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,100
Right. And Wilson.

583
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,763
So, as long as we're
stuck with each other,

584
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,033
we might as well
ignore each other.

I looked into that tenure
thing, and you're right.

It's actually easier for me to get rid of
a board member like Cuddy or Wilson...

590

than to get rid of a doctor.
