1
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,500
<i>So now the plan is either
find ourselves a new counselor,</i>

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,167
stick it out with the old
one, but go more often,

3
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,076
or resign ourselves to the fact
that she's never gonna be happy...

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,507
no matter what I do, so
let's take the money we're

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,014
wasting and put it towards
a membership at Lakeview.

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,212
I'm guessing the last option has
yet to be formally presented. Yeah.

7
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,256
Geez. What's with you? You
usually run half speed to stay with me.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,123
Didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,562
How are things
with Elyse? Great.

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,896
Great? Yeah.

11
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,971
One-syllable answers. You're either
out of breath, or you're lying to me.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,475
Yeah. We have our moments,
but they usually work out.

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,774
Man, you got some water? Yeah.

14
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,871
So how do you work things out?

15
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,448
I don't know. We talk,
someone apologizes.

16
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,543
Man, I shouldn't
have drank last night.

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,249
- Hey, you mean you apologize.
- Yeah, I guess.

18
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,555
- How often do you guys have sex?
- Enough.

19
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,686
You do it this morning?

20
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,788
You did. You did
it this morning.

21
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:07,494
Maybe that's why you can't
stand up, huh? Come on.

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,561
Elyse.

23
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,609
Great.

24
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,804
Honey, I'm dehydrated.

25
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,473
Do we have anything
with electrolytes?

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,010
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

27
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,578
This is an emergency.

28
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,624
<i>The fridge is empty.</i>

29
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,251
<i>Come on. It's almost 4:00.</i>

30
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,229
Elyse. Sweetie.

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,328
Call Jacques. Tell
him I'm not feeling well.

32
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,636
It's Saturday. You haven't been
to work in three days. Remember?

33
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,837
Just let me sleep.

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,006
Come on. You haven't been
out of bed since Wednesday.

35
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,108
- Leave me alone.
- Come on. What's up?

36
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,653
No. Leave me alone.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,451
Honey. I said leave me alone!

38
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,333
Oh. I think there's
something wrong with me.

39
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,436
She's been averaging 18 hours
of sleep a day since her admission.

40
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,702
Clinical depression.
Incredibly contagious.

41
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,142
Every time I'm around one of them,
I get blue. It's not clinical depression.

42
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,339
Great. Got it all figured
out. You don't need me.

43
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,852
Three E.R. doctors,
two neurologists and a

44
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:05,735
radiologist have all
figured out what it's not.

45
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,665
We need to figure out what it is. If
any of the above-mentioned doctors...

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,352
were interested in my opinion,
they would have asked for it.

47
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,020
None of them are willing to
subject themselves to you.

48
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,086
No pain, no gain.

49
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,031
The blood work shows
no signs of inflammation,

50
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,796
and no one can figure out
what's actually the cause— Ah.

51
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:26,101
What? Husband described her
as being unusually irritable recently.

52
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:30,838
And? I didn't realize it was possible
for a woman to be <i>unusually</i> irritable.

53
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,613
Nice try, but you're a
misanthrope, not a misogynist.

54
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,586
What's the first thing you ask a
doctor who's referring a patient?

55
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,249
Are you questioning my
ability to take a history?

56
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,119
What's the primary—
Not "what." "Why?"

57
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,494
Diseases don't have
motives. No, but doctors do.

58
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,692
Why this patient?
What interests you?

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,730
Give me the chart. Why?

60
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,872
I find your
interest interesting.

61
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,538
<i>She's irritable and
sleeping 18 hours a day.</i>

62
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,548
<i>What's interesting about that?</i>

63
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,676
Hypersomnia's usually accompanied
by irritability in depressed patients.

64
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,051
True, but not relevant.
She's not depressed.

65
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,148
Hello. She's sleeping
18 hours a day. <i>Fever.</i>

66
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,216
Clinical depression
does not cause fever.

67
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,727
- She could be sick and depressed.
- She's sick.

68
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,730
Oh, damn it. Why
didn't I think of that?

69
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,699
- Yeah, that's what I meant.
- Elevated sed rate indicates inflammation.

70
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,327
Hypersomnia and personality
changes point toward the brain.

71
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,064
Not the spleen?

72
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,232
Thank goodness we
hired a neurologist.

73
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,332
Brain symptoms. Hmm.
Could this be a brain problem?

74
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,954
<i>No other systemic signs of
inflammation. Probably not vasculitis.</i>

75
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,675
What about parasites?
Malaria, Chagas.

76
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,926
But the patient's never been outside of
the United States—especially the tropics.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,977
- You mean she claims
she's never been outside the U.S.
- Very good.

78
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,750
<i>Doesn't matter. Blood and C.S. F.
Smears show no sign of parasites.</i>

79
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,419
- Has to be a tumor then.
- A tumor sitting directly
on top of the brain stem...

80
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,429
<i>that three E. R. doctors, two
neurologists and a radiologist missed?</i>

81
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,330
Partridge in a pear
tree missed it too.

82
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,375
Redo the blood work,
and get a new M.R.I. with

83
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,530
two-millimeter cuts through
the mesodiencephalic.

84
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,538
And check for evil stepmothers.

85
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,540
<i>This much sleep usually
indicates poison apples.</i>

86
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,939
<i>Anything else besides
the shortness of breath?</i>

87
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,880
Not really. It's actually
just kind of a tightness.

88
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,917
You smoke? No, never.

89
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,248
- Exercise?
- Eight hours a day.

90
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,122
- I teach preschool.
- Sounds fun.

91
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,721
Any history of heart
disease in your family?

92
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,229
Not that I know of.
Take a deep breath.

93
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,270
Been under a lot of stress
lately? No more than usual.

94
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,204
You're probably
just a little anemic.

95
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,264
I'm gonna do an
E.K.G. just to make sure.

96
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,800
Do I need to take this off? Uh, no.
You can just pull that down in front.

97
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,252
Good Lord.

98
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,121
- Are those real?
- Do they look real?

99
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,159
They look pretty damn good.

100
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,218
They were a present
for my husband's 40th.

101
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,388
I figured he'd enjoy
them more than a sweater.

102
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,693
That's so sweet.

103
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,669
But I'm afraid the cause of your problem
could be staring us right in the face.

104
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,968
Actually, I guess I'm
the one doing the staring.

105
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,407
<i>Of course, I can't be sure.
I'd like to consult a colleague.</i>

106
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,173
He's actually somewhat of
an expert in these matters.

107
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,974
Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,480
A tumor? <i>We don't know.</i>

109
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,320
- We're checking just to be safe.
- Y'all already checked for that.

110
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,117
The previous M.R.I. had a broader
view. Some tumors are almost

111
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:36,625
impossible to see unless you
know exactly where to look.

112
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,495
- That means it would be small, right?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,035
Then you'd be able
to operate, take it out?

114
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,038
If it's a tumor, there are a
variety of treatment options,

115
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,597
but there are variables
other than just size.

116
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,209
Don't worry.

117
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,214
Too late.

118
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,150
Try to remain as
still as possible.

119
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,784
The less distortion there is, the
more detail we'll be able to see. <i>Okay.</i>

120
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,736
<i>X-ray tech, report
to Radiology Room 3.</i>

121
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,033
Well. That's what
breasts look like.

122
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,704
Is a lie a lie if everybody
knows it's a lie?

123
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,614
Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a
forest— House, come on. They're breasts.

124
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,812
They're a birthday present, not a
philosophical treatise. Lie number one.

125
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,822
She did not do that for her
husband. She did that for herself.

126
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,188
She thinks if she looks
different, she'll be different.

127
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,317
No. She thinks if she
looks different, she'll

128
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,286
be more attractive,
which I have to say...

129
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:46,732
Not to her husband. Cosmetic surgery is so
everyone else will look at us differently.

130
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,826
The same reason
you're wearing that tie.

131
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,497
Well, exactly. That was
gonna be my next point.

132
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,506
Last three months,
same five ties.

133
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,542
Thursday should
be that paisley thing.

134
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,271
It's a gift from my
wife. No, it's not.

135
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,780
Julie hates green. You
bought that yourself.

136
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,045
You want to look pretty at work.

137
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,915
Wilson's got a girlfriend.

138
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,511
D—Stop.

139
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,749
Stop. I don't.

140
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,282
It takes two department heads
to treat shortness of breath?

141
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,388
What, do the complications
increase exponentially with cup size?

142
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:21,265
I want an E.K.G. and blood
tests, including tox screen on Mrs...

143
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,270
- Exam Room One.
- You're ordering tests
to cover your lechery.

144
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,070
- Interesting.
- Very tricky case.

145
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,975
You love everybody.
That's your pathology.

146
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,514
<i>There were no lesions and no
mass effect that we could see.</i>

147
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,488
What does that mean?

148
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,220
It means we're still not sure what's
causing the neurological problems.

149
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,728
I know some things
are hard to cure,

150
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,741
but what I just don't
get is why it's taking

151
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,733
so long to figure out
what's wrong with her.

152
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,770
- I know you're scared. I would be too.
- I don't feel good.

153
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,733
You feeling nauseous?

154
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,275
Honey, are you all right?

155
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,937
<i>She's seizing!</i>

156
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,948
<i>Get her on her side.</i>

157
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,143
- I need some Ativan!
<i>- I'll get it.</i>

158
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,916
- What's happened?
- She's having a seizure.

159
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,787
She's aspirating. Suction.

160
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,533
Come on, Elyse.

161
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,709
<i>The M.R.I. reveals nothing.</i>

162
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>- That we were able to detect.</i>
- It's not a tumor.

163
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,089
<i>A small glioma could hide from
contrast. We could do a PET scan.</i>

164
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,857
<i>Yes. That's how a responsible doctor
would waste his time in this situation.</i>

165
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,593
Suddenly tests and radiologists
are incapable of error?

166
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,379
A glioma not presenting
on a contrast M.R.I.

167
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,264
would have to be smaller
than a grain of sand,

168
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,500
which does not a
gravely ill person make.

169
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:11,443
- It could be just postictal disorientation.
- We would have seen
improvement by now.

170
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,743
- Late-stage Lyme disease
can cause seizures.
- Does the husband care about her?

171
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,147
- He hasn't left her bedside.
- How annoying.

172
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,209
It also means she doesn't
have Lyme disease.

173
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,413
What, love conquers all?

174
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,457
Lyme disease initially
presents with a rash.

175
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,068
- Mr. Clingy would have noticed.
- We've looked at everything else.

176
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,924
Did you look at her breasts?

177
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,257
Men.

178
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,798
It could be paraneoplastic.

179
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,529
She have any family
history of breast cancer?

180
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,901
Her mother died of it.

181
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,634
The brain, but not the brain.

182
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,767
Clever, huh?

183
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,083
How can breast cancer
cause problems in her brain?

184
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,453
There are molecular similarities
between brain cells and tumor cells.

185
00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:00,790
<i>Paraneoplastic syndrome causes the body's
own antibodies to get thrown off track.</i>

186
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,728
They end up attacking the
brain instead of the tumor.

187
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,493
So, if you do find a
tumor, what do you do?

188
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,297
We treat the
underlying malignancy.

189
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,377
Once there's no tumor
to attack, there's nothing

190
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,136
for the antibodies to
get confused about.

191
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,971
- If the tumor's treatable.
- Exactly.

192
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,450
Ow. I'm sorry. I know
it's uncomfortable.

193
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,783
The tighter we go, the
better the image will be.

194
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,258
At least it'll keep me awake.
Don't worry. It's almost over.

195
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,995
I wish people would stop
telling me not to worry.

196
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,932
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,469
My mom was the same age.

198
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:00,044
We've been trying to get pregnant for
over a year. Guess we're lucky we didn't.

199
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,384
A lot has changed
since your mom died.

200
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,390
Don't worr...

201
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,825
Don't give up.

202
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>No tumor?</i>

203
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,640
The M.R.I. and the mammogram
only showed a few benign calcifications.

204
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,770
<i>It's most likely a
small-cell tumor.</i>

205
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,041
It's no surprise we're
having trouble finding it.

206
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,983
We should do a PET scan. Start
with her lungs, then maybe her bones.

207
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,247
Sometimes it presents
with no tumor at all.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,088
- How can a disease caused by a tumor
present if there's no tumor?
- It happens—12% of cases.

209
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,026
- And how do you treat it
if there's no tumor?
- You don't.

210
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,621
Those 12%, no treatment.

211
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,723
They were too busy
looking for the tumor...

212
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,859
Right till they put the
patient in the ground.

213
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,928
- What choice do we have?
- Treat the symptoms.

214
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,407
- I.V. immunoglobulin.
- So we're just gonna ignore the tumor?

215
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,934
Well, eventually it'll get bigger.
Then it'll be really easy to find.

216
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,505
<i>- One of you needs to check out</i>
<i>where she works.</i>
- Why?

217
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,108
- 'Cause the husband's not sick.
<i>- Meaning?</i>

218
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:09,315
<i>If it’s not paraneoplastic, and it
is a reaction to some sort of toxin,</i>

219
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,858
it's obviously not
coming from their home.

220
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,357
Foreman, you do it.

221
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:22,199
Why are you riding
me? It's what I do.

222
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,897
Has it got worse lately?
Yeah. Seems to me.

223
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,906
Really?

224
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,774
Well, that rules out the race thing.
'Cause you were just as black last week.

225
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>How long has Elyse worked here?</i>

226
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,781
Oh, three years.
She's my best rôtisseur.

227
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,378
And what's that? The rôtisseur
prepares the roasted meats and gravies.

228
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,390
How do you clean your grill?

229
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,824
You say “elbow grease." Do
you use chemical cleaners?

230
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,057
<i>Ah, non. Absolument.</i> And chefs
don't do the cleaning anyway.

231
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,395
What about pesticides? You must
spray for roaches and that sort of thing.

232
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,368
No. My kitchen is
clean. No roaches.

233
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,636
I need to get back to work.

234
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,077
So the fact that I'm here asking you
these questions, it doesn't worry you?

235
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,910
Look at me. I'm
here 18 hours a day.

236
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,179
That guy practically lives
here. <i>He</i> does live here.

237
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,018
I use the same detergents for 15
years, and everyone is healthy as a horse.

238
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,253
Whatever Elyse has,
she didn't get here.

239
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,317
Tell her I hope
she feels better.

240
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,522
And I had to get
a new rôtisseur.

241
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,575
- Where's Ed?
- He went down to the gift shop
to buy a shirt.

242
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,444
I told him I'd stay up
here in case you woke up.

243
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,852
You must have
better things to do.

244
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,150
I send my laundry out.

245
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,782
- You're not married?
- No.

246
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,656
Waiting for the perfect guy?

247
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,229
Let me guess. You've
already found him.

248
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,830
He threw my towels
out the window.

249
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,500
That's how we met.

250
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,877
Freshman year, Ed came to a
party that my roommate and I threw.

251
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,042
He spent most of the
night on the bathroom floor.

252
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:24,948
He figured I wouldn't notice the vomit
on the towels if I didn't have any towels.

253
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,152
I'm assuming he came back
the next day to apologize?

254
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,596
No way. I had to track him down.

255
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:39,471
Conflict resolution has never
been one of Ed's strong points.

256
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,599
Nobody's perfect, right?

257
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,338
I guess.

258
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,277
Oh, my neck hurts.

259
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,507
You've been in this
bed for a really long time.

260
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,088
We're gonna do the same test we did last
night, okay? Do you know what day it is?

261
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,922
My arm itches. It's
probably a mild skin irritation.

262
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:04,358
I'll get you some
hydrocortisone in a minute.

263
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,729
- Do you know what day it is?
- Tuesday.

264
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,995
It really itches.

265
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,367
How about I get you
that cream right now?

266
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,244
Oh, my God! Get them
off! Get 'em off of me!

267
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,046
- Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
- Elyse, calm down.

268
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,985
- Get them off me!
<i>- Elyse, calm down. Calm down.</i>

269
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,546
They're biting me!
Oh! They're biting me!

270
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,649
I'm gonna need some
Haldol, five milligrams.

271
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,956
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Get 'em off!

272
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,466
Get 'em off. Get 'em off.
There's nothing there, Elyse.

273
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,502
They're biting me.
There's nothing there.

274
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,503
Ow!

275
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>We had to sedate her.</i>

276
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,072
<i>You gave sedatives to a patient
who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?</i>

277
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,943
It was better than letting her
scratch all the skin off her arms.

278
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,712
<i>- Where's Wilson?</i>
- Creepy-crawlies are consistent
with paraneoplastic syndrome.

279
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,083
Onset immediately
after I.V.I.G. isn't.

280
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,384
There is a simple explanation.

281
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,448
Maybe she really has
bugs under her skin.

282
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:10,122
- Infection?
- That's what a worsening of symptoms
after immunotherapy would suggest.

283
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,132
<i>Blood cultures and the
timeline rule out most bacteria.</i>

284
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,658
Patient throws up on your
shoes, do you clean up most of it?

285
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,968
The symptoms rule out the
rest. Serology rules out viruses.

286
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,008
C.S.F. smears
rule out parasites.

287
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,272
<i>In the final stage of
African trypanosomiasis...</i>

288
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,745
almost all the parasites
are inside the brain.

289
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,907
It's possible they
wouldn't show on smears.

290
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,159
But it's not possible
for a patient who's never

291
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,477
been to Africa to have
African sleeping sickness.

292
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,699
- I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
- She could've got it from a transfusion.

293
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,320
- Or I'm just saying she could've
got it from a transfusion.
- Which she never had.

294
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,988
Okay. <i>What about toxins?</i>

295
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,591
<i>No, the kitchen she works in
is cleaner than some hospitals.</i>

296
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,034
But they do serve rabbit.

297
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,765
Rabbit fever fits her symptoms.

298
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,865
Tularemia initially presents with a
rash or ulcer near the infection site.

299
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,043
Not if she inhaled it.
Chopping the meat with

300
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,380
the cleaver could easily
aerosolize the bacteria.

301
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,816
- No. Then she'd have respiratory symptoms.
- Maybe she ignored it,
figured she had a cold.

302
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,979
We rejected Lyme disease because
the couple would have noticed a rash,

303
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,319
but a wet, hacking cough
is just gonna slip right by?

304
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,623
It's either that or she missed her exit
on the turnpike and wound up in Africa.

305
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,960
Okay, two lousy ideas.

306
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,556
Unfortunately, they're
better than all the other ideas.

307
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,126
Tularemia. Bizarre.

308
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,800
Very nice. That's
why I ride you.

309
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,586
<i>Stay tuned—</i> Did he
just turn on the TV?

310
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,713
He needs to think.

311
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,281
So this should tell us whether
or not she's got rabbit fever?

312
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,887
For a diagnosis of tularemia you need a
fourfold increase in serum antibody levels.

313
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,761
To measure an increase you need
a before. All we have is an after.

314
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:56,394
- A single titer over 160
would be a big clue.
- "That's why I ride you."

315
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,880
<i>What does that mean? When I
have a good idea it's because of him?</i>

316
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,033
Actually, I think he said
your idea was a lousy idea.

317
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,963
It has to be one of these
two conditions. I say we

318
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:06,054
take our best guess and
start treatment. Or treat both.

319
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,547
The treatment for tularemia
can cause aplastic anemia.

320
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,243
- How come he doesn't ride you guys?
- Got a crush on you.

321
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,879
- He just doesn't know how to show it.
- Get over it. He rides everybody.

322
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,734
- The treatment for sleeping sickness
kills one in 10 patients.
- We start with the safer treatment.

323
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,320
By "safer," you mean the one
that's slightly less likely to kill her.

324
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,805
Foreman got the gang
testing for tularemia?

325
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,610
- Yep.
- Probably inconclusive, but worth doing.

326
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,481
So, what's her name?
When do I get to meet her?

327
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,248
- There's nobody. Give it up.
- Your lips say no.

328
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
<i>Your shoes say yes.</i>
Well, they're French.

329
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,688
- You can't trust a word they say.
- Solid, yet stylish.

330
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,025
A professional woman
would be impressed.

331
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,123
I'm thinking accountant.
Actuary maybe.

332
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,395
<i>It's somebody in the hospital.</i>

333
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,403
<i>Patient?</i>

334
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,497
No. Chemo's not sexy.
Daughter of a patient.

335
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,599
She would certainly have
the neediness you need.

336
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,769
I'm not gonna date
a patient's daughter.

337
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:15,940
Very ethical. Of course, most married
men would say they don't date at all.

338
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,314
There was no date.

339
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,979
I had lunch with
one of the nurses.

340
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,683
<i>It's her first time in an oncology unit.
She's having a tough time— emotionally.</i>

341
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,124
- Perfect.
- I wanted to be nice.

342
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,628
<i>That's all. I mean it.</i>

343
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,028
You always do. It's
part of your charm.

344
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,964
Hi, boys.

345
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,502
<i>Mrs. Campbell's test results.</i>

346
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,437
You remember her. The preschool
teacher with the heart of silicone.

347
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,133
No. Doesn't ring a bell.

348
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,467
They came in yesterday. I
figured you guys would have

349
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,645
been all over them. I know
how concerned you were.

350
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,307
She's all upset 'cause we paid
more attention to the other girl.

351
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,873
You check out her
ass. I've got the chest.

352
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,944
<i>The tests were normal. Of
course, that's just my opinion.</i>

353
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,184
You might wanna call a couple of
guys from maintenance in for a consult.

354
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,125
You check her E.K.G. results
before she left the other day?

355
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,389
- You ordered it.
- You're the responsible one.

356
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,660
- What's wrong? They look normal to me.
- Where is she?

357
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,702
- Waiting downstairs. Why?
- I was right.

358
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,077
Do I have to get
rid of the implants?

359
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,411
Surprisingly, no.

360
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,679
But your E.K.G. shows a
slightly decreased heart rate.

361
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,406
Is that a problem?
You told me you hadn't

362
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,313
changed your diet or
exercise. Were you lying?

363
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,325
Lying? Does your husband
have high blood pressure?

364
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,327
My husband? Yeah, you see,

365
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,929
if you're gonna
repeat everything I say,

366
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,707
this conversation's
gonna take twice as long.

367
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,599
Yes. He was diagnosed
six months ago.

368
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,728
He do a lot of cooking? Not really,
other than oatmeal in the morning.

369
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,707
Did you happen to notice a slightly
odd taste to the oatmeal lately?

370
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,243
Wait. Are you saying that—
That it looks like your husband...

371
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,371
stirred in some of his blood pressure
medication along with the brown sugar.

372
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:59,350
You think my husband's trying to
poison me? No. Nothing like that.

373
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,582
He just doesn't want
to have sex with you.

374
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,764
Decreased sex drive is
one of the most common side

375
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:06,751
effects of the beta-blockers
he's been taking.

376
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,422
I'm guessing he figured if you're
both frigid, no harm, no foul.

377
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,625
Should've gotten him the
sweater. That's ridiculous.

378
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,804
Fine. But if you're still
concerned about the shortness

379
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:19,502
of breath, I'd start
making your own breakfast.

380
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,734
Wait.

381
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,003
What should I do?

382
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:29,606
If you care about your husband
at all, I'd do the responsible thing.

383
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,618
Buy yourself some
condoms, go to a bar, find...

384
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,225
Huh.

385
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,305
Lab tests inconclusive?

386
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,137
Not surprisingly.
<i>No. But too bad.</i>

387
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,303
Luckily, I have the answer.

388
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,643
- To what?
- Thanks for asking.

389
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,269
To life itself: sex. Anything
that can be transmitted

390
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,482
via the blood can be
transmitted through sex.

391
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,283
- Sleeping sickness from sex?
- It's not without precedent.

392
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,584
I'm pretty sure it is,
unless you're talking about

393
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,816
going to Africa and
having sex with a tsetse fly.

394
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,107
A Portuguese man was
diagnosed three years

395
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:18,422
ago with C.N.S.-affected
sleeping sickness.

396
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,405
His only connection
with Africa was through a

397
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,662
girlfriend who'd served
with the military in Angola.

398
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,704
Boy. Where'd you find that?

399
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,298
<i>The Journal of the Instituto
de Higiene e Medicina Tropical.</i>

400
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,343
- You don't read Portuguese?
- You do?

401
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,278
Pretty sure that's what it said. Either
that or it was an ad for sunglasses.

402
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,372
<i>Her husband has never
been to Africa either.</i>

403
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,782
Oh, stymied again.
Your logic is bulletproof.

404
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:43,118
I think ignoring respiratory
symptoms is more likely than cheating.

405
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,091
Because? They're completely
devoted to each other.

406
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,788
Because? They love each other.

407
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,797
Or?

408
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,356
<i>They're
overcompensating for guilt.</i>

409
00:23:55,734 --> 00:24:01,196
- Find out which it is.
- You want me to ask a man whose wife
is about to die if he cheated on her?

410
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,471
No, I want you to be
polite and let her die.

411
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,580
Actually, I don't want
you to ask her anything.

412
00:24:06,604 --> 00:24:08,708
Foreman, take the husband.
Chase, take the wife.

413
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,422
You don't trust me to do my job?

414
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,463
We all formulate questions based
on the answers we want to hear.

415
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,159
And how exactly do you reformulate
"Have you screwed around?"

416
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,565
Did you know she's been
trying to get pregnant? Yes.

417
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,628
After you got so freaked
about the sick babies

418
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,538
a while ago, I figured
that was your thing.

419
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,498
But you've never been
prescribed folic acid, and

420
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:37,599
you can't lose a baby if
you've never been pregnant.

421
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,545
You pulled my medical records? You
coughed the other day. I was concerned.

422
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,541
You were curious, like an
eight-year-old boy with a puzzle

423
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:47,416
that's just a little too
grown-up for him to figure out.

424
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,580
Tomayto, tomahto.

425
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:56,095
So it's either, uh, sleeping
sickness or this rabbit thing?

426
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,153
They're both fatal
without treatment.

427
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,758
And unfortunately, the treatment
for both is extremely dangerous.

428
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,770
Are there tests you can
do? Not at this stage.

429
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,568
But each condition
has a unique history.

430
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:11,635
We're hoping your answers
to a few questions will help us.

431
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,976
Sure. Whatever you need to know.

432
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,609
<i>Before the sleeping problems,
did you have any trouble breathing,</i>

433
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,711
a cough that wouldn't go
away— Anything like that?

434
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,047
No.

435
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,457
- Are you certain?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

436
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,121
I've never been away from
her for more than a night.

437
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,596
If she had breathing
troubles I would've noticed.

438
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,395
The other condition is
significantly more likely if...

439
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,266
If you've had an affair.

440
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,004
Have you ever had an affair?

441
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,103
Of course not.

442
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,082
- Are you sure?
- I think I'd remember
cheating on my wife.

443
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,176
You might be
reluctant to admit it. No.

444
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,414
I just want to be
perfectly clear.

445
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:59,083
If your wife has sleeping
sickness, and we don't treat her,

446
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,027
she'll die.

447
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:05,428
<i>I would never do that to Ed.</i>

448
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,865
I love him. <i>Absolutely not.</i>

449
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,926
I love her.

450
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,865
All right.

451
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:29,621
All right then. They say no cheating,
we cross off sleeping sickness.

452
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,816
Any new ideas?

453
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,186
Okay. We go with
Foreman's tularemia.

454
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,391
Start her on I.V. chloramphenicol, 25
milligrams per kilogram, four times a day.

455
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,457
Good night.

456
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,576
Where's Ed? Right next to you.

457
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,811
Well, you're two
down, two to go.

458
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,855
Two days?

459
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,689
No. Doses. You have about
20 more days of this fun.

460
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,422
What time is it?

461
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:14,331
About 4:00 a.m. I
pulled the short straw.

462
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,561
Flow rate looks good.

463
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,435
No rash or flushing.

464
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,075
What time is it?

465
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,976
4:00 a.m.

466
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,453
Do you not remember just asking?

467
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,716
I don't...

468
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,057
Elyse?

469
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,866
Elyse? Elyse?

470
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,767
- Elyse.
- What are you doing?

471
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,862
- I'm trying to wake her.
- She fall asleep again?

472
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,203
In the middle of a
sentence. Elyse. Elyse.

473
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:58,836
<i>- What's happening?</i>
- Patient's not responding.

474
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,176
Pulse is fine. Airway's open.

475
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,238
Check her blood pressure.

476
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,115
Pupils are reactive.

477
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,781
Elyse, wake up.
You gotta wake up.

478
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,656
- What does that mean? What are you doing?
- She's unresponsive to pain.

479
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,627
<i>Come on, Elyse.</i>

480
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,927
- Is she dying?
- I don't know.

481
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,241
She's in a coma.

482
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:42,246
<i>There's only one way a tularemia
patient goes into a coma...</i>

483
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,256
while on I.V. chloramphenicol.

484
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:47,657
The patient doesn't have
tularemia. And then there was one.

485
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,752
Patient comes in 'cause
she's sleeping too much.

486
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,862
It takes 10 doctors
and a coma to diagnose

487
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:53,993
sleeping sickness. And
then there was none.

488
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,127
We still have the problem of explaining
how a white chick from Jersey...

489
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,762
who's never traveled south of
D.C. has African sleeping sickness.

490
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,036
Still have the
obvious explanation.

491
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,370
I made it clear. If
this guy's lying about

492
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:08,139
sleeping around he knows
he's murdering his wife.

493
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,375
Does seem unlikely.

494
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,441
Go away.

495
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,102
<i>What are you doing?</i>

496
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,706
Checking for lymphadenopathy.

497
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,404
And waiting for
you. Who are you?

498
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,572
I'm Dr. House.

499
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,617
Your wife has human
African trypanosomiasis.

500
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,452
Sleeping sickness. You
mean it's not tularemia,

501
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,081
a virus, tumor or—or cancer?

502
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,025
No.

503
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,856
I've never had an affair.

504
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,024
I believe you.

505
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,694
And I trust Elyse.

506
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,237
The treatment for this
disease is a drug that's...

507
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,301
fatal on its own
10% of the time.

508
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:16,439
Which is why I need your written
consent before I can legally prescribe it.

509
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:20,077
Why would she lie if she knew it could
kill her? I don't ask why patients lie.

510
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,087
I just assume they all do.

511
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,749
But why? To protect you,

512
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,884
because she didn't think it mattered,
it just seemed easier, because...

513
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,420
that's what people do.

514
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,828
If you're absolutely certain that your wife
has never had sex with anyone but you...

515
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,429
since you were
married, then I'm wrong.

516
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,702
But if you think there's a
possibility that just one time...

517
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,676
she wasn't perfect...

518
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,911
<i>One weekend you’re out of town,</i>

519
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,115
<i>one fight where
she ran to a friend,</i>

520
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,248
one stupid Christmas party...

521
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:04,054
Then you need to allow
me to start treatment.

522
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,725
Because if we don't,

523
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,768
she's gonna be dead
by tomorrow morning.

524
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,339
You trust your wife that much?

525
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,607
I don't know.

526
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,316
I'm gonna start the treatment.

527
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:51,265
Glass syringes? And
special I.V. tubing.

528
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,370
Why do we need this stuff?
Because melarsoprol melts plastic.

529
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,972
This stuff's basically
arsenic mixed with antifreeze.

530
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,143
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, huh?

531
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,188
Nietzsche wouldn't have been so
glib if he'd been prescribed melarsoprol.

532
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,020
"Can cause vomiting,
abdominal pain,

533
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,858
blood toxicity, neural
damage, cardiac arrhythmia."

534
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,524
They forgot to say it's
gonna hurt like all hell.

535
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,158
She's lucky she's in a coma.

536
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,555
How long before we know if
it's working? It's tough to say.

537
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,420
It's a good sign that she
hasn't gotten any worse.

538
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,455
Does she even know I'm here?

539
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,192
She knows you're
always there for her.

540
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,230
Yeah.

541
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,535
If she gets better,

542
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,632
it means she wasn't
always there for me.

543
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,804
It means she made a mistake.

544
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,308
I can't help it.

545
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,913
Part of me—a big part
of me— Can't handle that.

546
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,250
It doesn't want
her to get better.

547
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,062
Does that make
me a terrible person?

548
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,772
Yes.

549
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,001
So you're treating her for
African sleeping sickness...

550
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,532
because you don't think it's possible for
someone to be faithful in a relationship?

551
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,579
And you do? Yes.

552
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:11,845
And you need to tell me that.
Look. I am not having an affair.

553
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,376
I had lunch with someone
I work with—at work. Once.

554
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:19,049
I believe you. What I don't
believe is it'll be just once.

555
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,616
I love my wife. You
certainly love saying it.

556
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:25,357
I'm sorry. I know
you love your wife.

557
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,490
You loved all your
wives. Probably still do.

558
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,934
In fact, you probably love all the
women you loved who weren't your wife.

559
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,461
You can be a real jerk sometimes, you
know that? Yeah. And you're the good guy.

560
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,135
At least I try. As long as you're trying to
be good, you can do whatever you want.

561
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,155
And as long as you're
not trying, you can say

562
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,544
whatever you want. So,
between us, we can do anything.

563
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,140
We can rule the world.

564
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,624
Mixing up some margaritas?

565
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,860
Mine's a double, senorita.

566
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,198
That's Portuguese,
you know. Spanish.

567
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,205
Uh-oh.

568
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,374
What's goin' on?

569
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,207
I'm recalibrating
the centrifuge.

570
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,270
Turn around.

571
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,649
It's a very sad thing.

572
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,694
An uncalibrated centrifuge.

573
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,595
Makes me cry
too. I'm not crying.

574
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,757
Okay.

575
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,674
I told the husband
he was a jerk.

576
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,543
Why?

577
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,958
When I was in college, I...

578
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,394
I fell in love,
and I got married.

579
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,631
And...

580
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,799
At that age, the chances
of marriage lasting...

581
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,275
<i>It lasted six months.</i>

582
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,576
Thyroid cancer
metastasized to his brain.

583
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,742
There was nothing they could do.

584
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,787
I was 21, and...

585
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,157
I watched my husband die.

586
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,797
I'm sorry.

587
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,959
But that's not the whole story.

588
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,001
It's a symptom,
not your illness.

589
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:53,739
Thyroid cancer would have been
diagnosed at least a year before his death.

590
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,304
You knew he was dying
when you married him.

591
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,180
It must have been
when you first met him.

592
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,524
And you married him anyway.

593
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,128
You can't be that good a
person <i>and</i> well-adjusted.

594
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,027
Why?

595
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,093
'Cause you wind up
crying over centrifuges.

596
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,635
Or hating people?

597
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,558
<i>Her fever spiked at 104.</i>

598
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,560
Echo shows global hyperkinesis.

599
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,619
Blood pressure?
Barely 90 over 40.

600
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:48,599
Did you give her dopamine? Started
270 micrograms per minute 10 minutes ago.

601
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,965
Still no change.

602
00:37:56,474 --> 00:38:00,570
Killing the parasites isn't gonna do much
good if we kill her heart at the same time.

603
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,046
A heart can be
replaced. A brain can't.

604
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,413
Right now we're killing both.

605
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,962
If she's gonna die, we
should at least let her do

606
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,387
it without that acid
flowing through her veins.

607
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,947
What's happening?

608
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:18,755
We would've expected your wife's
condition to show some improvement by now.

609
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,765
It hasn't.

610
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,824
It's going the other way.

611
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,957
Please don't die.

612
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,861
Please don't die.

613
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,828
She's awake.

614
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,774
Hey. She's gonna be okay.

615
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,641
Yeah. Sure.

616
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,406
What are you gonna do?

617
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,001
Were you always honest with her?

618
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,845
Do you know how lucky you are?
Your wife is alive. She loves you.

619
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,885
What she did...

620
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,854
You can't love a person
and do that to them.

621
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,083
She loves you.

622
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,360
I need to know who
you had the affair with.

623
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,837
He has to be notified so
he can get treatment as well.

624
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,509
Why did you lie to us?

625
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,071
You knew your life was at stake.

626
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,889
He's not coming back, is he?

627
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,926
We all make mistakes,

628
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,966
and we all pay a price.

629
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,041
I need that name.

630
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:42,020
Hey, there. How you doin'?

631
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,028
Fine.

632
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,866
Do you know where your dad is?

633
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,333
Can I help you?

634
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,323
That's some bad hat, Harry.
