1
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,799
<i>Jessica.</i>

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,278
<i>Jessica. Come on. We gotta go.</i>

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,080
- Move it or lose it, sister.
- I don't feel good.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,759
Mmm. You don't feel
warm. My stomach hurts.

5
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,839
- Well, honey, if you
don't have a fever— - I

6
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,166
don't wanna go to school.
I can do my work at home.

7
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,300
Jessica, what's wrong?

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,400
Everybody hates me.

9
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,070
Oh, they don't hate you.

10
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,345
They don't even know you
because they're too ignorant to try.

11
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,478
I hate myself.
Jessica, don't say that.

12
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,485
Oh, honey. Look
at me. Look at me.

13
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,690
You are a wonderful,
beautiful little girl.

14
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:07,963
Don't let a few bad apples—
A few? Try my whole class.

15
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,762
Remember the story where the guy keeps
saying that he hates green eggs and ham?

16
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,434
And then at the end he
realized he really loved them?

17
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,775
One day, they're gonna realize
what a great kid you really are.

18
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:24,649
You just gotta be like
Sam-I-Am. And don't give up.

19
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,581
Okay.

20
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:35,420
<i>That's it. Keep goin'.</i>

21
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:40,297
<i>Good. Nice. You're doin ‘great,
Jessica. You're doin ‘great.</i>

22
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,338
<i>Hey. Hey, Seth.</i>

23
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,034
- You wanna spend the rest of class
sittin' on the bench?
- No.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,169
Keep goin', Jess. You
got 40 more seconds.

25
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:55,614
My arm hurts. <i>Come on. Tough
it up. You can do it. You can do it.</i>

26
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,174
- My chest hurts.
- How do you think the ground feels?

27
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,447
Hey, Seth. Two laps. Bye.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,082
<i>Hey, Jess. It's just a stitch. Okay?
Just... keep breathin'. You got it.</i>

29
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,149
I can't.

30
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,593
Only 10 more
seconds. You got it.

31
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,533
<i>Jessica? Jessica?</i>

32
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,441
Jessica!

33
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,773
Oh, my God. Hey, go to the
office. Get Miss Parsons. Now!

34
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,251
I'm on the playground at Finley

35
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,789
Elementary. One of my
students is havin' a heart attack.

36
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,918
Yeah, she's 10. Don't you think I know
that? Just send the damn ambulance.

37
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,622
<i>Come on. Wake up.
Come on, sweetie.</i>

38
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,125
<i>Dr. Bender, call extension 2870.</i>

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,639
You ever seen an
infected pierced scrotum?

40
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:30,644
Um, no, but I know a few people on whom
I'd like to see it happen. We need to talk.

41
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,148
Well, if pain's what you're after,
the penis is really the way to go.

42
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,877
- I'd recommend the apadravya.
- We're not talking.

43
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,816
Oh. It sounded like we were.

44
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:44,825
No, you're attempting to avoid talking
because you know what I wanna talk about.

45
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,658
Nipples? You need to get
rid of one of your people.

46
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,961
Absolutely. As soon as I
do performance reviews.

47
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,058
And then review the
reviews, of course.

48
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,332
A decision like this can't be made
without proper, you know, review.

49
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,566
Shouldn't take longer
than a month, maybe two.

50
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,074
Four at the most, unless
it gets complicated.

51
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,077
There's no way outta this.

52
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,581
You might as well get it over with as fast
as you can, like ripping off a Band-Aid.

53
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,359
Only instead of a two-cent piece of
tape and gauze, it's a human being.

54
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,784
- Like you care.
- Like you don't.

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,354
You have a week. Get it done.

56
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,460
<i>We have a referral
from Dr. Lenkiewicz.</i>

57
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,972
- Don't know him.
- He knows you.

58
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,372
- What's the problem?
- Heart attack.

59
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,935
- Definitely don't know him.
- The patient's 10.

60
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,181
<i>Ten-year-olds do not have heart
attacks. It's gotta be a mistake.</i>

61
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:48,586
Right. Simplest explanation is she's
a 40-year-old lying about her age.

62
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,524
Maybe an actress trying to hang on.
I meant maybe the tests were wrong.

63
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,426
<i>That's what the E.R. thought.
Three C.K.-M.B.'s were positive.</i>

64
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,954
<i>The E.K.G. shows classic signs
of S.T. elevation. It's a heart attack.</i>

65
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:03,026
She's morbidly obese. The
"morbid" part of that raises alarms.

66
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,595
<i>Come on. It takes decades to
eat your way into a heart attack.</i>

67
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,184
Doesn't take decades to
kill yourself. If I was that fat,

68
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,610
I'd be pretty tempted to
knock back a bottle of pills.

69
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,240
<i>It's not a drug overdose.
The fatigue, muscle pain and</i>

70
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,378
<i>difficulty concentrating have
been bothering her for over a year.</i>

71
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,281
That's because of her
weight, her depression.

72
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,378
That's what five pediatricians, two
nutritionists and a psychologist said.

73
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,390
The heart attack would seem to
indicate that they missed something.

74
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,552
- It's gotta be something genetic.
- What about metabolic syndrome "X"?

75
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,153
<i>Insulin resistance?</i>

76
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,950
Syndrome "X" could cause a stroke.
I don't know about a heart attack.

77
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,975
It could, if her blood
pressure was high enough.

78
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,679
Which is likely,
considering her weight.

79
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:42,334
Fits the symptoms. Me likee. Do a
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.

80
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,940
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

81
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,508
I've been told that I gotta get rid of
one of you guys by the end of the week.

82
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,682
New sheriff. Belt tightening.
You know how it goes.

83
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,752
Okay. Carry on.

84
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,959
Some kind of game.
House's own version of <i>Punk'd.</i>

85
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,971
It's not House. It's Vogler.

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,974
<i>We can't let it get to us.
We've gotta stick together.</i> Why?

87
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,738
Are you suggesting we start
slashing each other's throats?

88
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,042
I'm suggesting it's a
zero-sum game. Your loss

89
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:22,272
is my win. That's not
conducive to team play.

90
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,444
Which is what House seems
to want. Look, I'm with Cameron.

91
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:30,149
It may be a bad strategy, but I don't
wanna give House that satisfaction.

92
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,660
Come on. Sick kid, remember?

93
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,992
<i>She's diabetic?</i>

94
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,157
<i>No, but it's similar.</i>

95
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,114
M.S.X. patients don't
respond normally to insulin,

96
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,778
which causes their
body to create too much,

97
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,068
and that leads to
metabolic abnormalities.

98
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,041
We're going to do a test to be
sure, but there are certain dangers.

99
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,307
Is this... <i>thing</i> treatable?

100
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,644
It's controllable through
proper diet and exercise.

101
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:59,982
Wait. Jessica already eats
right, and she exercises every day.

102
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,488
I know you've already
seen several nutritionists...

103
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,048
- And we've done everything
they've recommended.
- I understand, but...

104
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,494
Why can't any of you
doctors see past her weight?

105
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:16,727
If diet and exercise are the
treatment, then the diagnosis is wrong.

106
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:22,333
It might be. But the only way we'll
know is if you let us do this test.

107
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:31,408
It's really bad, especially at night. It's
like my heart is on fire. Like it's, um...

108
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,420
Oh, I don't know. Like, uh...

109
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,479
<i>Burning?</i> Exactly.

110
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,357
Hmm, sounds almost
like... heartburn.

111
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:44,296
So, can you give me
somethin'? Like a thesaurus?

112
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:48,301
What? I take it you never mentioned
this during any of your prenatal visits.

113
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,303
Prenatal?

114
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,839
I'm not pregnant.

115
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,207
Sorry, you don't get to make that call
unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules.

116
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,111
I know when I'm pregnant,
all right? I have six kids.

117
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,708
That's why my husband had a
vasectomy, <i>and</i> we use condoms.

118
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,378
Vasectomies can reverse
themselves. Condoms break.

119
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:11,118
Okay. This... is what a
woman is supposed to look like.

120
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:14,161
Okay? We're not
just skin and bones.

121
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,493
We have... flesh.
We have... curves.

122
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,726
You have little
people inside you.

123
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,727
Okay, okay.

124
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,672
I'm sorry. I guess I must have just
been brainwashed by the media...

125
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,733
and all those years
of medical training.

126
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,974
- Damn right.
- I'll see if I can find some antacids
while the nurse gets some blood.

127
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,176
Blood? Why?

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,652
The heartburn. Gotta make
sure it's not... spreading.

129
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,421
I don't want to.

130
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,090
The test involves some
pretty precise measurements.

131
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,760
If we don't know exactly how much
you weigh, we won't get the right answers.

132
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,871
Let me tell you a secret. When
I was your age, I was heavy too.

133
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,671
Were you over a hundred?

134
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,204
Way over. Kids in my
neighborhood used to call me "Rerun."

135
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:13,242
Rerun? He was a heavy guy from TV. I—I
used to pretend I liked it, but I didn't.

136
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,379
How come you're
not heavy anymore?

137
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,482
Ninth grade, grew five inches.
Everything kind of evened out.

138
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,885
You think that'll happen
to me? <i>Well, yeah.</i>

139
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:27,195
Your mom's tall, and you are a little short
for your age. Probably spring right up.

140
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,270
<i>Obesity isn't something
you just grow out of.</i>

141
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,976
I take it you've never seen a
baby? She's not a baby. She's 10.

142
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,316
<i>And you figure making her feel like
crap would do her a world of good?</i>

143
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:51,518
- Yeah, if it gets her off the couch.
<i>- I'm sure she's already</i>
<i>under enough pressure.</i>

144
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,187
<i>Not from Mummy.</i> Everything in society tells
us we have to be thin to be successful.

145
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,028
No. Society tells you you have to be
thin to be attractive. And guess what?

146
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,194
That's what attractive means,
that society likes looking at you.

147
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,000
I think we should be telling our kids it's
fine as long as they're healthy. Right.

148
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,531
You weigh 90 pounds
because it makes you healthier?

149
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:14,411
Forget it. He's just cranky because he
knows he's the one who's gonna get the ax.

150
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,978
So, any thoughts?

151
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,957
On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?

152
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,755
Who you gonna let go?

153
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,403
I'm thinking I can convince Vogler
it would be more cost-efficient

154
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,908
to keep all of them. Yeah, you
should be able to pull that off.

155
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,458
Most billionaires aren't
very good with numbers.

156
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,127
It will be more
cost-efficient once I grab

157
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,202
Cameron's ass, call
Foreman a spade, and Chase...

158
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,711
Well, I'll grab his ass too.

159
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,738
You are uniquely talented in many areas,
but office politics is not one of them.

160
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,047
Don't take Vogler on.

161
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,610
- Separate or together?
- Together.

162
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,059
Increasing glucose to
6.9 milligrams per minute.

163
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,427
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- I'm thirsty.

164
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,126
- Just a little bit longer,
and you'll be done.
- Like Dr. Chase.

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,294
Wanna put some money on it?

166
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,906
I said I'm thirsty. <i>Just
five more minutes.</i>

167
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,671
Okay, sweetheart? <i>I'm not your
sweetheart. Don't call me that.</i>

168
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,339
- Jessica, that's not nice.
- They're the ones who aren't nice.

169
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,247
Jessica. <i>You're not, either. I
don't wanna do this anymore.</i>

170
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,649
<i>Jessica. Jessica, you
have to calm down. No! No!</i>

171
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,687
<i>Let me go.</i>

172
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,798
Check her blood sugar. She's
gotta be getting hypoglycemic.

173
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,849
<i>I've never seen her like this
before. Something's wrong.</i>

174
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,760
Let go of me! Get it out of me!

175
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,321
Let go of me, you son
of a bitch! You bastard!

176
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,427
Oh, no.

177
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,173
<i>She's sedated. Mrs.
Simms, don't worry.</i>

178
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,723
Hypoglycemia can cause
temporary psychosis and is

179
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:53,202
a common complication
during an CH.E. procedure.

180
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,339
I never wanted it
done in the first place.

181
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,510
We understand you're upset— You were
supposed to be monitoring her condition,

182
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,645
but instead you were
bickering and placing bets.

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,798
I apologize if it looked
like we weren't devoting our

184
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,885
full attention to your
daughter, but I assure you...

185
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,191
Oh, please. Save your pathetic
insincerity for your boyfriend.

186
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,700
You're wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically
sincere. And they didn't screw it up.

187
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,702
- Who are you?
- I'm from the lab.

188
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,534
The blood tests show your
daughter was not hypoglycemic, which

189
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:22,436
means her psychosis wasn't
caused by anything these doctors did.

190
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,468
- So then what was it caused by?
- I've no idea.

191
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:30,210
Huh. <i>But you’ll be happy to hear it
cannot be cured by diet or exercise.</i>

192
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,526
What else could cause
uncontrollable rage in a 10-year-old?

193
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,568
Nothing that could also
cause a heart attack.

194
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:56,375
I assume I don't have to point out that
now would be an extremely good time...

195
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,504
for one of you to distinguish
yourself with a brilliant idea.

196
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,511
A hypercoagulable state
can cause a blood clot.

197
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,991
<i>- Blood clots can cause a heart attack.</i>
- More likely to cause a stroke,
not the psychosis.

198
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,317
No, you're wrong. If a clot
made it to the amygdala

199
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,758
area of the brain, it might
cause uncontrollable rage.

200
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,723
<i>Right, because anything's
possible, but nothing's</i>

201
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:20,509
<i>gonna cause multiple
clots in a kid this age.</i>

202
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,765
- She's fat.
- Obesity doesn't cause blood clots.

203
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,948
<i>Extremely obese patients
can get a fat embolus.</i>

204
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,840
<i>Right, after they've had liposuction,
which she's clearly never had.</i>

205
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,707
- How do you know?
<i>- Because we have her medical records,</i>

206
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,678
<i>and because no plastic
surgeon in his right</i>

207
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,715
<i>mind is gonna give a
10-year-old liposuction.</i>

208
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,650
Have you ever met a plastic
surgeon who <i>was</i> in their right mind?

209
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,146
- She hasn't had liposuction.
- Thank you.

210
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,092
<i>But what about some other
ridiculous obesity treatment?</i>

211
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,892
Like what? <i>Diet pills can cause
heart attacks and blood clots.</i>

212
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:55,424
- Her tox screen was negative.
- Wouldn't show over-the-counter
weight loss drugs.

213
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,168
Her mother wouldn't
give her diet pills. She

214
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,114
thinks her daughter's
perfect just the way she is.

215
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,437
She's lying.

216
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,043
<i>Okay. You two, heparin and
warfarin to prevent further clotting.</i>

217
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,539
<i>And</i> you <i>find those pills.</i>

218
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,290
Not diet pills.

219
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,922
You might wanna broaden
the search just a little.

220
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,365
<i>And don’t just ask the mom.</i>

221
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,385
If she hasn't mentioned
it yet, she's not— If

222
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,428
<i>you’re gonna fire someone,
go ahead and do it.</i>

223
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,922
But don't treat us like
lab rats, testing how

224
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,603
long it takes to get us
at one another's throats.

225
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,976
- So what should I do?
- I don't give a damn what you do.

226
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,279
Yes, I had noticed your
complete indifference.

227
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,218
You don't even offer a
medical opinion anymore.

228
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,223
- Who would you fire?
- Not my call.

229
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,521
I want your opinion.

230
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,358
<i>Fine, it's you.</i>

231
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,024
Either way, you're
making a choice.

232
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,669
Chase.

233
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,704
- Because he screwed up an angio
a month ago?
- Anyone can make a mistake.

234
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,716
Right. So it's the
money. You resent it, but

235
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,974
you're gonna tell me that
he doesn't need the job.

236
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,139
He doesn't appreciate the job.

237
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,241
He was ready to go three
rounds with Cameron for it.

238
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,151
He wants the job. He
just doesn't appreciate it.

239
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,514
<i>There's nothing wrong
with just wanting to</i>

240
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:26,022
<i>hang out, but this is
not the place to do it.</i>

241
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,926
- I'm surprised.
- You thought I'd pick Cameron?

242
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,091
I didn't think
you'd pick at all.

243
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,807
Guess he's not the "rise above the
fray" guy he'd like us to think he is.

244
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,867
You practically
forced it out of him.

245
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,812
He's scared of losing his
job, just like everybody else.

246
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,850
I've been thinking. You've made it
quite clear that you're miserable here.

247
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,183
I am not miserable.
You're not happy.

248
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,621
And you are? With my job, yes.

249
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,922
I am exactly where I wanna be,
doing exactly what I wanna do.

250
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,259
Think I sense a hint
of sarcasm there.

251
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,428
Why don't you pick yourself?
Quit? Hmm, I was wrong.

252
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:13,963
About Vogler or Foreman?
Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy test.

253
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,795
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?
Either a woman carrying

254
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,104
an alien baby or
your newest patient.

255
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:24,141
<i>So you never saw her with any
pills. She never mentioned anything?</i>

256
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,516
No, of course not.

257
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,385
Would it be all right if I, uh,
talk to a couple of her friends?

258
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,424
Her friends? <i>I'm not
gonna interrogate them.</i>

259
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,757
I just wanna ask if Jessica
ever mentioned anything.

260
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,887
It's—It's pretty important.
She's very sick.

261
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,694
I understand. It's just, well...

262
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,961
Jessica really doesn't
have any friends.

263
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,265
Not one? I've tried to help,

264
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,806
make the kids include her
more, but... kids can be...

265
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,240
- Kids?
- I was gonna say jerks.

266
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,711
All the fifth-graders are
assigned an eighth-grade buddy.

267
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,714
Maybe you could talk to hers.

268
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,855
What's the status on House?

269
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,758
He asked for time to complete performance
reviews for everyone in his department.

270
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,819
And you told him no
and gave him how long?

271
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,923
A week. He'll do it.

272
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:17,528
<i>Guy's never done what he's told. I
don't see why he's gonna start now.</i>

273
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,867
Hi. Edward Vogler.

274
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,001
Is Dr. House claiming that I'm
forcing him to get rid of one of you?

275
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,773
I assume his goal is to stir
up antagonism toward me.

276
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:31,511
- And your goal is?
- I am forcing him.

277
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,850
I'll do whatever I can to ease the
transition for whoever he chooses.

278
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,858
- If you're feeling guilty about your decision,
there is an easy solution.
- I don't feel guilty.

279
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,521
Then... why approach
me and tell me all this?

280
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,258
I don't feel guilty. That
doesn't mean I don't feel bad.

281
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,732
I'm rich, but I'm still human.

282
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,970
I just wanted you to know...

283
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:55,133
that if there's anything I can
do for you, my door's open.

284
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,335
Thank you.

285
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:08,150
You're lookin' for info? Thought
you already had House all figured out.

286
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,349
I do. Don't know
his team though.

287
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,993
<i>The ultrasound and
biopsy confirmed our worry.</i>

288
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:21,364
The tumor is extremely
large, at least 30 pounds.

289
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,529
Oh, God. It's actually a
personal record for this clinic.

290
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,234
But it's completely benign.
There's no sign of cancer at all.

291
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,555
<i>I've already spoken with Dr. Bergin, and
he's available first thing in the morning.</i>

292
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,514
For what?

293
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,451
For the surgery.

294
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,784
But if it's not cancer,
it can't kill me, right?

295
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,358
Mmm, no. I'll have a huge scar.

296
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,261
I won't be able
to wear a bikini.

297
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,767
- You wear a bikini now?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?

298
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,770
Nope. But I've never
gone swimming with you.

299
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,568
I knew it. That's
what this is all about.

300
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,407
You are trying to force me
to have cosmetic surgery.

301
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,471
Yeah, that's exactly why <i>I</i> planted
a 30-pound tumor on your ovary.

302
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,581
It's not gonna kill
me. The only thing

303
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,042
surgery is gonna do is
change the way I look.

304
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,147
<i>That is the definition
of cosmetic surgery.</i>

305
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,387
<i>Uh, it would also relieve
your heartburn and discomfort.</i>

306
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,123
Yeah, right. Why give an antacid
if you can cut someone up...

307
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,256
and make them a little
easier on your eyes?

308
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:33,568
My husband... loves my
body. He can't get enough of it.

309
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,974
You think he's gonna wanna touch me if
I look like I've been gutted like a fish?

310
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,782
<i>That was unexpected.</i>

311
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,742
Yeah, it was.

312
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,747
All she does during recess is
run laps around the playground.

313
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,748
She says she's exercising,
but everyone knows

314
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:54,851
it's just because no one
wants to play with her.

315
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,455
I mean, I'm only her buddy because
Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.

316
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,523
That does <i>not</i>
mean I am her friend.

317
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,300
I'll make sure her doctors
are all clear on that.

318
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,306
Thanks.

319
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,673
So, has she ever said
anything to you about diet pills?

320
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,440
- Ha. She told you that too?
- What do you mean?

321
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,447
I totally busted her for
taking drugs one day.

322
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,042
She totally lied, said that they
were diet pills her mom had given her.

323
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,555
Come on. Get real. No way a
girl like that is taking diet pills.

324
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,591
<i>I didn't give her diet
pills. I would never do that.</i>

325
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,594
Right. So it was
her imaginary mom.

326
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,630
She didn't take any
pills. The girl's lying.

327
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,791
<i>Why would she lie? Because
she's another mean little jerk.</i>

328
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:37,530
- Mom.
- I'm sorry, honey.

329
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,198
Clemmie didn't lie.

330
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,803
I did. I took the pills.

331
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:51,245
<i>I told her you gave them to me
because I didn't wanna get in trouble.</i>

332
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:55,379
<i>Where did you get them?</i>
I took them from the store.

333
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,248
Why? Why would you do that?

334
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,521
Because I didn't
wanna be ugly anymore.

335
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,554
<i>- Oh, baby. You're not ugly.</i>
- Yes, I am.

336
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,760
I know you don't think
so, but I am. I'm disgusting.

337
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,702
Jessica, please don't say that.

338
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,038
I just—I just wanted to fit in.

339
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,043
You know, have friends?

340
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,172
<i>Or at least have one
person my age be nice to me.</i>

341
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,685
Oh.

342
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,289
Listen, the, uh...

343
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:34,020
The pills cause blood clots,
heart attacks and insomnia.

344
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,552
It explains everything. We'll
keep her overnight to make sure,

345
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,099
but, uh, she'll be fine.

346
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,625
Thank you.

347
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,137
<i>I can't believe she
was that desperate.</i>

348
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,073
Yeah, I'm sure that if
everyone I knew hated me,

349
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,202
couldn't bear to look at me, I
wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.

350
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,970
I'm not talking about
the shoplifting. I'm

351
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:55,874
sure she didn't even
know they were dangerous.

352
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,385
She probably saw them
advertised on TV or over the Internet.

353
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,354
Right. So I guess it's the media and
pharmaceutical companies' fault now,

354
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,982
not the fact that she can't stop
shoveling food down her throat.

355
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,993
No one forced her to get fat.

356
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,462
- No one forced a cancer patient
to get cancer.
- Give me a break. It's not a disease.

357
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,090
Have you seen the latest
research? <i>Yes, I have.</i>

358
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,103
What I haven't seen lately is a
kid eating an apple or riding a bike.

359
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,572
You Americans can't even compete with the
rest of the world in basketball anymore,

360
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,340
<i>unless, of course, it's the type you play
with a remote control on a big-screen TV.</i>

361
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,473
- Right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

362
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,179
Are you gonna let him say that?
He insulted our basketball teams.

363
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,591
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

364
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,836
It hurts so bad. Please.
<i>What happened?</i>

365
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,304
- She's bleeding.
- From where?

366
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,932
Oh, my gosh.

367
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,637
Just please stop it. Please!

368
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,310
Diet pills brought her to
us. We gave her the sores.

369
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,948
You think she got a staph
infection from something here?

370
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:15,103
I'm not saying the hospital gave her the
sores. I'm saying we did, by treating her.

371
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,222
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

372
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,961
- Highly unlikely. We started her
on heparin before the warfarin.
- Who gave her the heparin?

373
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:25,402
- I did warfarin. She did heparin.
- Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?

374
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,463
Yes. I did not screw up.

375
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,377
Did you actually see her prepare
and administer the heparin?

376
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,713
'Nuff said.

377
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,914
You were standing right there.
<i>I was preparing my own dose.</i>

378
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,972
Yeah, right. There's
gotta be some other cause.

379
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:47,653
None that I can think of.

380
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,218
<i>Let's fix the mistake.</i>

381
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,518
<i>Give her unfractionated I.
V. heparin and low molecular</i>

382
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,461
<i>weight heparin by
subcutaneous injection, stat.</i>

383
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,499
Making me look bad is
not gonna save your job.

384
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,702
You think you're incapable
of making a mistake?

385
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,939
You think that I'm just
gonna roll over and take this?

386
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,447
House isn't gonna protect you
just because you kiss his ass.

387
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:12,280
Vogler wants to know
what he can do for me.

388
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:17,312
Hey! Stop worrying about your asses
and start worrying about the patient's.

389
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,001
<i>She sleeping?</i>

390
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,378
As a result of the sedatives, yeah.
Can't let her wake up. Too much pain.

391
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:50,783
"Warfarin-induced
skin necrosis."

392
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,690
I... have no idea
what that means.

393
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,958
But it says here we
gave her the warfarin.

394
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,899
And I do know what
"induced" means. We did this?

395
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,734
At this point, it's
not exactly clear.

396
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,669
You should probably
talk to Dr. House.

397
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,974
Oh. You two need time
to get your stories straight.

398
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,037
He doesn't tell me what to do.

399
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:18,881
So you don't just blindly follow his
commands. You're your own man.

400
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:22,911
And yet here you are, working
for a guy you can't stand.

401
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,548
I respect him. What
exactly is it you respect?

402
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,584
His attitude toward humanity?
He thinks we're all idiots and liars.

403
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,428
How about his attitude toward you? Plays
with you like a cat with a ball of string.

404
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:37,493
What do you want? I wanna
know if you wanna keep your job.

405
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,663
If he chooses to let me
go, I can live with that.

406
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,207
- That's not an answer.
- Are you offering to protect me?

407
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,743
- Still not an answer.
- I want my job.

408
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,780
Dr. Chase. Boss.

409
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:02,160
What was that about? He wanted to
know what warfarin is. I don't know.

410
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,681
Brr. Icy.

411
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:35,387
I'll definitely think twice before
correcting one of your mistakes again.

412
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,161
Correct all you
want. Course, it's a bit

413
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:39,125
more productive if
there's an actual mistake.

414
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,794
<i>Right. I always
forget that part.</i>

415
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,828
I gave her the heparin, which means the
necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin,

416
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:51,639
which is probably why she's not
responding to your treatment. Yet.

417
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,445
If you didn't screw
up, then what is it?

418
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:02,350
<i>You don't have an answer.</i> Yet.

419
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,084
When you come up with
something, let me know.

420
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,924
I'll be in the
clinic, warming up.

421
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,453
I'm the only one who's always stood
behind you when you've screwed up.

422
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,659
Why? Why would you support
someone who screws up?

423
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,750
Because I'm not insanely
insecure, and because

424
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:18,727
I can actually trust in
another human being,

425
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,740
and I am not an angry,
misanthropic son of a bitch.

426
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,039
I'm sorry. You said
you <i>weren't</i> angry.

427
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,174
Who would you fire?

428
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,775
No one.

429
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,820
Not an option.

430
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,978
If everyone took a pay
cut and put in a few more

431
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:39,382
hours, we could all stay for
the same amount of money.

432
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,622
Figures you'd try and come up with
a solution where no one gets hurt.

433
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,960
The problem is, the world doesn't
work that way just 'cause you want it to.

434
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,001
Figures you'd stall and
refuse to deal with the issue.

435
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,560
<i>Problem is, the world doesn't go
away just because</i> you <i>want it to.</i>

436
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,847
Excuse me. Dr. House?

437
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:15,019
My wife saw you yesterday.
Lucille Hernandez?

438
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,062
Uh, he's not in today.

439
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,758
My wife said he
walked with a cane.

440
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:24,098
He's also got a bit of a drug problem.
Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.

441
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,766
<i>The M.R.I.'s are
rented, but, um—</i>

442
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,076
Did you make a decision?
He's not gonna fire anybody.

443
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:37,241
Yes. I'm gonna cut
the pay of all four of us.

444
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,483
<i>Seventeen percent
across the board will allow</i>

445
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:41,845
<i>you to keep us all for the
same amount of money.</i>

446
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,912
I believe it's what you
suits call a "win-win".

447
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,356
All right, uh, i-if you can— No.

448
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,625
<i>If he can work it so we keep the current
staff for the same amount of money,</i>

449
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,292
<i>what difference does it make?</i>

450
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,967
It's not about the money.

451
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,167
This is not a
negotiation. It never was.

452
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,802
I need to know that
whatever I ask you to do,

453
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,870
<i>however distasteful
you find it, you'll do it.</i>

454
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,974
And just as importantly,
<i>you</i> need to know that.

455
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,653
<i>What's going on with my wife?</i>

456
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,064
Even if I was Dr. House,

457
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:32,036
physician-patient confidentiality
protects me from annoying conversations.

458
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,037
She told me about the
tumor. Yeah? She also

459
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,200
tell you why she's
refusing to have it removed?

460
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,235
I don't care about a scar. And she
can always gain the weight back.

461
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:46,274
- You want her to regain the weight?
- Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.

462
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,618
Why? I've always thought she
looked sexiest when she was pregnant.

463
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,872
Something about knowing
she's a mother just makes

464
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,922
me want to— Tell her
that and leave me alone.

465
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:59,522
I did. You gotta talk to her. I couldn't
bear it if something happened to her.

466
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,433
The tumor is benign. Nothing's gonna
happen, except maybe some more heartburn.

467
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,032
What if it gets even
bigger, or it changes?

468
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,269
You know where to find us.
Building's not going anywhere.

469
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,183
Tell her it's cancer.
You obviously don't have

470
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:16,009
a problem with lying.
Oh. Way to win me over.

471
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,574
We got six kids. She can't
afford to take a chance.

472
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,280
You have kids. How novel.
That changes everything.

473
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,949
So if Mommy gets heartburn,
one of them might catch on fire.

474
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:29,461
Please. I don't
know what we'd do.

475
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,366
They are cute.

476
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,531
Have her come back in. What?

477
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,734
Your plight has moved me.
Tell your wife to come back.

478
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,518
The necrosis is getting worse.

479
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,053
Maybe because we're
treating her for the wrong thing.

480
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,887
- Have you found the right thing?
- No.

481
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,689
Then we continue the treatment, hope
it's just taking longer than it should.

482
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,731
<i>A t this point, it doesn't matter
what caused the necrosis.</i>

483
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,179
Or who.

484
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:09,859
<i>- If we don't stop it from spreading,
it'll kill her before the end of the day.</i>

485
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,994
What else can we do?
Get rid of it. Remove the

486
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:14,373
<i>dying flesh before it
penetrates the abdominal wall.</i>

487
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,266
Do it.

488
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,644
There's still a chance the heparin
treatment could start to take effect.

489
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,173
We're gonna wait as long as we can, but
if there's no change in the next few hours,

490
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,516
we're gonna have to
treat the symptoms directly.

491
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,887
So you can get rid of the
sores? Through surgery.

492
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,052
Technically, it's an amputation.

493
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,222
Amputation? But the sores are...

494
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:43,098
<i>Warfarin-induced necrosis attacks
fatty tissue, mainly in the breasts.</i>

495
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:48,800
Wait. Are you talking about
cutting off my daughter's... breasts?

496
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:57,913
- She's 10 years old.
<i>- A radical mastectomy</i>
<i>may be her only chance for survival.</i>

497
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,579
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to sign this.</i>

498
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,963
<i>Could we talk?</i>

499
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,534
What, no roses, no chocolates?

500
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,546
If you're here to apologize—
I'm not here to apologize.

501
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,344
Uh-oh.

502
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,212
That means you're here for
something more complicated.

503
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,121
Do you <i>want</i> to fire me?

504
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:44,625
Yes. Just waiting for an excuse.
Thank God Vogler came along. Whew.

505
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,463
<i>It's the only reason I can think of why
you're insisting that I made a mistake.</i>

506
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,992
Really? Because there
is another explanation.

507
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,301
Perhaps not as much fun
as your Freudian analysis,

508
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,364
but maybe you
actually made a mistake.

509
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,536
You're doing this because you
can't deal with your feelings for me.

510
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,245
I believe that <i>you</i> are the
only one to express feelings.

511
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,533
And if we're gonna look
at this from a first-year

512
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,884
psych point of view, maybe
you <i>want</i> me to fire you.

513
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,724
Maybe that's why you're acting
weird— You're the one being different.

514
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,841
You're always pushing things, pushing
the rules, pushing us. But not this time.

515
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,388
You jumped on this
idea like a life raft.

516
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:23,110
Not one question about
what else it could be.

517
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:27,094
No riding us for other
answers. I have the answer.

518
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,767
Then why aren't you watching TV
or playing your damn Game Boy...

519
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,678
or whatever else you have
so much fun doing by yourself?

520
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,180
Maybe I should just quit.

521
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,381
Make it easy for everyone.

522
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,449
Maybe you should.

523
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,590
<i>Men are pigs.</i>

524
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,727
You called me in to tell me...

525
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,232
I should've realized the
vasectomy and condoms

526
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:02,763
was overkill, but this
was too obvious to miss.

527
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,973
Cute kids.

528
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,244
Love her green eyes
and his baby blues.

529
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,354
- Of course, since both
you and your husband

530
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:15,253
have brown eyes— -
Where'd you get that?

531
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,384
From the father of three,
maximum four, of your six children.

532
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,791
So I'm thinking maybe the
reason you don't want surgery...

533
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,729
is that while your husband will
find you attractive no matter what,

534
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,928
all the other men you're sleeping
with might not be so open-minded.

535
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,665
Which brings me back to my
original thesis: Men are pigs.

536
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:39,143
You got nothing to worry about.
They'll pretty much have sex with anyone:

537
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,672
fat, skinny, married, single,
complete strangers, relatives...

538
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,345
You... are sick. So are you.

539
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,117
And I'm sure there are
Web sites full of men...

540
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,091
looking for married
women with surgical scars.

541
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,655
So have the surgery. Please?

542
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,428
Okay.

543
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,565
Thanks.

544
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,379
<i>Why have you been
talking to Cameron?</i>

545
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:20,647
- If House picks you,
I'll be needing a new source in that room.
- If he picks me?

546
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,783
Sure. Foreman's smarter.
House has got a thing for Cameron.

547
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,554
I've been feeding you
information so you'll protect me.

548
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,721
And I will protect you
as long as I need you.

549
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,060
And you will feed me information
as long as you need me.

550
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,999
I spoke with Cameron
because if I have alternatives,

551
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,003
I don't need you.

552
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,706
She's not gonna rat on House.

553
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,575
Foreman never said
anything about talkin' to me?

554
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,245
Interesting, huh?

555
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:16,767
It's been almost three hours.
Still no change in her condition.

556
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,834
I think we should
get her into surgery.

557
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,971
So what do you wanna do?

558
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,583
Assume that Cameron
didn't screw up.

559
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,266
What if it's not the
warfarin? It has to be. The

560
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,154
<i>sores presented right
after we administered it.</i>

561
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,189
Right, right, right.
But let's just say

562
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:37,457
it's not. Come on. Come
on. What do you got?

563
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,710
Can I have a second to
think? No. There's no time to

564
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,194
<i>think. Just say the first thing
that comes into your head.</i>

565
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,964
She's fat. Enough already, okay?
We got it. You hate fat people.

566
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,268
That's not what I meant. <i>We
already considered obesity as a cause.</i>

567
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,271
So did all her other
doctors. No, I mean what

568
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,208
<i>if it’s not a cause?
What if it’s a symptom?</i>

569
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:58,572
Okay. So, what could cause
obesity <i>and</i> skin necrosis?

570
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,987
I don't care if it makes
sense. Just give me something.

571
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,389
- Ulcers secondary to vasculitis.
- No, that's just sores, not obesity.

572
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,985
- Pyoderma gangrenosum.
- More sores.

573
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,998
<i>Let's look at it from the other side.
What has obesity as a symptom?</i>

574
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,502
Hypothyroidism? Genetics are
more likely. Her mom's heavy too.

575
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,969
She's not just
heavy, she's tall.

576
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,407
We have any history
on the dad? Yeah.

577
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,509
6'1".

578
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,390
Kid's short.

579
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:44,020
We got stunted growth, high
blood pressure, blood clots, obesity...

580
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,260
- It's Cushing's.
- No. Necrosis doesn't present...

581
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,167
In rare cases, Cushing's
can cause hypercalcemia,

582
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,035
which can lead to the same
skin necrosis as warfarin.

583
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,472
<i>It's perfect. It
explains everything.</i>

584
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,095
<i>Except it's not Cushing's.
She's had multiple blood</i>

585
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,445
<i>tests, and none show
abnormal cortisol levels.</i>

586
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:04,813
The hypercortisolism could be cyclical.
We didn't catch it in the right phase.

587
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,864
- We'll have to do another
U.F.C.— - There's no

588
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,979
time. We've got less than
an hour to make a call.

589
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,386
<i>If we treat for Cushing's
and we're wrong, she's dead.</i>

590
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,858
<i>If we assume it's not Cushing's, she'll
lose her breast and may still be sick.</i>

591
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:22,327
- Do an M.R.I.
- You want us to look
for hypercortisolism with an M.R.I.?

592
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,633
No, I want you to look for what could
cause hypercortisolism with an M.R.I.

593
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,820
Nothing on the adrenals.

594
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,724
Heard Cameron went
home. Is she sick?

595
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,324
Go back to the pituitary views.

596
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,530
- She seemed okay.
- Think she's got
another reason for leaving?

597
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,903
I hope so. Wait, stop.

598
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,408
There. What's that?

599
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,371
Huh. A tumor.

600
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,441
It's Cushing's.

601
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:18,513
<i>The tumor causes Cushing's. Cushing's
messes with hormone production.</i>

602
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,923
Hormones control
everything: growth, weight...

603
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:24,952
Can you fix it? She'll need
surgery to remove the tumor.

604
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,295
<i>Once it's gone, everything
will get normal very fast.</i>

605
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,767
- No mastectomy?
- No.

606
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,634
Thank God. <i>The
surgery is dangerous.</i>

607
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,004
The pituitary's located
between the cavernous sinuses,

608
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,066
basically right
between the eyes.

609
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,764
The area contains the
nerves that control eye

610
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:41,689
movement and the major
arteries that feed the brain.

611
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,579
Oh, my God.

612
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:47,278
The surgeon will approach
the gland transsphenoidally.

613
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,981
<i>An incision will be
made under the lip,</i>

614
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,218
<i>through which he'll insert
a fiber-optic microscope.</i>

615
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,601
<i>Once the tumor's found,
he'll cut it into small pieces</i>

616
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,786
<i>and remove it through
the same hole under the lip.</i>

617
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,057
<i>The whole procedure should
take about three hours, and</i>

618
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,300
<i>your daughter should be
able to go home in a few days.</i>

619
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,565
<i>The sores will go away, as well
as her fatigue and the muscle pain.</i>

620
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,630
<i>She'll even start losing weight.</i>

621
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,048
<i>Jessica.</i> Hi.

622
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,822
- Is that really you?
- Yep, it's me.

623
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,729
You look fantastic.

624
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,894
- She always looked fantastic.
- Yeah.

625
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,889
- It's been a week.
- Actually, it's over a week.

626
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,958
<i>How have you guys been?</i>

627
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,027
Who is it?

628
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,166
Chase.

629
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:58,072
No, Chase stays.
Pick someone else.

630
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:01,278
The deal was—
The deal's changed.

631
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,551
- Pick someone else.
- No.

632
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,187
Mmm.

633
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,626
Pick someone else, or it'll
be the whole department.

634
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,657
That's some bad hat, Harry.
