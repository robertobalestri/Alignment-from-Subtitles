1
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:04,933
Are you thinkin'
about taking drugs?

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,942
Well, think again, because
drugs are not the answer.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,001
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,239
Oh, don't remember
this ugly mug?

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,853
Two years ago, I was a star.
I won n-nine games in a row.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,550
<i>- But by the end of August,
I was gone—</i> - Cut! Cut!

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,462
- Not good, huh?
- Well, you caught the ball.

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,090
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:37,866
Look, I usually don't, you know,
give line readings, but let me—Try this.

10
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,907
Hollywood ain't
holdin' its breath.

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,137
Yeah, well, they're doin'
it wrong. I mean, for Hank.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,441
<i>Tell the director.</i>

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,580
I thought I'd give the
marriage a few months

14
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:49,506
before I go for the
meddling wife thing.

15
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,042
His arm came back the day
after you hooked up. I say meddle.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,715
You okay? Just gas.

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,248
Go help your man. Give me
a little room here to work it out.

18
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,167
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

19
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,797
Like that? No.

20
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,865
Hey, sweetheart. <i>Hey.</i>

21
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,367
<i>Hi, Bryan.</i> Hey.

22
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,778
Having trouble with the big
speech? Yeah. You got any ideas?

23
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,407
It's your story.
Just be yourself.

24
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,942
Drugs were there,
you took 'em. Simple.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,252
Why'd you get clean?
'Cause I was gonna die.

26
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,520
And, come April,
'cause you're clean,

27
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,859
you're starting Opening
Day against the Yanks.

28
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,731
Try it her way? Yeah.

29
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,736
Okay. Okay.

30
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:47,332
Let's start with the second part first.
That'll get him in the groove. Okay.

31
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,399
We'll do the
throwing thing first.

32
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,468
Everybody wants to direct.

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,476
- Warner all right?
<i>- Yeah, he's good.</i>

34
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,145
<i>You just bring it, babe.
Just tell your story.</i>

35
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,313
Roll cameras.

36
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,357
<i>Rolling. Sound. Speed.</i>

37
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,621
<i>Come on, kid! Show 'em what
you’re gonna give the Yankees!</i>

38
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,355
All right, action!

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,806
Oh, God!

40
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,519
You okay? It's gonna be
okay. It's gonna be okay.

41
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,476
<i>He's got osteopenia. His bones
are too thin to fix the arm problem.</i>

42
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,482
No. Price is not a problem
if you have what I need.

43
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,984
Young man? How did you know?

44
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,919
Well, if he's an old man,
osteopenia would just be a fact of life.

45
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,866
You make him comfortable, send him
home, which means you're just boring me.

46
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,382
So he's young, which means
it's most likely caused by cancer.

47
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,624
You're here because you haven't found
it. Have you looked really, really hard?

48
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,165
M.R.I. and PET scan
are both negative.

49
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,066
Well, how old is he? Maybe
the osteopenia is just early onset.

50
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,536
Ah, let's see.

51
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,631
"Born 9/21/77."

52
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,198
It's Hank Wiggen?

53
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,973
And he signed it. Sweet. Yeah.

54
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:10,040
"To Jimmy Wilson, the
Cy Young of medicine."

55
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,110
Did you ask for that?
Just the "Jimmy" part.

56
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,347
The bone's too thin to support the kind
of surgery that would let him pitch again.

57
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,553
But if we figure out what's
causing the osteopenia,

58
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,667
we can reverse the bone
damage, then do the surgery.

59
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:26,189
Beat the Yankees
and save the free world.

60
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,039
It was a working dinner.

61
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,940
My work—Company pays.

62
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,607
<i>I don't know. I just feel kind of
weird after what it turned into.</i>

63
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,776
Well, then it
stopped being work.

64
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,185
<i>You know, if it’ll solve
your ethics problem,</i>

65
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,157
you can reimburse me for these.

66
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,955
What are they, $5.57, I believe?

67
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,063
Mmm. Let me know about Friday?

68
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,367
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

69
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,894
<i>None of the usual suspects.</i>

70
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,307
Age isn't right, in apparent
perfect health before this incident,

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,927
M.R.I. and PET scan negative for tumors.
Test him again. It's gotta be cancer.

72
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,062
Sorry I'm late. Car broke
down on the interstate.

73
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,876
Don't believe you. CHEM-7
shows a poor kidney function.

74
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,778
- Why would a guy in his 20s
have a poor kidney function?
- Cancer.

75
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,908
It first attacks the bones,
and then the kidneys.

76
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:54,921
Come on, people. He was
17 and 7. His E.R.A. was 2.1.

77
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,035
You want it to be his
kidneys, because if it's

78
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,221
his kidneys, then maybe
we can treat it, fix it.

79
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,126
<i>And if it’s cancer, then
he'll never pitch again.</i>

80
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,214
If this were a regular
guy who broke his arm

81
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,189
lifting a box, you
would've sent him home.

82
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,930
My God, you're right. I lost my
head. All life is equally sacred.

83
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,161
I promise you. The
next knitting injury that

84
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,566
comes in here, we're
on it like stink on cheese.

85
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,737
<i>- He weighed 1 75 his rookie year.</i>
- Stop.

86
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,906
Now he's 195 after
playing a year in Japan.

87
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,916
Why? He let himself go.

88
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,174
<i>Steroids. The guy was
a drug user. I'm sure he</i>

89
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,751
<i>wouldn't have balked at
pumping up through chemicals.</i>

90
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,086
That'd explain the weight
gain and the kidney problems.

91
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,990
And the bone loss. Go
ask him what he's on.

92
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,154
When he says nothing,
have him pee in a cup.

93
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,437
If your car breaks down, you're
an hour late, not two minutes.

94
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,133
And two minutes isn't late enough to
use a clever excuse like car trouble.

95
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,676
I was coming in early. <i>Huh.</i>

96
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,406
Unprompted lies.
That's a bad sign.

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,780
Either a guilty conscience, or
something personal's going on.

98
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,521
See, that's all you had to do—
Just walk in, sit down, do your job.

99
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,962
No. No, I never took 'em.

100
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,124
We're gonna need a urine sample.

101
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,102
Oh, no, you don't trust me.

102
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,699
Baby, I'm worried about
takin' this morphine.

103
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,267
You're in pain.

104
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,439
The doses are
monitored. It's not a slip.

105
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,506
Besides, opiates
weren't your thing.

106
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,552
They should've been. Whoa.

107
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,850
<i>Mr. Wiggen? The urine sample.</i>

108
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,984
I wanna say no, so I am—no.

109
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,725
<i>Trust is a big issue in early recovery.
He really did gain the weight honestly.</i>

110
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,697
If you say so.

111
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,566
You're not gettin' it.

112
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,035
He thinks I'm an idiot.

113
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,268
He sure does.

114
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,581
Should we save a sample?

115
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,352
Dr. Sports Fan can put it in
Lucite and hang it around his neck.

116
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,117
Hey, Friday night,
can you cover for me?

117
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,596
I think so.

118
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,567
Oh, Friday. No, I'm sorry. I have to
go to that oncology thing, the seminar.

119
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,001
Oh. What's goin' on?

120
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,005
Dinner with the drug rep.

121
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,007
Castine Pharmaceuticals.

122
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,841
Arnie? Claims he has 500
lawyer jokes, only tells one?

123
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,813
Uh... new guy.

124
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,076
You need cash?

125
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:44,114
No, I—I don't have
that much on me.

126
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,523
No, no, it's not a problem.

127
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,721
I'll be over by 6:00. Okay.

128
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,664
5:00 p.m. Dr. House checks out.

129
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,099
It's 4:45. I was rounding up.

130
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,036
Carol Moffatt. Please see
Dr. House in Exam One.

131
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,199
- Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Cathy.
- It's Carol.

132
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,369
Uh— Uh, trouble with the leg?

133
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,547
<i>- When's the wedding?
- This Saturday.</i>

134
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,696
Ooh. Not much time
to fit into that pretty

135
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,076
dress. And no time for
practical shoe shopping.

136
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,590
- You're running two miles a day
further than you should be.
- It hurts right here...

137
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,128
New shoes, less
miles, and ix-nay on the

138
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:19,835
afternoon Cokes. You're
gonna look beautiful.

139
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,727
- What's wrong with you?
- I can't get my contact lenses out.

140
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,322
Out of what? They're
not in your eyes.

141
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,562
- But they're red.
- That's because you're trying
to remove your corneas.

142
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,400
<i>What's wrong with you?</i> Uh,
lately, my wife has noticed that...

143
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,805
Yeah, yeah. Symptoms. We're
working on a personal best here.

144
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,936
U-Uh, numbness in my feet
and hands, uh, constipation...

145
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,210
And? Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable
talking about his private matters.

146
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,994
Well, neither would I if I was
having trouble controlling my pee-pee.

147
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,954
<i>You're a dentist.
Nitrous oxide poisoning.</i>

148
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,845
<i>Which means you're
either dipping into your own</i>

149
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,600
<i>supply or you got a
bad valve in the office.</i>

150
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,184
Laughing gas rehab's probably
more expensive than the plumber.

151
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,559
Meanwhile, get
yourself some B-12.

152
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,621
Who's left? <i>I can't see.</i>

153
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,999
No, I'm just screwin'
with you. It's a hangover.

154
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,827
<i>My English lit prof told
me he'd fail me next</i>

155
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,671
<i>time if I didn't show
up with a doctor's note.</i>

156
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,182
Well, make friends with the
dentist. He can give you a

157
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:13,703
note, and maybe a little
nitrous to take the edge off.

158
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,584
<i>Dr. House.</i>

159
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,586
He tested negative for steroids.

160
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,588
Elevated beta-2 proteins though.

161
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,489
Could be cancerous—
Amyloidosis or lymphoma.

162
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,459
Or steroids. You guys
got any money on you?

163
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,462
He tested negative for steroids.

164
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,691
I have a couple 20s
on me. Fifty of 'em?

165
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,423
Foreman? The fat-pad
biopsy and abdominal C.T.

166
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,896
scan were negative
for the cancers, but...

167
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,439
That just leaves
us with steroids.

168
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,498
He tested negative for steroids.

169
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,134
Less money is made by biochemists
working on a cure for cancer...

170
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,306
than by their colleagues struggling
valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use.

171
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,874
But there is one
thing they can't hide.

172
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,554
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

173
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,927
And this is the
coolest day of my life.

174
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,036
See? Steroid use
shrinks the testicles.

175
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,242
I'm clean, man. No
steroids, no nothin'.

176
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,905
Your lips say no,
your prunes say yes.

177
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,847
Hypogonadism. Isn't
that a great word?

178
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:27,012
Thanks. We don't get to say it nearly
enough. Start him on Lupron right away.

179
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,355
These freaks are willing to defile
themselves for mass entertainment.

180
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,328
For money. I feel
sorry for them.

181
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,956
He drops a clean urine,
denies using steroids.

182
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,196
And you're giving him a
drug for what, steroid abuse?

183
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,534
No, no, it's not.
It's got calcium in it.

184
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,972
It's very good for the bones.

185
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,203
Basically, at a molecular
level, it's just milk.

186
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,467
<i>Dr. Whitman to</i>

187
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:55,024
<i>Anesthesiology.
Dr. Whitman, Anesthesiology.</i>

188
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,882
How long do you figure
before I get a call from Cuddy?

189
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,819
<i>- You put him on Lupron?</i>
- Uh-huh.

190
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,152
- And you told them it was like milk.
- Yes.

191
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,284
Is there any way in
which that is not a lie?

192
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,519
It's creamy.

193
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,758
- But I had three reasons.
- Good ones?

194
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,165
<i>Well, we'll see in a minute.
I'm just making them up now.</i>

195
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,831
- He lied to me first.
- Your mother did teach you
two wrongs don't make a right.

196
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,855
<i>If he lies to me about
not taking steroids, and I</i>

197
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,933
<i>lie to him about not
treating steroids, he's cured.</i>

198
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,807
<i>Adds up for me.</i> Second reason.

199
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,158
If I told him the truth, he
wouldn't have taken the stuff.

200
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,183
And if he told you the truth,
what would the stuff do to him?

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,617
- Severe respiratory problems.
- Third reason?

202
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,314
I wanted to eliminate
the placebo effect.

203
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,482
Excellent.

204
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,356
You and your lawyer
can write a paper.

205
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,658
Which brings me to my fourth reason. I
thought you said there were only three.

206
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,029
- I thought you'd buy one of 'em.
- Seriously?

207
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,658
He's not gonna sue.

208
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,703
Because his lawyer
is a nice guy...

209
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,036
who'll realize it's unfair to blame us
for ruining this kid's $100 million career.

210
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,042
Good guess, but no.

211
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,103
If the Lupron causes respiratory
problems, it means he's not on steroids.

212
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,479
<i>Which means there's
something else wrong with him.</i>

213
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,212
<i>And the choices for
that something else...</i>

214
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,688
are almost universally very bad.

215
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,770
<i>Osteopenia,
messing his bones up.</i>

216
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,375
<i>Hypogonadism, impaired
liver function, kidney function.</i>

217
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:42,047
And we have managed to find the
only professional athlete in the galaxy...

218
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,181
who is not on steroids.

219
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,192
And it's not cancer.

220
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,194
So what's killing him?

221
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,288
Who shares my suspicions that the
Yankees were somehow involved?

222
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,267
<i>Shrunken testicles indicate his body's
not putting out enough testosterone.</i>

223
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,625
<i>Throw out the lungs.
That was the Lupron— my</i>

224
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,069
<i>fault. Don't worry. I'll
send him a nice note.</i>

225
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,450
What about something
environmental?

226
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,943
Arsenic, mercury. The
symptoms could indicate...

227
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,673
Pretty small environment.
Wife's fine, no one else is sick.

228
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,341
<i>If you throw out the kidneys,
everything else adds up.</i>

229
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,907
The testicles, the bones,
the impaired liver function...

230
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,681
could all be caused by a
breakdown of his adrenal glands.

231
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,916
Addison's disease. I like it.

232
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,924
Mainly, of course,
because the treatment is...

233
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,189
- Steroids.
- Enough irony for all of us.

234
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,901
Treatment would
cause him to retain fluid.

235
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,061
- With the kidneys almost
shut down already, he'll die.
- So we'll get him a new kidney.

236
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,332
<i>Your theory is that Addison's
is causing all the symptoms...</i>

237
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,396
except for the kidney problems.

238
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,808
- What's causing the kidney problems?
- Cameron, if you had to make
an ironic guess right about now...

239
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,312
He tested negative for steroids.

240
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,872
Agreed. He's not
on steroids now.

241
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,904
But if he was on them
at any time in the last five

242
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:46,749
years, it could have
caused the kidney damage.

243
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,784
You see, kidneys
don't wear watches.

244
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:57,320
Sure, gall bladders do, but it doesn't
matter, 'cause kidneys can't tell time.

245
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,591
Steroid damage could take years.

246
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,898
No steroids. How many
times does he have to tell you?

247
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,836
I don't know.

248
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,884
How many times did he lie about cocaine
before coming clean with the league?

249
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,810
- That's completely different.
- Oh, that's right, I remember.

250
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:16,839
You never did come clean. The league was
out to get you. They faked the blood tests.

251
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,851
<i>You had to get yourself
a lawyer and everything.</i>

252
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,548
If Hank says he never
used steroids, that's the truth.

253
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:28,289
<i>That's too bad, because our theory is
that the kidney damage is caused by "A,"</i>

254
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,296
and everything else
is caused by "B."

255
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,333
The beauty of this theory is
that we can treat "A" and "B."

256
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,858
But if you add the kidney
symptoms back into the mix,

257
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,804
then we are looking at
another letter altogether,

258
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,807
one that is apparently
not in the alphabet.

259
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:46,471
We can't fix the bones, no
more baseball, no more breathing,

260
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,481
no more brain function.

261
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,118
<i>Get another explanation.</i>

262
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,678
<i>Okay. Yeah, I think I
got one in my other pants.</i>

263
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,156
Hold on.

264
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,396
Five years ago. Bangor, Maine.

265
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,565
<i>My pitching coach had me on
something. I never knew what it was.</i>

266
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,368
And you never tried too
hard to find out either.

267
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,304
I gained twelve pounds of
muscle in, like, four weeks.

268
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,207
I'm sorry, baby.

269
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,905
Huh?

270
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,477
How ya doin', Doc?
Good. Very good, yeah.

271
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,356
You want me to put Hank
Wiggen on the transplant list.

272
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,592
<i>He needs a new kidney. I was thinking
the kidney people might have some.</i>

273
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,568
They like to save them for people who
have— How do I put this? Kidney problems.

274
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,504
<i>He's a professional ball
player. Brings joy to millions.</i>

275
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,736
Do you really want to be known as
the hospital that sent him home to die?

276
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,177
That's a great idea. We could be
the hospital that killed two people...

277
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,739
The guy who deserved the kidney, and
the ball player we bumped up the list...

278
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,776
<i>when we weren't even sure
what was wrong with him.</i>

279
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,548
Everything else is
related to the Addison's.

280
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,851
The test for Addison's
was inconclusive.

281
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,721
The test for Addison's
is always inconclusive.

282
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,386
Why do we do it at all?
We should just ask you.

283
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,435
You're not putting
him on the list.

284
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,131
Your powers of
deduction are breathtaking.

285
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,040
- You take a perverse pleasure
in turning me down.
- What I live for.

286
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:29,982
Once in a while, though, try to ruin my
day— ask me something I can say “Yes" to.

287
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:50,636
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor. I didn't know
you were busy. Want me to come back?

288
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,935
- Is he on the list?
- No.

289
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,306
- Then I'm giving him one of mine.
- Okay.

290
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,992
You're not gonna tell me
it's a bad idea? Why give

291
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:00,722
a kidney to someone who
might not be able to use it?

292
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,409
Not my area.

293
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,474
That is, however, my chair.

294
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,621
When do we do it?

295
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,953
Very noble gesture.

296
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,790
My favorite kind. Dramatic,
yet completely empty.

297
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,988
The chances of nonidentical
twins being a match...

298
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,998
You live alone?
You writing a book?

299
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:22,126
I made it a question just
'cause it's more polite.

300
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,534
You got a big "keep out"
sign stapled on your forehead.

301
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,199
That explains it. I told
'em to put it on my door.

302
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:32,541
Even if real human contact is something
you don't have or even want or need,

303
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,843
you should at least be
able to see it in other people.

304
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,382
Yeah. Right.

305
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,783
True love—that's just how
we match organs these days.

306
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,516
There's a couple in France— high
school sweethearts— they're trading brains.

307
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,454
We're a match. Run your tests.

308
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,410
Hey. The lab call?
Is she a match?

309
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,412
Haven't heard yet.

310
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,916
You got a text message,
though. "Friday night." Very cryptic.

311
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,884
Gee, thanks for checking.
Can you cover for me?

312
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,285
Oncology seminar. Right.

313
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,017
Friday night the same
thing as the car trouble?

314
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,922
I had car trouble.

315
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,791
House says you were
lying. I believe him.

316
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,560
What's that? You got a little wet
smudge at the end of your nose.

317
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,261
Hey, I like the guy. He says what
he wants, does what he wants.

318
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,930
He won't talk to anyone
unless he can jerk them around.

319
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,769
Or needs a thousand
bucks. What is with that?

320
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,934
I scored.

321
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,006
It's a brave new world, Doc,

322
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,311
and we are the cutting edge.

323
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,448
You are looking at
two all-access passes...

324
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,252
to paradise itself.

325
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,360
How much? True
cost? No man can say.

326
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,523
Could that man's accountant say?

327
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,862
One thousand dollars. Whew.

328
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,961
Friday night. The biggest official monster
truck jam in the history of New Jersey.

329
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,399
Okay, please tell me you
didn't just say Friday night.

330
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,445
Whatever you've got, you cancel.

331
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,413
I can't do it. They only
give these tickets to owners.

332
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,918
Anytime we wanna be in the middle of the
track, we're in the middle of the track.

333
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,785
These tickets are so good,
we have to sign a release.

334
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,415
I mean it. We do
this, we could die.

335
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,984
I've got the
oncology thing. I—I...

336
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,930
The rectal cancer lecture— they booked
me a year ago. I-I-I-I-I can't get out.

337
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,990
There's no way out.

338
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,403
Fine. I'll ask one
of my other friends.

339
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,566
Huh.

340
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,334
What? You're saying
I've only got one friend?

341
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,439
Uh... and wh-who...

342
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,252
Kevin in Bookkeeping.

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,118
Okay, well, first of
all, his name's Carl.

344
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,248
I call him Kevin.

345
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,021
It's his secret
friendship club name.

346
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,929
- It's hookers.
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

347
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,957
Multiple hookers. But House is House. He's
gotta have it his way. Four or five women.

348
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,300
This isn't even funny. What?
You don't think he has sex?

349
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,864
- No, of course he— - He
doesn't have sex, he makes love.

350
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,876
I didn't say that.

351
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,311
It's the lab.

352
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,111
Dr. Foreman.

353
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,154
<i>Respiratory Therapy, call 4702.</i>

354
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,621
<i>Respiratory Therapy,
pick up 4702.</i>

355
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,109
If you have the results,
I'd like you to talk to

356
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,627
both of us. If you don't,
I'm late for a meeting.

357
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,153
Believe me. I'd much
rather be with your better half.

358
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,066
And by better half, I mean the one who
struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches...

359
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,502
and talks a lot less.

360
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:49,508
But I thought I would
talk to you first and alone.

361
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,739
I got your results
back from the lab.

362
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,008
You do match.

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,242
I—I do?

364
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,053
You're also pregnant.

365
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,830
You can't be a donor.

366
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,996
<i>Not in your current condition.</i>

367
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,147
Um... excuse me.

368
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,654
I have to go talk to my husband.

369
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,539
Heart looks good. We
can schedule the transplant.

370
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,376
No transplant.

371
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,814
Lola's not gonna
have an abortion.

372
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:07,479
Actually, your wife just told me
that she was making an appointment.

373
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,749
I don't care what she said.

374
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,485
I think you two need
to discuss this further.

375
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,585
We've been trying to get
pregnant almost since we met.

376
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,722
Well, it's your wife's
decision whether or not...

377
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,824
She wants to trade a child
for a kidney. That's murder.

378
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,893
I'm not gonna let her do that.

379
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,842
Foreman says we've got a
problem about the transplant.

380
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,779
If she terminates the pregnancy, he's
not gonna let himself die on principle.

381
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,783
Would you give up a
baby for someone you love?

382
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,449
Please tell me I
don't have to decide.

383
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,582
It depends. How
long would they live?

384
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,924
This is a pragmatic
question for you?

385
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,929
Fifty years, no problem.

386
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,431
Six months, I say let him die.

387
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,085
I've actually given this a
lot of thought. My personal

388
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,767
tipping point is seven years,
eight months and 14 days.

389
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,430
I couldn't do it.

390
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,441
You found religion?

391
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:06,188
- Do you have to be religious
to believe a fetus is a life?
- There seems to be a correlation.

392
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,380
I'm, uh...

393
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,516
Do you like monster trucks?

394
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,988
- I don't know what they are.
- Right.

395
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,164
I got two tickets. Friday night.

396
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,038
- You asking me to go with you?
- Sure. Sounds good.

397
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,837
Like a date?

398
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,901
Exactly.

399
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,970
Except for the—the date part.

400
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,012
Forget it.

401
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:49,818
Uh, no, I—I was gonna
go to the oncology dinner.

402
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:53,256
Of course. You have
to hear Wilson's lecture.

403
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,318
No. I just found out he
canceled, like, two weeks ago.

404
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,269
<i>So... what do I wear?</i>

405
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,937
Still with us, Hank?
Yeah. I'm here.

406
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,445
My chest feels funny.

407
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,243
Tachycardia. Your
heart's beating too fast.

408
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,875
We're sorting it out. But
you stay with us, all right?

409
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,186
- Keep talking to us, Hank!
- Where's Lola?

410
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,782
Ten units of insulin
sub-Q, an I.V. push D-50.

411
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,293
- Why's his potassium up?
- Damned if I know.

412
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,875
Kayexalate too. We
gotta suck that potassium

413
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:31,473
out of him. We gotta
get his heart rate down.

414
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,591
- We need a crash cart!
<i>- You got it.</i>

415
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,627
- It's definitely not Addison's.
- It's not steroids either.

416
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,038
Set. Help in here, please!

417
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:46,670
His heart rate is 130 and rising
like a Randy Johnson line drive.

418
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,782
"A" for effort. There's no
point in doing the transplant.

419
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,018
Even if he was stable
enough, it's obvious

420
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,287
that we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

421
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:59,052
First it's too high.
Now it's too low?

422
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,826
<i>His heart's not
responding to the atropine.</i>

423
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,957
<i>Heart rate's down to
40.</i> I thought it was up.

424
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,467
Now it's down. Last
time he went out at 35.

425
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,334
- What's wrong?
- I have no idea.

426
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,505
<i>Hit him with the atropine
before he gets to 35 again.</i>

427
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,971
<i>We've already given
him three milliliters.</i>

428
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,140
<i>Apparently that's not enough.</i>

429
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,084
<i>We can't stabilize
his heart rate.</i>

430
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,086
<i>What did you do
to him?</i> Kayexalate.

431
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,146
His pulse was through the
roof. So was his potassium.

432
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,625
- It wouldn't do this.
- Something did.

433
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,428
Call me when he's
stable. Or dead.

434
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,508
I remember the first time.

435
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,545
You weren't even supposed
to be pitching that day.

436
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,051
I'd flown all the way to
Tokyo to watch this kid,

437
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,181
and he gets tossed for
arguing a call in the first inning.

438
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,986
Ah, your pitches—perfect.

439
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,898
Ball seemed to go
faster than your arm.

440
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:18,995
It was like the rules didn't apply,
like physics couldn't slow you down.

441
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,269
Hot damn, it was beautiful.

442
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,473
Hey, Warner.

443
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,913
Hey, kid. How ya feelin'?

444
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,544
I hurt.

445
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,749
My arm, my head, everywhere.

446
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,688
They must've dialed
down the morphine.

447
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,753
That's just wrong,
man. You're in pain.

448
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,199
Hey, I got somethin' for ya.

449
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,364
No.

450
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,636
A doc in St. Louis gave
'em to me for migraine.

451
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,577
I'm an addict. I can't take that. Even
Lola was okay with the morphine.

452
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,275
This stuff's just
a little stronger.

453
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,340
Come on.

454
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,358
I'll just try one, Warner.

455
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,194
<i>Dr. Mulvaney, please
call extension 6 134.</i>

456
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,392
<i>Dr. Mulvaney, please
call extension 6 134.</i>

457
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,799
Three more symptoms.

458
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,566
Heart rate up. Heart rate down.

459
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,608
<i>Now he's hallucinating.</i> You
gotta promise not to tell Lola.

460
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,545
Okay, coach? He's
not just dreaming?

461
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,980
No R.E.M. He's actually awake.

462
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,575
Drugs? Not psychedelics.

463
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,177
Not with the heart symptoms.

464
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:46,658
Well, hallucinations would point to
digitalis. It would also mess up his heart.

465
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,990
But he's not on it.

466
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,690
And why would he take it?

467
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,764
Yeah.

468
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,927
Pithy analysis.

469
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,938
I can see why they asked you
to speak at the cancer dinner.

470
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,201
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.

471
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,470
I'm sorry about
the monster trucks.

472
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,638
No, I think it's great.
You're giving back.

473
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,515
Only thing is...

474
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,578
uh, digitalis,

475
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,888
it would only explain
the later symptoms,

476
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,951
not the original ones.

477
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,572
Sure, you know, it's
got a lot of movement.

478
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,576
Problem is, everybody
sees the movement.

479
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,045
You're throwin' your curveball like
you're—you're throwin' a curveball.

480
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,709
Deception. That's the...

481
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,718
Same motion.

482
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,721
Less movement, but it
won't come back at you.

483
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,781
<i>All right, outfielders
move in! Right there!</i>

484
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,524
How'd you get in here?

485
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:01,192
Spoke Spanish. Told them I was
the new shortstop from the Dominican.

486
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,963
How's Hank doin'? Lousy.

487
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:11,003
Around your fingernails, that
swelling, it's called clubbing.

488
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,069
Hippocrates noticed that a lot
of his friends who also had that...

489
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,809
tended to frequently
grab their chests and die.

490
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:19,977
Yeah, I got a heart condition.
What's wrong with Hank?

491
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,317
What do you take
for it? Digitalis.

492
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,379
Got 'em with you?

493
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,693
Huh. Well, that's weird.

494
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,856
I just filled this prescription a couple
days ago. There's another bottle here.

495
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,991
Don't bother.

496
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,901
Hank Wiggen stole your pills.

497
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,835
He tried to kill himself.

498
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,480
So what happened?

499
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,861
He left the bottle open while
he went to get some water?

500
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,863
Next time, just take
the whole bottle.

501
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,595
Hey, man, you got no right.

502
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,501
See, people remember
how many they've got.

503
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,098
Date's right on the label, number of
pills— regular person can do the math.

504
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,136
But a junkie doesn't have
to, because how many

505
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,406
pills he's got left, that's
all he's thinking about.

506
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,414
Big insurance policy?

507
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,118
- This isn't about the money.
- Not for you, no.

508
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:32,419
Most reputable stores won't
cash your checks after you're dead.

509
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:36,223
But for Lola, well, girls like
that, they're all about the money.

510
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,422
Don't you say that.

511
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,262
She already saved my life.

512
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,735
I was dead in Japan. She brought me
back. Everything since then, that's gravy.

513
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,601
That's more than I deserve.

514
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,606
You owe her? Everything.

515
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,733
Ah. So the attempted suicide,

516
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,837
the scaring her to death—
What is that? That's gratitude?

517
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,779
Love?

518
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,874
Yeah, I get that.

519
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,921
Well, take out what you
did to yourself yesterday...

520
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,286
We're back to the
kidneys and the bones.

521
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,959
I'm scheduling the transplant.

522
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,194
Never visit a patient.

523
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,862
I want that baby!

524
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,839
Even if I'm gone, that's
a piece of me and Lola...

525
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,706
breathing, walking around town,

526
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,768
<i>goin' to baseball games.</i>

527
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:32,478
If there's any more transplant
talk from you, Lola, or anybody else,

528
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,977
I won't screw it up this time.

529
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,046
I'll take myself out for good.

530
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,002
I'll start treating the
Addison's, which will

531
00:32:44,026 --> 00:32:46,622
most likely destroy
what's left of your kidneys.

532
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,327
<i>Fine. Start the treatment.</i>

533
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,966
Hey.

534
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,647
What— Hank Wiggen peed on me.

535
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,513
What do you think these
pants are worth on eBay?

536
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:08,986
I've got some big boy diapers in my
office. The rep hands 'em out like candy.

537
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:12,388
Is it that bad? No, not if
you like the smell of urine.

538
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:16,451
Of course, why should I trust someone who
lies about what he's doing Friday night?

539
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:20,999
Question is, what are you
<i>really</i> doing Friday night?

540
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:25,128
Or more to the point, what could
possibly be better than monster trucks?

541
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,195
Or are we breaking up?

542
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,559
Stacy's coming into
town this weekend.

543
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,561
We're having dinner.

544
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,620
Just catching up.

545
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,057
I definitely had pants here.

546
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,932
Wait a second. Is
that Stacy the stripper?

547
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,938
I heard she's
playing Atlantic City.

548
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:04,306
No, Stacy the
constitutional lawyer.

549
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,438
You thought I couldn't
handle this news.

550
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,375
You talk to her a lot?

551
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,684
No, it's been a long time.

552
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,754
- If you don't want me to see her— -
What is this, eighth grade? I'm fine.

553
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,764
It's fine if you're upset.

554
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,732
No, it's...

555
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,970
I have no right to be upset.

556
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,166
You two were friends.

557
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,104
You should see her.

558
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,170
Say hi for me.

559
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,341
So, you're okay?

560
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,410
I'm not the cancer doctor who's
lying about the cancer dinner.

561
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,983
I'm not the one betraying all those
poor little bald-headed dying kids.

562
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,458
I'm gonna go get
some pants. I stink.

563
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,437
You're treating him for Addison's
and you don't think it's gonna work?

564
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,240
He tried to kill
himself. I know.

565
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:18,807
He's confused. We can have another
baby. I can make him understand that.

566
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,284
I'm having an abortion.
We do the transplant— No.

567
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,379
I can make decisions
about my body.

568
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,790
And he can make decisions about
his. He doesn't want your kidney.

569
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,492
So he'll die?

570
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,224
Probably.

571
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,879
If you keep that appointment,
he'll also probably die.

572
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,857
Keep the baby.

573
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,834
Are you just being polite?

574
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,682
My pants are...

575
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,685
Oh, they're all wet.

576
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,987
You can't smell that?

577
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,359
You think she'll abort
anyway, try to force his hand?

578
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,424
No, she's not gonna
risk losing him.

579
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,470
That's funny?

580
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:51,636
No, the monster trucks. House
asking you, that's—that's funny.

581
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,147
I was the first person he
ran into. He just asked me.

582
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,943
Yeah, like a date.

583
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,213
Exactly. Except
for the date part.

584
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,207
If the patient decides
to go the dialysis route,

585
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:10,560
we've got some product
you should check out.

586
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,792
Mmm. Hey, Dr. Foreman.

587
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:17,563
<i>Courtesy of the generous Sharon and
the good folks at Castine Pharmaceuticals.</i>

588
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,814
I was just telling the guys about
the Bermuda conference in April.

589
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,967
<i>Three days of sun and
scuba, and one hour of lecture.</i>

590
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,237
Oh, God, do we have
to go to the lecture?

591
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,280
<i>So, you're the new Arnie.</i>

592
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,910
Dr. House. It's good to see you.

593
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,317
Would you get me a
coffee? Black, no sugar.

594
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,356
Okay, so who is it?

595
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,456
Come on. She's
sleeping with one of you.

596
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,235
Oh, God, please
tell me it's you.

597
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,328
She buys lunches. She doesn't...

598
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,635
Don't worry. You're not
gay. You're adventurous.

599
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,369
<i>You think she's gonna prostitute herself?
The three of us are that important to her?</i>

600
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,311
I'm afraid not, no.

601
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,544
The groupies sleep with the
roadies in order to get to Mick.

602
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,815
And you're Mick? That was
the metaphor I was making, yes.

603
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,789
Why are you here?

604
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,883
Damn, it's you.

605
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:21,165
It's not Addison's. New
symptom. Inability to smell.

606
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,463
I was just in Hank's room.

607
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,972
He said it smelled like the men's
room at Veteran's Stadium. He was right.

608
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,383
We rejected environmental
causes because the wife was healthy.

609
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,400
Well, she's not. Last six
months, she can't smell a thing.

610
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:38,506
If you think of them as one single
patient, you add her symptoms to his...

611
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,075
Cadmium poisoning.

612
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,486
It explains everything. Even why they
had so much trouble getting pregnant.

613
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:47,048
How could they have gotten
exposed to that much cadmium?

614
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,027
Unless they were eating
steel and batteries for breakfast.

615
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,428
So, where else is cadmium?
Some foods, polluted groundwater.

616
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,491
<i>We should check their home.</i>
I think I know how it happened.

617
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,502
I'm gonna need
another urine sample.

618
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,734
What for? Sure.

619
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,241
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

620
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:07,006
Why wouldn't you give it to me
before, but now it's no problem?

621
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,913
- I'm dyin', right?
- So you've got nothing to lose this time.

622
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,720
Begs the question, what were
you worried about last time?

623
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,756
The funny thing is, when we tested you
before, we were just looking for steroids.

624
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,852
What should we
look for now, Hank?

625
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,865
Hank, what's the story?

626
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,032
A little weed every now and
then when no one was looking?

627
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,505
I don't believe this.

628
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,875
- We quit.
- You did.

629
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,676
If you'd kept going, you wouldn't
have just lost your sense of smell.

630
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,216
I quit the hard stuff.

631
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:51,149
- I just needed to relax.
- Based on the symptoms,
you're a lot more than a social user.

632
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,057
<i>So you've been lying to
me all this time?</i> I'm sorry.

633
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,585
<i>There must have been cadmium in
the soil where the marijuana was grown.</i>

634
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:03,931
Some people get bone loss, kidney
failure, some people's testes shrink,

635
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,461
<i>and some people lose
their sense of smell.</i>

636
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,336
We'll start
treatment right away.

637
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,138
You should be
fine by opening day.

638
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,577
Baseball's in the summer, right?

639
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,808
It didn't hurt the baby,
did it? The cadmium?

640
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,784
- If you've been clean,
the baby should be fine.
- Okay.

641
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:27,822
Please. I'll stop everything.
I'll—I'll go to meetings every day.

642
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,330
Lola.

643
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,191
Twice a day.

644
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,400
How's the ballplayer doing?

645
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,168
Much better. Too
bad about his career.

646
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,573
What do you mean?

647
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,720
Major League Baseball's
collective bargaining agreement...

648
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,236
requires medical
reports on all treatment.

649
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,909
Given Hank's history, he's
not likely to get much leniency.

650
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,919
Why should they care that
he's being treated for Addison's?

651
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,854
You're not treating him for
Addison's. My report says I am.

652
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,948
You're lying on the report?

653
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,960
Well, everybody
does stupid things.

654
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,462
It shouldn't cost them
everything they want in life.

655
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,990
No, it shouldn't,
but it usually does.

656
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:14,301
On the other hand, if it means
someone can actually beat the Yankees...

657
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,802
So what about House? Is there
any way we can get him down there?

658
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,847
You really wanna
talk about work?

659
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,946
No. Not at all.

660
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,444
That was amazing!

661
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,812
I'm telling you. Grave
Digger never disappoints.

662
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,546
You ever been married?

663
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,551
Well, now, let's not ruin a lovely
night out by getting personal.

664
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,055
I lived with
someone for a while.

665
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,960
You gonna finish that?

666
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,569
<i>I'll race you to the car.</i>

667
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,144
That's some bad hat, Harry.
