1
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:09,768
Grandma's got some
cash. We could steal that.

2
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,740
What kind of creep are you?

3
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,544
We steal from strangers.

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,482
Hey, Grandma's not
gonna call the cops.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,780
Look.

6
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:22,152
Either you start doing
this, or you get a job.

7
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,058
That guy.

8
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,430
You're gonna remember
that guy for the rest of your life.

9
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,340
Hey. How you doing?

10
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,979
I said... Hey, give
me all your cash!

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,681
Why?

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,016
You want to buy yourself a
pretty dress, you little bitch?

13
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,619
He ain't kidding, man.
Where's your wallet?

14
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:06,497
On your sister's nightstand.
I forgot it after I paid her.

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,230
Whoa, Tony... You
want to die tonight?

16
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,828
I said where's your wallet?

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,052
I think he's sick.
Maybe you shouldn't.

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,135
He's faking.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,305
Look, go in his
pockets. Grab his wallet.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,783
Good. Let's go.

21
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,158
You all right, man?

22
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,490
He's fine. He's faking it.

23
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,469
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at Maple and Fourth.

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,199
There's a really sick guy.
I think he got mugged.

25
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,708
What? Are you happy? Let's go!

26
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:30,648
Today, we're hunting for
the cat burglar of diseases.

27
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,210
Causes a healthy man's lungs
to fail, but leaves no fingerprints.

28
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,983
Respiratory distress,
could be asthma.

29
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,752
No hyperinflation on the x-ray.

30
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,020
Food allergy. Could have
eaten shellfish or peanuts.

31
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,221
No hives. No
erythema on the skin.

32
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,321
Pulmonary embolism.

33
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,027
Embolisms don't
magically dissolve.

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,159
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,430
Laryngospasm.

36
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,334
Frosty fall air hits
his vocal cords,

37
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,170
they spasm shut, choke him out.

38
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,040
Good idea. You've been
tremendously helpful.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,354
You can leave. I just hired him.

40
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,313
Well, I fired him. To infinity.

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,939
You didn't tell him
I was coming back?

42
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,415
She did. I said no.

43
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,783
When your extended job
interview slash reality TV show

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,877
killed a patient,

45
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,082
you lost your veto power.

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,954
Everybody, this is
Dr. Foreman. He will...

47
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,120
Does this mean there's
one less slot for us?

48
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,298
It's still Dr. House's
department.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,528
He decides who
stays, who goes...

50
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,661
Foreman goes.

51
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,868
But Dr. Foreman will
be my eyes and ears.

52
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,638
You do nothing
without his knowledge.

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,679
Oh!

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,246
Just in case I need them

55
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,649
where exactly will Dr. Foreman
be keeping my balls?

56
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,048
If you wanna keep your
jobs, that never happened.

57
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,958
The only way to get the cat
burglar is to catch him in the act.

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,120
Give the patient a
methacholine challenge.

59
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,721
See if it sets off laryngospasm.

60
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,041
You want us to
stop his breathing?

61
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,761
Well, only until you
can figure out why.

62
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,633
After that, it would
be irresponsible.

63
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,609
You and I should talk.

64
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,803
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,055
She didn't have
to do that publicly.

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,172
Yes, she did.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,240
She had to establish her dominance
in front of them. Limit my power.

68
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,184
There's nothing we can do.

69
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,154
Well, that's not the
never-say-never Dr. Foreman I know.

70
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,223
There's lots we can do.

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,314
Not really, Cuddy...

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,122
I can make you miserable.

73
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,355
That's true.

74
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,988
Until you quit. Again.

75
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,576
So, why don't we just
skip the middleman?

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,727
I'm not quitting.

77
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:32,671
My God. Not everything's about you
and your little job and your little world.

78
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,970
This is about restoring
order in the universe.

79
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,270
I'm not quitting.

80
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,040
You're gonna be miserable.

81
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,138
I already am miserable.

82
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,986
Cuddy obviously
thinks we're idiots.

83
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,991
She's not gonna let
House hire any one of us.

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,517
Tidal volume's holding at
1.2 liters. Increase the dose.

85
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,927
So, which master do we serve?

86
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,828
Whose ass do we have
to kiss to get this job?

87
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,095
You really want this job so bad?

88
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,160
How about you
try doing this job?

89
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,933
Double the dose to 16
milligrams per milliliter.

90
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,399
My foot's tingling.

91
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,001
Is that normal?

92
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,807
No. What exactly does it...

93
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,280
And my stomach's killing me.

94
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,715
Could this test
cause that stuff?

95
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,877
No.

96
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:23,883
Test was a bust.

97
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,858
Amber has moved
down to even money.

98
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,622
We found two new symptoms.

99
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,458
Yep. Back to two to one.

100
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,532
What's going on?
You're the favorite.

101
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,624
House's? To get fired.

102
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,936
You can bet against
yourself. Lovely parting gift.

103
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,028
What's the limit?

104
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,129
Isn't one.

105
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,470
Five hundred on Kutner.

106
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,373
A thousand on Amber.

107
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,244
Do you take checks?

108
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,405
No.

109
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,977
How do we connect abdominal
pain and numbness in the extremities

110
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,316
with respiratory collapse?

111
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,448
Dissecting aortic aneurysm.

112
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,084
Doesn't cover all
three. What else?

113
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,158
Carry on. He's the boss.

114
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,839
What about a spinal cord lesion?

115
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,115
Would have to be
in the brain stem.

116
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,483
It still doesn't
explain the lungs.

117
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,442
Weird, though.

118
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,875
That he's the boss.

119
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,675
Didn't he quit recently?
Was it a money issue?

120
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,408
Lungs, stomach, numbness...

121
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,848
No, that wasn't it.

122
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,510
It was something else.

123
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,318
Was it bling account? Med
plan didn't cover tattoo removal?

124
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,086
We have to unify these symptoms.

125
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,491
I remember.

126
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,496
You didn't want to
turn into me. Right?

127
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,361
You didn't want to become evil.

128
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,161
Can we stick to
the medicine, here?

129
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,292
Absolutely.

130
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,836
I'm just flattered.

131
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,841
In a few short weeks, seems like
I've just turned towards the light.

132
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,536
Either that, or
you sold your soul.

133
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,077
Multiple marantic
emboli could...

134
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,204
Did you get a raise?

135
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,576
Because then you're a whore.

136
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,480
Or didn't you? Because
then, you're a stupid whore.

137
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,854
Patient just crashed.

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,187
Can they go, boss?

139
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,067
You're right. But?

140
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,570
No but. You're
right about all of it.

141
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,436
Then, I'll see you
at the reunion.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,374
Seems I didn't get out
of here soon enough.

143
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,006
The world thinks I've been
corrupted, so no one will hire me.

144
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:32,849
I hate being here. I'd
love to quit, but I can't.

145
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,491
He's got a pulse.

146
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,812
Must be another
respiratory collapse.

147
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,447
Means this is our chance
to prove laryngospasm.

148
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,449
We need to tube him and bag
him. We will. Right after we...

149
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,151
If we just let him die, it
doesn't matter what he has.

150
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,953
Brennan, tilt his head back
so I can get a straight shot.

151
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,937
Okay. While you're killing
him, I'll get the intubation kit.

152
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,284
I decided you're right. You're
obviously in an impossible position.

153
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,187
There's no point in
me humiliating you.

154
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,280
Thanks.

155
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,792
So, I'm gonna humiliate Cuddy.

156
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,350
Until she fires you.

157
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,625
Guy's faking. It's Munchausen's.

158
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,598
You notice the EMT run sheet?

159
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,534
Paramedic who brought him
in is also named Martin Harris.

160
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,765
If the name was Attila
Von Weinerschnitzel,

161
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,120
I'd say you might
be onto something.

162
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,443
Look, room 406, abdominal pain,

163
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,143
room 403, left-sided
numbness, 402, syncope.

164
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,117
He's copying his
neighbors' symptoms.

165
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,550
No. Yeah.

166
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,321
Coincidence is much more likely
than you being a stubborn jerk.

167
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,762
Munchausen's patients
create symptoms, not names.

168
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,475
Munchausen's patients
have medical histories

169
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,991
they don't want us reading.

170
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,195
No laryngeal spasm.

171
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,533
Breathing's resumed normal
rate, without intubation.

172
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,402
You see? Nothing's
wrong with him.

173
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,339
He's in a lab coat.

174
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,077
Munchausens pretend
to be patients, not doctors.

175
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,847
He's got Mirror Syndrome.

176
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,545
Giovannini's?

177
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,679
Do you know another
Mirror Syndrome?

178
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,248
Brain's got no idea who he
is, where he is, what he is,

179
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,919
so it fills the holes with
whatever dirt's lying around.

180
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,327
He reads a name
tag, he's got a name.

181
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,492
Sees a doctor, he's got a job.
Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.

182
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,160
My explanation's simpler.

183
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,704
Well, if it's simple, then
we discharge the nutbar,

184
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,139
but if it's complicated, then
the nutbar has got brain damage.

185
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,972
So, we let him jerk them around
for a few days till we're sure?

186
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,445
No. We let him jerk you around.

187
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,216
There's a faster way.

188
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,922
Mind if we play through?

189
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,290
Sure. What could
possibly go wrong?

190
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,727
What's going on here, Martin?

191
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,429
Operation? House?

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,559
Who is this guy?

193
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,398
Excellent question.

194
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,439
Who are you, Martin?

195
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,439
He just likes to
watch and do stuff.

196
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,314
Number 10 scalpel
for initial incision.

197
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,676
Glad you're here, House.

198
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,585
Of course you are.

199
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,655
It's lecture time.

200
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,055
Yeah. It is.

201
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,685
Stop worrying
about the power play.

202
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,196
Was that it? I think you
can go a lot deeper, here.

203
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,029
I mean, why am I so
obsessed by all of this?

204
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,934
You're threatened by Foreman
and feel the need to impress Cuddy.

205
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,282
The only thing that's relevant
is Foreman is a good doctor.

206
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,365
He can help you.

207
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,340
Lighten the load. Good idea.

208
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,605
I'll have him sort my mail.

209
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,808
Sure.

210
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,013
Deflect.

211
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,783
Who is this guy?

212
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,151
I think we just found out.

213
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,656
It's all about Cuddy.

214
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,216
You've got to be the alpha dog.

215
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,160
You can almost smell
the pheromones now, huh?

216
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,697
I like him.

217
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,329
Told you I didn't
need you. House!

218
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,069
House, what is going on?

219
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,014
Ow!

220
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,021
Your blood's turned to sludge.

221
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,682
If we don't heat you
up, you're gonna die.

222
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,419
Can't fake that!

223
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,266
Mirror Syndrome patients
have no agenda, no ax to grind.

224
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,131
They can read you
because they have to.

225
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,706
Moods, attitudes, everything.
They're like mind readers.

226
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:47,950
Except they can read your mind.

227
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:48,998
Where are we going?

228
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,668
Unfortunately, we
have to cure him.

229
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,234
His hand wasn't
black when he came in.

230
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,803
The operating room was sterile.

231
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,520
Only thing different was the
temperature. Cold agglutinins means...

232
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,960
It's gotta be some
kind of infection.

233
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,317
No fever, so it's gotta be a
tiny infection, hard to find.

234
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,581
And you better find it fast.

235
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:06,615
This guy feels another cool breeze,
his blood turns to slop and he drops.

236
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,957
I need three ways
to pinpoint infection.

237
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,155
Blood cultures.

238
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,061
Blood's clumpy. Nothing
you can do with it.

239
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,430
Unless we soak him in
warm water before we draw it.

240
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,968
Good. What else?

241
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,163
Ultrasound his abdomen.
Look for an abscess.

242
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,570
Good. Ladies and gentlemen?

243
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,768
I have a regrettable
announcement.

244
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,901
Kitchen has just learned

245
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,776
that our annual shipment of
mayonnaise was improperly stored,

246
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,078
so anybody who
ate, well, the food

247
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,482
should head across the
lobby to the clinic right away.

248
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,178
Ask for Dr. Cuddy.

249
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,419
You're not punishing Cuddy.

250
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,133
You're punishing every
doctor in the building.

251
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,683
It's her building. Her
doctors. Still need one more.

252
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,904
Well, we need to
find out his history.

253
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,260
Where he's been, what he's done.

254
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,663
Yeah. He has no memory,
but his bio's tattooed to his rear?

255
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,759
The mayo is fine. You can
stay where you are. I'm a doctor.

256
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:54,001
Mail order. I've seen the diploma.
There's two N's in University.

257
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,440
Big Love was right.
History is the key.

258
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,471
No ID, no wallet, no missing
person's report filed for 100 miles...

259
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,039
The key is the key.

260
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,278
He had car keys in his
pocket when he was admitted.

261
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,496
Keep him in the isolation room

262
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,684
so he doesn't pick up Extreme Bitch
Syndrome from one of the nurses.

263
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,268
Run the ultrasound
and the blood cultures.

264
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,658
The cultures were my idea.

265
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,957
No one's keeping score.

266
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,190
You're losing.

267
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,392
Search the street where he was
mugged. Find the car and the registration.

268
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,526
There could be
thousands of cars.

269
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,812
Hey, why do I get
this assignment?

270
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,532
Because, if you
deal with the patient,

271
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,098
he's gonna wind up singing Osmond
songs and proposing to five nurses at once.

272
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,905
I'll go with Cole.

273
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,101
Ooh!

274
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,306
We have a love connection.

275
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,008
Make a fist.

276
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,878
Little pinch.

277
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,156
Wow. That's a strong pinch.

278
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,888
This thing works. You're
lucky you've got me.

279
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,261
My colleague wanted to
cook you in boiling water.

280
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,327
That's right, baby.
My blood's that good.

281
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,490
That's supposed to be me, right?

282
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,604
No.

283
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,614
That's me. I'm
always right. Gotta be.

284
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,758
I don't think I'm always...

285
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,720
If they don't like you, you've gotta
be right, or you're not worth anything.

286
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,894
Infections can hide
deep beneath the skin.

287
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,829
This will find them.

288
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,060
Who was that last doctor?

289
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,229
Dr. Amber Volakis.

290
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,467
Don't really need her name.

291
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,774
Wait. You saying that you...

292
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,175
I want her?

293
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,382
Don't know what you want.
Don't care what you want.

294
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,453
I'm married.

295
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,217
So am I.

296
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,318
Even if I wasn't, she's a
little too aggressive for me.

297
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,624
Hey.

298
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,495
Aggressive is never a bad thing.

299
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,331
Yeah. True.

300
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,578
I'm done.

301
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,007
You okay?

302
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,107
Yeah.

303
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,744
We've gotta run some more tests.

304
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,283
You can clean yourself up.

305
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,426
Lesion on the liver.

306
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,463
Cystic or solid? Solid.

307
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,090
Well, you certainly did the
right thing by coming to me.

308
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,226
Yes. I needed a
smug oncologist to...

309
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,667
An authoritative oncologist.

310
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,704
I hate you. Tell me why.

311
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,832
I've been scanning literature.
Very interesting study in Sweden.

312
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,708
Apparently, Giovannini's patients
mimic whoever they think's in charge.

313
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,146
Any country with that low an age of
consent and that high a rate of suicide

314
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,513
isn't thinking straight.

315
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,176
I am in charge of
our relationship.

316
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,619
It was a surgery. You were
the surgeon. In that setting...

317
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,852
You would pick up my
laundry if I asked you to.

318
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,119
Go ahead. Ask.

319
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,560
I wouldn't do that to you.

320
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,344
I want all my personal
private doctors back right now!

321
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,004
Except for Foreman.

322
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,877
Your team, Foreman included,

323
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,043
is dealing with the Great
Mayonnaise Panic of 2007.

324
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,884
Frankly, I'm worried it might
spread to other continents.

325
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,886
Lesion on the
liver. Possibility.

326
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,932
Why are you doing a
pelvic for food poisoning?

327
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,263
She said her hoo-hoo burned.

328
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,435
Lesion on the liver. Ideas?

329
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,100
Start with a biopsy
to rule out cancer.

330
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,474
Could be an abscess.

331
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,035
Needle works for that, too.

332
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,876
Well, unless it's a
vascular hemangioma.

333
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,007
Aspirate that, and he'll
bleed out, we'll kill him.

334
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,450
If he bleeds out, we
know what he had.

335
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,282
Had?

336
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,049
Two diagnoses out
of three, he lives.

337
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,852
We do nothing, three
out of three he dies.

338
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:05,948
Go stick his liver.

339
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,269
Where's Foreman? We should...

340
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,421
You need him to draft
your letter of resignation?

341
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,569
You risking our patient's
life to get back at Cuddy?

342
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,192
What? No. That
would be childish.

343
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,395
This is what I'm doing
to get back at Cuddy.

344
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:19,439
Who here doesn't have
any health insurance?

345
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,974
Michael Moore was right.

346
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:27,069
MRIs, PET scans, neuropsych tests,
private rooms for all these patients.

347
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,409
Fight the power!

348
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,783
Sorry. I missed.

349
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,983
I have to reposition the needle.

350
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,492
You're gonna feel another pinch.

351
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,191
You still with me?

352
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,561
I'm here.

353
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:47,825
You feeling faint?

354
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,924
No.

355
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,331
What's wrong?

356
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,803
It's personal.

357
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,808
You got personal problems?
You got no memory.

358
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,937
I'm in a hospital. I don't
want to be in a hospital.

359
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,743
You're sick, so...

360
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,083
I'm bored.

361
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,287
You ask what's wrong,
then you ignore the answer.

362
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,991
Just go on with
what you're doing.

363
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,826
You think everything's okay

364
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,633
as long as you don't think
about it, don't deal with it.

365
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,910
Is that blood?

366
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,174
I think it's pus from a fungus.

367
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,078
I have fungus in me?

368
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,982
If you've been in the
tropics in the last few months.

369
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,316
I saw this in tsunami survivors.

370
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,515
Their skin grafts would ooze
black pus sometimes weeks later.

371
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,288
Traced the fungus back to
the sand in the tsunami tides.

372
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,857
That's so cool.

373
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,265
I think the black pus is fungal.

374
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,861
If I'm right, that's where the
cold agglutinins are coming from.

375
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,099
That's what's driving
his memory loss.

376
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,701
Amber's putting him on
amphotericin. It will cure him.

377
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,109
This makes no sense.

378
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,739
I'm doing blood tests to be sure,
but the sooner we get him on...

379
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,910
I'm not talking
about the infection.

380
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,979
I'm talking about you letting Tonya
Harding administer the treatment.

381
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,820
I'm out of the game. Why?

382
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,951
A couple of weeks ago,
you named me Grumpy.

383
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,639
Said I didn't want to be here,
wanted to be back in the third world...

384
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,791
And you realized
I'm right just now?

385
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,027
I got a confirmation.

386
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,568
The patient's nuts.

387
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,696
The patient's unbiased.

388
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,273
The patient has no ax to grind.

389
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,206
The patient is nuts.

390
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,174
I miss my old life.

391
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,372
Helping people who
barely have clean water,

392
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,142
let alone the kind of medicines
we waste by the SUV-load.

393
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:48,244
You're nuts. You're gonna be
miserable at home, at work, somewhere.

394
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,823
The goal in life is not
to eliminate misery.

395
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,756
It's to keep misery
to the minimum.

396
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,827
Now, that's inspiring.

397
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,594
You said you came
back to get married.

398
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,029
What does your fiancée do?

399
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,498
She's a court reporter.

400
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,094
Uh-huh. Well, I'm sure Thailand
will have courts any day, now.

401
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,101
Someone's gonna be
miserable sometime. Accept it.

402
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,405
That's how I stay so happy.

403
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,175
Why do you care if I stay?

404
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,546
You're good.

405
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,249
Don't screw it up just
because you're miserable.

406
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:29,020
I'm gonna stay until
the patient's cured,

407
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,289
which should be
in about an hour.

408
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,565
You okay?

409
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,937
Not okay.

410
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,600
Which one of us is he mirroring?

411
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,976
Well, if it was you, he'd be
inflicting pain on someone else, so...

412
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,812
I'd say he's mimicking whichever
one of us happens to be dying.

413
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,201
<i>The heating blanket wasn't
keeping him warm enough.</i>

414
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,319
<i>Ordered a whirlpool,
got his blood flowing.</i>

415
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,952
So far, it's keeping
his rash at bay.

416
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,430
Rash worse equals
cold agglutinins worse.

417
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,058
Means what was in
his liver wasn't fungus.

418
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,227
Yeah. Labs confirmed...

419
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,429
That it wasn't even pus.

420
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,338
It was just coagulated blood
caused by the cold agglutinins.

421
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:19,106
Which you mistook for a cool
fungus that you saw after the tsunami.

422
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,323
Same consistency as... You
saw what you wanted to see.

423
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,009
Not what was there.

424
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,517
Wait a second. Didn't you quit?

425
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,076
I spoke to my
fiancée. I'm staying.

426
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,588
Of course you are.

427
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,419
Because you're the exact
right amount of miserable.

428
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,994
Broad spectrum
antibiotics aren't working.

429
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,086
It's got to be viral
or exotic bacteria.

430
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,836
There are a thousand
microbes it could be.

431
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,909
We could repeat all cultures.
Maybe we just missed it.

432
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,698
Or we could get
an accurate history.

433
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,079
We're working on it.

434
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,877
Well, that'll be good
solace to the Widow X.

435
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,713
His car was towed, and
the tow gate's locked.

436
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,877
Guys must be out on a run.

437
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,352
<i>That's why I sent two of you.</i>

438
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,889
One of you breaks
in, the other posts bail.

439
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,925
Getting arrested is not
what I'm worried about.

440
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,587
Not a problem. You know
how to kill dogs, right?

441
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,394
So, we're back to
repeating all the cultures.

442
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,938
Or we get an accurate history.

443
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,633
Didn't we just rule
out that possibility?

444
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,642
You guys ever heard
any of my metaphors, yet?

445
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:29,340
Well, come on. Sit on Grandpa's lap
as I tell you how infections are criminals.

446
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,442
The immune system's the police.
Seriously. Grumpy, get up here.

447
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,112
It will make us both happy.

448
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,385
Anyway, cops don't
just let crooks run free.

449
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,483
They keep
fingerprints, mug shots.

450
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:44,121
The immune system does the same
thing, only it calls them antibodies.

451
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,358
We find out what
diseases he's had in his life,

452
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,869
good chance that'll tell us
where he's been in his life.

453
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,632
Alice. Your turn
through the looking glass.

454
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,003
Draw blood and CSF.

455
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,042
Hey, guys.

456
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,443
I haven't signed off on this.

457
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:17,190
You seem like a good
guy, Cuddy seems decent,

458
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,356
House doesn't.

459
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,731
It means either you're
gonna give in, or Cuddy is.

460
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,395
Either way, I'm sorry.

461
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,141
Your boyfriend has
me at even odds.

462
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,242
So talk to him.

463
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,082
I did. He said he's just
responding to market forces.

464
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,213
He is. I got 100 on you.

465
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,189
What do you care what
other people are betting on?

466
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,525
If he's trying to screw with me

467
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,875
'cause he's jealous Cuddy
didn't ask him to take this job...

468
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,061
Right. You're figuring
he's jealous of your misery.

469
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,261
He's messed up enough to...

470
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,430
The problem is
you're not miserable.

471
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,337
Then House has been
wasting a lot of time.

472
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,899
You've been humiliated.
Treated like crap.

473
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,021
You have every right to
be miserable, but you're not.

474
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:11,040
Because even though this job is
insane, and House is insane, you like it.

475
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,448
You always have.

476
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,577
You know what's worse
than a sanctimonious speech?

477
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,713
A sanctimonious
speech that's dead wrong.

478
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,417
See?

479
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,459
You belong with House.

480
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,659
We're gonna use your spinal
fluid to tell us where you lived.

481
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,994
Cool.

482
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,662
Not really. It's a poor substitute
for an actual history and without...

483
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,466
Nah. It's cool.

484
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,476
Yes. It is.

485
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,505
I need you to stay as still
as possible. Ignore the pain.

486
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,172
Bring the pain.

487
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,217
I'm not a masochist.

488
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,481
Neither am I.

489
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,353
I know. But I was responding
to you responding to...

490
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,859
Never mind.

491
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,094
I just like experience. If
it's new, it's interesting.

492
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,427
Yeah? Not me.

493
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,900
I don't just like new,
I gotta have new.

494
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,199
If it's not there,
I make it there.

495
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,863
Really, I'm just easily bored.

496
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,771
There are 300 million
people in this country.

497
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,834
If I'm doing exactly what
everyone else is doing,

498
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,344
then who the hell am I?

499
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,346
You know what I mean?

500
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,577
We're just about finished.

501
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,345
I like hot tubs.

502
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,444
They're nice.

503
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,886
You don't knock?

504
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:33,524
Are you putting K-Y jelly
on his phone receiver?

505
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,123
An exploding
snake in his drawer?

506
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,395
No.

507
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,564
I'm replacing his Vicodin
stash with laxatives.

508
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,836
Don't. Don't stoop
to his level. Why?

509
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,209
Because he's suddenly
gonna realize he's no longer 14?

510
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,871
Either I take his
garbage forever,

511
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,575
or I give him a reason to stop.

512
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:55,347
You don't have to make him miserable.
Just make him think that he's won.

513
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,753
I'm not gonna fire Foreman.

514
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,189
I said think he's won.

515
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,592
Find some other way to soothe
his ego. The thing's big enough.

516
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,858
You must be able to
find some corner to polish.

517
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,732
Where were you two hours ago?

518
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,831
Where were you?

519
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,105
What do you have? High
titres to histoplasmosis.

520
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,977
Probably lived in
the Ohio River Valley.

521
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,177
Also weakly positive
on Coccidiomycosis.

522
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,413
Weak means older.

523
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,285
Means he moved to Ohio
from the San Joaquin Valley.

524
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,949
Or he happened
to visit California.

525
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,856
He's also positive
for Chagas' Disease.

526
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,395
Central America.

527
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,397
Or he kissed his
maid from El Salvador.

528
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,764
Or he sat next to someone from
Belize on a flight to Weehawken.

529
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,359
Or he ate lettuce
from Honduras. Yes.

530
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,905
You're right, buzzkill.
This tells us next to nothing.

531
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,807
But since that's on the something
side of nothing, I thought we'd go with it.

532
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,070
His rash is back.

533
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,978
The hot tub isn't hot enough
to keep his body warm.

534
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,948
So, we take his body out of the
picture. Let's hit him from the inside.

535
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,882
Lipopolysaccharide.

536
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,062
LPS won't just give him a fever.

537
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,098
He could hit 110. Fry his brain.

538
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,264
Or make him just
toasty enough to

539
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:16,625
keep his blood flowing
free, like my bowels.

540
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,294
You smell that?

541
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,269
It's not gonna get sweeter.

542
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,672
You nailed Brennan for
seeing what he wanted to see.

543
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,798
You're no different.

544
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:24,900
But you are.

545
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,536
You used to like this stuff.

546
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,810
You left here because you didn't
like what you were turning into.

547
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,025
Do you like who you are, now?

548
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,711
Do you like being
Cuddy's errand boy?

549
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,183
That was just a courtesy
flush. I'm not actually done.

550
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,304
You want to induce a fever?
Well, unless you're willing

551
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,695
to don a white T-shirt and
hop into the hot tub with him,

552
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,198
I need another way to
keep him warm or he dies.

553
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,428
You could maim
him. I could cure him.

554
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,629
I'm not letting you do it.

555
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,672
You gonna fire me?

556
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,867
No.

557
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,508
Wait a second. What
the hell was that?

558
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,608
You were won over
by my soaring rhetoric?

559
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,847
I basically just threatened
to hold my breath.

560
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,991
You never intended to stop me.

561
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,549
You just pretended to stop me,

562
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,527
so you could pretend
to fail to stop me,

563
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,893
so you could stroke my ego.

564
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,766
War doesn't end
until Foreman's gone.

565
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,632
Foreman's not going anywhere.

566
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,864
And

567
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,338
I know when my
Vicodin isn't Vicodin.

568
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:32,868
Do you know when your birth
control pills aren't birth control pills?

569
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,540
If we can keep your fever up,
we can get you back on dry land.

570
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,380
You feeling okay?

571
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,184
Surprisingly, yeah.

572
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,482
I feel pretty good.

573
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,425
That's not the way
fevers usually work.

574
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:53,590
Nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to work.

575
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,826
No kidding.

576
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,425
You're giving me a fever.

577
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,871
Doctors don't
give people fevers.

578
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,169
It was necessary to
keep your blood flowing.

579
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,504
Yeah.

580
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,072
It was necessary.

581
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,842
And that was all that mattered.

582
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,444
It's exciting, isn't it?

583
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,680
You're happy?

584
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,389
Why wouldn't I be?

585
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,262
Whoa. Hey. Hey. You with me?

586
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,466
I need help in here!

587
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,082
V-fib. We've got to shock
him. Get him out of the water.

588
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,106
How long's he been out?

589
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,233
Just a few seconds.

590
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,945
He's dry enough. Not yet.

591
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,212
Dry faster. Ten more seconds.

592
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,428
He'll get brain
damage. He needs...

593
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,114
Kutner, you... Wait!

594
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,247
He's dry enough. Clear.

595
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,362
It worked.

596
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,260
For one of them.

597
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,831
Cardiac arrest. We were able to
shock him back to normal sinus rhythm.

598
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,602
And Kutner nearly into a coma.

599
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:16,809
So, now, you've electrocuted
yourself and set a patient on fire.

600
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,680
I like the dedication.
Thank you.

601
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,377
It wasn't a compliment.
Yeah, it was.

602
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,045
The insult comes
now. You're insane!

603
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,385
You either have an aversion to
towels, or you want pain. I think both.

604
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,137
I'm thinking it goes
back to high school gym.

605
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:33,030
Anybody think we should discuss which
infection is causing the cold agglutinins

606
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,396
before they stop
his heart again?

607
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,025
Sure. Why not?

608
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,870
Until they find his car we
have to assume he's traveled

609
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,433
to Ohio, California, Central
America and possibly Weehawken.

610
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,221
Nothing on the blood
cultures. Do them again.

611
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,840
Quadruple run time.

612
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:53,374
We know the infection is
in his heart. We do a biopsy.

613
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,183
If we see polys, we've got
bacterial. Lymphs, we've got viral.

614
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,713
He just had a heart attack.
Ripping out a piece might kill him.

615
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,350
Yeah.

616
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,123
We biopsy his toe instead.

617
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,028
No. That's a terrible idea.

618
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:11,264
Won't tell us anything. Biopsy
his heart. Come on. I'll join you.

619
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,439
I got you a job.

620
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,645
Mount Zion Hospital in Boston.

621
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,483
They have a great
diagnostics department.

622
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,554
Gilchrist said he'd
take you, anyway.

623
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,818
That was very nice of you.

624
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,950
Oh, God. Does everything
have to be about you?

625
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,585
It's simple math.

626
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,539
I'm not gonna back down,
you're not gonna back down,

627
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,056
Cuddy's not gonna back down,
and no one's gonna be happy here.

628
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,262
And Cuddy's gonna
end up pregnant.

629
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,463
What?

630
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,596
It doesn't matter.

631
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,730
Are you saying...

632
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,401
What is you having sex
with... Starts Monday.

633
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,501
I could help you pack.

634
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,512
I don't want the job.

635
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,146
Why not? You're miserable.

636
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,983
Apparently not.

637
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,989
Well, you're gonna be.

638
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,324
Are you smiling?

639
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,452
No.

640
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,357
Do your own stupid biopsy.

641
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,171
His name's Robert Elliot.
He's from Hamilton, Ohio.

642
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,942
Here's everything he had in
his trunk and his glove box.

643
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,682
No need for the heart biopsy.

644
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,623
I now know exactly who
he is and what he has.

645
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,285
You saved his life. Really?

646
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,990
No, you idiot. It's VapoRub
and lunch receipts.

647
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,643
We have his name. We could find
his doctor, get his medical records...

648
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:52,297
It's 8:00 at night. The
biopsy will be faster.

649
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,171
Not fast enough to save
him, but that's hardly the point.

650
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,375
Thirteen.

651
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,549
Is your name Thirteen?

652
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,543
Why did you volunteer
to go streetwalking?

653
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,950
I thought I could help that way.

654
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,512
A black Mormon
could help that way.

655
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,889
There's no reason for
you to want to be there.

656
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,087
Which means there's a reason
you didn't want to be here.

657
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,721
Didn't want to
look in the mirror?

658
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:34,371
Hi. Cuddy called. She
needs you to iron her shirts.

659
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,176
We'll take over.

660
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,248
Go ahead.

661
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,083
Talk to him.

662
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,690
You might feel a little tug
when the catheter's in the heart.

663
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,223
Come on. Make
him feel comfortable.

664
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,031
I've done this procedure
dozens of times. It's completely...

665
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,470
My God.

666
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,209
You are incredibly hot.

667
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,346
I'm not here. Deal with her.

668
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,745
Are you an idiot?

669
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,476
Do you not think she's hot?

670
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,645
I'm not the alpha here.
She is. She's my boss.

671
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,585
The rash is back.

672
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,656
Increase the drip.

673
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:26,565
If you think that's
the right thing to do.

674
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,294
This is so frustrating.

675
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,662
I don't think that's me.

676
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,745
Hey.

677
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,280
Get in there. See
how he's doing.

678
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,940
You were just in there.

679
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,655
Apparently, it's impossible to
see anything else when I'm in there.

680
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,587
I'm a blinding white
hot light of power.

681
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,381
Got it. Pink. Good size.

682
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,926
Nice specimen.

683
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,394
I'm scared.

684
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,625
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

685
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,297
No.

686
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,996
No, it's not.

687
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,304
I'm not interested
in how he's doing.

688
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,868
I'm interested in
how she's doing.

689
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,380
So, get in there and
tell me how he's doing.

690
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,848
You think he'll mimic
her if I'm in there with her?

691
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,886
You're a powerful, dominating
man, but who knows?

692
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,615
So, I'm gonna get
fired before her? Yes.

693
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,056
You're gonna get fired right
now unless you get in there...

694
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,820
Nothing on the biopsy.

695
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,486
And how is he?

696
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,689
His fever's at 106...

697
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,061
I know.

698
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,723
But how is he?

699
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,594
Bitter? Sexually frustrated?

700
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,898
He's delightful.

701
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:42,371
Loves the smell of freshly baked
rhubarb pie and isn't afraid to love.

702
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,999
Also, his rash is coming back.

703
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,011
He needs the meds and the
tub. Just to keep him stable.

704
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,205
Fine. Soak him again.

705
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,009
He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.

706
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,016
No. You love hot tubs.

707
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,495
Find the rest of the gang. Tell
them to meet me at the lecture hall.

708
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,181
I hate hot tubs.

709
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,391
What did you say?

710
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,722
I hate... He likes.

711
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,489
Who else was in there?

712
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,532
No one.

713
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,090
You didn't think
to mention that?

714
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,194
The guy likes warm, swirling water.
Didn't know that was diagnostic.

715
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,103
It's not.

716
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,904
What it is, is that water hit
him, and he had a thought.

717
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,343
Not about you, but about him.

718
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,615
We need to splash him some more.

719
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,731
Do I know you?

720
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,602
You look familiar.

721
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,908
You, too.

722
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,807
My name's Robert Elliot.

723
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,378
I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.

724
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,321
Me, too.

725
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,220
What do you do?

726
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,726
Stuff.

727
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,094
Me, too.

728
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:20,096
What brings you to New Jersey?

729
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,163
Is it work or vacation?

730
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,274
Work.

731
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,880
What type of work?

732
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,385
I'm tired.

733
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,742
I eat out a lot. A
lot of restaurants.

734
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,477
The Knotty Pine,

735
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,351
Ritchies.

736
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,321
I know those places.

737
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,917
They're good, huh?

738
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,586
They're convenient.

739
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,857
For what?

740
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,126
They're on the road.

741
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,827
You on the road a lot?

742
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,166
No more than you, I suppose.

743
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,876
You ever use this stuff?

744
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,847
I use it all the time.

745
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,308
I use it all the time.

746
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,081
Yeah. I just said that.

747
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,391
You know, the cool thing about
this stuff is you can do a lot with it.

748
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,894
Soften your skin,
you can treat scrapes,

749
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,260
naughty stuff.

750
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,281
Why did you do that?

751
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,451
Because it doesn't
smell like dung.

752
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,885
You're saying
you like the smell?

753
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,330
Not really.

754
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,502
It just doesn't smell like dung.

755
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,533
Something else
does smell like dung?

756
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,007
Yeah.

757
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,269
Dung.

758
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,443
You guys ready?

759
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:51,587
Now is the time that you stare
at me in slack-jawed amazement.

760
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,682
He sells farm equipment.

761
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,594
See? Pig lagoons. Pig farms.

762
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,929
And as every child knows, where
you have pigs, you have pig poo.

763
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,095
But as very few children know,

764
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,765
where you have pig poo, you
have eperythrozoon infection.

765
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,605
We'll start him
on clarithromycin.

766
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:14,771
This time tomorrow he'll
be back to his old self.

767
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,474
Whoever that might be.

768
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,209
It can wait.

769
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,046
He has a temperature of 107.

770
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,110
It can wait 15 minutes.

771
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,181
You know where Cuddy is?

772
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,794
Hi. I'm the Dean of Medicine.

773
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:34,526
Hi. I'm the guy
who saved your life.

774
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,464
So, what if it's House?

775
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,628
Then I take the
job at Mount Zion.

776
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,035
There is no job at Mount Zion.

777
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,231
House said that...

778
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,400
Well, if House said
it, it must be true.

779
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:47,104
I can fire him. I can fire him
now. I can fire him tomorrow.

780
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,789
I don't even need a
reason. She doesn't fire me.

781
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,224
She never will fire me.
Because she needs...

782
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,739
He's a good doctor, that's all.

783
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,283
I respect his
expertise, and I...

784
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,649
She's hot for me. Always...

785
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,847
Shut up!

786
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,758
Well, that could have
been either of us.

787
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,260
You have great yabos.

788
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,267
That still could have
been either of us.

789
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,765
You lose.

790
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:19,537
Seriously. I have always thought my
breasts were one of my best features.

791
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,606
Damn.

792
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,683
You all suck.

793
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:38,552
The two of you took
14 hours to find a car.

794
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:43,862
You forgot to mention that a guy
with no memory had memories.

795
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:48,031
If you keep on thinking that
insane guys have hidden wisdom,

796
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,440
you're gonna wind up
shooting people on a subway.

797
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,069
Something. So,

798
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,416
which one of us sucks the most?

799
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,543
It's a tie. Between?

800
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,677
All of you.

801
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,221
We're all fired?

802
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,279
None of you are fired.

803
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,167
That was nice of you.

804
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,295
Sure.

805
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,032
Why didn't you fire anyone?

806
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,835
They're good doctors. Right.

807
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,341
Why didn't you let Brennan quit?

808
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,476
He's a good doctor.

809
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:27,638
Right.

810
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,111
By not letting anyone go,

811
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,912
you made six people happy
and one person happy and rich.

812
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:39,184
Chase won every one of those bets.
So either you're just really nice or...

813
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,452
What's your cut?

814
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,518
Fifty percent.

815
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,927
How bad do you
want to keep your job?

816
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,829
I'll keep my mouth shut.

817
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,858
Hey.

818
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:55,105
You actually do want
to stay, don't you?

819
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,039
I think I do.

820
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,043
Every one of those idiots got
some insight about themselves

821
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,135
from the pig salesman,

822
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,511
but not one of them
did anything about it.

823
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,051
People don't learn. They
don't change. But you did.

824
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,847
You're a freak.
