1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,303
Yeah, I said I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling too hot.

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,704
You're sneezing. You could
do that in a movie theater.

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,618
Yeah, and I'll be in a nice
soft chair when I collapse.

4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,769
I'm exhausted, babe.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,311
<i>Oh, come on.
We're gonna be late.</i>

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,176
Episode Four never
comes to the big screen.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,306
This is the pre-Lucasized
version, remember?

8
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,942
<i>None of that Greedo
shooting first crap.</i>

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,017
Go without me.

10
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,162
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,212
You love <i>Star Wars.</i>

12
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,482
Don't you?

13
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,717
Ben?

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,917
<i>Since when?</i>

15
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:28,326
Since just before I
started pretending I loved it.

16
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,557
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to be supportive.

17
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,532
Fine. I'll go alone.

18
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,306
Baby, I'm sorry. <i>Me, too.</i>

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,215
I'm so woozy I can hardly think.

20
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,344
We'll hang out at home.

21
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,819
No, you should go.

22
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,355
Did you just feel something?

23
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,722
Feel? Like what?

24
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,851
Is there an earthquake?
<i>In New Jersey?</i>

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,191
Oh, God. <i>What?</i>

26
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,255
I think I'm, like,
hallucinating.

27
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,104
Call 911.

28
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,457
Twenty-six year old female, gas
main exploded under her building,

29
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,427
she was pulled out of
the rubble after six hours.

30
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,837
Two surgeries for multiple
fractures and burns.

31
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,373
I'm thinking the broken bones

32
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,467
are a response to the
building falling on her head.

33
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,441
And the fever?

34
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,883
She's the only collapse victim
whose body temperature was...

35
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,681
Put her on antipyretics.

36
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,016
Already have. The
fever is holding at 104.

37
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,186
Fluctuating consciousness.

38
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,754
Can't take the case.
I don't have a team.

39
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,831
So hire a team.

40
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,663
What for? I don't have a case.

41
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,327
Have you even
interviewed anybody?

42
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,200
You test-drive a
car before you buy it.

43
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,671
You have sex before
you get married.

44
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,699
I can't hire a team based
on a 10-minute interview.

45
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,835
What if I don't like
having sex with them?

46
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,554
You've spent the last two
weeks doing absolutely nothing.

47
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,646
Concert is over.

48
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,886
In what twisted universe

49
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,053
does mastering Eddie Van Halen's
two-handed arpeggio technique

50
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,222
count as "absolutely nothing"?

51
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,823
Take the case, or you
will spend the next month

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,870
helping the collapse
team change bandages.

53
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,336
I diagnose her alone, by the end
of the day, you go away for a week.

54
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,841
Done.

55
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:14,854
It's not gonna work.

56
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,549
If he solves the
case, we cure the girl.

57
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,182
And prove he
doesn't need a team.

58
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,090
He's not gonna solve
the case. Not that fast.

59
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,025
Why not? Because
he needs a team.

60
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,139
And this will prove to him...

61
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,574
Wanna change his
mind about something?

62
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,194
You need a more convincing
argument than "you promised."

63
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,734
Fever?

64
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,639
Non-responsive to
antibiotics, antipyretics.

65
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,643
Fluctuating consciousness.

66
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,973
Go!

67
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,945
You talking to me?

68
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,782
Yes.

69
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,159
Imagine that the roof
of the storage closet

70
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,890
collapses on your
favorite floor buffer,

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,163
which then starts overheating.

72
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,865
Why would I have a
favorite floor buffer?

73
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,493
Okay.

74
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,004
Maybe the electrical
works got banged up in there

75
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,665
from stuff falling on it?

76
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,265
Hmm. Interesting.

77
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,938
Brain damage, leading to
hypothalamic dysregulation.

78
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,510
Nah.

79
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,135
If you're brought in covered in
rubble, it's all about the MRIs.

80
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,780
We'd have seen that. Come
on! Gotta earn that fiver.

81
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,483
Or stuff leaked in the
holes, messing it up.

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,822
Lacerations lead to
multiple portals for infection.

83
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,089
Bacterial would have
responded to the antibiotics.

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,960
It's too high for viral.

85
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,159
Parasites or fungus is possible.

86
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,859
Or maybe lupus?

87
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,940
My grandma has lupus.

88
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,802
Okay. Auto immune, I'll run a
lupus panel. Infection fits best.

89
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,677
A complete history
would be helpful,

90
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,909
which leads to the
worst part of the job,

91
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,484
dealing with the
floor buffer's family.

92
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,888
We talked every couple of weeks.

93
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,584
But Ben would
know better than I.

94
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,685
No farms, no travel
anywhere weird.

95
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,320
You get that, Dr. Buffer?

96
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,132
No travel, no farm.

97
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,829
The file says she was sick
before the building collapsed.

98
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,496
Yeah, I figured
it was just a cold.

99
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,834
Why, do you think it's related?

100
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,274
Her being sick and
her being sick? Often is.

101
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,107
She was unconscious
when I found her.

102
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,275
We'd been fighting.

103
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,509
I just want to...

104
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,347
Just tell me she's
gonna be okay.

105
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,410
I'm not even sure if
you're gonna be okay.

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,761
We're gonna make her all better.

107
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,430
Show off.

108
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,797
You ought to be nicer to people.

109
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,802
Where are we going?

110
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,600
You know how the laughter
of little children is infectious?

111
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,901
Well, parasites and
fungi are even more so.

112
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,453
We're gonna find out which one
is making her brain bubble over.

113
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,536
Where, the building?

114
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,103
EPA's doing that job
for us, they say it's clean.

115
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,412
Which means we're making a
pilgrimage to Castle Blackberry.

116
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,783
Her name's Bradberry. I
should've asked them for keys.

117
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,288
No need, I'm sure we can
find a large rock somewhere.

118
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,625
I'm not breaking into
somebody's house.

119
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,126
I got principles.

120
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,296
I got some loose change
here says you don't.

121
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,232
I'm not doing this

122
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,333
for less than $50.

123
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,578
Where's the restaurant?

124
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,943
What restaurant?

125
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,312
The one you said you
were taking me to for lunch?

126
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,680
Oh! Uh...

127
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,446
This one's homier.

128
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,245
Dibs on the cold pizza!

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,091
I'm sure it looked
easier on YouTube.

130
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,503
Oops!

131
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,543
Yeah. You don't need a team.

132
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,545
You can't even get
arrested without company.

133
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,674
You're right. Only one solution,
never replace them, ever.

134
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,317
Do you need help?

135
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,151
Yeah, yeah. Patronize
the poor cripple.

136
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,413
Ow.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,186
Let me get that. I got it.

138
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,887
Will you just let me get it?

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,992
I'll check the bedroom.

140
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,468
There's some interesting
mold on the windowsill here.

141
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,511
It's gonna take me a while.

142
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,638
I'll cover the bathroom.

143
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,646
She had a secret diary.

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,518
Is there any other kind?

145
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,386
What are you doing?

146
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,949
There's a sale on liquid Tide.

147
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,227
If you're broke,

148
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,040
I could lend you a tiny
bit of the money I owe you.

149
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,465
No, no. I wouldn't put
you in that position.

150
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,262
What does the diary say?

151
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,530
Basically a list of her
sexual encounters,

152
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,402
boys, girls, vibrating
appliances...

153
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,635
If it was, you'd be
quoting, not summarizing.

154
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,211
It's just a parade
of sad banalities.

155
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,305
"I can hardly get out
of bed. Feeling blue."

156
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,646
Then, three months ago, turns
into a parade of happy banalities.

157
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,778
"It's starting to turn the
corner. Job's looking up."

158
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,755
We can stop swabbing. Her
clichés are getting healthier.

159
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,556
Or she's less depressed.
Aren't there pills that do that?

160
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,993
Anti-depressants
don't cause fever.

161
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,521
Not on their own. But the ER didn't
know she was on MAO inhibitors,

162
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,592
so they gave her Demerol,
that's a nasty combo.

163
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,934
So, all you have to
do is convince this kid

164
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,996
that his girlfriend
had a secret doctor,

165
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,975
and a secret stash
and a secret life.

166
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,345
It's been a while since a patient
took a swing at you. Can I watch?

167
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,473
I only have to
convince the mother.

168
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,320
Actually, I don't have
to convince anyone.

169
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,624
This is total crap. If she was
seeing a psychiatrist, I'd know.

170
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,250
If she was on drugs, I'd know.

171
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,959
Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the
forms so we can start the dialysis.

172
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,295
But why anti-depressants?
I don't understand.

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,931
Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the
forms so we can start the dialysis.

174
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,096
Stop saying that.

175
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,869
Dr. Buffer, what is going
on? What aren't you telling us?

176
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,769
He's a janitor?

177
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,870
More significantly,
a blabbermouth.

178
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,608
House, shut up.

179
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:55,016
I am very sorry how Dr. House handled
this. It is completely unforgivable.

180
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,020
Except if he's right.
Dialysis will filter her blood.

181
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,356
There's nothing to filter.

182
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,855
Save her life.

183
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,226
She wasn't depressed.

184
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,391
I'm miserable around Ben.

185
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,640
Not me, I like
Ben. February 12th.

186
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,542
Either she's depressed or
she just thinks you're a jerk.

187
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,188
Neither suggests that
you should be the one

188
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,613
directing her medical treatment.

189
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,173
Does the diary say my
daughter's taking these drugs?

190
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,250
No, but medically...

191
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,809
Did you find drugs
in their home?

192
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,980
She's probably hiding
them in her purse.

193
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,219
I thought it'd be rude to go searching
under a thousand tons of rubble.

194
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,669
This was months
ago. We were in a fight.

195
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,870
It doesn't mean she's depressed

196
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,238
and it doesn't mean
she doesn't love me.

197
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,890
Fine. Maybe the
diary proves nothing.

198
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,229
On the other hand, half the
country's on anti-depressants

199
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,929
and it fits her
symptoms perfectly.

200
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,743
No ring on your daughter's finger
means you make the decisions.

201
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,206
I'm not sure that I know
her well enough anymore.

202
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,947
You really wanna risk her
life on how well he knows her?

203
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,596
Wilson, you idiot.

204
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,538
<i>Listen carefully, and
no one will get hurt.</i>

205
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,268
<i>You must follow
the instructions.</i>

206
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,913
Any attempt to contact the FBI or
other law enforcement agencies,

207
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,506
or Cuddy, will
be met with the...

208
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,613
And a large Coke, no ice.

209
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,847
Give it back. What happened?

210
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,319
Did someone kidnap your guitar,

211
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,195
a $12,000 1967
Flying V or something?

212
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,358
Where'd you hide it?

213
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,630
I'm flattered you would
consider me this bold and brilliant.

214
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,672
Yeah. It takes a...

215
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,003
It takes a criminal mastermind

216
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,169
to pull off a heist from an unlocked,
unguarded room down the hall.

217
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,270
What do you want?

218
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,975
Me? Nothing.

219
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,486
But I'm sure the kidnapper
wants whatever a kidnapper wants.

220
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,681
To see you interview five to seven
well-qualified fellowship candidates.

221
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,382
I don't need a team.

222
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,652
You were bouncing
ideas off a janitor.

223
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,285
And solved the case!

224
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,863
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.

225
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,029
If you can hear what
I'm saying, blink once.

226
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,386
You can't talk right now. You
have a tube down your throat.

227
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,676
And try not to move your head.
You've been in a terrible accident,

228
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,512
but it looks like you will
have no permanent injuries.

229
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,348
You've had a bad
fever, but it's gone now.

230
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,779
I've been here the whole time,
honey. Okay? I'm not leaving.

231
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,085
This is very important.

232
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,184
I need you to blink
one for yes, twice for no.

233
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,062
Were you seeing a psychiatrist?

234
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,498
Were you on MAO
inhibitors, the anti-depressant?

235
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,701
Megan, it's okay. It doesn't
matter, okay? I love you.

236
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,710
Honey? Honey, what's wrong?

237
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,054
Megan, are you all right?

238
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,189
What's happening?
Are we upsetting her?

239
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,333
Heart is beating too fast.
Get the family out of here.

240
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,475
Megan?

241
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,573
Megan! Charging to 200.

242
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,550
Meg. Meg! Megan!

243
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,346
Clear!

244
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,131
We shocked her back into sinus
rhythm, but she's still tachycardic.

245
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,262
Fascinating. Equally
fascinating is, why are you here?

246
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,363
I was gonna leave you
alone if you won the bet.

247
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,533
But you lost.

248
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,941
I explained the fever, which
is all we were talking about.

249
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,805
She confirmed the
anti-depressants.

250
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,292
Go bet with someone else if you
wanna explain the heart problems.

251
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,875
She confirmed them by winking.

252
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,631
Maybe there was a
cute guy across the room.

253
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,349
She got better when I treated
her. Even I'm not that cute.

254
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,551
Two unrelated symptoms.
Just a coincidence?

255
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,116
Or you're grasping at straws

256
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,218
to avoid admitting you
can't do this on your own.

257
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,593
Fine.

258
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,497
What explains the fever
and persistent tachycardia?

259
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,159
It could be anything.
Endocarditis?

260
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,100
No. Fever, no infection.

261
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,640
Um... Keep going,
you're doing great.

262
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,569
You win.

263
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,458
I don't believe you. I'm
not gonna play this game.

264
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,314
Just give me the damn résumés.

265
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,020
And my guitar.

266
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,457
I don't have it.

267
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:03,787
Although I did hear some plangent
strumming from under that couch earlier.

268
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,964
Wow.

269
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,372
This kidnapper isn't
just bold. He's diabolical.

270
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,378
I guess he realized he probably
shouldn't give it back to you

271
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,448
until after you've
had the interviews.

272
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,623
Huh!

273
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,635
You didn't write anything.

274
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,866
So, what you're saying is, you
didn't find that one big explanation

275
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,464
'cause there isn't one. Clever.

276
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,410
Well, let's just say your anti-depressant
theory does explain the fever.

277
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,072
What about the heart? And
don't say a building fell on her.

278
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,150
Okay.

279
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,519
A structure
collapsed... Shut up.

280
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:03,317
Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature
releases potassium, causes V-tach.

281
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,257
You'd think she'd get crush
syndrome after she was crushed,

282
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,349
not two days later.

283
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,761
Microvascular occlusions, takes
that long for the blood to reperfuse.

284
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,996
She'd have a baggy
heart. Echo it to confirm.

285
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,402
Is crush syndrome good or bad?

286
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,502
Does it sound good?

287
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,156
I mean, compared to the
other things it could be.

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,558
There are no other
things it could be.

289
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,210
Then why are you testing her?

290
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,082
Excellent question.

291
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,887
What? What is it?

292
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,789
The heart's fine.

293
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,726
Why is she sweating?

294
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,730
Her fever's back.

295
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,289
Why would her fever be back?

296
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:48,991
I can't say.

297
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,730
You don't know?

298
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,296
Well, I know. I just can't
say, 'cause you'll hit me.

299
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,243
Let's discuss this
in front of witnesses.

300
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,504
The DT's?

301
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,047
So, she's an alcoholic now?

302
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,878
Her first fever was from the
medication for her depression.

303
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,974
Or you're wrong.

304
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,254
The second fever was from the
self-medication for depression.

305
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,380
This is insane.

306
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,148
You don't think I would have
noticed her being constantly drunk?

307
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,019
You were practically living with
Sylvia Plath. You didn't notice that.

308
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,586
Tone it down or I will hit you.

309
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,426
Fine. I'll do liver
enzyme tests.

310
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,400
Liver enzymes can also be
elevated from musculoskeletal trauma.

311
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,903
They'd be there whether she
had a drinking problem or not.

312
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,237
They don't know that.
Just pretend to confirm.

313
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,307
What's the treatment?

314
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,570
She's not an alcoholic.

315
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,839
Hair of the dog. IV alcohol.

316
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,441
Taper it off after a few days.

317
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,505
She's sick and
traumatized and half dead,

318
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,346
you wanna make her drunk?

319
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,817
Just do it.

320
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,979
You can't do this. We lived
together. We were gonna have kids.

321
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,284
You barely even know her.

322
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,656
Apparently, neither did you.

323
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,343
<i>Hello?</i>

324
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,946
Hi, can I speak to
Trevor Kaufman?

325
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,083
<i>Yo, yo. This is Trev. What up?</i>

326
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,323
This is Dr. Gregory House. Can
you come in tomorrow to interview?

327
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,921
<i>House? Are you serious? Awesome!</i>

328
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,523
<i>Hey, I got the House interview!</i>

329
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,535
<i>Oh, look at me, I got
the House interview!</i>

330
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,614
<i>Shut up! Would you shut up?
- I'm so cool.</i>

331
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,901
<i>Hey, give me the phone back.</i>

332
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,086
<i>Give the phone
back, seriously, man.</i>

333
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,871
I got a page.

334
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,971
No, you didn't.

335
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,244
They called a code.

336
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,784
No, they didn't.

337
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,985
You got a page, but not from us.

338
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,031
Did you ever see
<i>Raid on Entebbe?</i>

339
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,129
Yeah.

340
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,799
In the end they
release the hostages.

341
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,638
<i>How's that working for you?</i>

342
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,201
The Ugandans played fair.

343
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,280
They didn't move the
hostages on the Israelis.

344
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,041
Once again, I'm in awe of the
kidnapper's tactical brilliance.

345
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,188
What is <i>El Fuego Del Amor,</i>
and why do you need 10 of them?

346
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,126
It's a telenovela.

347
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,788
I'm learning Spanish.

348
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,724
Say <i>adiós.</i>

349
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,493
Are you erasing my TiVo?

350
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,694
House, not the season finale!

351
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,828
I don't negotiate
with terrorists.

352
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,762
<i>I smoke them out
of their hidey-holes.</i>

353
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,866
Do you know what terrorists
do when you don't negotiate?

354
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,343
They terrorize.

355
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,039
Bring it on.

356
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,049
Fever's down. Sweating is
abated. Heart's working fine.

357
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,685
I guess House was right, again.

358
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,352
That's good news, right?

359
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,451
It is good news.

360
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,394
So, what does this
mean, she's an alcoholic?

361
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,761
There's no other explanation?

362
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,568
No, sorry.

363
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,399
It doesn't make any sense.

364
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,202
Dr. Cuddy, she's doing this
thing with her mouth again.

365
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,035
It's been on and off for
the last couple of hours.

366
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,047
Is she trying to talk?

367
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,212
No.

368
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,214
I think she's screaming.

369
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,126
Morning.

370
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,389
Huh!

371
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,022
Where did you come from?

372
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,760
Apes, if you believe
the Democrats.

373
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,030
I heard you were there
when I was proven right.

374
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,481
The alcohol treatment took
away the heart and fever problems.

375
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,168
Yes, I was also there when
you were proven wrong.

376
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,177
She'd been silently
screaming for two hours.

377
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,146
Amylase and lipase are through
the roof. She has pancreatitis.

378
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,150
IV alcohol could
cause pancreatitis.

379
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,446
Okay.

380
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,934
You're not gonna argue with me?

381
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,157
No.

382
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,230
You think I'm right?

383
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,391
No.

384
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,364
Why not? No.

385
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,194
That's not really a
yes or no question.

386
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,365
Which is why I'm
not answering it.

387
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,739
If it's not the IV
alcohol, it's gotta be...

388
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,402
Not interested.

389
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,945
If I'm wrong,

390
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,976
she's gonna die.

391
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,993
Are you sure you're
still Dean of Medicine?

392
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:36,045
I'm not interested in arguing because
I'm not interested in enabling you.

393
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:40,081
You need someone to bounce
ideas off of. You need a team.

394
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,559
Don't follow me.

395
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,333
MAO inhibitor caused the fever,

396
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,961
alcohol caused the pancreatitis,

397
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,269
alcohol withdrawal
caused the V-tach.

398
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,203
Your logic is irrefutable.

399
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,769
You're wrong.

400
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,787
Well, who are you gonna
believe? A classic toy,

401
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,375
or a woman who, if she had
any confidence in her ideas,

402
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,388
wouldn't feel the need to
distract you with a water bra?

403
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,375
Are you really just gonna
treat the pancreatitis?

404
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,487
Are you here to enable me?

405
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,221
I don't want her to die
because you're stubborn.

406
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,493
Wow. So, you can enable
and rationalize at the same time.

407
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,742
Guess you are still
Dean of Medicine.

408
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,598
If you're right, then this guy,

409
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:27,129
who's not an ass, who's not a
workaholic, who's not a sociopath,

410
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,176
has somehow missed both her
depression and severe alcoholism.

411
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,475
Yes. Imagine that, a
couple with secrets!

412
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,674
Why would she lie?

413
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,184
Okay, alcoholism, you
don't wanna advertise, but...

414
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,688
If you're right, there'd be an
abnormality on the pancreas.

415
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,489
At least do an MRI to confirm.

416
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,476
Oh, my God!

417
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,718
This guy means business.

418
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,157
Or guys, could be multiple guys.

419
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,218
Or gal. Who knows?

420
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,533
All I can say is, this
reeks of boldness.

421
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,364
I am not hiring a team.

422
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,303
You ever tighten a guitar
string really, really slowly?

423
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,175
Past the point it can
handle the strain?

424
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,874
It makes this weird sound,

425
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,082
almost like a scream.

426
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,176
I thought this was gonna be fun.

427
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,763
I mess with you, you mess
with me, eventually you give in.

428
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,905
But you've shown a startling lack
of humor, which got me thinking.

429
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,069
Oh, God.

430
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,578
What's the real reason
you won't hire a team?

431
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,376
I told you. I don't need a team.

432
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,493
Then hire three people and
let them sit on their asses.

433
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,541
That wouldn't be right.

434
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,178
Three years ago, you hired
a team. What's changed?

435
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,782
I've become a man of
principle. I've gotten smarter.

436
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,587
What answer will
make Socrates shut up?

437
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,424
What's changed
is, you hired a team.

438
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,226
You connected with a
team, you worked with a team

439
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,096
and you lost a team.

440
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,095
Damn.

441
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,296
There's no abnormalities
in her pancreas.

442
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:43,775
You fall in love. You get married.
50% chance it'll end in misery.

443
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,606
Hiring employees
can be even tougher,

444
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,408
because you know,
eventually, they're gonna leave.

445
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,644
There's increased T2
signal on her hepatic capsule,

446
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,776
if you know what I mean.

447
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,221
You got hurt. Get over it.

448
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,121
Now, if you'll excuse me,

449
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,322
my patient's about to start
bleeding out of her mouth and anus.

450
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,440
Internal bleeding.

451
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,014
Not anymore. Now
it's all over the place.

452
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,413
Why are you here?

453
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,014
That's my patient down there.

454
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,644
You're here because I'm here.

455
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,819
I am done enabling you.

456
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,820
I know.

457
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,703
The alcohol didn't cause the
pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.

458
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,482
The question is, what
caused the internal bleeding?

459
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,599
I hate myself.

460
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,652
You do know that the patient
had a building lying on her.

461
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,676
Four days ago.

462
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,041
Bleeding can start at any time.

463
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,489
She's bleeding from
five different sites.

464
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,345
Do you think they
synchronized their watches?

465
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,178
She got Warfarin
after her hip surgery.

466
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,718
It's designed to mess
with bleeding patterns.

467
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,549
Fever, heart and bleeding.

468
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,987
Three problems, three
completely different explanations.

469
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,049
She must be the unluckiest
woman in the world.

470
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,390
I only cling to
this crazy theory

471
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,541
because it's been proven
right every step of the way.

472
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,724
Each treatment worked.

473
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,460
Yes. She looks
perfectly healthy.

474
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,401
This much bleeding is a
symptom of something more.

475
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,564
And you need a team,
because you're wrong

476
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,368
and you're gonna
kill this woman.

477
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,040
If I had a team, this
patient would be dead,

478
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,780
because they'd be
here instead of me

479
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,857
and they wouldn't notice the
size of this woman's uterus.

480
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,396
Hi. How's it going?
Mind if I observe?

481
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,461
Got a big room up top with
a big window just for that.

482
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,970
Stop that.

483
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,567
You wanna look at vaginas,
there are websites for that.

484
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,372
You think I'm made of money?

485
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,308
Can you get him out of here?

486
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:05,976
Enlarged uterus means that
she was recently pregnant.

487
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:10,044
She's a good liar, but I doubt she
can hide a baby from her boyfriend.

488
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,657
Scraping in the uterus indicates
that she had an abortion,

489
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,629
and nothing in
her medical history.

490
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,290
Only one reason
to hide an abortion.

491
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,130
Boyfriend wants
babies, she doesn't.

492
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,294
She's bleeding everywhere.

493
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,396
Unless the guy was performing
an abortion with a shotgun...

494
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,770
<i>Stop enabling him.</i>

495
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,636
It's not the abortion,
it's what she did after.

496
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,507
The boyfriend would
have noticed condoms,

497
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,377
he would notice abstinence.

498
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,375
He would not notice the pill,

499
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,610
which means I don't need a team!

500
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,493
Hey, where's your
mother in common law?

501
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,361
Dr. House, this
is Doug McMurtry.

502
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,128
His girlfriend was
working with Megan when...

503
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,697
She's dead?

504
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,500
She passed this morning.

505
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,566
Well, then why
are you still here?

506
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,678
I need the old lady's
consent to do some treatment.

507
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,646
What'd you find out?

508
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:14,050
I wish I could tell you, but
since you're not legally related...

509
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,053
What the hell did you find out?

510
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,859
Your girlfriend had an abortion.

511
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,159
See why I didn't tell you?

512
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,228
I'd be insane to also tell
you that she's on the pill.

513
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,167
No, she's not.

514
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,504
If they'd known she was on it,

515
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:40,740
they wouldn't have given her a
blood thinner after her hip surgery.

516
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,906
The combination
caused the bleeding.

517
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,382
It's good news. It's treatable.

518
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,829
Just give her Tamoxifen, which
is normally a breast cancer...

519
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,185
That's not true.

520
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,320
We wanna have kids.

521
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,292
Hmm.

522
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,496
See, I already
did the blood tests.

523
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,933
And either she lied to
you, or her blood lied to us.

524
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,910
Tell Megan I'm glad
she's gonna be okay.

525
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,113
How're you doing?

526
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,783
I got cancer.

527
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,625
You're on an oncology
ward. Everybody's got cancer.

528
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,096
You want sympathy,
you ought to try

529
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,827
the hardly-anything-
wrong-with-me ward.

530
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,961
In fact, why don't I take
you there right now?

531
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,198
How sick are you? Can you walk?

532
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,433
Are you a doctor?

533
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,704
Admitted today. First day
of a five-day chemo course.

534
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,802
Yeah, you can walk.
Come on, let's go.

535
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,813
Does Dr. Wilson
know you're here?

536
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:53,109
Well, if he didn't, this
would be really stupid.

537
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,129
'Cause then he wouldn't
know where his patient was.

538
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,782
He might think he'd
been kidnapped.

539
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,290
Now the room upstairs
is bigger, it's got cable,

540
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,793
better-looking
sponge bath nurses.

541
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,659
If you feel sick, you call
me directly, not Dr. Wilson.

542
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,757
He's getting his last
set of hormone shots.

543
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,480
You put her on Tamoxifen?
An anticancer drug?

544
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,980
It blocks estrogen receptors.

545
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,212
Does it also block breathing,
and kidney function?

546
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,946
She's crashing.

547
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,649
Doesn't mean I was wrong.

548
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,561
This is Dr. Marvin. We're bringing
this patient over now. Thanks.

549
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,563
Anybody here a doctor?

550
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,202
Kidney failure, spiking
fever, breathing difficulties.

551
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,737
Any theories?

552
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,268
Am I in an M. Night
Shyamalan movie?

553
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,310
You're House, right?

554
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,350
Okay, I assume you know me

555
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,377
because I once insulted you,
your patient, or your relatives.

556
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,888
If that's so, I apologize.
I was drunk that day.

557
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,482
Patient initially presented
with crush injuries.

558
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,824
I know you because
Dr. Cuddy issued a memo.

559
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,000
Telling you to
cooperate fully with me?

560
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,090
No.

561
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,327
Figured that was a long shot.

562
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,506
Anybody here not get that memo?

563
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,446
Fungal infection.

564
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,418
Don't you have a patient?

565
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,581
She shot herself in the
leg while high on meth.

566
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,955
Wouldn't hurt her to be
in pain for a little while.

567
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,528
Fungal infection would
be in her eyes by now.

568
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,595
Haemophilus?

569
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,154
Doesn't explain
the remitting fever.

570
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,229
You've heard that I've
got a job opening, right?

571
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,203
I just care about people.

572
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,466
Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome.

573
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,441
ARDS doesn't explain
anything, except the breathing.

574
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,520
If you care about people,
you're not getting the job.

575
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,309
I was lying. Crush syndrome.

576
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,878
Doesn't explain the breathing.

577
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,510
What was the problem with ARDS?

578
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,746
Only explained the breathing.

579
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:09,787
The crush syndrome?

580
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,135
It didn't explain the breathing.

581
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,589
Are you a fan of symmetry?

582
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,490
Sure. Weird.

583
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,324
'Cause your eyes are lopsided,

584
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,796
and by eyes I mean breasts.

585
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:28,137
ARDS and crush syndrome,
both reactions to severe trauma.

586
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,503
Why can't she have both?

587
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,598
Because...

588
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,937
Because then, there's
nothing we could do.

589
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,816
Boy, you remind me of someone.

590
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,116
Send me your résumé.

591
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,158
I'll put it on top of the pile
that I'm never gonna look at.

592
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,128
I couldn't leave.

593
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,806
You don't seem like the type of
person who would give up on giving up.

594
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:02,868
I love her.

595
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,470
You loved somebody.

596
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,773
Somebody who didn't
drink, wanted to have babies

597
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,314
and wasn't miserable.

598
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,679
I know she lied, but...

599
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,980
What are you doing? Why are
you saying these things to him?

600
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,416
The woman you love doesn't
exist. This woman is dying.

601
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,125
She has Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome and crush syndrome.

602
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,720
Her body's basically giving up.

603
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,824
We can keep her on supported
dialysis and hope for the best.

604
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,072
Never mind. She
has a lump in her arm.

605
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,971
Does that mean you're wrong?

606
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,846
Well, that'd be good
news for you guys.

607
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,384
We'll know after a biopsy.

608
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,791
Which patient is that?

609
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,852
Megan... House's patient.

610
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,987
Yeah.

611
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:00,157
Didn't you get my memo? Sure.

612
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,859
Got both memos.

613
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,595
Both.

614
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,999
And the second memo
said to ignore the first memo.

615
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,406
Yeah, seemed odd.

616
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,437
I did an MRI and...

617
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,035
Of course you did.

618
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,439
What'd you find?

619
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,709
It's kind of freaky.

620
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,683
She's got growths
all over the place.

621
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,780
She's got tumors?

622
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,223
Not exactly.

623
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,785
The growths are
eosinophilic granulomas.

624
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,195
They are usually
from allergic reactions,

625
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,699
so I'm putting her on steroids.

626
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,236
Allergy to what? She
doesn't have allergies.

627
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,263
We don't know.

628
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,569
Unfortunately, the only
drug she's had enough of

629
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,837
to have this kind of
reaction is cephalosporin.

630
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,309
And why is that unfortunate?

631
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,142
'Cause she was on
it two months ago.

632
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,366
That's what you mean, right?

633
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,726
She took it for strep throat
so she can't be allergic to it.

634
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,843
It would seem so.

635
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,182
What is this
hospital doing to her?

636
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,450
She has had three
separate medical disasters,

637
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,426
and now she's dying of an
allergy she can't possibly have?

638
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,112
Mr. Lee. I just have to check...

639
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,856
Sam? Are you okay?

640
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,558
What are you doing here?

641
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,035
I was taking a nap.

642
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,900
Where's my patient?

643
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,840
You stole my patient.

644
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,136
You kidnapped my guitar.

645
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,373
Give him back.

646
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,006
Only when you give her back.

647
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,550
It's a she?

648
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,380
It's certainly not a dude.

649
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,250
It's a guitar. You
took a human being!

650
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,686
Now who doesn't
have a sense of humor?

651
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,423
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.

652
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,655
What, are you listening for
the distant sound of screaming?

653
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,130
The nurses know to call me.

654
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,757
They don't know who he is!

655
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,893
His name's right there on the
chart. Now go away. I'm working.

656
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,870
They give him the wrong meds, who
the hell knows what's gonna happen?

657
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,774
House!

658
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,938
Bad things would happen.

659
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,818
He's in Room 318.

660
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,331
What are you giving Megan?

661
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,563
Megan? Nothing.

662
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,734
Nothing? What's going
on? What's wrong with her?

663
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,674
Her? Nothing.

664
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,405
Then why are you
giving her drugs?

665
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,073
Just some amphetamines
to wake her up.

666
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,482
Everything could be
explained by her lying to you.

667
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,619
The anti-depressants,
the drinking, the pill,

668
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,984
until now.

669
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,252
Now she's allergic to something
the chart says she's not allergic to.

670
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:21,095
That's not her lying, that's the chart
lying, which doesn't make sense.

671
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,864
You know Liz Masters?

672
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,135
No. Yeah, she worked with Megan.

673
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,370
That was her boyfriend
you met outside the morgue.

674
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,443
Mmm.

675
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,310
This is her chart.

676
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,942
She's on MAO inhibitors for
depression. She's on the pill.

677
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,319
She had an abortion a month ago,

678
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,187
and she's allergic
to cephalosporin.

679
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,886
What's going on here? What,
are you saying this isn't Megan?

680
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,030
Yes.

681
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,971
Ben?

682
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,100
<i>Since when?</i>

683
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,576
Since right before I
began pretending I loved it.

684
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,240
She's the same size as Megan,
the same build, the same hair color.

685
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,147
<i>They were both horribly
injured, unrecognizably.</i>

686
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,312
EMT teams do not second-guess

687
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,878
family members' identifications
at accident scenes.

688
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,760
No. Liz died
yesterday. This isn't Liz.

689
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,526
I know Megan.

690
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,333
I know her hair, I know
her hands, I know her smell.

691
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:38,501
What's your name?

692
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,876
Liz.

693
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,711
Oh, God!

694
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,555
Your girlfriend
never lied to you.

695
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,569
Oh, God.

696
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,317
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

697
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,786
You talking to me?

698
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,556
Go away.

699
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,664
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

700
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,867
How'd you know it was me?

701
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,341
There's a scent given
off by wounded feral cats.

702
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,310
You were wrong.

703
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,405
I got everything right,
just treated the wrong...

704
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,346
They had a good relationship.

705
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,616
He couldn't even identify her.

706
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,916
And you were wrong about
needing a team. She almost died.

707
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:32,547
So, I almost need a team.

708
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,185
You were content with your
"people are idiots" theory.

709
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,922
But Cameron would
never have accepted

710
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,430
that this guy knew nothing
about the love of his life.

711
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,192
And as soon as you claimed
it was multiple conditions,

712
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,567
Foreman would have done
anything to prove you wrong,

713
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,231
and then Chase would have
done anything to prove you right.

714
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,675
Any one of them would
have solved this days ago.

715
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,037
Hire a team.

716
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,180
I don't care how you do it.

717
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,020
Just do it.

718
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,757
<i>Sometimes I am wrong.</i>

719
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,830
I have a gift for observation.

720
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:19,070
For reading people and situations,
but sometimes I am wrong.

721
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,300
This will be the longest
job interview of your life.

722
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,240
I will test you in ways

723
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:30,475
that you will often consider
unfair, demeaning and illegal.

724
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,375
And you'll often be right.

725
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,681
Look to your left.

726
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,288
Now look to your right.

727
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,483
By the end of six weeks,

728
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,927
one of you will be gone,

729
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,290
as will 28 more of you.

730
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,991
Wear a cup.
