1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,140
You okay?

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,369
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,342
Thinking's not gonna
get you to the top.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:12,856
Mom, you're supposed
to be encouraging me.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,644
No, I'm supposed
to be coaching you.

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,715
The slower you go, the
more tired you're gonna get.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,085
There's a hold about a
foot above you on the left.

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,390
I know.

9
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,831
Nice grab!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,460
Keep going. You're
almost there, babe.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,834
I can't. My calf's cramping.

12
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,104
You need to get off your toes.

13
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,799
Get on the ball of
your foot. I can't.

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,900
Yes, you can. You can
get all the way to the top.

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,050
It's okay. I got
you. You all right?

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,831
Looks like you were wrong. Yeah.

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,864
But you did awesome. That's
the highest you've gotten.

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,015
I'm proud of you.

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,148
I don't feel so good.

20
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,056
Okay. Come on down.

21
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,654
Mom?

22
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,589
Mom, are you okay?

23
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,404
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,741
Whoa! Did you see
that? You all right?

25
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,575
My arm. I think I
broke it. Don't move.

26
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,910
Oh, Jane, I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,192
What happened?
Did the rope break?

28
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:27,119
No. My hands, I can't move them.

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,250
She's been to an ortho, two
neuros and an immunologist.

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,297
None of the treatments
have had any effect.

31
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,026
You think it's over?
It's getting worse.

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,465
Last neurologist found
intermittent numbness in both arms

33
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,763
as well as the hand paralysis.

34
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,114
I meant the game. You think
he's gonna keep all four of us?

35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,108
He said he would. No sign of
upper motor neuron involvement.

36
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,335
He lies.

37
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,877
My ears are burning.

38
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,173
Tell him you're
done firing people.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,512
Well, if I lie, that would
be little reassurance.

40
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,849
Dr. Kutner, who told you
that it would be a good idea

41
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,391
to put up superficial representations
of a hypocritical season

42
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,517
celebrating a mythical figure?

43
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,650
It wasn't me.

44
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,854
He lied.

45
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,731
Homey knows better,
Hymie doesn't care,

46
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,028
and Huntington's would
have done a better job.

47
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,398
I don't have Huntington's.

48
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,835
That you know of.
Why would you...

49
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,033
Because I got sued when
I called you "honey buns."

50
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,302
Am I fired if I put up...

51
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,819
The point of the
game was to scare us.

52
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,402
Telling us it's
over isn't scary.

53
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,743
Therefore, he has no reason
to say that unless it's true.

54
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,216
Good. Then, can we
do a Secret Santa?

55
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,081
I liked you better 15 seconds ago
when you were afraid for your job.

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,214
So, who's sick?

57
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,850
35-year-old single mom.

58
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,554
It's an odd
presentation of paralysis.

59
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,323
Is there any history
of drug use? No.

60
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,126
She says there's no history.

61
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,860
She's not a liar.

62
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,027
Okay. This is gonna
be a tough case.

63
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,936
I have almost no knowledge
of alien physiology.

64
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,439
Everyone lies. But there's
an exception to every rule.

65
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,652
Actually, there isn't. That's
kind of what makes it a rule.

66
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,854
The patient's mother died of
breast cancer when she was seven.

67
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,369
She never even knew
her mom was sick.

68
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,713
She promised herself she would never
hide anything from her own daughter.

69
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,844
Oh. I didn't know
she'd promised.

70
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,048
And we're not her daughter.

71
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,523
The patient inherited the
BRCA1 mutation from her mom.

72
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,924
She had a prophylactic double
mastectomy 10 years ago.

73
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,997
She lied about it. She told
her co-workers. She told her kid.

74
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,395
She lied to the world.

75
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,900
Reconstructive surgery is
designed to convince people that...

76
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,697
She didn't get
reconstructive surgery.

77
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,548
Okay. We can rule
out breast cancer.

78
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,599
Actually, I was gonna rule it in.
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.

79
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,576
Even the best surgeon can't
remove every cell of breast tissue.

80
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:12,050
MRI what's left of her chest.
Set the machine to scan for irony.

81
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,179
I'm gonna go re-do
the patient history.

82
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,961
Your mom tell you about
all the drugs she does?

83
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,431
She smokes pot once in a
while, but not in a long time.

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,559
What about you?

85
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,966
How would that make her sick?

86
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,332
Are you a doctor?

87
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,735
I'm 11.

88
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,838
That's not an answer.
That's an evasion.

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,070
Drinking? You
ever sneak a drink?

90
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,139
I don't do any of that
stuff. It's bad for you.

91
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,014
I understand why you don't
want your mom to know.

92
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,142
But I'm her doctor, so...

93
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,517
No, I would tell my mom.

94
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,647
And I would tell you. Why?

95
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,992
Because she would
never lie to me.

96
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,421
What's her favorite
way to have sex?

97
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,963
I don't get what sex has
to do with breast cancer.

98
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,228
Are you a doctor?

99
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,013
Did you go to med school
since the last time I asked?

100
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,677
You just think we've
got to be lying to...

101
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,297
White lies? What are those?

102
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,344
Those are lies we tell to
make other people feel better.

103
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,604
I don't lie.

104
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,704
Rationalizations?
What are those?

105
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,942
Those are lies we tell to
make ourselves feel better.

106
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,075
No. We don't...

107
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,277
Lies of omission?

108
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,114
Saddle, bronc or doggie?

109
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,886
That's sex talk.

110
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:32,289
She used to like being on top, but
now she likes to be on her stomach.

111
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:38,001
That way she doesn't have to
see them looking at her scars.

112
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,211
It's child abuse.

113
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,748
Honesty?

114
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,910
There's a reason that
everybody lies. It works.

115
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,577
It's what allows
society to function.

116
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,121
It's what separates
man from beast.

117
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,213
Oh, I thought that
was our thumbs.

118
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,450
You want to know every place
your mom's thumb has been?

119
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,894
I'm sorry. I missed rehearsal.
Am I taking the truth-is-good side?

120
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,207
Don't you usually
take that part?

121
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,699
Lies are a tool.

122
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,393
They can be used
either for good...

123
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,629
Wait. I've got a better one.

124
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,035
Lies are like children.

125
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,165
They're hard work but they're worth it
because the future depends on them.

126
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,801
You are so full of
love or something.

127
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,413
When you care about someone...

128
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,973
You lie to them.

129
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,543
You pretend that their constant,
ponderous musings are interesting.

130
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,821
You tell them they're not
losing their boyish good looks

131
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,003
or becoming worn out and...

132
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,584
I stand corrected. And may I say it's
been a real pleasure chatting with you.

133
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,130
Axilla is clean. Surgical
margins look clear.

134
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,224
No lymphadenopathy, no
masses, no nothing. It's not cancer.

135
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,104
We need a new theory.

136
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,170
You catch her lying?

137
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,262
Not yet.

138
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,001
Wouldn't no have
been a shorter answer?

139
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,101
Wouldn't you not talking have
made this a shorter conversation?

140
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,475
Kid says Mom's a slut.

141
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,585
She called her mom a slut?

142
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,910
No. I called her mom a slut.

143
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,109
She jumps anything
with a pole and a pulse.

144
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,229
Not that I'm judging, here. Given her
medical history, I'm actually impressed.

145
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,398
Maggie already admitted to
having multiple sexual partners.

146
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,414
Which is why we already
tested for, and ruled out,

147
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,802
syphilis and any other STD that
could have caused her symptoms.

148
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,591
STDs aren't the
only risk in risky sex.

149
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,633
The problem in sleeping with
strangers is, they're strange.

150
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,361
We'll follow up with
any recent partners.

151
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,130
Send Foreman and
Taub. They're better liars.

152
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,035
More likely to get to the truth.

153
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,476
You think I drugged
her? Use a coaster.

154
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,280
We're not cops. Legally, we
don't care one way or another.

155
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,096
But we need to know the
truth so we can help her.

156
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,799
I'd known her for less than an hour
and she offered to take me home.

157
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,348
There was no need to drug her.

158
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,057
Not that I would.

159
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,198
She's gonna be okay, right?

160
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,530
As long as she doesn't have to
pick up or hold anything, yeah.

161
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,003
Sorry. I just had the floors
done. Reclaimed pine.

162
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,106
You always this thirsty?

163
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,044
I don't know.

164
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,206
Water's supposed to
be good for you, right?

165
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,976
Dehydration,
anxiety, aggression.

166
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,485
I'm not aggressive.

167
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,522
Spastic chorea
in his right hand.

168
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,900
What about my hand?
How much do you weigh?

169
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,825
About 180, 190?
180. What is this?

170
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,225
If you took what she did, it
could take longer to hit you.

171
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,058
It might affect you differently.

172
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,326
But you didn't give
her anything, right?

173
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,329
She was really drunk.

174
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:27,238
I just gave her some E
to help enhance things.

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,172
Have any of it left?

176
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,934
Is my hand gonna be okay?

177
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,004
There's nothing wrong with it.

178
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,412
We lied.

179
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,189
I've had a sore throat
for a few days now.

180
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,248
My stomach's also
been bothering me.

181
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,691
I think my glands are swollen.

182
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,524
Saint Nicholas?

183
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,030
Patron saint of children.

184
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:57,036
Also seamen, merchants,
archers, prostitutes and prisoners.

185
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,766
Mmm. He must have
been pretty hard working.

186
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,240
Or just a credit hog.

187
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,606
Open wide.

188
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,213
Say, "Ah." Ah.

189
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,610
You have strep.

190
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,581
Is it contagious?

191
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,052
Only for the next 24 hours, as
long as you take the antibiotics.

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,383
How contagious?

193
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,285
Take a personal day.

194
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,722
I can't.

195
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,619
I'll write your pimp a note.

196
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,889
My pimp?

197
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,056
You get tested for
AIDS every three months.

198
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,827
And your necklace.

199
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,095
Prostitutes wear
religious symbols?

200
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,365
I think they just like kneeling.

201
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,670
You don't have the skin of a
seaman, the fingers of an archer,

202
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,176
the clothes of a merchant
or the attitude of an ex-con.

203
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,678
So, that just leaves one left.

204
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,714
Mmm, two, actually.

205
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,111
But I'm not a child, am I?

206
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,394
You owe me 50 bucks.

207
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,128
Then you owe me
half a lap dance.

208
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,967
It's for the nurses' holiday
bonus. I know you got the memo.

209
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,475
I got the memo last year. I
want to hire 40 more fellows.

210
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,134
You already fired
the ones you hired?

211
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,678
They work better
when they're scared.

212
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,645
You were right. Guy
slipped her Ecstasy.

213
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,680
He have any symptoms? No.

214
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,650
Kutner's starting the
patient on hemodialysis,

215
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,712
and Thirteen's in the lab trying to
figure out what the guy put in the drugs.

216
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,855
See? Clear, simple
statement of facts

217
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,419
describing their cooperation
with absolutely no attitude or fear.

218
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,930
Something's got to be done.

219
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,330
Oh, yeah.

220
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,094
How are you feeling?

221
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,570
I still can't move my hands.

222
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,005
It will take a few more hours to cycle
all your blood through the machine.

223
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,873
What just happened?

224
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,177
Nothing. What's wrong?

225
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,112
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.

226
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,214
Didn't they?

227
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,683
What did you do?

228
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,844
Is this from the drugs?

229
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,563
Most of the drugs should
be out of your system by now.

230
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,764
And our drugs
wouldn't... I can't see.

231
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,881
Do something!

232
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,083
I can't see!

233
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,593
I can't see!

234
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,467
Nothing in the
Ecstasy except Ecstasy.

235
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,434
Well, that never hurt anybody.

236
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,631
Can't make them
blind days later.

237
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,731
Do you spell "Homey" with a "Y"?

238
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,477
I want to be respectful.

239
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,088
You're actually gonna
let us do Secret Santa?

240
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,910
Not just you guys.

241
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,881
I like presents, too.

242
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,583
Pick a name.

243
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,746
Why are you doing this?

244
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,312
See, this is why no
one likes your people.

245
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,155
The notion of picking one time of the year
to be decent to other people is obscene

246
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,738
'cause it's actually
validating the notion

247
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,540
of being miserable
wretches the rest of the year.

248
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,964
So, you think this is the part
of the year that's screwed up?

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,299
On the other hand, you are now a
team. You've got to work together.

250
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,948
And the simple fact is, giving
people crap makes people like people.

251
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,498
So, spend 25
bucks. Learn to love.

252
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,573
Blindness could be a
complication from the hemodialysis.

253
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,512
No, the dialysate
composition was within range.

254
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,307
Sweet. Interesting.

255
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,562
The dialysate composition just
indicates... Indicates nothing.

256
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,586
I was referring to his
reaction to the name he got.

257
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,766
I was pleased. I thought
it'd be fun to buy for...

258
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,851
Means there's someone here
it wouldn't be fun to buy for.

259
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,623
I wonder who. Pick a name.

260
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:14,794
Then go check out
the patient's house.

261
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,861
Interesting.

262
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,802
We're wasting time
going to the home.

263
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,772
Kearns-Sayre Syndrome
fits the symptoms.

264
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,968
No family history of
Kearns. Go to their house.

265
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,454
She would have told us if there
were any other drugs. You met her.

266
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,489
She couldn't have been more
candid. You're absolutely right.

267
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,005
Go to their house... MS or a
vascular problem fits better.

268
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,778
They could affect
hands and eyes.

269
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,048
Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS.

270
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,556
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes
to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.

271
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,220
Oh, and whoever goes to their
house, get me their computers.

272
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,529
You talk to your kid about sex

273
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,564
so she'll think you're being
open about everything.

274
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,545
It keeps her from asking questions
about things you don't want to talk about.

275
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,505
That's right. Her honesty
proves just how dishonest she is.

276
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,566
Yes! Exactly who I wanted.
This is gonna be fun.

277
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,246
The dye may sting when
it enters your bloodstream.

278
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,979
Are you scared, Mom?

279
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,385
Yeah.

280
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,047
Are you? Yeah.

281
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,716
Are they?

282
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,219
They don't look scared.

283
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,593
Either they're confident
or they just don't care.

284
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,225
We're confident.

285
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,097
Okay if I shift you a bit? I
need to get you into position.

286
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,577
Your boss is weird.

287
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,476
Yeah, he is.

288
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:37,211
He thought he'd get information
you may not have been telling us by...

289
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,615
Being a jerk?

290
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,677
You'd be surprised
how often it works.

291
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,016
Choroidal flush looks good.

292
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,425
Why would people
lie to a doctor?

293
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,085
Dozens of reasons to lie.
Only one reason to tell the truth.

294
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,754
You're never even tempted?

295
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:56,093
I mean, lies do sometimes
smooth things out, make life easier.

296
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,535
Yeah? Your life easy?

297
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,634
Not even close.

298
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,775
Dye's reached the retinal
capillary bed. No leakage.

299
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,747
That's good, right?

300
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,541
It means it's not a
vascular problem.

301
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,381
But? A vascular
problem we could fix.

302
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,419
They look worried now, Mom.

303
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,262
What's with the Secret Santa?

304
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,822
You trying to bring
them together?

305
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,231
Want to drive them apart.

306
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,331
With gift giving?

307
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,927
Conflict's built
right into the name.

308
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,964
Santa's about sharing.
Secret's about withholding.

309
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,573
Aside from the Trojan
horse, gifts don't usually...

310
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,172
What did you get your wife
for your final anniversary?

311
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,273
Uh, a sweater. She hated it.

312
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,613
She loved it.

313
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,085
Then you didn't buy it.

314
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,954
I gave her some cash and...

315
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,988
Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly
how little we know about a person.

316
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,893
And nothing pisses
off a person more

317
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,604
than being shoved in
the wrong pigeonhole.

318
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,761
Nice.

319
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,671
I'm thinking of spending a few
extra bucks on my Secret Santa.

320
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,831
Bad idea.

321
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,685
You mind if I tell House you asked
them for the key instead of breaking in?

322
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,008
Yes. I do. Just another
5 bucks. 5 will be 10.

323
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,789
The key's proof she
doesn't have anything to hide.

324
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,253
The key is proof I didn't do
exactly what House told me to do.

325
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,760
And what do you
care if it's another 15?

326
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,912
I'm gonna tell him. Who
are you so anxious to please?

327
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,784
Not you.

328
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,266
You really think you're gonna
prove people are capable of honesty

329
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,368
using a mother and daughter
you've known for one day?

330
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,072
I'm not the one who's based his
entire worldview on the proposition.

331
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,893
If I'm wrong, so
what? If he's wrong...

332
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,959
So, you've got
Huntington's? Nope.

333
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,163
But House said that...

334
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,397
If I wanted to talk about
it, why didn't I bring it up?

335
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,638
Fluorescein angiogram was
clear. No leaks. No lesions.

336
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,146
Definitely not a
vascular problem.

337
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,640
Someone get their
birthdays out of the file.

338
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,845
Have you tried leaving it blank?

339
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,553
Tough to get into the head of
someone who actually trusts people, huh?

340
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,258
Found both computers in
an office on a desk they share.

341
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,696
No sign of macular
degeneration or optic neuritis.

342
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,029
Her eyes are completely normal.

343
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,864
Except she can't
see out of them.

344
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,064
So she says.

345
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,537
You find anything on the MRI?

346
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,404
No sign of plaques. It's not MS.

347
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,500
We haven't found anything
abnormal on any tests.

348
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,102
Except she can't see
or move her hands.

349
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,237
So she says.

350
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,474
You can't lie about
flaccid paralysis.

351
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,876
Maybe she's not
lying. Her brain is.

352
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,218
What if it's a
conversion disorder?

353
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,189
Lacks personal boundaries.

354
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,859
Promiscuous. Inappropriate
obsession with truth telling.

355
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,727
Certainly sounds
like a psych case.

356
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,963
Cool. I'll set up a psych consult
and start her on anti-depressants.

357
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,298
No.

358
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,268
Her mind is tricking her body.

359
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,908
We need to trick her mind.

360
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,242
Or even better...

361
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,275
You don't need her. I know.

362
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,183
Then this serves
no medical purpose.

363
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,122
You have a genetic
defect, choose to ignore it.

364
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,885
This woman has a genetic defect,

365
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,188
chooses to butcher
herself to be safe.

366
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,925
Yet, what you claim to be
fascinated by is her honesty.

367
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,226
Interesting.

368
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,234
You claim to want the truth.

369
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,362
And then you screw with people
who actually live by it. Pathetic.

370
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,236
Hey, I gave you
credit for interesting.

371
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,709
You're protecting her because you're
jealous she did what you couldn't.

372
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,812
I need you.

373
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,111
I'm not lying to her.

374
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,379
Fine. Keep your mouth
shut. I still need you.

375
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,887
If it doesn't work, you've
got to hold the kid down

376
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,924
until someone else
finishes lying to Mom.

377
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,624
That does actually
serve a medical purpose.

378
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,761
Jane.

379
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,435
I have to lie because
she trusts me?

380
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:55,407
If you show doubt, the
placebo treatment won't work.

381
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,171
If it's just depression,
that's good news, right?

382
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,588
There are a lot of
great medications.

383
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,946
Why can't we just give her those?
Why do we have to lie to her?

384
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,450
Because we might be wrong.

385
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,725
Those medications
take a long time to work,

386
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:09,979
and since your mom's
condition's declining,

387
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,991
there's a chance the drugs won't
tell us anything until it's too late.

388
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,522
My mom's not depressed.

389
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,222
Maybe she's hiding it from you.

390
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,697
No.

391
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,799
She wouldn't.

392
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,144
She's doing what
every good mom does.

393
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,138
Protecting her child from bad news
that she can't do anything about.

394
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,672
My mom's never lied to me.

395
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,104
If you don't know how to lie,

396
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,236
you don't know how to tell
when you're being lied to.

397
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,847
Maybe you're right.

398
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,384
I know I'm... I was lying.

399
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,919
I know how to lie.

400
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,556
I just won't do it to my mother.

401
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,228
You like foosball?

402
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,229
Until the treatment of your
infectious paraparesis takes effect,

403
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,862
Jane can't come
back into the room.

404
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,235
I've already been inoculated.

405
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,808
Can she have it already?

406
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,037
Don't worry. It's a
very effective treatment.

407
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,670
You should be feeling
better in a matter of minutes.

408
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,078
Don't you think Jane
deserves a few secrets?

409
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,087
Some personal space?

410
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,181
Room to make her own mistakes?

411
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,727
She makes plenty of mistakes.

412
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,947
Only difference is I'm there
to help her through them.

413
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,431
But she's got to know you're
looking over her shoulder.

414
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,727
It's got to stifle her.

415
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,177
I think the world
would be a better place

416
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,433
if everybody always acted like their
mom was looking over their shoulder.

417
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,251
I want to go see my mom.

418
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,342
She's sleeping.

419
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,997
Why don't we just double
the amount we can spend?

420
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,785
Nope. Can't afford another 25?

421
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,018
If we allow people 50,
people will spend 60.

422
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,720
Ah! So, you can't
afford another 35.

423
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,195
You must really like who
you got. Or really dislike.

424
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,456
My mom always
gives the best presents

425
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,230
to the teachers I get
along with the worst.

426
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,237
No. No.

427
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,472
How do you know no?

428
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,444
I know you didn't get House.

429
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,647
I know he didn't get House.

430
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,213
You gave them all
your name? Mmm-hmm.

431
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,452
I figured I could sow some dissension
and get a few ties and sweaters.

432
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,186
What happens when they find out?

433
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,727
It's Secret Santa.

434
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,154
What happens when they find out?

435
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,961
They'll argue about what
to do with that information.

436
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,263
The ties are less important
than the dissension.

437
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,396
We still have to buy him
something. Not a chance.

438
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,650
We weren't supposed to discuss
this. We're not supposed to know.

439
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,905
He's not supposed to put
his name in there five times.

440
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,377
He wants presents. It's sad.

441
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,277
It's pathetic.

442
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,588
I'm still buying him a present.

443
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,244
No, you're not.

444
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,014
Fine.

445
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,926
What's wrong?

446
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,296
I think it's getting worse.

447
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,498
I can't breathe.

448
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,595
I need a nurse in here!

449
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,310
Her lymph nodes are cutting off
her airway. We've got to intubate!

450
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,886
The swollen lymph nodes
were cutting off Maggie's airway.

451
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,473
We shrunk them with alcohol and
she's breathing on her own now.

452
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,527
Well, that sucks.

453
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,896
Four thousand, three
hundred saved emails

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,994
and not a single mention of
"lesbionic," "Sanchez," or "mangina."

455
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,403
Swollen lymph nodes
means it wasn't psychological.

456
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,598
Who's that from?

457
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,735
Santa, obviously. As
you know, I worship him.

458
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,213
Oh, wait. I meant Satan. I
always get them confused.

459
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,719
What is an "alpine butterfly"? And
why is she learning how to do one?

460
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,366
House, we already have a full
history. You don't need to waste time...

461
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,468
It's just a climbing knot.
But what does she use it for?

462
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,984
- Try "bondage."
- I did once.

463
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,828
But she just tied me down and whined about
how hard it is to be Dean of Medicine.

464
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,994
Gyms aren't exactly pristine. Could be a
fungal infection. Seriously, who's it from?

465
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,389
No fever. No
elevated white count.

466
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:23,009
That's funny. Friend sent
her a Garfield cartoon.

467
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,010
That cat sure does love lasagna.

468
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,104
House, stop obsessing.

469
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,585
If it weren't for my obsessions, we
wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.

470
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,518
Eighteen months ago,
she sold her Stairmaster.

471
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,751
It was only two months old.

472
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,761
Now, either she needed the cash, or
climbing stairs was getting more difficult.

473
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,094
Twelve months ago,
she canceled a hiking trip.

474
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,360
Now, either she just wanted
to sit home and watch TV,

475
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,232
or walking was
getting more difficult.

476
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,568
She's been suffering joint
pain for the last two years.

477
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,108
Pull my ribbon. If
you know what I mean.

478
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,700
ACE levels are too
low for sarcoidosis.

479
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,347
That's not what I meant.

480
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,225
Could just be an inactive phase.

481
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,342
It's not Christmas yet.

482
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,612
I remembered. I'm not
a Satanist. I'm a Druid.

483
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,051
No lung involvement. Yet.

484
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,282
We'll need a bronchoalveolar
lavage to confirm it.

485
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,485
That's a shame. I was gonna
surprise her with one for Christmas.

486
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,761
Wow!

487
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,923
Now, either that cost
more than 25 bucks,

488
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,437
or I'm seriously starting to doubt
Steve Jobs' business strategies.

489
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,236
Thanks!

490
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,409
Last round of saline,
Maggie. One more big breath.

491
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,916
You've got to get the liquid to go
all the way into your lungs, okay?

492
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,450
Here we go.

493
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,584
The gift could
be from a patient.

494
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,283
Who sent it to the wrong doctor?

495
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,154
House obviously gave
the present to himself.

496
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,293
They're arguing right now.

497
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,925
I've been looking
for this all morning.

498
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,765
Did you look in the
box on my desk?

499
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,203
Oh, by the way, your mom
called. Your dad's dead.

500
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,465
You left the present
sitting on your desk?

501
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,205
It wouldn't have been as effective
sitting in a closet in my home.

502
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,589
They're gonna know
it's from you. No.

503
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,275
They're gonna guess
that it was from me.

504
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,026
They might even be 90%
sure that it was from me.

505
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,519
But all that means is
they're 10% percent sure

506
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,645
that one of the other
guys is screwing them over.

507
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,384
Have you ever considered
channeling your powers to,

508
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,120
I don't know, bring
peace to the Mid-east?

509
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,560
I couldn't do that.

510
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,502
But if they ever got it,
you could screw it up.

511
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,193
Yeah. That's more
where my powers lie.

512
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,795
The gift could be
from Wilson. It's House.

513
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,614
Why do you have a
problem with him speculating?

514
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,937
Because that's what
House wants us to do.

515
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,535
Lungs are pristine. No
infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.

516
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,671
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?

517
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,015
A little harder.

518
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,982
Great.

519
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,990
Maggie? Open your eyes.

520
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,862
Why aren't you saying anything?

521
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,260
What's wrong?

522
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,596
Maggie tested
negative for sarcoidosis.

523
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,198
But she's bleeding
into her eyes, now.

524
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,573
Have her platelets dropped?

525
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,441
Plummeted. New labs
show they're under 40.

526
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,557
She'll bleed out of every
orifice if we don't find the cause.

527
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,743
Could be splenic
sequestration, tuberculosis.

528
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,216
Gaucher disease, TTP.

529
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,185
Hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, sepsis, lupus...

530
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,779
Listing all the possible
causes is only impressive

531
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,915
if you can do it
reverse alphabetically.

532
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,460
We need to know why her
platelet machine is broken.

533
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,724
Go to the factory. Do a
bone marrow aspiration.

534
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,242
I'm your Secret Santa.

535
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,768
You're not supposed to tell.

536
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,438
But you got a present already,

537
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,982
which means you have
more than one Secret Santa.

538
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,985
Or somebody else
wants to make me happy.

539
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,818
Merry Christmas.

540
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,468
On the one hand,
you should be in bed.

541
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,174
On the other hand, I told you
to rest. So, I see your dilemma.

542
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,945
Hey, I don't think
resting is the problem.

543
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,351
Can strep cause this?

544
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,649
Clap on.

545
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,623
Trust me, first place I went.

546
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,857
No rash on my labia. Do
you need to take a look?

547
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,856
I'm saving my money
for a Red Rider BB gun.

548
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,297
Darker shade of lipstick?

549
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,929
I'm not wearing any.

550
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,337
You tell your
mother what you do?

551
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,108
It doesn't matter. I'm curious.

552
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,814
I don't need to break her
heart just so I can feel righteous.

553
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,527
Do you do a donkey show?

554
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,994
I'm not curious. It matters.

555
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,066
It's a donkey or a mule.

556
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,837
I can never remember.

557
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,471
Wow. That is a creepy smile.

558
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,373
I bet the donkey's
is even creepier.

559
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,809
Do I have to explain... Nope.

560
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,643
That's my job.

561
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,151
Contagious ecthyma.

562
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:37,553
Any contact can cause rashes,
flu symptoms, sore throat.

563
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,783
Has there been

564
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,124
contact?

565
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,695
Okay. Antibiotic cream for you

566
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,266
and a love glove for Francis.

567
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,199
You'll both be fine.

568
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,139
You should come and see
the show. I think you'd like it.

569
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,902
Sorry. I hate Westerns.

570
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,005
So, they really never lie?

571
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,392
Doesn't seem like it.

572
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,554
Admirable.

573
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,706
You tell Cameron everything?

574
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,096
No.

575
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,290
You think she keeps secrets?

576
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:26,133
If I knew, they wouldn't
be secrets. I hope she does.

577
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,766
People have a right to a little
privacy, even from the people they love.

578
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,045
Did you buy House a present?

579
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,346
Why would I? To screw with me.

580
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,749
Then, I'm gonna say yes.

581
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,782
No, wait. Stop. Stop.
What's that smell?

582
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,122
The bone is smoking.

583
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,090
Her bones are
harder than the drill?

584
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,735
We ran a full body bone scan to
find the cause of hardening in the hip.

585
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,932
No hot spots anywhere.

586
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,497
Tracer could have been inactive.

587
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,167
So, I screwed up the test?

588
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,954
There are so many ways
that could have happened.

589
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,755
Maybe it was inactive,
maybe it didn't fully circulate...

590
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,090
It circulated. The
camera picked up.

591
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,607
Hey, hey. It's Christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?

592
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,013
Why do you think
there are no hot spots?

593
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,556
I did not screw up. The
density is consistent.

594
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:22,025
Just means the density was
consistent. Doesn't mean it was cold.

595
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,528
It's possible all she
has are hot spots.

596
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,192
It's consistent because her
entire skeleton is turning to stone.

597
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,132
Good for an aspiring superhero.

598
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,299
Fatal for a human hoping
to make it to Kwanzaa.

599
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,844
It's got to be from a carbonic
anhydrase type 2 deficiency.

600
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,969
It has free will.

601
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,456
It doesn't have to be
anything it doesn't want to be.

602
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,075
I meant if it's not CA-2, well,

603
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,118
none of the other causes of
osteopetrosis are treatable.

604
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,716
You're right. It's got to be.

605
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,684
Go run her blood and hope that
your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.

606
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,238
They accused Kutner of screwing
up a test because they hate him.

607
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,399
You're surprised?

608
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:10,685
That's the sort of
crap that happens

609
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,302
when you mess
with people's heads.

610
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,107
One day, he will
screw up a test.

611
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,383
And if they don't accuse him of that
because they like him, someone could die.

612
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,876
Where are we going?

613
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,387
Nowhere. I just
know it hurts you.

614
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,625
CA-2 deficiency's a genetic
disorder that scrambles proteins.

615
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:34,257
If the blood test is positive, you'll
need a bone marrow transplant.

616
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,995
"Transplant" sounds like a
euphemism for "slim odds."

617
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,632
Slim but not none.

618
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,869
We're gonna need to
test Jane for a match.

619
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,737
Don't you have donor banks?

620
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,075
Jane is your best bet.

621
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,081
The procedure is perfectly
safe. There's no risk.

622
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,548
No risk?

623
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,847
Any surgery has... Then,
don't tell me there's no risk.

624
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,313
You're gonna tell me
there's no pain, either?

625
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,600
The testing will hurt a little.

626
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,616
I'll be fine.

627
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:07,596
If she doesn't do this
and you don't make it,

628
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,960
she's gonna spend the rest
of her life blaming herself.

629
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,438
Mom, please.

630
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,809
Find someone else.

631
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,043
Let someone else take the risk.

632
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,294
Donor bank turned up a
49-year-old man in Cleveland

633
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,298
who's a five out
of six HLA match.

634
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,743
First flight out of
Cleveland leaves at...

635
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,204
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland
man a closer match than her daughter?

636
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,772
He may not be. Maggie
didn't let us test her.

637
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,839
Why not?

638
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,535
Pain, danger, risk of...

639
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,305
Only reason to
give multiple reasons

640
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,676
is you're searching for what
the person wants to hear.

641
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,648
House.

642
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,988
You're wrong about
sainted Mommy.

643
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,862
Don't care. You can forget the donor
bank. There's no CA-2 deficiency.

644
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,524
Best we can do is
make her comfortable.

645
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,802
Is that from Taub?

646
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,634
Yes.

647
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,575
Yes, it is.

648
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,308
Merry Christmas.

649
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,749
Who's gonna tell the
patient she's dying?

650
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,017
I will.

651
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,925
And nobody leaves here
until we find out what killed her.

652
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,365
Whatever she has is fatal.

653
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,928
Makes no difference if it's
disease number 58 or 907.

654
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,242
Are you guys mad at me?

655
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,744
No. You had no choice.

656
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,324
Of course I had a choice. You had
no choice once I made my choice.

657
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,510
And now, I'm choosing
not to be mad at you.

658
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,584
Why?

659
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,949
Because it will
drive House nuts.

660
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,249
Do you think that will make
your lives better or worse?

661
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,760
I told my mom I don't
care what she thinks.

662
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,589
I want you to test my marrow.

663
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,763
I can't be dying.

664
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:28,897
Sure you can.

665
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,237
You're wrong.

666
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,810
You don't even know what I have.

667
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:36,871
What you have is one last
Christmas with your daughter.

668
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,883
One last chance to
give her a present.

669
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,251
The truth.

670
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,222
It's inexpensive, highly valued.

671
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,885
Never have to stand in line to
return it the day after Christmas.

672
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,552
What are you talking about?

673
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,259
A mother who's going to die

674
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,391
doesn't refuse a donor
test because it might hurt.

675
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,460
She refuses when she
knows it won't match.

676
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:00,832
Which tends to happen

677
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:04,398
when mother and daughter
aren't mother and daughter.

678
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,275
I can do DNA tests if you'd
rather keep lying to me.

679
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,656
I never wanted kids.

680
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,024
I loved them, but
with my genes...

681
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,432
I knew this woman,
a drug addict.

682
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,338
She got pregnant, didn't
want to have an abortion.

683
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,804
But she also didn't want her daughter
to ever know who her real mother was.

684
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,005
What she was.

685
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,011
I promised never to tell.

686
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,858
A promise to an addict is worth
more than a promise to your daughter?

687
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,692
It'd be cruel to tell her.

688
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,791
Right. She lives a lie.
You get to die a hypocrite.

689
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:10,870
Mom? The doctors told
me what's happening.

690
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,207
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

691
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,574
I promise you.

692
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:16,874
Doctors can be wrong.

693
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,393
There's still a
chance I can beat...

694
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,352
You really believe that?

695
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,553
I do.

696
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,363
No, Mom. You're dying.

697
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,333
Nobody can help you.

698
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,729
It's not gonna be okay.

699
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,156
That was cold.

700
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,561
Yeah.

701
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,988
What did you get for Christmas?

702
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,683
I got a watch, a vintage LP,

703
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,249
and a second
edition Conan Doyle.

704
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,522
And if that wasn't bad
enough, my patient's dying.

705
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,725
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.

706
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,792
No one ever wants to
go in the patient's room.

707
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,804
Even the candy stripers
leave them alone.

708
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,764
But I saw something amazing.

709
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,067
Pure truth.

710
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,514
She told her mother
that she was dying.

711
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,310
Stripped her of all hope.

712
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,653
That sounds horrible.

713
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,814
It was like watching some
bizarre astronomical event

714
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,600
that you know you're
never gonna see again.

715
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,618
You tell people the cold, hard
truth all the time. You get off on it.

716
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,027
Because I don't care.

717
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,360
She cared.

718
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,926
And she did it, anyway.

719
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,434
She did it because she cared.

720
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:25,302
The angels of Christmas have finally
given House a present he can appreciate.

721
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,469
Oh, don't ruin it.

722
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,036
Don't pin this on Christ.
He's got enough nails in him.

723
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,275
Patient had to die...

724
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,628
Why don't you take off that hat?

725
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,777
It's Christmas. It's a reindeer.

726
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,980
It's a moose, on a Jew.

727
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,454
Who cares?

728
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,288
Things have their place.

729
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,159
You wouldn't hang dreidels
from a Christmas tree.

730
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,630
You could.

731
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,463
Things don't care.

732
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,871
No, they don't.

733
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,669
Happy solstice, House.

734
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,477
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen</i>

735
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,985
<i>Let nothing you dismay</i>

736
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,045
<i>Remember, Christ, our savior</i>

737
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,557
<i>Was born on Christmas day</i>

738
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,991
<i>To save us all
from Satan's power</i>

739
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,928
<i>When we were gone astray</i>

740
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,896
Have you people
no holiday spirit?

741
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,695
Bring me the
eggnog of good cheer.

742
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,565
House, if you have
something to say, say it.

743
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,900
If you don't, give us a chance
to get home before Santa.

744
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,496
Scrooge.

745
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:29,802
Give the patient risperidone.

746
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,374
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying. She's not crazy.

747
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,778
I am gonna perform
a Christmas miracle.

748
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:41,649
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort
and joy Comfort and joy</i>

749
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,881
You said all the other causes
of osteopetrosis are fatal.

750
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:49,689
Except for the one we discounted
early because it was impossible.

751
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,731
When a fetus forms,
it's just a mass of cells.

752
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,065
<i>Breast tissue covers
extensive portions of the body.</i>

753
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,537
As the fetus develops,
most of this tissue recedes

754
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,234
remaining only
in the fun places.

755
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,402
But sometimes,
extra breast tissue

756
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,036
<i>is left behind in places
where it doesn't belong.</i>

757
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,809
Risperidone does
a lot of things.

758
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,750
One is it makes breast tissue
swell so we can find it more easily.

759
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,550
You're telling me I could
have breast cancer?

760
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,716
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.

761
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,727
Taub's parents have a
winter condo in Florida.

762
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:23,955
They're still New Yorkers.

763
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,530
Actually, my
parents... Don't care.

764
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,992
I told a parable.

765
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,564
Now, I'm gonna raise the dead.

766
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,033
Give me that syringe.

767
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,564
That's got to be a fat deposit.

768
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,303
Yes, I could be wrong.

769
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,004
If I am, she's
dead. So, shut up.

770
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,911
What's that?

771
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,922
Risperidone also
causes galactorrhea.

772
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:55,423
What's that? Galactic?

773
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,661
Open your mouth.

774
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,790
Relax. You've had it before.

775
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:00,957
I am not...

776
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,530
Milk?

777
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,703
Ew!

778
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,970
We'll cut out your mom's
tumor and start her on chemo.

779
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,079
All the rest of your
symptoms should go away.

780
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,822
I love you.

781
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,655
I know.

782
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,037
Have a wonderful life.
