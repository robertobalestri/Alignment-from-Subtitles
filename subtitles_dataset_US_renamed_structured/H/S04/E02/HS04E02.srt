1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,266
<i>Big Eye, this is Cobra Zero Six.</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,000
<i>Just entered Indian Country,
approaching way point four.</i>

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,134
<i>Request confirmation to
engage target on first approach.</i>

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,609
<i>Roger, Cobra Zero Six.</i>

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,146
<i>Big Eye waiting for
confirmation as well.</i>

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,524
<i>If we wait any longer, Big Eye,</i>

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:15,925
<i>we're not gonna have
any choice in the matter.</i>

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,043
<i>I can't exactly
do a U-turn here.</i>

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,610
<i>Roger that, Cobra.
Hold for confirmation.</i>

10
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,606
Captain Cooper, are you okay?

11
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,113
What happened?
You weren't answering.

12
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,542
Because the damn comm
cord got disconnected!

13
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,408
You spend a billion
dollars on the avionics

14
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,470
and don't bother to check
the comm connection?

15
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,125
No, I checked that
twice before you got in...

16
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,641
And the next time you
ask us to test a prototype,

17
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,996
it'd be nice if your directional
gyro didn't spin like a top

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,216
when I'm supposed to
be 500 feet off the floor.

19
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,655
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:34,718
I'll go review the simulation, see
if I can figure out what went wrong.

21
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,733
Who is this man?

22
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,803
Come on, take a shot.

23
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,346
I'm not gonna fire you every
time you get a wrong answer.

24
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,642
Neville Chamberlain.

25
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,841
You're fired.

26
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:34,682
Does this man look like he's ceding
Czechoslovakia to a fascist dictatorship?

27
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,216
It's Buddy Ebsen, the actor.
He's dead. Why are we...

28
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,992
Buddy Ebsen was the original tin
man in the <i>Wizard of Oz,</i> for a day.

29
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,299
He was diagnosed allergic to
the aluminum dust in the makeup.

30
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,031
His lungs failed. He nearly
died. Question is, why?

31
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,732
Didn't you just say
he was allergic?

32
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,607
You may not have legs, but you
got ears. I suggest you use them.

33
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,203
I said he was
diagnosed allergic.

34
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,046
Since we are currently short
exactly one interesting patient,

35
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:07,178
we are gonna figure out what really
happened to Buddy Ebsen in 1938.

36
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,314
Now, on one hand,
he's not getting deader.

37
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,724
On the other hand, your
jobs hang in the balance. So...

38
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,353
House?

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,229
I want seven alternate
diagnoses when I get back.

40
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,200
Did you forget how
to count to three?

41
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,437
I get a budget for three.

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,910
Doesn't mean I
can only hire three.

43
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,674
Actually, that's
exactly what it means.

44
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,182
I cut the permanent
salaries by 10%.

45
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,117
Over three years, that'll more than
make up for the breakage on the 27

46
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,930
that I'm gonna weed out
over the next few weeks.

47
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,650
There's 40 people in there.

48
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,319
Row D, you're fired.

49
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,893
I didn't actually
count all the resumes.

50
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,092
This is stupid. You can't
manage that many people.

51
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,294
You're just gonna keep
weeding them out arbitrarily?

52
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,394
Sure, and having
them sitting in my office

53
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,903
schmoozing about their
favorite Algerian surfing movies

54
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,805
is a much better system.

55
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,640
Wait a second. Were
you in Row D? Yes.

56
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,476
My apologies. My boss says
I'm being arbitrary and stupid.

57
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,483
Row D is not fired.
Row C is fired!

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,644
What? WOMAN: Great. Thank you.

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,815
See, that was not arbitrary.

60
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,019
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I've been paged.

61
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,262
That's interesting.

62
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,854
Apparently, I paged myself.

63
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,101
If you have a resume
there, I'm not interested.

64
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,148
But I wouldn't mind hearing
how you got my pager number.

65
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,012
It's not a resume.

66
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,652
$50,000.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,157
Does One-Eyed Nicky want
me to run that to Jimmy the Nose?

68
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,351
It's for my medical bills.

69
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,518
I need you to find out
what's wrong with me.

70
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,996
Insurance is usually
cheaper than that.

71
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,761
Cash means there's
something to hide.

72
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm a captain in the Air Force,

73
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,066
about to start a new assignment.

74
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,836
NASA's astronaut
training program.

75
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,372
I discovered salt
and created FM radio.

76
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,312
Something is wrong
with my eyes, my ears...

77
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,614
Well, if it's fixable, the
Air Force will do it for free.

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,718
If not, it doesn't matter.

79
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,121
There are a hundred
applicants ready to take my place

80
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,887
who don't need to be fixed.

81
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,791
I need to do this off the books.

82
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,729
I did the research. You're
the best, you break rules,

83
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,357
and you don't care about
anyone except yourself.

84
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,330
Well, let's say that's true.

85
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,737
You get a new job.

86
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,638
Hospital gets a
nice wad of cash.

87
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,140
What do I get?

88
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,046
I crashed a flight simulator

89
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,546
because I started
to hear with my eyes.

90
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,819
The aluminum could
have been tainted...

91
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,920
Don't care. New patient!

92
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,089
30-year-old female
with synesthesia.

93
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,769
New rules.

94
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,565
You generate a lab
report, you shred it.

95
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,439
X-ray, you melt it.

96
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,273
No notes, no records, nothing.

97
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,349
As far as you're concerned,
the patient is Osama Bin Laden

98
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,284
and everyone not in this room
is Delta Force. Any questions?

99
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,084
We're protecting
Osama Bin Laden?

100
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,418
It's a metaphor.

101
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,652
Get used to it. Any
more questions?

102
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,839
And you're not even
gonna tell us her name?

103
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,865
You think her name might be
connected to what's wrong with her?

104
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,864
Here's Osama.

105
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,174
Now, you all have numbers, so
we're gonna do this alphabetically.

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,447
8, 15 and 5.

107
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,041
Is the synesthesia new?

108
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,510
Yes.

109
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,181
Any history of similar
symptoms or psychiatric...

110
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,518
No, nothing.

111
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,083
Are you on any prescription
meds or use any other drugs?

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,095
No. Should we trust her answers?

113
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,098
What, you think I'd pull you off
Buddy Ebsen just for a junkie?

114
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,497
Can we trust your answers?

115
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,898
You gotta trust someone, right?

116
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,266
No.

117
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:20,034
Has anyone close to you been sick
lately? A family member, co-worker?

118
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,870
No, not that I'm aware of.

119
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,706
Two down. Kitty Carlisle?

120
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,577
Do you spend much
time above 20,000 feet?

121
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,475
Why would you ask that?

122
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,816
People who fly are
immobile for long periods.

123
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,823
Could be a leg clot that embolized
to the brain through a PFO.

124
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,552
That's an unusual choice.

125
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,187
Well, like you said, you wouldn't
interrupt Buddy with anything that wasn't.

126
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,393
The patient is a frequent flyer.

127
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:53,196
13, 32, 39, get Osama an
EEG, MRI and angiogram.

128
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,400
How many of you think
that Oswald acted alone?

129
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,278
If, by alone, you mean that
he was unaware that the CIA...

130
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,375
Oh, shut up.

131
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,818
Split yourself into two groups.

132
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,287
Test her blood. Test her stool.

133
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,618
Who likes the designated hitter?

134
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,027
You're wrong. You're
lucky you're not fired.

135
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,465
Two more groups LP and cultures.

136
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,196
Who doesn't know what
a designated hitter is?

137
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,406
Okay, here's her address.

138
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:30,035
I want you to break in and
find out what she's hiding.

139
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,444
Why don't we just ask
the patient for the key?

140
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,695
Well, if you can find out what
she's hiding just by asking,

141
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,244
we'd have to redefine hiding.

142
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,648
You want to live in this
country, learn the language.

143
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,153
What do you want
the rest of us to do?

144
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,262
30 people for three openings
and I want you to wash my car?

145
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,463
This is not why I busted
my ass in med school.

146
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,648
We spend a half an hour
cleaning the car. Big deal.

147
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,334
It's demeaning.

148
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,105
Work is demeaning?
We're too good for this?

149
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,271
Oh, don't give me that
honest day's labor crap.

150
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,646
We all went to med school so we
wouldn't have to do an honest day's labor.

151
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,582
What about an
honest hour's labor?

152
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,095
In exchange, we
get a shot at learning

153
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,452
from one of the best
diagnosticians in the world.

154
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,320
No, we don't.

155
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,654
If we did, we'd be one of the ones
drawing blood or checking for toxins.

156
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,162
We're done.

157
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,788
He's just not gonna cut us loose

158
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,096
until we've dusted his
shelves and starched his shirt.

159
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,373
I'm out of here. Who's with me?

160
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,986
Are we sure he wasn't joking?

161
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,184
Maybe this is just a test.

162
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,456
Everything's a joke and everything's
a test and he wants us to do it.

163
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,655
Come on, get up here.

164
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,699
Well, I could try, but I
pulled a muscle in 1987.

165
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,669
I didn't waste two years repeating
medical school to be arrested and deported.

166
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,364
Why'd they make you repeat?

167
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,304
Not enough gym credits?

168
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,342
According to the
state of New Jersey,

169
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,278
medical schools in my country
suffer from not being from this country.

170
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,264
You know, if you get it open, you're
gonna have to come down and let me in.

171
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,314
Or, you could
just wait out here.

172
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,086
This is a competition.

173
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,560
Change your mind?

174
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,027
No.

175
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,801
Then why are you here?
Never intended to quit.

176
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,539
Then why did you... Intended
to get everyone else to quit.

177
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,946
Get off the car.

178
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,448
I need to clean it.
We need to clean it.

179
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,618
I stole his keys. We'll
take it to a car wash.

180
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,564
He's got people breaking
into a woman's apartment.

181
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,116
Obviously, respecting personal
property isn't one of the rules.

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,798
I told the super I was
worried about my niece.

183
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,898
She hasn't been
answering the telephone.

184
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,239
Nice guy. Two daughters
in Mount Holyoke.

185
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,781
No evidence of clots, and other
than elevated red blood cell count,

186
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,946
the blood work was unremarkable.

187
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,926
You got a problem with
the naked female form?

188
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,491
Not at all.

189
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,557
Maybe she's just not used to seeing it
spooning with the naked dolphin form.

190
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,398
That's not a dolphin,
it's a porpoise.

191
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,166
There is a difference, you
know. Salary, for one thing...

192
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,174
You want us to
give you a minute?

193
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,892
High red blood cell
count likely means...

194
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,248
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

195
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,152
There are a lot of different
explanations for elevated red blood cells.

196
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,484
Yeah, well, which one fits best

197
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,115
with the damaged flue
that your competitors found

198
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,626
in the gas fireplace
in Osama's cave?

199
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,623
Car's clean.

200
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,725
Did you just see a blond
guy with a pretentious accent?

201
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,201
Can't see an accent.

202
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,532
Good point.

203
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,129
Can I have my car keys back?

204
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,642
Give me the car keys, put the
patient in a hyperbaric chamber

205
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,737
and no more prime
numbers for you.

206
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,381
Thank you.

207
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,381
The high pressure and oxygen will flush
the carbon monoxide from your system.

208
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,842
This much oxygen for
too long can have some

209
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,222
toxic effects, so
we'll do this in cycles.

210
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,889
Can I talk to you a second?

211
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,730
You're working that thing all
the time. Is everything all right?

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,912
We're supposed to be watching
her heart rate and blood pressure.

213
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,098
Yeah, I was until you
pulled me over here.

214
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,005
I'm sending out a
consult on another patient.

215
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,098
Okay.

216
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,821
What? I'm not quitting my old
job until I'm sure I've got a new one.

217
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,780
I didn't say anything.
You had a look.

218
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,316
Yeah, I did. Sorry.

219
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,914
Hey, I think she's
having a heart attack.

220
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,284
No, I just feel a little funny.

221
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,481
Tachyarrhythmia.

222
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,116
Call the code!

223
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,857
Nothing.

224
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,127
V-fib. Where the
hell is... Clear!

225
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,012
Are you crazy? You can't use
those! We're in a hyperbaric...

226
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,236
Clear!

227
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,534
She's on fire!

228
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,649
Her heart's beating.

229
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,191
And we are so fired.

230
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,194
We've started her on
nitro and blood thinners.

231
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,862
Electrolytes and post-arrest
EKG were normal.

232
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,996
The attack was not
caused by the procedure.

233
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,938
So, what does cause synesthesia,

234
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,067
high red blood cell
count and heart attack?

235
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,637
Aren't we gonna discuss what caused
the sudden appearance of burnt flesh?

236
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,143
He brought charged paddles
into an oxygenated room.

237
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,709
And you didn't stop him.

238
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:18,315
Means either you thought it was a chance
worth taking, making you a hypocrite,

239
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,725
or you thought he'd fail,
making you a cutthroat little pixie.

240
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,154
What causes...
Takayasu's syndrome.

241
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,962
Not without a rash and a
fever. It's gotta be Whipple's.

242
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,663
No way. You ever see
Whipple's without abdominal pain?

243
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,171
Stop it!

244
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,140
This argument is distracting
every male and lesbian here.

245
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,735
You're both right.

246
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,335
In the sense that you've
convinced me that you're both wrong.

247
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,438
What about cardiomyopathy?

248
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,006
Structural abnormality
causes the heart attack

249
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,952
and throws clots to the
brain, leading to synesthesia.

250
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,147
How old are you?

251
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,817
I'm 21, unless it's relevant.

252
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,387
Okay, Scooter.

253
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,227
Do a transoesophageal echo.

254
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,791
And since the positive divisors of
26, are 2 and 13, have them assist.

255
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,030
The rest of you,
go to the cafeteria.

256
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,131
Document 10 things that
can cause infection, each.

257
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:25,148
I wouldn't. Someone named 17 thinks there
could be lysteria in the cream cheese.

258
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,724
17's a stupid number.

259
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,562
What's Chase doing here?

260
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
You saw Chase?

261
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,760
Last night. Outside my office.

262
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,633
That's interesting.

263
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,714
It's more curious
than actually...

264
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:43,438
Chase took a job at the Mayo
Clinic in Arizona a week ago.

265
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,170
Interesting.

266
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:54,454
It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you
saw, but Chase, the one you fired.

267
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,455
Not interesting.

268
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,890
Someone who looked like someone
I used to know walked by my office.

269
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,795
It's always interesting when
repressed guilt starts unrepressing itself.

270
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,992
The only thing I
feel guilty for is this.

271
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,005
We're gonna feed this
endoscope down your esophagus,

272
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,945
try to find where your
heart might be damaged.

273
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,745
It's gonna feel uncomfortable,
but just keep swallowing,

274
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,412
I promise you'll be fine.

275
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,221
She's ready.

276
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,920
Go ahead, take a whack.

277
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,487
Right, so if we don't find
anything, House blames me.

278
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,328
Or you find something
and get a gold star.

279
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,833
Why don't you wanna do it?

280
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,702
House isn't gonna be impressed by a
gray hair doing his ten-thousandth echo.

281
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,171
So, you're just
being altruistic?

282
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,233
That makes you
suspicious, Doctor...

283
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,913
Call me 13. I'm
not getting invested.

284
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,813
Her heart's structurally sound.

285
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,287
No clots, no valvular defects,
no wall motion abnormalities.

286
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,051
Got that from
structurally sound.

287
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,024
What did she say?
Structurally sound.

288
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,892
I assume you're not all walking
with me to tell me you found nothing...

289
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,954
It showed a
short burst in the...

290
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,062
Okay. Who's next?

291
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,774
It showed a short
burst of atrial flutter.

292
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,680
I ran a rhythm strip twice
and got the same result.

293
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,797
Stop.

294
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,541
Okay, here's how
we diagnose in transit.

295
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,069
I lead, you draft, I move, you
move, I stop, you stop. Got it?

296
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,290
Flutter could mean
hormone overproduction...

297
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,659
Wait a second. Why did you
do the test? I gave it to Scooter.

298
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,777
- We didn't think it mattered.
- It doesn't.

299
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,787
It matters that you let her.

300
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:40,760
Okay, 10, 24, 39, run a TRH
stimulation test for hyperthyroidism.

301
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,125
That could cause
another heart attack.

302
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,927
Proving her first attack
was caused by her thyroid,

303
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,628
which is kind of
the point, right?

304
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,066
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

305
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,298
I ride alone.

306
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,707
The hormones
stimulate your thyroid.

307
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,975
Don't worry if you get
flushed or you start to sweat.

308
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,812
It means the thyroid's working.

309
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,314
And, if you want, I
can remove that mole.

310
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,786
I'm a plastic surgeon.
You're allowed a little vanity.

311
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,916
I'm fine with the way I look.

312
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,483
Good for you.

313
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,722
Although, I do find it a bit odd
that someone so self-assured

314
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,462
doesn't want her doctors to
find out what's wrong with her.

315
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,766
What are you talking
about? Why else am I here?

316
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:29,070
You're jerking us around. You're
handcuffing us with all these restrictions.

317
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,871
I'm feeling warm.

318
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,942
Her pulse is 120. Stop pushing.

319
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,625
If House thought this would handicap
us, he wouldn't have taken the case.

320
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,174
Or maybe that's
why he took the case.

321
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,395
He wants to see if we can
get it out of her on our own.

322
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,684
What did you find at her home?

323
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,417
You were in my home? Nothing.

324
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,221
Travel pictures, yearbook, her
name on an employment slip?

325
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,105
We weren't checking
for that stuff, okay?

326
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,791
Obviously, House
didn't want us to.

327
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,493
You're gonna... You're
gonna out me, aren't you?

328
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,865
You're gonna ruin everything.

329
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,598
Nobody's trying to
do anything, just relax.

330
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,167
This is not a normal response to
the test. Pulse and BP are too high.

331
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,835
Get away from me.

332
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,414
Get away from
me! Don't touch me!

333
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,390
Paging me during <i>Judge Judy,</i>
not the best way to win my affections.

334
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,983
She had another
episode of synesthesia.

335
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,330
It set off a psychotic attack.

336
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,911
And now she ran in there, and must
have jammed something in the handles.

337
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,563
So, you call me?

338
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,334
The guy with one good
leg and zero leverage?

339
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,841
We break that door down, security
shows up and her name goes in a file.

340
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,815
Luckily, violence
is not the last resort.

341
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,414
Extortion is. So, go
ahead. Extort her.

342
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,122
If you don't open this door,
we're gonna break it down.

343
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,395
Clever.

344
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:02,231
An appeal to her deep concern for hospital
property. Let's see how that works.

345
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,267
If you don't open this
door, you're going to die.

346
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,639
Go away!

347
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,088
Well, you seem
to be getting to her.

348
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,910
She doesn't care if she dies.

349
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,107
You think she wants to die?

350
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,482
No, but I think she only wants to
live under certain circumstances.

351
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,520
Open up, or I blab
your secret to everyone.

352
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,855
You don't know anything.

353
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,690
I do.

354
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,369
No!

355
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,723
Anybody think that
a sedative might...

356
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,041
I'm trying. Okay!

357
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,218
Who's that?

358
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,351
Who is she?

359
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,227
Osama Bin Laden.

360
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,871
Who is she?

361
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,278
Is she okay?

362
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,980
She's stable. Who is she?

363
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,554
What did House tell you?

364
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,355
That she is on the run from
an international crime syndicate.

365
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,860
That's what he told us.

366
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,057
House may be your
boss, but I'm House's boss.

367
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,657
You wanna work here,
I better be okay with it!

368
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,727
Honestly, he didn't tell us anything
about who she was or what she...

369
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,670
Her name's Greta Cooper.

370
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,802
Wants to be an astronaut.

371
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,539
Doesn't want NASA to know her brain's
getting her ears confused with her eyes.

372
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,675
I went through her mail.

373
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:02,851
You're a virus, House. Now
instead of one liability, I've got 20.

374
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,450
Apparently only 19.
Which number was it?

375
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,154
From now on, everything
you do gets charted.

376
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,356
With pen, on paper,
in a binder that says,

377
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,695
"Princeton-Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital" on the cover.

378
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:14,859
Mom!

379
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,212
If you wanna run something
through the labs, I get a copy.

380
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,228
If you do scans, I get a copy.

381
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,901
If you think about doing
scans, I get a copy.

382
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,377
You know my current thoughts,
right? I don't have to put those on paper.

383
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,243
Three issues.

384
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,312
One, number 10, you're fired.

385
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,116
She told you?

386
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,182
Well, it had to be someone
who went to her home.

387
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,252
Number 26 is half asleep.
Missed his afternoon nap.

388
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,661
Obviously, he
doesn't feel guilt.

389
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,641
Number 2 is here on a
visa, she can't jeopardize.

390
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,758
You can't know.

391
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,894
And that chick's been
pointing at you since I walked in.

392
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,403
Issue two, what
causes synesthesia,

393
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,808
high RBC, tachyarrhythmia
and panic attacks?

394
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,313
Slight glucose elevation.
That says thyroid.

395
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,145
Baseline thyrotropin's 1.1.1.3.

396
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,460
Whatever. Her thyroid's working.

397
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,611
What about her liver?

398
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,450
Original ALT levels weren't
abnormal, but were near the edge.

399
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,387
She has patient data
on her PDA. I do not.

400
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,949
I saw the lab values. You said
we couldn't write anything down.

401
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,460
I also said I wanted answers.

402
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,395
Liver cancer's the most likely.
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

403
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,659
We need to do an MRI.

404
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,132
Which brings us to issue three.

405
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,680
You're saying we
can write stuff down?

406
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,328
To you, I'm
saying, you're fired.

407
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,372
To everyone else... But
you said specifically...

408
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,838
I hate tattletales.

409
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,172
She tattled on 10.
Now, you've tattled twice.

410
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,974
Issue three...

411
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,513
Come on, let's go.

412
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:39,177
Issue three, how do we do
tests when we can't do tests?

413
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,483
Dr. Cuddy didn't say we can't do
tests, she said we have to chart.

414
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,183
If we chart, we won't
get consent, so we can't.

415
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,522
The patient's life may
depend on her consenting.

416
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,461
Her dreams depend
on her not consenting.

417
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,227
So, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

418
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,566
You've got an hour.

419
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,839
How do you scan a liver
without scanning a liver?

420
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,709
And what's Cameron doing here?

421
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,183
Interesting, so you're
seeing Cameron now.

422
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:17,019
No, not interesting,
because not seeing. Saw.

423
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,950
My patient won't consent
to MRIs or ultrasounds.

424
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,393
You've dealt with more liver
cancer than anyone else here.

425
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,490
So, you want me to share the secret
scanning techniques I learnt in Nepal?

426
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,229
Unfortunately, the monks
made me swear a blood oath.

427
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,395
Where was she?

428
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,563
In the lobby.

429
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,102
I guess, we could palpate
the area around the liver.

430
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,145
Which won't work unless the
tumor's enormous, which you know,

431
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,079
which means you're here because
these visions are freaking you out.

432
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,445
Did...

433
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,048
She had blond hair. Why
would I hallucinate that?

434
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,054
Yes, yes!

435
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,182
Why are you merging
Cameron and Chase?

436
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,955
We should find out before the next
time you see her, when she'll be black.

437
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,520
Because, of course, it's
scientifically impossible for a person

438
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,964
to go back and visit
somewhere they worked.

439
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,093
No. But since
she's not a dead cat,

440
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,661
it is scientifically impossible for
her to be in two places at once.

441
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,201
Physics joke. Don't
hear enough of those.

442
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,676
She just called me from Arizona.

443
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,440
Notice the area code, 480.

444
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,006
They put an offer on
a place in Scottsdale.

445
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,712
Do you want to talk or should
I? I guess we could both talk.

446
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,255
Although, they're engaged,
and if you're staying in touch,

447
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,847
you might wanna buy them...

448
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:33,694
Maybe it's not repressed
guilt, maybe it's just panic.

449
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,600
Right now, you've got enough
fellows to build a railroad,

450
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,127
but you're gonna have to narrow that
room full of numbers down to three people.

451
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,074
Any chance you could turn this creative
brilliance towards my patient's liver?

452
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,908
I think you're gonna
choose people

453
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,990
for reasons that have
nothing to do with their skills.

454
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,974
I think you're gonna choose people
just because you can't stand them.

455
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,216
Because if you like
them, well, that's just

456
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,956
stressful.

457
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,092
Stress.

458
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,423
I like it.

459
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,636
We need to stress
the patient's liver.

460
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,034
You mean make her sick?

461
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,300
I mean, make her
sick in a specific way.

462
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:17,400
If her liver's given to malfunctioning,
we make it malfunction.

463
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,411
Are we on the other
side of wrong here?

464
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,243
Don't we have an ethics board
that we should consult, or...

465
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,646
I fired you.

466
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,876
No, you didn't.

467
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,146
He fired you, you're number 6.

468
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,450
No, I'm not. I'm number 9.

469
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,319
I approve of your shamelessness.

470
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,822
You're still fired.

471
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,622
So, how do we stress her liver?

472
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,163
Lying and paperwork, I get.
Shutting down organs, I think...

473
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,257
We could give her intravenous vitamin
D and stick her in a tanning booth.

474
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,895
If she goes into a coma, we
know it's a metabolic problem.

475
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,063
Nice.

476
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,402
But vitamin D's metabolized
by the liver and kidneys.

477
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,306
It wouldn't tell us
which one's screwed up.

478
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,401
We could get her wasted.

479
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,058
Give her shots of tequila and measure
how long it takes for her to pass out.

480
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,950
If it's too fast, then we know
her liver is not processing alcohol.

481
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,714
Means it's shot.

482
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,753
I like you, number 9.

483
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,629
You wanted to see me?

484
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:14,962
You a Mormon?

485
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,569
You're wearing a ring
from Brigham Young.

486
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,008
Or did your folks
just do the lawns?

487
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,620
The Church has a very progressive
attitude towards racial equality.

488
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,443
Don't care. Actually,
I'm thanking God.

489
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,614
You're the only
non-drinker we got.

490
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,776
We need a control group

491
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,788
to establish whether the liver's
deterioration is within normal range.

492
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,223
Got a big drinker, a medium
drinker, now I got a no-drinker.

493
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,954
Just do an MRI.

494
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,330
You really think the guy
who created heaven and earth

495
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,959
cares what you put
in your digestive tract?

496
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,698
Her dream shouldn't
outrank my religious belief.

497
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,570
Why not? Her dream
might come true.

498
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,905
All life is sacred, right?

499
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,411
We're not saving her life.
We're doing a diagnostic test.

500
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,848
Not even a real diagnostic test.

501
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,479
Well, that fake test
might really save her life.

502
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:14,058
Would you pull an ass
out of a pit on the Sabbath?

503
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,631
Would you or would you not pull
an ass out of a pit on the Sabbath?

504
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,576
Fine. I'll do it.

505
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,010
Good.

506
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,014
Why'd you have to pick tequila?

507
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,954
I assume a single malt
would've worked just as well.

508
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,923
Wasn't our choice.

509
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:52,187
Okay, two minutes,
then round number five.

510
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,263
So, tell me about
the magic underwear.

511
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,895
Is that why you're here?

512
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,908
I'm the big drinker,
doing my part for science.

513
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:06,309
The interesting question
is why your religious beliefs

514
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,745
are suddenly less
important than her dreams.

515
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,146
You're reversing your argument?

516
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,513
I know what I believe.

517
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,183
I'm just not quite
sure what you believe.

518
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,416
Well, LDS doesn't try to
dictate every detail of our lives.

519
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:20,391
When a situation isn't clear, we're
encouraged to make our own decisions.

520
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,291
But your judgment was to say no.

521
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,157
You used my judgment.

522
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,663
You made a good argument.

523
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,895
Rational arguments don't
usually work on religious people.

524
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,334
Otherwise, there would
be no religious people.

525
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,598
You're an atheist.

526
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,071
Only on Christmas and Easter.

527
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,817
Rest of the time, it
doesn't really matter.

528
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,434
Where's the fun in that?

529
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,273
A finite un-mysterious universe?

530
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,280
It's not about fun.
It's about the truth.

531
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,437
The truth is we're having
this debate because

532
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:46,341
you wanna figure
something out about me.

533
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,717
What have you got so far?

534
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,324
Greta! Greta!

535
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,835
She can't breathe.
We need to intubate.

536
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,191
No!

537
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,751
At least oxygen.

538
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,560
NASA will need to know why!

539
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,401
I checked the tests you ordered.

540
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,968
Did you just see Foreman?

541
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,675
You measured the
density of her teeth.

542
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,582
It's a shortcut test
for hypocalcaemia.

543
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,895
You had to have just passed him.

544
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,785
So, you suspected hypocalcaemia

545
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,085
from her complete
lack of broken bones?

546
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,820
Is that why you also
ran three tox screens?

547
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,055
Patient might have
been sneaking uppers.

548
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,572
He was in a white coat.
Did you hire him back?

549
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,158
Foreman is running the diagnostic
department at New York Mercy.

550
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,836
Have you been drinking?

551
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,243
She was having
trouble breathing.

552
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,062
Refused oxygen and intubation.

553
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,763
So you put her on a treadmill?

554
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:15,865
Records will show that we gave her oxygen
as a part of a routine cardio stress test.

555
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,275
She gets to breathe, your
boss gets her paperwork.

556
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,040
Whose idea was that?

557
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,538
It was a joint decision.

558
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,808
It never is.

559
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,255
So, how old were you
when your brother left home?

560
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,848
Why do you think that I...
Why aren't you answering?

561
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,693
Did your mother
initiate the divorce?

562
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,961
We should probably focus
on what's wrong with her lungs.

563
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,122
Are you Wiccan?

564
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,631
She really can't breathe.

565
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,033
Okay. Hold still.

566
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,632
What are you doing?

567
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,676
Auscultatory percussion.

568
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,677
If you have a
good ear, you can...

569
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,759
You didn't have a lot of friends,
because you chose not to...

570
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,581
You can hear
while you're talking?

571
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,287
You can detect not only structural
details, but small, deep masses.

572
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,121
Game's over.

573
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,467
You either have lung
cancer or tuberous sclerosis.

574
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,996
We need to cut you
open and biopsy.

575
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,301
That'll

576
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,008
leave a scar.

577
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,842
NASA doctors will
see it. They'll know.

578
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:33,146
I never opened for Springsteen
or slept with Barbara Feldon.

579
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:36,347
You can live for years
without dreams. Without lungs...

580
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,014
Find a way.

581
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,285
Okay.

582
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,990
As long as you keep saying
it strongly, you won't die.

583
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,669
Find a way.

584
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,138
How do we force a
patient into surgery?

585
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,439
Texas bag scam? Saratoga Wire?

586
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,211
Paris Exposition Trick?

587
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,684
The problem's not the
surgery, it's the scars,

588
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,119
and we have a plastic surgeon
here who can hide them.

589
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,283
Not that well. NASA's
gonna check every cranny.

590
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,089
I say we just put ether in her
oxygen and do what we have to do.

591
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,220
She'll sue.

592
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,354
For what?

593
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,229
Making it harder for her
to lie to the government?

594
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,131
We don't need to hide them.

595
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,727
We give her elective
cosmetic surgery.

596
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,035
The incisions will give
us access to her lungs.

597
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,769
And she's got an innocent
explanation for the scars.

598
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,538
You mean, like, liposuction.

599
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,581
No, no. Those incisions
are too far from the lungs.

600
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,481
We don't subtract. We add.

601
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,017
Turn her Bs into Cs.

602
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:48,058
It's myth that fake hooters blow
up at high altitude. She'll be fine.

603
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,160
Just think of it as one
giant rack for mankind.

604
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,128
I fought for years
to be taken seriously.

605
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,763
Trust me, you'll be taken more
seriously. Just sign the form.

606
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,936
This'll make me a joke.

607
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,704
There's gotta be another way.

608
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,617
I've known a few
people who had dreams.

609
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:15,779
One thing they all had in
common was they got laughed at

610
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,214
and they didn't care.

611
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,667
You bumped a
splenectomy for a boob job?

612
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,467
Would you condemn
this woman to a life

613
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,735
where people look at her
face when they talk to her?

614
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,403
If you don't explain this,
I'll cancel the surgery.

615
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,639
Can I explain why you're here?

616
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,409
I think I just told you why I...

617
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:48,010
I scheduled a diagnostic patient
for a boob job. Which is ridiculous.

618
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,816
So, obviously you
had to confront me.

619
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,186
With you so far.

620
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,466
But I'm gonna give you a reason.

621
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,617
Not a good one.

622
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,059
No. Not even
close to a good one.

623
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,663
But here's the drag
from your point of view.

624
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,927
My explanation will make sense.

625
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,027
Not to the board, not
to a judge, but to you.

626
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,436
So you'll let me do it.

627
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:11,135
Then, you're gonna have to sit next
to me at the administrative hearing.

628
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,608
Don't you have
better things to do?

629
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,282
It's in the best
interests of the patient.

630
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,994
Trocar's in, you're good to go.

631
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,737
Deflate the lung.

632
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,608
There, a cyst.

633
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,304
Cysts, I count three of them.

634
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,817
Probably the same, if
not more, on the left lung.

635
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:56,253
Okay, so what's been working
overtime to kill Miss Bin Laden?

636
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,349
We know her name now.

637
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,085
Yeah, but I forgot it.

638
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,560
Say the magic word and get
immunity from the next challenge.

639
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,325
Alveolar hydatid disease.
Hits all the organs.

640
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,230
She'd have had
multiple seizures by now.

641
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,665
Pulmonary Langerhans'.

642
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,635
Doesn't explain
the red blood cells.

643
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,830
Come on!

644
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,170
Cysts, synesthesia, heart
attack. You guys have gotta...

645
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:19,438
<i>Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</i>

646
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,282
<i>Raises red blood cell count,
causes masses on the organs.</i>

647
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,012
<i>If one of the masses is
a pheochromocytoma,</i>

648
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,816
<i>it could cause neurologic
episodes and a heart attack.</i>

649
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,961
Do you see a blonde guy who still
has peach fuzz standing up there?

650
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,493
Yeah.

651
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,462
This is a closed procedure.
Gallery's off limits.

652
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,765
<i>Not to the surgical staff.</i>

653
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,873
Are you gonna hire
that guy instead of us?

654
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,186
Not a chance. I love you guys.

655
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:08,285
Please dig out the cysts, histology
to confirm Von Hippel-Lindau.

656
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,328
Don't forget her chesticles.

657
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,872
Calling Arizona was
a very nice touch.

658
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,204
You do have residual...

659
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,403
Not only do I not
have residual feelings,

660
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,140
I didn't even have
primary feelings.

661
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,647
You freaked... You lied!

662
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,114
Because you knew it meant...

663
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,445
It meant nothing!

664
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,146
I saw him 'cause he was there.

665
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,849
Did Cameron follow her <i>bashert</i>
to the surgery department?

666
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,720
I think Chase followed her.

667
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,283
She's been a senior attending
in the ER the last three weeks.

668
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,795
A blonde senior
attending, to be accurate.

669
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,094
And Foreman, is he
back in neurology?

670
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,226
He's at New York Mercy.
He's been there a month.

671
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,270
Did you see Foreman?

672
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:53,396
No.

673
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,737
<i>Doctor Chang to OR.
Doctor Chang to OR.</i>

674
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,568
So, I'm cured.

675
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,479
You're fine for now, but Von
Hippel-Lindau is a genetic disease.

676
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,914
There's no cure.

677
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,077
Greta, you need to
come clean to NASA.

678
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,752
You said you got all the cysts.

679
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,348
They could re-emerge.

680
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,953
I'll go to radiology clinics.

681
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,586
I'll get regular screenings.

682
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,995
If something happened
while you're up there,

683
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,208
you'd be playing
Russian Roulette

684
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,632
- with other people's...
- Relax.

685
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,598
She doesn't have to
tell, and neither do you.

686
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:32,201
Turns out the NASA doctors even know
where the hyphen in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.

687
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,374
You called them?

688
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,372
I'm not an idiot.

689
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,885
Those shuttles fly
over New Jersey.

690
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,961
So, here we are. The big moment!

691
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:58,800
Which of you gets to live
to be abused another day?

692
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,638
And which of you goes home and rationalizes
being fired as character building?

693
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,925
The following numbers,
thanks for playing.

694
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:15,785
21, 19, 8, 34,

695
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:17,719
17,

696
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,281
29, 5,

697
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,087
36, 2.

698
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,890
The rest of you, 8 a.m. sharp.

699
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,730
I'll be in sometime
between 10:00 and 3:00.

700
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,236
Oh, and 26, stick
around a while.

701
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,274
I did nothing wrong.

702
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,078
Lots of people
did nothing wrong.

703
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,875
Other people screwed
up, I never even...

704
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,075
Other people took chances.

705
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,285
26?

706
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,700
Buddy Ebsen actually
was allergic to...

707
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,159
Yeah, I know. How old are you?

708
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,694
21.

709
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,593
You don't think it's relevant.

710
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,189
I'll likely have less time to
use the skills you teach us,

711
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,098
but I don't think that's
significant to you.

712
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,069
How about the fact that you
never went to medical school?

713
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,033
Which is why you let the
unlucky number do the trans echo.

714
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,443
At least you're
ethically unethical.

715
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:21,085
30 years I worked in the Columbia
med school admissions office.

716
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,816
Audited all the classes,
most of them, more than once.

717
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,155
I just never got a diploma.

718
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,525
You had to know I'd
find out sooner or later.

719
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,024
I know you break rules.

720
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,926
I thought maybe
you'd break one for me.

721
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,999
I can't hire you as a doctor.

722
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,900
But you can still tell
me what you think.

723
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,105
You could also fetch me coffee
and pick up my dry cleaning.

724
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,614
Until I can decide
whether or not to keep you.

725
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:54,744
So, I'm playing this whole
game to be, like, your secretary?

726
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,311
Assistant sounds
marginally less demeaning.

727
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,248
It's not my dream job.

728
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,693
Actually, it is. It's just
not your dream title.

729
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,747
Three weeks.

730
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,282
For someone who never misses
something small, you missed something big.

731
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,662
You're an idiot.

732
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,763
The hair, where
I'm working, or both?

733
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,802
The hair makes you
look like a hooker.

734
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,901
I like it.

735
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,597
Pulling pieces of windshield
out of car accident victims,

736
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,803
and reattaching fingertips
sliced off cutting bagels?

737
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,673
At least Chase's move
is only one step down.

738
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,377
I can do good here.
Get it out of my system.

739
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,013
Why'd you rat your
patient out to NASA?

740
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,925
I don't know who's been gossiping
about ethics instead of sex,

741
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,985
but I hope they've
already been fired.

742
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,690
Which number was it? Greta.

743
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,666
Number. No number, the patient.

744
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,711
How do you think she
got your pager number?

745
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,346
She came into the
ER, didn't want to talk...

746
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,668
I didn't rat her out.

747
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,036
You lied?

748
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,138
I suppose I should tell her
that before she keys my car.

749
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,735
Why lie?

750
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,940
I had to stop
some leaky faucets.

751
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,348
What did it matter?

752
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,915
It was no one's business.

753
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,246
Right.

754
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,483
She's gonna be the
safest astronaut up there.

755
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,870
Certainly more vigilant than the
guy next to her who's got no clue

756
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,227
about the aneurysm in
his head ready to pop.

757
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,628
Right.

758
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,833
You got a better reason?

759
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,101
You couldn't kill her dream.
