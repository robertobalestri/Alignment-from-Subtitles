1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:06,168
The Chinese Water Torture Cell
was invented in 1911 by Harry Houdini.

2
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,545
Nothing like new material.

3
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,842
He was lowered
head-first into the water.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,680
His ankles were locked and
bolted to the top of the tank.

5
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,886
I'm going to need a volunteer.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,155
Ooh! Ooh!

7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,890
The guy dislocating
his shoulder, right there.

8
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,795
Could you tell the guy
next to you to come up?

9
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,828
Come on, get up there, man.
Get up there, man! Come on!

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,702
Come on!

11
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,040
Hi, have we met before? No.

12
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,392
See, if you'd said, "Yes," you
could've gone back to your seat.

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,217
Now, can you vouch for this audience
that this is a glass tank full of water?

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,379
Yeah. No, you can't.

15
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,014
You haven't done
anything yet. Come on.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,558
Knock on the glass.

17
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,594
Solid glass. Knock on it.

18
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,892
It's real water, too.
Ilana, splash the guy.

19
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,996
Does that feel wet to you? Yeah.

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,348
And you think that proves
it's water? I think we have met.

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,814
Do you know the public washroom
behind the truck stop east of Omaha?

22
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,016
No. See, if you'd said, "Yes,"

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,407
that would have been so funny.

24
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,904
Hold out your arms for me.

25
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,337
You've done this
before, right? No.

26
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,907
Again, two choices and
you went for the unfunny one.

27
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,561
Now, remember. There's only
one thing you've got to be able to do.

28
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,971
Drag a screaming, crying
shackled man out of a tank of water.

29
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,235
Up!

30
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,211
Hey, you can swim, right?

31
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,412
Tell me you can swim!

32
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,012
Yeah.

33
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,615
Two answers, man. Two answers!

34
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,306
Is that part of the act?

35
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,775
I'm new. I think so.

36
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,645
Maybe not.

37
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,682
Get up here!

38
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,158
Aw.

39
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,303
Five eager doctors,
and no sick people.

40
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,834
Let us try and fill our spare
time with a new challenge.

41
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,011
The winner gets immunity...

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,140
I've a sick guy. I saw
this magician last night...

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,514
The girl's fine. He didn't
really cut her in half.

44
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,247
His heart stopped while he was
hanging upside down in a water tank.

45
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,551
A drowning man's heart
stopped? That is a mystery.

46
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,593
Along with immunity, the
winner gets to nominate two...

47
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,026
He lost consciousness almost
as soon as he hit the water.

48
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,396
You have to leave work at 6:00
p.m., but you make time for man dates?

49
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,523
What's the challenge?

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,193
Are we not allowed
to be friends?

51
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,346
I'm just hurt. When I asked
you to come see <i>Mamma Mia...</i>

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,396
No history of heart
disease, no angina, no...

53
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,506
He's lying.

54
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,906
About his history?
ER confirmed...

55
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,375
About everything. He's a
magician. That's what they do.

56
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,414
He screwed up the trick, started
drowning and he got a cardiac arrest.

57
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,109
You were talking
about a challenge?

58
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,676
The winner nominates
two of your competitors.

59
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,749
I will fire one of them.

60
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,089
Even if he was drowning,

61
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,039
it would have taken longer
to set off a cardiac incident

62
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,173
without some
underlying problem...

63
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,223
Fine. Go run your tests.

64
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,824
If you're wrong, you're fired.

65
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,062
If I'm right, do I stay?

66
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,595
If I say no, are you going
to let your patient die?

67
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,969
What's the challenge?

68
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,570
We can all applaud the doctor
who's willing to break all the rules.

69
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,640
But the real hero is
the unsung doctor,

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,313
toiling in anonymity, because he
broke the rules without getting caught.

71
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,152
I need to know you
have these skills.

72
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,624
I need you

73
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,588
to bring me the
thong of Lisa Cuddy.

74
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,324
Not kidding.

75
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,666
Thong, Cuddy, go.

76
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,179
It's how I got hired.

77
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,375
You're actually
considering this?

78
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,553
If you want to stand on principle,
I really respect you for that.

79
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,387
It's childish, unprofessional
and inappropriate.

80
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,551
The job is not worth it.

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,859
We should all beg off, tell him
we failed, no winners, no losers.

82
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,227
Fine.

83
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,178
You're going to
do it, aren't you?

84
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,898
Of course I'm going to do it.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,137
No valvular regurgitation, no wall motion
abnormalities, no other structural defects.

86
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,909
If you didn't sound so despondent,
I'd say that was good news.

87
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,483
No. It is for you, not for him.

88
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,712
Notice any heaviness in
your legs the last couple days?

89
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,253
Why isn't it good news for you?

90
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,086
Because if there's nothing
wrong with you, he gets fired.

91
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,490
Seriously? Somewhat
seriously. Your legs?

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,305
Haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

93
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,561
Shortness of breath?
Would it help if I puked?

94
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,004
Pick a card.

95
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,682
Any tightness in
your chest or arms?

96
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,004
Pick a card.

97
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,117
You don't seem too worried.

98
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,370
Would you please pick a card?

99
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:20,505
Our boss thinks your cardiac arrest was
just a result of you accidentally drowning.

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,846
Your boss is an idiot. Put
it back. Shuffle them up.

101
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,749
So, then, why
aren't you worried?

102
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,912
Either I'm dying or I'm not.

103
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,286
I mean, I don't want
the ride to be over,

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,758
but unless worrying is
some new form of treatment...

105
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,460
Your card. No.

106
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,896
I'm going to prep you for
a transesophageal echo.

107
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,076
You sure you shuffled these?

108
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,194
And I'm going to
need to sedate you.

109
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,898
Might wanna check
your wallet first.

110
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,804
Would you check your
wallet? It's part of the trick.

111
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,351
That's my card.
How did you do that?

112
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,183
Do it again?

113
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,829
Thought you weren't
playing. I'm not.

114
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,369
She'll fire you if
she catches you.

115
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,166
I don't think she can fire me
for not trying to steal her panties.

116
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,672
You trying to will them off?

117
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,106
If I had a plan,

118
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,509
the first part would be not
telling you what the plan was.

119
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,308
You haven't touched that coffee.

120
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,473
Yes, I have.

121
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,644
She can't keep her panties on
if they're wet. We work together.

122
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,818
One wins, protects the other.

123
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:40,293
Or, I win by myself, and then you try
desperately to convince me to spare you.

124
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,763
Dr. Cuddy!

125
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,298
Dr. Taub, are you okay?

126
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,235
I just tripped. I'm so sorry.

127
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,797
I have some extra time. Do
you need any help in the clinic?

128
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,069
Okay.

129
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,343
We found no apparent cause for
the arrest. TTE and TEE revealed no...

130
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,479
Send the patient home.
You can give him a lift.

131
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,547
We checked for
clots, we checked for...

132
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,802
You're reporting to me because
you're scared to report to House,

133
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,988
because you found nothing,
because this isn't a case.

134
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,529
And you thought
I'd save your ass.

135
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,030
Yeah.

136
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,700
I thought he was sick.
What was I supposed to do?

137
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,236
What about his lungs? Decreased
oxygen saturation leads to heart failure.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,241
ER didn't find anything.
ER wasn't looking.

139
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,710
Too busy trying to keep
him alive. Get an MRI.

140
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,384
<i>Clinic.</i> Yes, can
you ask Dr. Cuddy

141
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,581
to come to the
nurses' station? Stat.

142
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,214
<i>Right away.</i>

143
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,378
I asked you to get Dr. Cuddy.

144
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,976
Dr. Taub said
she'd be right out.

145
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,718
A fungus in my lungs? How would
I even get something like that?

146
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,940
Well, right now it's just a
theory. We don't even know if...

147
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,143
God, I knew I shouldn't have
done those mushrooms in college.

148
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,377
I'm sure there's no connection.

149
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,767
It was a joke.

150
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,356
You really lose your sense of
humor when your job's on the line.

151
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,500
Sorry. Most dying
people don't really like to...

152
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,139
Not that you're dying.

153
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,678
But a little sick
would be perfect?

154
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,180
Yeah.

155
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,248
My stomach!

156
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,947
Stabbing or throbbing?

157
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,667
Grey Turner's sign.
He's got internal bleeding.

158
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,818
I'll call surgery.

159
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,888
The surgeons have transfused
three units AB positive,

160
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,640
but they're still looking
for the source of the bleed.

161
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,498
No trauma. Could be liver
disease, vitamin K deficiency.

162
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,332
Only thing we know
for sure it's not, nothing.

163
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,481
And we would've noticed
something chronic like liver disease.

164
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,236
It's probably an
intestinal infarct.

165
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,673
No, I got it!

166
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,545
Eau de Cuddy.

167
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,414
No way. How did you get them?

168
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,749
Only one way.

169
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,249
These are not Cuddy's panties.

170
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,349
You don't think that I...

171
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,450
No.

172
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:31,294
Also, she's wearing
a red bra today.

173
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,230
Like I'm the only
one who noticed.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,265
Means that the
downstairs will match.

175
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,361
Do your research, people.

176
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,772
An intestinal infarct could
be linked to the cardiac arrest.

177
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,241
Hike up your skirt.

178
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,039
That's rude, even for you.

179
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,912
Hike it down then. You're wearing a
black bra. Let's see the underwear.

180
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,278
No!

181
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,386
You two cut a deal.

182
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,385
If you're not cheating,
you're not trying hard enough.

183
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,295
So, you're not wearing
any underwear?

184
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,799
There's a guy bleeding...

185
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,270
Foreman, she's not wearing any
underwear. You used to be more fun.

186
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,340
She's not wearing any
underwear, big deal.

187
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,069
When she stops wearing clothes,
then we can drop the medical stuff.

188
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,405
Let me see the MRI film.

189
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,705
We didn't get any images.

190
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,679
He started screaming
as soon as I turned it on.

191
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,238
Define soon.

192
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,548
I didn't even get a
chance to sit down.

193
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,015
You guys ever wonder

194
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,852
how he was going to
get out of that water tank?

195
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,424
You, come.

196
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,096
Lacerations in his digestive
tract and his spleen is shredded.

197
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,972
Ladies and gentlemen, I
have nothing in my hands,

198
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,068
nothing up my sleeve.

199
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,778
I do have something in my pants,

200
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,112
but it's not going to help
with this particular trick.

201
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,776
Watch closely.

202
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,820
How you been? Fine, 'til now.

203
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,693
Ta-da!

204
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,925
Now, you disappear.

205
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,399
Look familiar?

206
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,145
The MRI's magnet ripped this
through your intestine into your spleen.

207
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,342
Forgot about that, on
account of almost dying.

208
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,116
Where's Dr. Kutner?

209
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,155
He's no longer on your case.

210
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,520
'Cause there's
nothing wrong with you.

211
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,923
I didn't screw up that trick.

212
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,485
Everything that's
happened can be explained

213
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,190
by you being forgetful
and incompetent.

214
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,857
You screwed up,
you passed out...

215
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,494
Know my favorite time to lie?
When my life hangs in the balance.

216
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,936
Your life doesn't
hang in the balance.

217
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,750
You know your life
doesn't hang in the balance.

218
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,333
Your reputation might hang...

219
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,173
You ever do magic as a kid?

220
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,248
You seem like the
type. Lonely, obsessive...

221
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,215
I outgrew it. You?

222
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,410
Pick a card?

223
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,954
Too much trouble.
Can I just pick my nose?

224
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,649
I am not a hack.

225
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:15,187
I tell you how it's
done, will you go home?

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,467
Guess you're going to make it
magically appear in my wallet...

227
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,665
You are a hack.

228
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,184
I don't screw up.

229
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,395
Nosebleed that major
means he's actually sick.

230
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,038
Means the cardiac
arrest was a symptom.

231
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,400
Stop gloating.

232
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,499
I'm not gloating.

233
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,703
Then what's that smirk?

234
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,541
No smirk, it's just how I look.

235
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,137
What about the
underwear challenge?

236
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,740
I declare it officially on hold.

237
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,183
Not really fair, but I get it.

238
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,663
It's Cuddy's.

239
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,738
Pull down your pants.

240
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,103
You think I'm lying?

241
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,076
No, I want to give you a
reward. Yes, I think you're lying.

242
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,745
Cardiac arrest
plus nosebleed. Go.

243
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,409
Patient has no significant family
history, no angina, no prior attacks.

244
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,008
What if isn't his heart?

245
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,496
What if it's the vessels
around his heart?

246
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,957
Polyarteritis nodosa causes
cardiac symptoms and hypertension,

247
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,184
which makes his nose bleed.

248
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,456
You know what else makes your nose
bleed and your heart race? Cocaine.

249
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,553
Guy works in a B-list
nightclub in Atlantic City.

250
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,566
He's got to be taking
regular rolls in the snow.

251
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,262
You, take the gloater
to the patient's drug den.

252
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,305
Make sure you pat down
his pockets before you leave.

253
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,898
You and Big Love, biopsy a
blood vessel from around the heart.

254
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,376
Test for polyarteritis nodosa.

255
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,445
You, in my office.

256
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,480
Those aren't my panties.

257
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,817
I know.

258
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,419
Hypothetical.

259
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,792
A young woman does
something clumsy in public,

260
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,193
and instead of laughing it off,
she gets irrationally upset. Explain.

261
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,631
Maybe she's clumsy
'cause she's nervous

262
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,765
'cause she forgot to do
her spelling homework.

263
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,537
Well, in my
hypothetical, she's eight.

264
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,071
This girl's not insecure.
Seems more like she's afraid.

265
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,194
Do you have a point, or did you
just get a new book of riddles?

266
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,880
I think you're hiding
a medical condition.

267
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,478
I'm not.

268
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,318
I'm glad we had this talk.

269
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:02,919
Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms,
because they think they can't get sick.

270
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,261
If you've got something going
on, I need you to take care of it.

271
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,767
And I take your compassion
entirely at face value.

272
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,497
It's not compassion.
It's self-interest.

273
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,764
I want my team healthy.

274
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,966
It's not self-interest.
It's curiosity.

275
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,302
I dropped a file, House.

276
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:19,778
I start bleeding from the eyes, I'll
be sure to make an appointment.

277
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,808
Okay.

278
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,314
Well, found some pot.

279
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,445
Bag it.

280
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,183
I'm not sure it really
fits the symptoms.

281
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,817
Of course not, but it'd be
irresponsible to leave it here.

282
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,587
You have a quarter? No.

283
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,107
How did Cole get
those panties off Cuddy?

284
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,155
They were never on her.

285
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,201
No way those are hers.

286
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,035
Aha.

287
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,037
Tularemia.

288
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,539
No, he'd have to have rabbits.

289
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,271
True, maybe a tick
jumped from a rabbit

290
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,940
and landed on one of
these white, fluffy alligators.

291
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,210
Then it jumps onto our patient,

292
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,549
transfers the bacteria, causes
pericarditis, explains everything.

293
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,890
What are you giving me?

294
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,453
How'd you do the trick?

295
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,794
If I explain, it becomes mundane.
You lose the actual magic.

296
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,065
What do you mean,
"The actual magic"?

297
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,333
You think you're actually
sawing women in half?

298
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,018
You going to tell me
what's wrong with me or not?

299
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,877
Magic is cool. Actual
magic is oxymoronic.

300
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,410
Might not even be oxy.

301
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,644
You're not going to
tell me unless I tell you?

302
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,553
You got a nurse
to plant the card.

303
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,249
I can't get a nurse
to help me pee.

304
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,847
You got a buddy
to plant the card.

305
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,417
The fun is in not knowing.

306
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,102
The fun is in knowing.

307
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,368
My head. Oh, I've
got a headache.

308
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,169
How bad? Is it new?

309
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,371
It's not too bad.

310
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,882
I'll just take one
of these Vicodin.

311
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,021
You eat a lot of beets, you
have an electric toothbrush

312
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,360
and you sleep less
than six hours a night.

313
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,694
That's impressive.

314
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,600
The red betamine from the beets
stains the plaque deposits on your teeth,

315
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,172
which are then swirled by
your spinning toothbrush.

316
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,707
Your heavy lids and your
prematurely aging skin

317
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,868
tell me that you're
carrying a major sleep debt.

318
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,673
That was way cooler
before you explained it.

319
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,112
It was meaningless
until I explained it.

320
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,083
People come to my show because
they want a sense of wonder.

321
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,952
They want to experience
something that they can't explain.

322
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,026
If the wonder's gone
when the truth is known,

323
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,358
there never was any wonder.

324
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,692
You have tularemia from your
rabbits. I put you on antibiotics.

325
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,531
You'll be better in
a couple of days.

326
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,131
Sorry to spoil the mystery.

327
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,406
Thank you.

328
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,621
I'll get it.

329
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,826
Oh, my God!

330
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,987
You're not wearing
underwear. Of course, I'm...

331
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,792
A skirt that tight,
you got no secrets.

332
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,062
A skirt that tight I can
tell if you got an I IUD.

333
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,296
Have you seen Dr. Cole?

334
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,393
No...

335
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,300
You're blushing. I am not.

336
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,840
Look at me.

337
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,435
Oh, my God!

338
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,678
How'd you do it?

339
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,511
So I'm safe?

340
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,955
In this job, yeah. Your
crotch, on the other hand...

341
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,253
How'd you do it?

342
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,624
Prayer, mostly.

343
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,494
Just tell me. Does Cuddy
have her groove back?

344
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,336
It'd be rude of me to discuss.

345
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,934
You handed over her panties.

346
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,603
I don't think gallantry's
really an option at this point.

347
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,805
If I tell you, then
where is the magic?

348
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,815
He passed out. Ultrasound
revealed bleeding around his heart.

349
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,612
We drained 100
cc before it stopped.

350
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,924
The antibiotics aren't working.

351
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,148
It's obviously not tularemia
or any other infection.

352
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,349
Excuse me, we were talking.

353
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,497
Bleeding around the heart
could mean botched biopsy.

354
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,602
When Cole was looking for...

355
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,821
Why would you accuse the man

356
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,386
who decides your
fate of screwing up?

357
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,293
Those really were her panties?

358
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,429
Cole has traveled through
the forest of crustaceans

359
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,269
and brought us a treasure.

360
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,002
He has earned his reward.

361
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,753
If I could just get the
immunity, I would...

362
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,110
No, Sophie. You can't.

363
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,546
Use whatever criteria you want.

364
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,312
Could be a clotting issue.

365
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,219
If he developed DIC after the surgery,
even a normal biopsy bleeds out of control.

366
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,815
So, cardiac arrest and DIC.
What's the common denominator?

367
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,770
Could be cancer. We've
been looking at his chest

368
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,126
since he got here. It's clean.

369
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,473
So the main mass
is somewhere else.

370
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:09,128
Throws off a clot, blocks an
artery in his heart, causes the arrest.

371
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,033
Good. Go find out where
he's hiding his cancer.

372
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:20,178
If you swallowed any more metal
now would be a good time to tell us.

373
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,077
My hands feel kind of numb.

374
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,212
You lost a lot of blood.

375
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,258
I'm going to die.

376
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,385
Everybody gets
scared in the hospital.

377
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,671
You're sick, you feel awful...

378
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,357
No.

379
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,400
This time tomorrow,

380
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,931
I'll be dead.

381
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,950
So who's going on the block?

382
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,681
He thinks he's dying.

383
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,123
He's probably right.

384
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,792
Tomorrow.

385
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,057
You decide to put
me up, I totally get it.

386
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,131
Nothing personal.

387
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,724
I haven't decided anything.

388
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,859
But you don't like me.

389
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,403
I like you.

390
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,434
There's some fluid in the lungs.

391
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,169
No masses.

392
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,770
I'm manipulative.
I play the game.

393
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,647
I can be a bitch.

394
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,977
There's a dark spot.

395
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,443
Damage from where
the key ripped through.

396
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,953
You're probably expecting
me to bash the others.

397
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:41,392
Give examples of how they screwed
up. You know I can. I'm a good doctor.

398
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,254
As good as anybody
around here. Probably better.

399
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,632
And you know that's the
only thing that matters.

400
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,235
What's that?

401
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,648
It's not a tumor, it's another
bleed. This one's in his kidney.

402
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,019
And his thigh. He's
bleeding all over the place.

403
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,324
His timetable may be right on.

404
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,397
It was creepy. The patient
predicted his own death.

405
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,802
Would have been more impressive if
he predicted that he wasn't going to die.

406
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,082
Of course, that
takes longer to prove.

407
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,438
Could be a symptom.

408
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,633
Sense of impending doom.

409
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,041
Yeah, could be
adrenal gland disorders,

410
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,704
blood issues, anaphylaxis...

411
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,624
If you're going to kiss
his ass to protect your ass,

412
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,617
at least wait until
he's had a good idea.

413
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,412
It's a symptom of
him being a charlatan.

414
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,429
He's a second-rate magician
with a mysterious illness.

415
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,764
Why wouldn't he
predict his own death?

416
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,267
If he's wrong, we all forget it. If
he's right, he goes out a legend.

417
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,102
He got scared right
after a transfusion.

418
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,789
Tainted blood has been known to
cause a sense of impending doom.

419
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,095
It could also explain the DIC.

420
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,067
I predict all your
pagers go off right now.

421
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,164
But if it had happened...

422
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,639
Anyone bother looking at his panel?
His immunoglobulin levels are low.

423
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,985
That doesn't tell us
anything specific...

424
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,741
Are you acting stupid because
you know you're safe? Clever.

425
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,306
Low immunoglobulin plus
failing heart, plus fluid in the lungs,

426
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,750
plus internal bleeding
equals amyloidosis.

427
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,981
He's bleeding way too
much for amyloidosis.

428
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,353
Say anything about his
hands or feet feeling weak?

429
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,792
He said his hands felt numb, but
that's explained by the blood loss.

430
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,501
No! Do not give
me credit for that.

431
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,968
Close doesn't count. That's how
people get sucked into this stupidity.

432
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,130
He's seizing.

433
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,798
Somebody stabilize him.

434
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,699
The rest of you pull his medical
records. Go back 10 years.

435
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,145
Look for joint pain, fatigue,
anything associated with amyloidosis.

436
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,677
Mr. Finn, nod if
you can hear me.

437
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:48,982
You had a grand mal seizure.

438
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,920
We're giving you liquids
and an anticonvulsant.

439
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,753
Just try to rest.

440
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,355
Pulse is dropping.
He's stabilizing.

441
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,239
You're not going to put
me on the block, are you?

442
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,391
I haven't decided
who I'm going to pick.

443
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,899
It's cool.

444
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,766
His legs look swollen to you?

445
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,430
Slight swelling could be renal.

446
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,996
I baby-sat for you.

447
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,532
I decided I'm going to make my decision
based solely on who deserves to be here.

448
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,079
That's admirable, though stupid.

449
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,925
You shouldn't save the strongest.
You should get rid of the strongest.

450
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:20,351
Eliminate your competition,
which is definitely not me.

451
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,081
And I'm your friend.

452
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,698
And how you going
to explain to your kid

453
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,284
that I can't take him to the zoo
next week because you got me fired?

454
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,021
Kutner, he's going
to seize again.

455
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:34,795
Flank pain, his kidneys are
shutting down. Also, Amber's a racist.

456
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,730
You knew they'd get paged?

457
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,296
I noticed a trend.

458
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:44,969
If nobody does anything,
sick people often gets sicker.

459
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,706
Do you think it's remotely
possible they had sex?

460
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,306
They're both single. It's
still legal in the blue states.

461
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,112
She barely knows him.

462
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,651
You know, in some cultures,

463
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,086
hiring people to steal someone's
underpants is considered wooing.

464
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,490
You should move there, because
here it's just, you know, creepy.

465
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,653
This was no woo. This
was an effective test!

466
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,827
This is beneath my skills.

467
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,560
Kidneys are shutting down.

468
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,899
Led to a sodium deficiency
and caused him to seize.

469
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,234
Kidney failure means that I
was right about amyloidosis.

470
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,764
Except that nothing in his medical
history remotely indicates amyloidosis.

471
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,402
So, kidney failure proves
I'm right about the bad blood.

472
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,743
Bad blood doesn't explain
the heart or the liver.

473
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,340
His major symptoms didn't
start until after we transfused him.

474
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,113
His cardiac arrest's no longer
considered a major symptom?

475
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,518
Not when it's
caused by drowning.

476
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,066
So your new theory is that you
were an idiot to take this case.

477
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,649
Yes. Can I go test
that theory now?

478
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,422
Waste of time. He needs a bone
marrow transplant for the amyloidosis.

479
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,806
You'd have to
irradiate him first.

480
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,973
If they're right
about the blood,

481
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,432
you'd be destroying his
immune system for nothing.

482
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,959
Which could be a good thing.
Does he have a really crappy life?

483
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,768
Go prove I'm right. Do a
subcutaneous fat biopsy.

484
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,680
At least let us eliminate
the bad blood theory.

485
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,439
Check the blood banks for
mis-marks and contamination.

486
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,578
You got two hours.

487
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,811
That's completely arbitrary.

488
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,787
No, if I'd said that you've
got three lunar months,

489
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,153
that'd be completely arbitrary.

490
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,000
Two hours is how long
it's going to take Big Love

491
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,822
to finish the biopsy
that you guys can't do,

492
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,352
because you're wasting
two hours checking blood.

493
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,463
Nine, three!

494
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,897
Five, all!

495
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,204
Hey, brought you
something from the cafeteria.

496
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,671
It's not a bribe.
This is a bribe.

497
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,571
How much?

498
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,775
$1 million.

499
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,975
$5,000.

500
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,417
This is so wrong.
House specifically said

501
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,321
you can use whatever
criteria you want.

502
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,917
I've got money. You need money.

503
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,557
Hand me that slide.
Right now, you're earning

504
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,624
what I'm earning,
which is miserable.

505
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,568
I know what school your
kid's at. I know what it costs.

506
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,074
I've seen his picture.

507
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,969
He's going to need braces.

508
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,609
No RBC damage.

509
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,058
Nothing wrong with storage.

510
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,450
I'm going to double-check
type and start cultures.

511
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,311
We still got 32 minutes left.

512
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,550
Time flies. What have you found?

513
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,704
You're checking up on them.

514
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,160
It means Cole's finished with
the biopsy and it was negative.

515
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,786
Inconclusive.

516
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,707
The fat doesn't always
give you the answer.

517
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,599
You need to biopsy his actual
organs, lungs, kidneys, liver.

518
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,546
We stick another needle
in him, he'll hemorrhage.

519
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,835
Unless we start
treatment for amyloidosis.

520
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,771
Unless it's not amyloidosis.

521
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,105
If he has an infection,
the radiation will kill him.

522
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,474
Show me evidence of infection.

523
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,012
We need more than two hours.

524
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,957
Some of these cultures will
take at least a day to grow.

525
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,916
He'll be dead in a
day. Like he predicted.

526
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,350
No, he'll be half a day off.

527
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,514
Would it make you guys feel any better if
I let you argue with me for three minutes

528
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,354
before I order you to
treat for amyloidosis?

529
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,826
No. Just treat for amyloidosis.

530
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,328
No, don't.

531
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,827
You're playing the Cuddy card?

532
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,027
That's why I'm here.

533
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,365
Amyloidosis was your idea.

534
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,530
I was wrong.

535
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,870
Yeah, me, too.
You were never fun.

536
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,473
Give me the blood.

537
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,276
I'm type AB. Give me the blood.

538
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,892
Whatever's in there
could be killing him.

539
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,316
In where?

540
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,876
How much tainted blood do
you think they keep in here?

541
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,197
How many people
have gotten sick from...

542
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,299
It would have to have been
the first batch, the splenectomy.

543
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,601
That's when the
symptoms started.

544
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,459
Okay, let's transfuse
blood from those donors.

545
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,691
I'll be fine, we'll move
on, treat for amyloidosis.

546
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,800
Fill 'er up!

547
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,204
I have a new theory.

548
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,476
You're not stubborn.

549
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:44,013
You're not going to get checked
because you already know the answer.

550
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,578
I found an old
picture in your wallet.

551
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,814
Of course you did.

552
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,519
I wasn't snooping. I
needed lunch money.

553
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:59,028
I figure it's your mom, except
she looks about 32 years old.

554
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:04,201
Now, the only reason not to
update a photo in 20-odd years,

555
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,605
is she's not talking to you,

556
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,503
which would be interesting,

557
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,010
or she's dead, which
would also be interesting.

558
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,515
She's dead.

559
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,044
So is Grover Cleveland.

560
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,789
Pretty young to have a dead mom.

561
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,952
Even younger 20 years ago.

562
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,387
I Googled her obituary.

563
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:38,595
Said she died at New Haven
Presbyterian after a long illness.

564
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,739
Parkinson's?

565
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,948
Huntington's chorea.

566
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,179
I'm sorry.

567
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,426
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

568
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,121
No, you're not.

569
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,195
You don't want a
doctor on your team

570
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,994
who's slowly losing control
of her body and mind.

571
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,865
Huntington's isn't the only
thing that causes tremors.

572
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,494
You think it's just
a coincidence?

573
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,336
I think you're the only one
on the team who drinks decaf.

574
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:23,305
I've been switching it out with the
regular ever since you dropped that file.

575
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,978
You're trembling because
you're hopped up on caffeine.

576
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,652
The first file wasn't my fault.

577
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,283
Medical explanation for
that is, people drop things.

578
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,726
I've been walking
around thinking I'm dying.

579
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:37,955
You are.

580
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,156
You don't know that.

581
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,942
With Huntington's,
it's inevitable.

582
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,528
No, you don't know,
because I don't know.

583
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,038
How could you not get tested?

584
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:55,671
If your mom had it, it's a 50% chance
you're a bomb waiting to explode.

585
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,512
Not knowing makes me do
things I think I'm scared to do.

586
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,145
Take flying lessons, climb
Kilimanjaro, work for you.

587
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,752
Yeah, 'cause if you knew, you
couldn't do any of those things.

588
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,184
What?

589
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,285
You're sweating.

590
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,195
You're burning up.

591
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,935
House, you're sick.

592
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,852
Could be pneumococcus. That'd
cause chest pain and a stiff neck.

593
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,242
It's not pneumococcus.

594
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,507
Let me check your lymph nodes.

595
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,214
I'm not the patient!

596
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,160
The patient is the one
whose body is shutting down.

597
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,710
I'm having a benign
transfusion reaction.

598
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,348
Pseudomonas would present as
an armpit rash. Take off your shirt.

599
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,551
You first. House, you
gotta let us do this.

600
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,855
We can't biopsy him
without bleeding him to death.

601
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,260
You are not biopsying me.

602
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,991
How's your stomach?
Any diarrhea?

603
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,502
The more transfusions you have,
the greater the chance of you reacting.

604
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,199
I've had three in a decade. The
fever will be gone in a couple of hours.

605
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,434
I heard somewhere that
doctors ignore symptoms

606
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,203
because they think
they can't get sick.

607
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,087
You told us to give you the
blood so that you wouldn't...

608
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,409
I am not sick.

609
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,914
Fever is a symptom.

610
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,880
But not of what the patient has.

611
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,351
My kidneys are working. I'm
not bleeding out of every organ.

612
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,580
Yet.

613
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,189
This is a waste of time,

614
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:14,454
and it's distracting you
from the actual case.

615
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,988
What's wrong?

616
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,293
The room's spinning.

617
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,398
You okay?

618
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,766
Dizzy, my mouth just went dry.

619
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,031
Could be a symptom of a...

620
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,403
It's a symptom of narcotics.

621
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,106
Who spiked my...

622
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,120
What'd you drug him with?

623
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:49,160
Amber's nickname is "Cutthroat
Bitch" and you're pointing at me?

624
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:51,230
Got the kidney sample.

625
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,423
You're the only one
with nothing to lose.

626
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,629
Could have been you. You don't
seem to care if you get this job or not.

627
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,815
Yeah, I've been here for eight
weeks because my subscription

628
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,171
to <i>Masochism Weekly</i> ran out.

629
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,608
You're the only one who hasn't
asked me not to put them on the block.

630
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:08,511
You're either going to
pick me or you're not.

631
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,693
You're fair enough to try
to make the right decision,

632
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,310
and arrogant enough that nothing
I can say will change your mind.

633
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,821
I don't want it to be over, but,

634
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,518
unless worrying about it is
going to make a difference...

635
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,568
I'm going to run some stains.

636
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,339
He'll be less of an ass to you.

637
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,818
Patient dead yet?

638
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,218
No.

639
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,321
It's a little much
for a first date.

640
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,657
Obviously, you've
never dated me.

641
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:00,563
Feels like you already got
the lung and kidney samples.

642
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,190
Now I just need a
piece of your liver.

643
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,498
Hey, you might want to
use a little bit of lidocaine.

644
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,935
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

645
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,732
Slight pinch!

646
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,844
You drugged me.

647
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,914
You drugged me.

648
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,547
Stopped by the lab.

649
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,483
Your mutinous team is starting to
worry about life on Pitcairn Island.

650
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,816
All your biopsies are clean.

651
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,052
Because there's
nothing wrong with me.

652
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,985
Did Foreman finally okay
the amyloidosis treatment?

653
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,155
Patient's scheduled
for irradiation at 9:00.

654
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,659
You risked your life again.

655
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,331
You couldn't be sure
he had amyloidosis.

656
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,048
You can't be sure
that I couldn't be sure.

657
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,472
You did one test.
It was negative.

658
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,768
Inconclusive. Well, then,

659
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,300
by all means, flood your
body with possibly lethal blood.

660
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,779
I usually like to give the
lethal blood to Foreman,

661
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,474
but I'm the only
one who's type AB.

662
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,212
Of course you're type
AB, universal recipient.

663
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,416
You take from everybody.

664
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,481
Of course, you're type
O. Universal donor.

665
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,493
No wonder you're
paying three alimonies.

666
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,221
How do you know
what blood type I am?

667
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,426
I don't. It just seemed
to fit the metaphor.

668
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,128
No, no, no, no.

669
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,103
Did you test my
blood for something?

670
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,212
Why would you test
my blood for something?

671
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,606
I didn't.

672
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,302
You must have told
me what you were.

673
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,812
Who the hell chats
about their blood type?

674
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,008
You had to have tested me.

675
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,154
There's no reason to ask
anyone their blood type.

676
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,253
You're about to run
out of here, aren't you?

677
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,624
Nurse, can I have a
moment with my patient?

678
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,998
He's due in radiation.

679
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,469
It's too late, he's dying.

680
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,637
Told you.

681
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,771
I'm sorry I doubted you.

682
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,846
It'd be a shame if your
secrets died with you.

683
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:38,317
Perhaps you've got that
trick written down somewhere.

684
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,349
Or maybe you want to tell
me and I'll write it down for you.

685
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,288
That way you can live on.

686
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:51,233
I'm taking it with me. See,
that way it stays magic.

687
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,472
You were wrong about everything.

688
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,134
It was never magic,
and you're not dying.

689
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,237
What's your blood type?

690
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,978
Type A.

691
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:06,841
What?

692
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,683
Trust me, it's way
cooler to know.

693
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,488
Where's Finn?

694
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:18,386
Up my sleeve.

695
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,364
It's not amyloidosis.
And his blood's fine.

696
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,526
We just gave him the wrong type.

697
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,936
Caused the DIC, explains the
bleeding, multi-system failures.

698
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,098
But we tested his blood.

699
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:32,871
That's because we don't test
blood for type. We test for antibodies.

700
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,688
Because your body only
makes those antibodies

701
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,704
when you actually
have that type of blood.

702
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,421
Well, apparently, he
has one more symptom.

703
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,351
His body's making an
extra antibody, type B.

704
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,446
Combine that wit h his natural
type A and, presto, change-o,

705
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:47,390
he magically pulls blood
type AB out of his hat.

706
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,450
Would you stop that? God, yes.

707
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,622
Autoimmune diseases can make
antibodies go haywire, but, still...

708
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,529
It's happened. And
apparently, it's happened again.

709
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,229
I finally have a case of lupus.

710
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,273
Flush him with saline,
transfuse four units, type A

711
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,601
and start him on steroids.

712
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,836
He'll be back hoodwinking
idiots in no time.

713
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,930
Big Love, rise.

714
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,214
Use their power wisely, my Lord.

715
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,880
I nominate Amber.

716
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,148
Cutthroat Bitch, rise.

717
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,796
You're surprised?
You're everyone's pick.

718
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,790
Next victim.

719
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,392
I nominate

720
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,460
Kutner.

721
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,074
Now everyone's surprised. Why?

722
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,346
You said I don't have
to justify my picks.

723
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,511
No, I said you could use
whatever criteria you want.

724
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,486
Doesn't mean I don't wanna know.

725
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,149
He was right about
this being a real case,

726
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,855
he was right about the botched
transfusion and he's your love nugget.

727
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,296
You got no reason to pick him.

728
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,198
But somebody else does.

729
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,501
Kutner's a liability.

730
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,670
He electrocuted himself,
lit a patient on fire,

731
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,546
it's only a matter of time before
he burns the hospital down.

732
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,712
You made a deal with Cuddy.

733
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,554
That's how you
got her underwear.

734
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,561
She sold it to you for the right
to put her choices on the block.

735
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,894
You said get her
underwear. I got it.

736
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,162
Your scheme was brilliant,

737
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,734
and you're fired.

738
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,835
You're all about
breaking the rules.

739
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,810
Her rules, not mine.

740
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,377
The whole point of this
was to subvert Cuddy.

741
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,177
You became her partner, gave
her power she didn't already have.

742
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:30,517
Let her greedy fingers into my cookie jar,
which sadly is not as dirty as it sounds.

743
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,389
Thanks for playing.

744
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,711
What the hell is this?

745
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:10,757
Looks like an envelope with the results
of a genetic test for Huntington's inside.

746
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,490
Did you look?

747
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,361
I thought it'd be fun
to find out together.

748
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:15,991
I don't want to know.

749
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,763
No, you're afraid to know.

750
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:22,572
I might die. So could you. You
could get hit by a bus tomorrow.

751
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,508
The only difference is you don't have
to know about it today. So why should I?

752
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,012
I don't have to know
the lottery numbers,

753
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,016
but if someone offered
them to me, I'd take them.

754
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,247
You spend your whole
life looking for answers,

755
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,879
because you think the next
answer will change something.

756
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,892
Maybe make you a
little less miserable.

757
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,838
And you know that when
you run out of questions

758
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,627
you don't just run
out of answers,

759
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,860
you run out of hope.

760
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,198
Are you glad you know that?
