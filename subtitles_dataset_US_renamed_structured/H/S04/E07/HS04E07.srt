1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:03,598
<i>We just arrived.</i>

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,469
<i>Yeah. Kids okay on your end?</i>

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>Good.</i>

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,578
<i>Yeah, yeah. He's very excited.</i>

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,479
<i>Hey, hey. Listen, I gotta go,
okay? I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:15,743
<i>Excuse me.</i>

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,980
<i>Get away. Get away.</i>

8
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,251
<i>Sorry about that. Sorry.</i>

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,352
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,597
Excuse us.

11
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,676
<i>I ought to go back and
kick the hell out of that guy.</i>

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,645
She was old enough, she
didn't have to scream like that.

13
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,865
It's okay, Dad. It
didn't bother me.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,463
<i>For the first time, none
of these people bother me.</i>

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,601
<i>I just think, "36 more hours."</i>

16
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,804
Thirty-six more hours? How
do you figure that, Kenny?

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,972
<i>Tomorrow at this time,
I'm scheduled for surgery.</i>

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,484
<i>It's a 10-hour procedure,
throw two in there for prep,</i>

19
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,544
<i>thirty-six until I'm just
another face in the crowd.</i>

20
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:31,514
<i>Kenny has a frontonasal
encephalocele. It's a midline deformity.</i>

21
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,891
<i>He's here to undergo
a facial bipartition.</i>

22
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,361
And what does that mean?

23
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,728
Well, we have five
surgeons, four nurses.

24
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,460
<i>He's going to require
six units of blood.</i>

25
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,865
<i>Will it fix him?</i>

26
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,630
It'll repair a lot of
the damage done...

27
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,727
We need a sound byte.

28
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,672
Would you say, "He'll be
ready for the junior prom"?

29
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,540
<i>Yeah, yeah. That's
probably true.</i>

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,579
No, I mean, I
need you to say it.

31
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,738
<i>Dr. Chase,</i>

32
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,247
we got an issue.

33
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,207
Heart rate's skyrocketing,
he's over 180.

34
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,809
He's in v-fib. Paddles!

35
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,012
<i>Charge to 300.</i>

36
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,214
Turn that camera off.

37
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,756
Is this a reaction
to anesthesia?

38
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,019
Haven't given it yet.

39
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,384
Clear!

40
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,893
Crank it to 360.

41
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,255
<i>I said turn that damn
camera off! Clear!</i>

42
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,864
<i>A teenage boy with a cranial
facial deformity was about to undergo</i>

43
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:54,666
<i>a reconstructive procedure, when
he had an unexplained cardiac arrest.</i>

44
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,970
<i>Good.</i>

45
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,339
<i>Good?</i>

46
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,871
<i>I mean, go on.</i>

47
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,509
<i>We have the patient
on a pacing wire,</i>

48
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,316
<i>it's the only thing
keeping his heart going.</i>

49
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,789
<i>Yeah, we know. We're doctors.</i>

50
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,792
<i>Right, it was meant
to be just for them.</i>

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,725
Just be yourself.

52
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,858
<i>Until we are able to figure out
exactly what is causing the heart block,</i>

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,301
<i>the reconstructive surgery
is on hold, obviously.</i>

54
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,801
<i>That's "yourself"?</i>

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,470
<i>Fascinating case.</i>

56
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,034
<i>I will see you again
after I have saved his life.</i>

57
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,274
<i>Have a warm bath waiting.</i>

58
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,776
<i>Are you following me?</i>

59
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,412
<i>Darnell will be trailing
you throughout the case.</i>

60
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,355
<i>Pretend we're not here.</i>

61
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,984
<i>But if I do that, won't
I bump into you?</i>

62
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,221
<i>We'll stay out of your way.</i>

63
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,195
<i>No, it was a joke.</i>

64
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,563
<i>See, I became a doctor because
of the movie,</i> Patch Adams.

65
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,528
<i>Listen, do you wanna get
ahead of me and maybe back up,</i>

66
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,335
<i>I don't know, low down,
so I look more powerful?</i>

67
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,102
That's perfect. Yeah?

68
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,735
Also, my eyes look better
in rooms with summer colors.

69
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,576
You know what?
It's black and white...

70
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,745
You think I like the cameras?

71
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,914
You think I want the whole world
watching you check out my ass

72
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,015
and question my wardrobe?

73
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,970
Would it be better if I checked out
your wardrobe and questioned your ass?

74
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,292
A little part of me...

75
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,625
There is no little part of you.

76
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,895
Thought that maybe you would see

77
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,129
what great PR this
could be for the hospital

78
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,969
and not make me force
you to act like a human being.

79
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,804
You using force
on me is intriguing.

80
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,968
On the other hand,
cameras make people act.

81
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,241
Sometimes like human
beings, sometimes just weird,

82
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,874
sometimes they
wear open-tip bras.

83
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,209
It's cold in here.

84
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:51,821
A less obvious point is that I need my team
to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart.

85
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,794
That production company is covering
all the medical costs for this kid.

86
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,888
So either you let
them continue filming

87
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,934
or the kid goes home
with the same face.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,375
<i>Sorry about that. Private.</i>

89
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,374
<i>She waxes her
moustache once a month</i>

90
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,679
<i>and sometimes gets some
pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.</i>

91
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,453
So, did he hire you flat out or are
you competing for one of the spots?

92
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,055
I'm not sure what
you mean by that.

93
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,725
She's not competing.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,964
She was handpicked by
House. She's safe, like Foreman.

95
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,938
So that takes three
spots down to one.

96
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,010
Where's Foreman?

97
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,570
- He's in the bathroom.
- Good.

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,014
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

99
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,911
<i>Walks look good on camera.</i>

100
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,513
<i>They give the illusion of
the story moving forward.</i>

101
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,621
<i>New patient.</i>

102
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,294
Sixteen-year-old boy with
second-degree infranodal heart block.

103
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,427
<i>Post-arrest.</i>

104
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,596
Any reports of
light-headedness or syncope?

105
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,911
<i>Certainly not light-headedness.</i>

106
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,271
<i>Why did you hire her?</i>

107
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,502
<i>Not in front of the company.</i>

108
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,907
<i>Are we gonna be on TV?</i>

109
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,275
<i>I'm making a music video.</i>

110
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,109
<i>Come on. A little
faster, more energy.</i>

111
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,910
<i>Why are you glad
Foreman's not here?</i>

112
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,781
<i>Because he would object
to what I'm about to do.</i>

113
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,012
<i>Oh!</i>

114
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,718
<i>Sorry.</i>

115
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,661
Hey, buddy.

116
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,831
You stay in there, we'll be out here,
making sure he doesn't move again.

117
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,494
God! Finally I
hear myself think.

118
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:42,892
Our patient has...

119
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,494
Why did you hire her?

120
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,670
Because she has way
more diagnostic experience

121
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,268
than the other swimsuit
models I was considering.

122
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,577
Our patient has a frontonasal
encephalocele with a midline cleft.

123
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,747
Don't stare directly at it.

124
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,119
So what caused "Big
Head's" heart to stop?

125
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,953
Simple. His big head.

126
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,289
Increased intacranial pressure
would cause heart block.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,297
Wrong. Sixteen years they've been
testing that insane noggin to death.

128
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,799
What about a
congenital heart defect?

129
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,391
He has a midline
anomaly on his head,

130
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,905
makes sense he'd have a
midline anomaly in his heart, too.

131
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,964
The 16 years of
testing didn't show?

132
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,306
Why did you bring her
in so late? It's not fair.

133
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,254
The rest of us... Hey,
hey, hey! You wanted fair,

134
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,713
you picked the wrong
job, the wrong profession,

135
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,147
the wrong species.

136
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,239
Forget the deformity.

137
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,082
Treat the patient like he's
any other really, really ugly kid.

138
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,145
Infection? Could
be endocarditis.

139
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,383
Well, since he doesn't
have a prosthetic heart valve,

140
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,688
I assume you're thinking
he's an IV drug user?

141
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,988
House said assume he's normal.

142
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,306
Dealers don't ask for ID and
don't care what you look like.

143
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,265
Nice. You're right
about the habit.

144
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,800
You're wrong
about the substance.

145
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,394
Blackened skin under the nose
equals frostbite from huffing Freon.

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,268
Freon's toxic, it
damages the heart.

147
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,740
Discoloration could
be acanthosis nigricans.

148
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,709
It's a common side
effect of these deformities.

149
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,143
There's also discoloration
on the cheeks and forehead.

150
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,407
Do a nuclear study.

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,814
If I'm right, you'll see
scarring of the heart.

152
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,851
I'm not part of some game, am I?

153
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,690
I gave up a career because I
thought this was a firm offer.

154
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,991
Yes, this is a real offer.

155
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,239
I think she might be an idiot.

156
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,339
Who?

157
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,739
No, she can't be an idiot.

158
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,902
I mean, she was in
the CIA, for God's sake.

159
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,412
And the Bay of Pigs
was a daring triumph.

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,414
She had good ideas in Langley.

161
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,642
All your ideas.

162
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,185
She was able to identify
that they were good ideas.

163
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,720
Stab in the dark
here, is she pretty?

164
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,846
She's new.

165
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,321
She's nervous. She's a C-cup.

166
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,154
She said one dumb
thing in a differential.

167
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,921
They all say dumb
things in differentials.

168
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,188
A D-cup?

169
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,627
If she's no good, just fire her.

170
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,666
I can't. I just hired her.

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,398
She left a career.

172
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,934
Wow.

173
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,941
Either that's actual guilt, or I
have got to see this woman.

174
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,542
<i>My son is not huffing Freon.</i>

175
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,983
<i>Mr. Arnold, Dr. House is like a
savant when it comes to diagnostics.</i>

176
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,415
<i>What's his genius theory?</i>

177
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,218
<i>Because Kenny's not normal, he's
doing drugs to deal with his pain?</i>

178
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,227
<i>Maybe the way to look at
this is that you are normal.</i>

179
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,140
<i>And what's that
supposed to mean?</i>

180
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:28,625
<i>You're like any other parent who
thinks his kid can't be doing drugs.</i>

181
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,435
<i>Doing this because my
dad thinks I'm on drugs?</i>

182
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,621
I was doing drugs behind
my parent's back at your age,

183
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,171
and I had a lot
less reason to be.

184
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,245
Not that your life
must be miserable.

185
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,685
Not that I'm suggesting that
you should be doing drugs.

186
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,416
<i>How's school going?
I'm home schooled.</i>

187
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,755
Really? You're lucky.

188
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,606
Going to school was boring.

189
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,221
My dad took me out, and it
wasn't because it was boring.

190
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,289
I had a rough
time in school, too.

191
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,496
Maybe not like you, but, you know... I
don't mean to compare our situations.

192
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,205
Actually, I guess I am
comparing our situations,

193
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,868
but only to show you
how yours is worse.

194
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,211
<i>You can edit that out, right,
so I don't look like an idiot?</i>

195
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,374
Relax. Everyone acts
like an idiot around me.

196
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,015
Makes you think it's not an act.

197
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,529
Can I have something
for my headache?

198
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,577
Yeah, is that new?

199
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,122
Sixteen years old.

200
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,351
Has the same birthday I do.

201
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,495
I'm gonna start the test now.

202
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,273
Study showed no signs of
scarring on Kenny's heart.

203
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,321
It wasn't drugs.

204
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,609
Well, then, give me
something better.

205
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,677
What's causing heart block?

206
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,294
It could be toxoplasmosis.

207
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,880
We should do an LP
to test for infection.

208
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,464
If it was toxoplasmosis, we'd
have seen enlarged lymphs,

209
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,652
and because you're not pretty enough
to be an idiot, you must know that already,

210
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,454
which means you just said it
because you want to do an LP

211
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,622
to look for
intracranial pressure.

212
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,171
Because it is
intracranial pressure.

213
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,546
Wait, I'm not done.

214
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,826
You thought I wouldn't catch on,

215
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,129
which means you either think
I'm an idiot, which is flattering,

216
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,633
I've been doing
my hair differently...

217
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,199
The kid's got headaches. He's been
popping acetaminophen like peanuts.

218
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,801
How could you possibly
think that I was done?

219
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,919
I prefaced that with an
"either." It needs an "or."

220
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,020
Or, you are an idiot,

221
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,566
which is possible, I'm not
great at judging men's looks.

222
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,090
<i>The OR?</i>

223
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,898
<i>And the MRI room.</i>

224
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,567
<i>Yes...</i>

225
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,707
<i>Dr. House frequently conducts differential
diagnoses in a variety of places.</i>

226
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,912
<i>He feels that a change in venue</i>

227
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,974
<i>often leads to a change
in thinking processes.</i>

228
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,153
<i>I have to go take
care of something else.</i>

229
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,022
Just let me do a CT
scan, see if I'm right.

230
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,236
The sooner we fix the problem,

231
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,354
the sooner we can get to
his reconstructive surgery.

232
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,092
Yeah. Who cares if you're
dead? It's how you look.

233
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,544
Well, since you've given me
nothing better, we're back to drugs.

234
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,662
The one thing we know it's not.

235
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,830
Decreased uptake on
the membranous septum.

236
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,583
Could be an artifact.
We can redo it, but...

237
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,270
Nothing's nothing.
Do an EP study.

238
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,544
EP study means we have
to stop this kid's heart.

239
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,510
I'll set it up.

240
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,412
<i>House, do you have a
minute to be disemboweled?</i>

241
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,284
<i>I'm gonna thread this catheter
through different areas in your heart,</i>

242
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:12,457
<i>and once I've found the right pathway,
I'll apply some electrical energy.</i>

243
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,291
It'll stop my heart?

244
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,666
It sounds worse than
it is. You'll be fine.

245
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,736
Is it gonna hurt?

246
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,636
There'll be some discomfort.

247
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,008
If you've done
drugs, I understand.

248
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,581
Being different's really hard.

249
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,889
Kenny, it's more important
for you to get better

250
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,790
than to worry about
getting in trouble.

251
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,538
If I did drugs, that could
explain my heart problem?

252
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,894
It could.

253
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,989
And then you could do
the surgery to fix my face?

254
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,091
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

255
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,770
<i>You know how famous people,</i>

256
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,902
<i>everywhere they go people
are watching them, staring?</i>

257
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,576
<i>They never have
a chance to just be,</i>

258
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,782
<i>you know? And a lot
of them turn to drugs.</i>

259
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,289
<i>And people stare at them because they're
beautiful, but, me they just stare...</i>

260
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,156
You okay?

261
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,121
I need to know what kind of
drugs, Kenny, and how much.

262
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,596
Coke, mostly. A lot of coke.

263
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:24,764
And then when I run out, I
usually go to LSD or acid.

264
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,134
Those are the same thing.

265
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,641
They are?

266
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,211
You don't do drugs, do you?

267
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,689
I drank from my dad's
liquor cabinet one time...

268
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,073
We're not gonna
do this test. No...

269
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,729
I need you to turn on your side.

270
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,016
We need to intubate. I
need some help in here!

271
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,285
Too bad you guys are
going for a theatrical release.

272
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,991
Vomiting blood would
have made a great act-out.

273
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,124
Likely causes?

274
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,223
Mallory-Weiss tear.

275
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,768
No pallor, no melena.

276
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,565
Why are you wearing a tie?

277
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,469
<i>I always wear
ties, I'm a doctor.</i>

278
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,984
<i>Please don't look at the camera.</i>

279
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,340
<i>Sorry.</i>

280
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,069
<i>Nasal papilloma.</i>

281
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,789
<i>Hemorrhage could have
overwhelmed the heart.</i>

282
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:07,872
<i>Nice lipstick.</i>

283
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,040
<i>Thank you.</i>

284
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,481
<i>Bad idea.</i>

285
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,312
The hemorrhage
came after the block.

286
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,718
House, let them do their job.

287
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,080
Is anybody here more
interested in the medicine,

288
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,091
a little less interested
in the paparazzi?

289
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,319
Upper GI bleed.

290
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:24,194
Could be something he ate
or drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.

291
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,893
Good.

292
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,332
Except no abdominal pain,
patient hasn't lost his appetite

293
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,882
and the last I checked,
the gastrointestinal

294
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,897
tract isn't connected
to the heart.

295
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,941
Yeah, but other
than that, real good.

296
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,375
Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis.

297
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,447
I just said it wasn't
a nasal tumor.

298
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,448
Stomach cancer.
Tumor causes bleeding,

299
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,984
body's reaction to the tumor
causes paraneoplastic syndrome,

300
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,178
which leads to heart block.

301
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,245
Finally, someone who
is not just a pretty face.

302
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,154
You and Taub, run the
scope, find the tumor.

303
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,703
Could be dangerous. If the
bleeding was caused by liver failure

304
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,171
as a result of the
intracranial pressure...

305
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:00,530
Liver is the one organ you can't
ascribe to intracranial pressure.

306
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,932
<i>True.</i>

307
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,806
Intracranial pressure
can cause liver problems.

308
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,878
It causes an increase in the cavernous
sinus pressure, which causes pressure

309
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,112
in the superior vena cava,
which shuts down the liver.

310
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,083
Did you just think of that? No.

311
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,363
Then why didn't
you say anything in...

312
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,618
Think it would've changed
his mind? Not a chance.

313
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,123
House would have undercut me,

314
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,035
and forced me to do a
procedure I just argued against,

315
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,995
and then I'd look like a hypocrite
in front of the thousands of people

316
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,327
and potential future
employers watching this film.

317
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,859
If you're right, and we stick a scope
back down a kid with liver failure,

318
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,700
he could bleed again.

319
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,034
I know.

320
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,337
He just vomited blood.

321
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,714
<i>Isn't that dangerous?</i>

322
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,714
<i>No. You're in good hands.</i>

323
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,419
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

324
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,463
Well, it's great how he
rebounded from that setback.

325
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,590
<i>What setback?</i>

326
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,134
<i>He didn't tell you about the...</i>

327
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,965
<i>Well, that's his right.</i>

328
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,902
<i>The records were sealed.</i>

329
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,583
<i>Personally, I think he
was just tapping his foot</i>

330
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,371
<i>and reaching for
the toilet paper.</i>

331
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,775
<i>Obviously it was a witch hunt.</i>

332
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,581
<i>You think they singled
him out because...</i>

333
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,981
<i>No. Literally, a witch hunt.
Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan.</i>

334
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,883
<i>It's a beautiful
religion, it's very caring.</i>

335
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,287
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>

336
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,518
You have an all-access pass to
the case, not my Fave 5s. Now, go.

337
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,161
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

338
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,997
I think I'm going blind.

339
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,162
Hairy palms, too?

340
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,969
She said something idiotic
again and I didn't even notice it.

341
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,101
Foreman had to point
out that it was idiotic.

342
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,372
She's making me an idiot.

343
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,879
It's cute. You have a crush.

344
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,574
No, I think it's
something systemic.

345
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,116
Thirteen's pretty.

346
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,515
You're obviously okay with her.

347
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,950
She killed a patient.

348
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,112
The bitch is pretty.

349
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,246
The bitch is a bitch.

350
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,482
Ask her out.

351
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,854
The bitch? She's a bitch.

352
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,620
No, the one that's
making you an idiot.

353
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,837
It's the story of life. Boy
meets girl. Boy gets stupid.

354
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,454
Boy and girl live
stupidly ever after.

355
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,232
Pretty girl kill again? No.

356
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,293
Elephant boy just
vomiting up blood again.

357
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,785
No tumors in the
patient's stomach, so...

358
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,320
But the scope caused
variceal bleeding.

359
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,370
Took 20 minutes
of banding to stop it.

360
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,790
Taub was right
about the liver failure.

361
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,009
Yeah.

362
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,881
His craniofacial deformity is
causing intracranial pressure...

363
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,011
No. Which is causing...

364
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,954
Where are the nosebleeds?
Where's the labored breathing?

365
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,367
You were right about
me being wrong.

366
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,735
You were wrong
about you being right.

367
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,092
I need new ideas. Anybody?

368
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,560
Does it bother you
that this kid's gonna die

369
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,101
because you won't put down
that camera at all? You know?

370
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,771
Your people should
be extra motivated.

371
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,157
I'm sure they all wanna
look good in the film.

372
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,707
<i>No, 'cause now they're too
worried about looking bad.</i>

373
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:08,949
Dr. House, heart block plus liver
failure could mean autoimmune.

374
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,819
Maybe scleroderma.

375
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,359
Foreman? Does that make sense?

376
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,088
Not without tight
skin on the hands,

377
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,223
muscle weakness and
a 30-year-old patient.

378
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:23,633
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder.

379
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,905
Hey, say what she just said.

380
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:32,172
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder?

381
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,152
Go look for signs of
retinal degeneration.

382
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,740
No, it's ICP. You're
only gonna see swelling.

383
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,413
Take him with you, so he
can see the degeneration, too.

384
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,125
<i>So before you worked here in the
ER, you worked for House, right?</i>

385
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,251
<i>Three and a half years.</i>

386
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,419
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

387
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,019
<i>Hey. I don't wanna be on TV.</i>

388
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,136
<i>I'm not signing a release.</i>

389
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,290
<i>We'll blur you out.</i>

390
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,231
<i>Take off your pants.</i>

391
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,395
<i>You gonna be able to use
any of this if I start swearing?</i>

392
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,963
Did House treat you as badly
as he treats his current fellows?

393
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,133
<i>Loaded question.</i>

394
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,071
<i>That's not even a word.</i>

395
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,679
Fork!

396
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,840
Very clever.

397
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,315
I learnt how to be a
doctor from House.

398
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,824
<i>Or at least a doctor who learnt
how to be a doctor from House,</i>

399
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,280
<i>if that makes any sense.</i>

400
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,256
<i>And you left his team because
you couldn't stand him anymore?</i>

401
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,987
<i>No, no. I love Dr. House.</i>

402
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,458
Now, that's something
we haven't heard.

403
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,861
<i>I mean...</i>

404
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,563
<i>What did you ask me again?</i>

405
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,363
<i>Why you left.</i>

406
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,668
<i>I loved being around him,</i>

407
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,265
<i>professionally.</i>

408
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,344
<i>You know, he was
always stimulating.</i>

409
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,904
<i>Not in an erotic
sense of the word.</i>

410
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,348
<i>Fork. They forked,
and then they spooned!</i>

411
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,218
<i>Lean forward, and place
your chin on the rest.</i>

412
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,159
<i>I can't reach it.</i>

413
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,452
Skooch in a little.

414
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,559
I'll take care of it.

415
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,397
Just like last time?

416
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,538
Maybe we should try
this the old-fashioned way.

417
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,310
Okay, look up to the ceiling
and try not to blink, okay?

418
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,884
<i>Okay, good. Now straight ahead.</i>

419
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,254
<i>There it is. Swelling,
no degeneration.</i>

420
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,786
It's not mitochondrial.

421
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,641
Swelling proves there's
increased pressure in his brain.

422
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,724
Absolutely.

423
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,444
So, now we can schedule
the reconstruction?

424
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,868
Absolutely not.

425
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,529
Your test proved you wrong.

426
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,368
We found exactly what
I predicted we'd find.

427
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,499
Swelling means there's
increased pressure.

428
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,601
You get a gold Star
of David for proving,

429
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,043
yes, this kid has a big head

430
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,809
and big heads cause pressure.
Doesn't explain the liver.

431
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,247
Too much acetaminophen does.

432
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,150
JRA explains all of
it, including the liver.

433
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,585
One theory's better than
two. Treat with steroids.

434
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,351
If you're wrong, steroids are
gonna mess with his immune system,

435
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,893
<i>put off his surgery for months.</i>

436
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,397
<i>You really wanna lose this
argument in front of the camera?</i>

437
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,463
<i>I'll speak to the father.</i>

438
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,906
Dr. House believes
that Kenny has JRA.

439
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,875
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

440
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,241
We need to start
administering steroids.

441
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,906
<i>Will the steroids fix it?</i>

442
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,649
<i>I don't think he has JRA.</i>

443
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,953
I think Dr. House is wrong,

444
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,357
and that the steroid
treatment could be dangerous.

445
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,395
I think I can get House
thrown off the case,

446
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,433
and get Kenny the
facial surgery he needs.

447
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,965
The father refused steroids until
we're sure about the diagnosis.

448
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,372
I am sure.

449
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,909
It's JRA.

450
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,603
And why would
he even doubt that,

451
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,648
unless a former fellow of
mine was chirping in his ear?

452
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,081
The decision was his. I
merely voiced my concern.

453
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,190
Why did you take this job?

454
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,446
He's got a bulging cyst.

455
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,818
Perfectly good plastic
surgery practice, lots of money.

456
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,288
Fluids aren't draining properly.

457
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,121
Temptation to come screw
with me just too much for you?

458
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,303
There's gotta be
a better reason.

459
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,818
He needs surgery to drain it.

460
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,525
Oh, and I think I mentioned
this earlier. You're fired.

461
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,697
What you did was
over the line. Get out.

462
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,201
But don't go anywhere.
You're not fired, yet.

463
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,014
No one is firing anyone
in the middle of this case.

464
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,329
Not while those
cameras are here,

465
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,415
and not while Taub is the only
person that this father trusts.

466
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,284
Where are you going?

467
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,803
To do what I always
do in these situations.

468
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,659
Treat my patient
behind his back.

469
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,197
That's one option.

470
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,927
Or you can do a CT
scan of the kid's head.

471
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,127
If there's no midline shift,
we know Taub's wrong

472
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,661
and you get your consent
to give the kid steroids.

473
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,605
Just a warning.

474
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,473
If we have to start getting consent
every time we do a procedure,

475
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,605
soon they'll be asking
for informed consent.

476
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,782
Didn't think you had
the guts to stage a coup.

477
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,848
Coup failed. I'm scheduled
for execution at dawn.

478
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,018
No, you're not.

479
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,322
No reprieve from the governor.

480
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,330
You're a test result away from
becoming House's front runner.

481
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,876
He doesn't care about what you
said, or what you did five minutes ago.

482
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,528
He just wants the
next good idea.

483
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,969
Show me 20 percent
magnification of the forebrain.

484
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:31,744
I look at our patient, as soon as I
saw his face, I saw a regular kid.

485
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,139
One thing about being a plastic
surgeon, you don't see what is,

486
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,511
you see what could be.

487
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:42,521
Talk like that around House, doesn't matter
how many good ideas you come up with.

488
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,788
So,

489
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,917
tell me what you don't
like about yourself.

490
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,257
Gosh.

491
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,826
There's so many things.

492
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,829
Is Dr. Taub available? Because
he was very highly recommended.

493
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,802
Well, he's no longer
practicing with us,

494
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,362
but I've taken
over all his files,

495
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,583
so if you tell me
what needs work...

496
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,870
Do you know why he left?

497
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,468
He had personal issues to
deal with, so if we could just...

498
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,376
My goodness. Is he okay?

499
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,039
Oh, yeah, he's fine. He's fine.

500
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,175
Because my friend had
his ears done by Dr. Taub.

501
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,152
Should he worry that
they may pop back?

502
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,052
No, it wasn't a
professional issue.

503
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,057
I'm sorry, I really can't
go into more detail.

504
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,389
Shall we discuss your needs?

505
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:25,954
You know that toe next to the big
toe? Mine's bigger than my big toe.

506
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,728
Is there any way to shorten
it? Or make my big toe bigger?

507
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,997
Like, a toe-gmentation?

508
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,538
Did he lie, cheat or steal?

509
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,007
You're not here for a
consultation, are you?

510
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,136
What gave me away?

511
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,703
Was it my obviously
perfect feet?

512
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,814
Hi.

513
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,823
CT shows that...

514
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,949
Let's go.

515
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,925
<i>What are you two doing here?</i>

516
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,489
<i>Skipping three scenes.</i>

517
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,331
<i>CT's back. He's gonna say that
there's evidence of an anomaly,</i>

518
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,461
<i>I'm gonna say, he's wrong.</i>

519
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,165
<i>He's gonna go back to the
father and we'll all end up here.</i>

520
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,708
The defect is pushing
on the right frontal lobe.

521
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,209
This bend is a
sign of herniation.

522
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,508
Or, it's a sign of increased
pressure from JRA.

523
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,677
<i>Dr. Taub would rather
distract you from the truth</i>

524
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,153
with sparkly things,
like four karat diamonds.

525
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,278
House.

526
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,722
Your partner said that you
left for personal reasons,

527
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,202
<i>but your wife said
you lost a patient.</i>

528
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,854
<i>You son of a bitch,
you spoke to my wife?</i>

529
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,088
<i>See, that confused me.</i>

530
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,596
<i>Why would you give her a diamond</i>

531
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,256
<i>if you screwed
somebody else over?</i>

532
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,528
<i>If you screwed her
over, I mean, I could...</i>

533
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,467
<i>Get that camera out of here!</i>

534
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,234
You say anything to her?

535
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,368
Just asked questions.

536
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,673
Get them out of here, too.

537
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,270
We're doctors.

538
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,787
I screwed around with a
nurse. It became a deal.

539
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,017
My partners found
out and I resigned.

540
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,752
There. Happy?

541
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,395
If you could be a bit more
descriptive, I'd be happier.

542
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,762
Some people pop pain pills,

543
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,263
I cheat.

544
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,269
We all have our vices.

545
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:20,875
<i>Taub, I don't see it.
Stay away from the family.</i>

546
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,783
<i>House, start steroids and
stay away from his family.</i>

547
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,658
<i>Wow, you are ugly.</i>

548
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,658
<i>Wow, you're an ass.</i>

549
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,563
<i>I have a deformity.</i>

550
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,535
I know, that's why you're ugly.

551
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,763
But you're a lucky boy.

552
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,329
Anywhere else in
the animal kingdom,

553
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,500
your parents would
have eaten you at birth.

554
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,840
Your son needs steroids.

555
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,105
Dr. Cuddy agrees.

556
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,441
Does Dr. Taub?

557
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,013
He's not a real doctor.
He's a plastic surgeon.

558
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,781
All he cares is that your
son looks good in his coffin.

559
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,187
So, I'm supposed to believe you?

560
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,485
The doctor who cares.

561
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,355
You shouldn't care if I care.

562
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,486
I don't trust you.

563
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,759
Because I don't think
the surgery's important?

564
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,760
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

565
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,930
You're willing to take chances to risk
his life for something he doesn't need?

566
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,496
I do need it.

567
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,873
<i>I can't have real relationships.</i>

568
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,211
<i>I can't even have
a real conversation.</i>

569
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,217
<i>Not even with my dad.</i>

570
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,449
<i>Dad.</i>

571
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,956
<i>I know you love me.</i>

572
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,926
<i>But you don't treat me normal.</i>

573
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,591
<i>You're always protective.</i>

574
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,601
<i>The world can always go to hell.</i>

575
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,930
<i>But you never yell at me.</i>

576
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,566
<i>Even when I screw up.</i>

577
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,140
<i>I wanna be normal.</i>

578
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,251
Take your steroids,
and you get to live.

579
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,285
Then you can do your surgery.

580
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,190
But it'll only change your face.

581
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,960
It won't change who
your face made you.

582
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,245
We're gonna get caught.

583
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,601
Not on film.

584
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,698
All their camera
equipment's in here.

585
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,537
Where did you get those keys?

586
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,475
Blue, the janitor.

587
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,107
What?

588
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,644
That's his name.

589
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,648
His name's Lou.

590
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,521
Owe him an apology.

591
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,050
Just watch 20
minutes of this stuff,

592
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,423
tell me if I'm out of my mind.

593
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,985
Finally, we have video evidence.

594
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,562
<i>Dr. House, heart block plus liver
failure could mean autoimmune.</i>

595
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,398
<i>Maybe scleroderma.</i>

596
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,410
<i>Foreman? Does that make sense?</i>

597
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,082
<i>Not without tight
skin on the hands,</i>

598
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,338
<i>muscle weakness and
a 30-year-old patient.</i>

599
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,344
Can I see that again?

600
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,772
What did you miss?
She screwed up, I didn't...

601
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,543
No, just the part where
she leans forward.

602
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,518
I think you can see
through her dress.

603
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,251
<i>Upper GI bleed.</i>

604
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,418
<i>Could be something he ate
or drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.</i>

605
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,654
<i>Good.</i>

606
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,692
You thought that
was a good idea?

607
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,130
What am I gonna do?

608
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,428
Just enjoy.

609
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,369
I'm gonna keep her around,
because she makes me an idiot?

610
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,134
Well, you're protected,
Foreman seems immune.

611
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,367
You think he's gay?

612
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,603
Did he become an
idiot around Chase?

613
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,122
<i>I just said it's not a nasal...</i>

614
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,048
Wait a minute, rewind
that. Was that Thirteen?

615
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,151
Wow.

616
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,983
I can't believe I'm that guy.

617
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,751
Every guy is that guy.

618
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,121
I'm not every guy.

619
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,557
What is this? Semantics here?

620
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,652
Okay, all guys are that guy.

621
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,731
I'm not all guys!

622
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,192
Cameron was smart.

623
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,169
You know, I'm
beginning to doubt that.

624
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,737
I wanted to clarify
something I said earlier.

625
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,237
"I love Dr. House,"

626
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,978
and then I qualified it,
which, after thinking about it,

627
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,783
I didn't really need to do.

628
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,654
I did love being around him.

629
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,753
I guess, I just
wanted to qualify

630
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,860
what I qualified before.

631
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,735
I'm looking defensive, aren't I?

632
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:37,962
No, no. I think that's great.

633
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,869
Clears everything up.

634
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,369
It's no big deal, really...

635
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:55,618
There's a mass lesion in the left anterior
temporal lobe surrounded by oedema.

636
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,452
Did you just insult
me in Pig Latin?

637
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,321
Dr. House, please.

638
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,454
Will you just take
a look at this?

639
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,733
The defect is causing this
nodular shadow here, you see it?

640
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,903
You're right, I didn't
see that before.

641
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,536
Come on, let's go.

642
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,243
Hey.

643
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,009
I know you think you're feeling
better, on account of feeling better,

644
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,417
but this trusted family doctor
thinks that he's found a mass lesion,

645
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,490
so if you could lie back
down and struggle to breathe...

646
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,819
Okay.

647
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,518
You were right.

648
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,322
I'm thrilled I'm wrong.

649
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,689
This is great, Kenny.

650
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,395
You're gonna get
your surgery now.

651
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,665
First person I'm coming
back to see is you,

652
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,230
because compared to me,
you're gonna look like butt.

653
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,468
Hey!

654
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,740
What, no comeback?

655
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,979
Look at that.

656
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,174
What?

657
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,042
His little finger,
it's twitching.

658
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,017
No, it's not.

659
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,682
Just give it a second.

660
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,582
There. TAUB: And?

661
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,222
He's not better.

662
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,493
What's wrong?

663
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,157
My diagnosis.

664
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,495
I don't know what he has.

665
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,103
Cancel the surgery.

666
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,978
New symptom. Involuntary
muscle movement.

667
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,608
Twitching finger is a symptom?

668
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,263
The body doing something
it's not supposed to do

669
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,846
is the definition of a symptom.

670
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,585
Kid's about to have a life-changing
operation. He's nervous.

671
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,658
Or he's not.

672
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,852
Or you were right.

673
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,919
Kid got better when
we put him on steroids.

674
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,328
This is JRA and it's
under control now.

675
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,764
Or the steroids have just
tempered his condition.

676
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,894
He got a haircut, but
he's still got bad hair.

677
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,062
What about Lyme disease?

678
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,198
It explains everything, the heart
issues, the internal bleeding,

679
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,684
even why he'd get
better on steroids.

680
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,268
On the other hand, if
he has Lyme disease,

681
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,678
there'd be other subtle clues
like a huge target-shaped rash.

682
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:03,874
But thanks for playing.

683
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,282
Why can't you just accept
the fact that you cured this kid?

684
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,650
You want to stop his surgery!

685
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,679
You're not normal.

686
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,917
<i>So you don't want
anyone else to be normal.</i>

687
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,222
<i>You don't think
normal's healthy.</i>

688
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,395
Could be rheumatic fever.

689
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,164
Also explains why
the steroids helped.

690
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,637
It's a similar
inflammatory disease.

691
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,640
Rheumatic fever doesn't
explain liver failure.

692
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,505
Taub thinks that
acetaminophen does.

693
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,168
Fine. Let's test your theory.

694
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,507
Remove his pacing wire.

695
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,911
<i>If he's better, his heart
will be just fine on its own</i>

696
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,678
<i>and then he can
have his operation.</i>

697
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,847
<i>If I'm right, his
heart will stop.</i>

698
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,152
<i>Kutner, have the
paddles on standby.</i>

699
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,594
<i>Another chance to
blow someone up.</i>

700
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,663
There'll be some
minor discomfort

701
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,758
and you'll feel a slow,
steady pulling sensation.

702
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,699
Are you sure his
heart is ready for this?

703
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,203
Absolutely.

704
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,433
He's convinced he's sure.

705
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,271
<i>Whereas I care about your son,</i>

706
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,942
<i>and have therefore brought
a professional defibrillist.</i>

707
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,246
We're not gonna need those.

708
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,557
Dad, I feel fine, and my
finger hasn't moved in a while.

709
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,960
Okay. Take him off.

710
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,227
Here we go.

711
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,650
Heart rates 85 beats per
minute. BP 110 over 70.

712
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,159
<i>Is he okay?</i>

713
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:57,994
I feel the same.

714
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,298
He's fine. You're fine.

715
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,801
Thank God!

716
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,632
What do you mean, thank God?

717
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,107
<i>God's the guy
who gave it to him.</i>

718
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,841
Thank you. Thank you.

719
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,045
Can you tell us
about the procedure?

720
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:14,369
We have to use both an
extra and intracranial approach

721
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,773
to get enough exposure to
reduce the encephalocele cyst

722
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,811
and do the bony reconstruction.

723
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,307
<i>And how are you
participating in this procedure?</i>

724
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,680
She's not.

725
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,181
<i>They don't want me here because
they think the kid's cured. I don't.</i>

726
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,224
And what do you
think the problem is?

727
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,690
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

728
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,024
<i>I just know that if Dr. House is
right, something's gonna go wrong.</i>

729
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,690
<i>Dr. House doesn't
think he's right.</i>

730
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,632
<i>Well, then I'll just waste a
few hours watching a surgery.</i>

731
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,136
<i>See, the danger is,
we have to reconstruct</i>

732
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,399
all the way down
to the cranial base,

733
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,805
<i>and there are some
big vessels down there.</i>

734
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,034
<i>So, what we'll do is we'll
work our way down to here...</i>

735
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,603
<i>When were these pictures taken?</i>

736
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,774
<i>Well, about three weeks
ago. Why? What do you see?</i>

737
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,010
Well, the acanthosis
nigricans was already there.

738
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:03,852
It's been there a lot longer
than that, probably his whole life.

739
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,857
<i>What about around his hairline?</i>

740
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,356
What? There's no discoloration.

741
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,860
<i>There is now.</i>

742
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,902
I have a new theory.

743
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,809
Their bad ideas don't
indicate a lack of intelligence,

744
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,970
they indicate an open mind.

745
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,606
The willingness not to be
trapped by conventional...

746
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,209
You've got a problem.

747
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,523
Tell me something I don't know.

748
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,851
You hire beautiful girls, enslave
them, force them to be around you

749
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,899
because you don't know how
to have an actual relationship.

750
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,724
If they're qualified, keep them. If
not, fire them and ask them out.

751
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:46,663
You do realize that, "Tell me something
I don't know" is just an expression?

752
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,109
Thirteen... You think
that just because

753
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:51,312
she is as beautiful, ergo, you think that
because she hasn't had a decent idea...

754
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:55,967
No. My point is she's about to enter
your office, so you should shut up.

755
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,410
You were right
about the diagnosis.

756
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,003
Yes, it was JRA. I'm very proud.

757
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,291
No, I mean you were right about
being wrong. He's got Lyme disease.

758
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,443
It explains everything.

759
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:11,419
Could you just hold up some fingers
so I can see if I'm literally blind?

760
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,617
We ruled out Lyme
disease hours ago.

761
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:14,725
All the symptoms fit.

762
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,817
I am so ashamed.

763
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,138
Is she really that good looking?

764
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,221
Apparently.

765
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,416
How many lives have been
lost because of pretty girls?

766
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,457
The target rash is hiding.

767
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,503
No one ever looked
at him closely enough.

768
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,771
She's getting
uglier by the second.

769
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,774
<i>We can try and
pretend we're above it</i>

770
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,526
<i>and we can try and
intellectualize it away,</i>

771
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,146
<i>but ultimately, shiny,
pretty, perky things are good</i>

772
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,550
<i>and ugly, misshapen,
teenage boys are repulsive.</i>

773
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,860
<i>The question was, do you resent
Dr. Cuddy's interference in your practice?</i>

774
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:30,827
<i>Oh.</i>

775
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,869
<i>Well, then I guess my answer
wasn't very helpful, was it?</i>

776
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,207
"Mini-stud", stand up.

777
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,001
I spoke to your other partner.

778
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,152
After Cuddy told you...

779
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,627
No, I stayed away.
Did it all over the phone.

780
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,615
I asked for a reference. Said you
were applying for a plastic surgery job.

781
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:01,894
Oh, God!

782
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:02,966
Yeah.

783
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,627
He went nuts. Apparently
you signed a non-compete.

784
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,283
Now, why would
you agree to that?

785
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,139
I don't wanna
practice plastic surgery.

786
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,906
You sign a contract because
someone's making you.

787
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,503
Someone's getting
something from you.

788
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,606
What did they
give you in return?

789
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,413
They agreed to keep
their mouths shut.

790
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:25,480
So you gave up your chosen
career just so they'd be quiet?

791
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,555
I love my wife.

792
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,760
You risked this job with
nothing to fall back on.

793
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,601
I thought you were wrong.

794
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,105
Sit back down.

795
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,427
You're keeping him
because he's a philanderer?

796
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,783
Where do I sign up?

797
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,653
Ask the Mormon. I'm keeping
him because he's interesting.

798
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,721
Dr. Terzi, would
you please stand up?

799
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,163
Nice.

800
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,601
I have treated you unfairly.

801
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,036
Pre-judged you.

802
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,744
And for me to be
a better person,

803
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,679
I have to rectify
that situation.

804
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,238
You're fired.

805
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,452
You wanna grab some dinner?

806
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,382
Maybe a movie?

807
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,418
Seriously.

808
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,304
<i>Just days ago, with
Kenny's condition worsening.</i>

809
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:57,075
<i>It was Dr. Gregory House
reassuring Kenny and his father.</i>

810
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,479
<i>I care about your son.</i>

811
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,418
<i>The charming House, who
happens to be a film buff</i>

812
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,719
<i>with a soft spot in his heart for
children told us how he got his start.</i>

813
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,589
<i>See, I became a doctor because
of the movie,</i> Patch Adams.

814
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,322
<i>Determined to save
the boy's life, as well as...</i>

815
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:12,955
The horror.

816
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,127
Well, it's nice of them
to send us an early copy.

817
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,431
Not so much sent as stolen.

818
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,030
<i>It was Dr. Gregory House
who served as not only a doctor,</i>

819
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,303
<i>but a rock for
Kenny and his father.</i>

820
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,505
<i>You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.</i>

821
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,411
<i>House, one of
those rare doctors...</i>

822
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,608
God!

823
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,309
<i>Who wears his
heart on his sleeve.</i>

824
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,710
I was saying that was
a stupid thing to do!

825
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,484
It's difficult not to be moved.

826
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,819
Oh, stop it.

827
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,487
Suddenly, I don't feel I can
trust Michael Moore movies.

828
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,155
Where are you going?

829
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,631
Kittens to get out of
trees? Deaf kids to read to?

830
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:53,398
I owe it to the world to make sure
this evil never sees the light of day.

831
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,767
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

832
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,179
<i>Thank you, Dr. House.</i>

833
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,018
<i>Thank you.</i>
