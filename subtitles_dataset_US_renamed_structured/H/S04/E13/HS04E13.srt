1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:07,439
Whoever thought walking in a circle
at two miles an hour would be draining?

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,272
Fresh air, exercise.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,403
You know, some things
do have their negative sides.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,573
Our income just got cut in half.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,207
And we get to spend
twice as much time together.

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,685
More, if you don't leave
before your lunch hour is over.

7
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,024
Out of my way.

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,754
We have a legal right to
hold you up for 15 seconds.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,226
Fifteen, fourteen...

10
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,319
One.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,058
Eleven, ten...

12
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,798
Ow!

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,928
Just trying to do my job.

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,269
Hey, relax. Three more
seconds and you can go.

15
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,546
Are you telling me what to do?

16
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,409
It's okay.

17
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,145
Just take a breath.

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,220
Get the hell off me!

19
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,618
I think it's been 15...

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,251
You okay?

21
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,626
<i>Oh, my God. Jeff?</i>

22
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,460
Standby.

23
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,446
Place is a mess.

24
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,179
Welcome to a world without
nurses. Here, you can start with these.

25
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,687
It's not my fault. I
don't use nurses.

26
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,666
Cuddy was looking for you,
said she'd send you down here.

27
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,556
I know. That's why I'm here.

28
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,992
Because Cuddy
hasn't found you yet.

29
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,123
She's going to look everywhere
except the place she wants me to be.

30
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,538
Hey. I've got an
aortic dissection here.

31
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,049
What's with the idiot?

32
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,715
Fainting spell and a
recent history of dysgeusia,

33
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,551
everything tastes like
lemon meringue pie.

34
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,886
You want to take him?

35
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,187
No.

36
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,721
Sir!

37
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,494
Why do you have two
lunches in front of you?

38
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,559
Been here for two meals.

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,663
And you're happy with that? No.

40
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:54,205
I just don't see much
use in complaining.

41
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,033
Seriously?

42
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,273
It's a pretty useful tool.

43
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,006
You complain, make
people miserable.

44
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,781
Then they do what you want,
to make the misery go away.

45
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,787
We probably should say something.
Maybe I can call one of doctors...

46
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,016
They're doing their best.

47
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,127
Ow!

48
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,753
What the hell?

49
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,193
I'm sure it was an accident.

50
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,296
Is he Canadian?

51
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,200
He's a low priority.

52
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,297
Is that a yes?

53
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,575
He's just... Happy.

54
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,042
I've got to stop this,
before it spreads.

55
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,306
You guys are done.

56
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,487
Could be a metabolic
disorder, toxic exposure,

57
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,082
carcinoma of the tongue
metastasized to the brain, epilepsy, M.S.

58
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,323
Or it could be the flu and we
should all be back in the E.R.

59
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,126
No, you're ignoring
the big symptom.

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,636
What if we were looking at
both the flu and decent parenting.

61
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,938
Okay, you two are
perfectly healthy.

62
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,234
This guy wasn't pandering.
He wasn't vanilla nice.

63
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,972
He was nice without any
aspiration of personal gain.

64
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,669
I'm thinking genetic defect.

65
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,909
Niceness is a defect?

66
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,779
Three cavemen see a stranger
running towards them with a spear

67
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,950
one fights, one flees, one smiles
and invites him over for fondue.

68
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,125
That last guy didn't last
long enough to procreate.

69
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,095
And how long has the
patient been suffering?

70
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,428
At least as long as his wife
has known him, eleven years.

71
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,077
The chances of him having an
undiagnosed pathology for that long...

72
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,262
What are you saying?

73
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,668
Evolution is wrong?

74
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,230
Where do you think we
are? 21st century America?

75
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,038
He's saying that
statistics are true, too.

76
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,442
The world is a bell curve,

77
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,708
most of us fall within
the standard deviation.

78
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,180
But there are outliers.

79
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,514
And if we believe in the
existence of extreme jerkiness,

80
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,384
which I suspect that we do,

81
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,284
then we also have to accept the
existence of the opposite extreme.

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,660
You want it to be a symptom,
because then we're supposed to be jerks,

83
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,199
which means you don't
even have to try to be nice.

84
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,470
Okay, maybe I am
biased. Let's take a vote.

85
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,006
Who thinks niceness
is not a symptom?

86
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,532
And who thinks that
their vote counts?

87
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,249
You two, check out his
home for toxins. Taub and 31...

88
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,375
31?

89
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,848
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that
either way was good with you.

90
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,324
Taub and Thirteen, MRI for
tumors, EEG for nerve damage

91
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,262
and test whatever comes
out of him for everything else.

92
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,507
Too much axis tilt.

93
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,373
Don't release until your
thumb's at the bottom of the ball.

94
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,443
I assume Wilson was busy.

95
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,077
Again.

96
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,031
No axis tilt.

97
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,297
With Amber?

98
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,899
Again.

99
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,435
Still. It was nice of you
to invite me. This is fun.

100
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,648
No, it wasn't. No, it isn't.

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,394
I didn't invite you to
be nice, I invited you

102
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,480
because bowling isn't one of the
two things guys do by themselves.

103
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,285
What's the second thing?

104
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,417
Other hand.

105
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, if people are incapable of
being nice, why bother having the word?

106
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,467
The ontological
proof of niceness.

107
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,768
The existence of the word
proves the existence of the concept.

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,833
Look out for those
minotaurs on your drive home.

109
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,974
And I thought motives don't
matter, only results mattered.

110
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,310
So what are you gonna do?

111
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,095
To screw up Wilson's relationship
so you don't have to listen to me

112
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,587
while you bowl.

113
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:05,623
I wish the best for them, and
their tragically deformed children.

114
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,385
She's good at being bad.

115
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,326
You might not be
able to destroy her.

116
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,233
As long as I give it my best
shot, I can hold my head high.

117
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,102
Cameron had this
one insufferable friend.

118
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,336
She wasn't going to get rid of her,
and I sure wasn't going to join them.

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,469
So I just said, "See
her on Thursdays."

120
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,309
I know it's not as exciting as
an exploding birthday cake,

121
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:32,853
but, hell, I don't want to hang
out with her every night anyway.

122
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,423
That's amazing. Cameron
only has one insufferable friend?

123
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,807
Joint custody.

124
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,444
Of Wilson?

125
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,844
Unless we have
another love child.

126
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,638
Deal with him.

127
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,950
He needs a mother figure.

128
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,163
I'm not saying you're not
entitled to spend time with him.

129
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,179
I'm just saying
I'm entitled, too.

130
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,287
I don't know how to deal with
him when he's being reasonable.

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,659
This is reasonable?
This is crazy.

132
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,062
You're not a child, you
can make your own plans.

133
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,191
No. Crazy is what House would
normally do in this situation,

134
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,327
swap your lubricant
with super glue.

135
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,462
The man knows me.

136
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,133
This is his way of accepting us.

137
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,006
It's actually a very
touching moment.

138
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,911
I'm proposing I get every other
day and every other weekend.

139
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,413
I have Yoga Wednesdays,
you can have him then,

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,183
but you have to have
him home by 11:00.

141
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,821
We can swap weekends.

142
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,988
Mondays and
Wednesdays. And midnight.

143
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,862
If he's not home till midnight,
we won't be asleep till almost 2:00.

144
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,958
Wilson, make a ruling.

145
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,194
No.

146
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,207
You two are like dogs
circling each other in the park.

147
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,176
And I say that with all
the love in the world.

148
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,324
You need to sniff each
other's butts, bare your teeth

149
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,211
and arrive at some
strange détente.

150
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,773
Otherwise you'll end up
biting each other's eyes out.

151
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,514
Again, with all the
love in the world.

152
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,683
I'll let you sniff first.

153
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,057
Take my deal or get
out of my apartment.

154
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,928
Take my deal or I move in.

155
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,968
This guy worked for Habitat
for Humanity in Costa Rica.

156
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,904
And coaches handicapped kids.

157
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,853
You think we should do a
work up, on the other coaches?

158
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,573
It is possible he's too perfect.

159
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,979
I'm not saying he's perfect,
I'm saying he's trying to be.

160
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,074
It's what people do.

161
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,385
What?

162
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,819
That's not what people do.

163
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,415
People usually suck, but they
want to be good, want to be nice.

164
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,153
House?

165
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,218
Exception that proves the rule.

166
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,820
What sort of argument is that?

167
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,159
Bad one.

168
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,203
That might be relevant.

169
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:09,074
Hydrofluoric acid. Lowers his calcium,
causes the fainting and taste issue.

170
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,236
But not the niceness.

171
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,711
Wouldn't that be nice?

172
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,676
You are King Solomon.

173
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,030
If you want us to cut him
in half, we're cool with that.

174
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,888
My boyfriend's too much of a
wuss to make the call for himself.

175
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,483
And I mean that with
all the love in the world.

176
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,961
I'm gonna piss off one of
them. And they both scare me.

177
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,743
"Your treatment of
patients is reprehensible."

178
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,227
You're reading his
performance review?

179
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,811
I'm busy. We have
a nurses' strike.

180
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,583
"Your management of
employees borders on abuse."

181
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,352
Let's go.

182
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,459
No, I... I want to hear it.

183
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,362
"You are overtly contemptuous
of hospital hierarchy."

184
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,296
And covertly.

185
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,165
But I suppose, you
didn't know about that.

186
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,036
"Your attitude towards supervisory
personnel is disrespectful.

187
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,303
"And a disturbingly large proportion
of your comments are racist or sexist."

188
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,710
That top makes you look
like an Afghani prostitute.

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,149
Would be an example of that.

190
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,707
Sign this.

191
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,048
House, I got the... It can wait.

192
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,315
I will sign if you
will give us a ruling.

193
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,326
I will give you a ruling if you
do the reviews on your team.

194
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,197
I'd be happy to continue
the mockery of this process.

195
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,969
What did you offer him?
Wednesdays till 11:00,

196
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,197
and alternate weekends.

197
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,864
Wednesdays till 11:00,
and alternate weekends.

198
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,842
Yes! Wednesday nights are
Ladies' Nights at Cheetah's.

199
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,306
Calcium's normal.

200
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,972
Wow. It really could wait.

201
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,992
Everything's normal. And
you thought it wouldn't be?

202
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,395
He's a carpet cleaner, he's got
a home full of hydrofluoric acid.

203
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,939
Doesn't mean his
calcium should be low.

204
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,421
Yeah, actually, it kind of does.
HF causes lower levels of...

205
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,515
Lower, not low.
Lower than normal.

206
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,469
Lower than yesterday.
Yesterday might have been high.

207
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,394
What's lower than high?

208
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,896
He actually has hypercalcemia,

209
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,865
which is being lowered
to normal by the HF.

210
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,733
So what gives us elevated
calcium, bad taste and fainting?

211
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,135
I take it you know.

212
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,367
Get the team. This
is gonna be fun.

213
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,806
Hello, again.

214
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,578
These people think
you're not too nice.

215
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,879
Too nice? For what?

216
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,787
For life as we know it to have
evolved without an intelligent designer.

217
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,052
I'm going to prove them wrong.

218
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,184
Your wife is very ugly.

219
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,230
Get out of here. JEFF: Deb...

220
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,293
He's obviously
trying to prove a point.

221
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,899
I think I just did. You're
either perfect or you're sick.

222
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,871
And in my experience,
sick is much more common.

223
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,738
He's not sick. He's nice.

224
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,937
Nice in the sense that your toaster
is nice for making you breakfast.

225
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,207
It's the only thing his
wiring will let him do.

226
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,079
He has Williams Syndrome.

227
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,710
Your husband is missing the
genes that make him suspicious.

228
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,981
You're wrong, he's...

229
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,784
Relax, there's no cure.

230
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,222
He's gonna go right on
tasting lemon meringue pie,

231
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,557
fainting and being a sap.

232
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,255
What about the other symptoms?

233
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,591
He has no other symptoms.

234
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,790
But Williams does.

235
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,094
He's got the
teeth, the glasses...

236
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,063
Williams cuts IQ by 20...

237
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,230
He doesn't work in
the physics department,

238
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,249
except when they spill a
black hole on their carpet.

239
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,105
Elfin appearance?

240
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,804
Yeah, he's more
Legolas than Keebler.

241
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,711
Bet you he can still crack
off a batch of Pecan Sandies.

242
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,148
Perfect pitch?

243
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,048
You love to karaoke, right?

244
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,818
I suck. Modest.

245
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,921
Another symptom.

246
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,389
No, he really does suck.

247
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,223
Give us a warble. Know any Cher?

248
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,489
No, but I know Bread.

249
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,532
<i>Baby, I'm-a want you</i>

250
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,367
<i>Baby, I'm-a need you</i>

251
00:13:55,802 --> 00:14:00,672
<i>You're the only one I
care enough to hurt about</i>

252
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,971
<i>Maybe I'm-a...</i>

253
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,907
What's the matter?

254
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,809
He's stroking!

255
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,949
Not a moment too soon.

256
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,434
You were wrong.

257
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,876
Why do people say that with such
pleasure? It's very hurtful, you know.

258
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,588
It means the patient gets to keep
being nice. Why does that offend you?

259
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,103
It's the way he said it.

260
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,709
He wasn't relieved, he was
excited. He was also wrong.

261
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,811
And I say that with
no sense of pleasure.

262
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,531
Patient tested
negative for Williams,

263
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,533
which means the stroke and
everything else wasn't caused...

264
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,722
You have a friendly demeanor
but you sometimes get too involved.

265
00:14:55,795 --> 00:15:01,701
You relate well to your peers and patients
and you complete tasks in a timely manner.

266
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,760
Please sign.

267
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,180
What the hell was
that? I have to give

268
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,469
each of you performance reviews.

269
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,543
Plenty of other conditions
can cause debilitating niceness.

270
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,738
How is that
supposed to help him?

271
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,304
I don't know, how was it
supposed to help Wilson?

272
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,793
Cross out Wilson's name and
the date and then fill in your own.

273
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,616
The point of a review is
to give feedback to help...

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,552
I'm thinking neurosyphilis.

275
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,558
Wouldn't show up on
the MRI without contrast.

276
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,823
I'll go run the tests.

277
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:39,333
He doesn't think it's syphilis but
he's gonna go run those tests anyway.

278
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,238
Because he doesn't know,
that's why we do tests.

279
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,800
Because he's a wimp.
Because he's afraid of you.

280
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,608
You want me to intimidate
him into not being afraid?

281
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,925
Not sure I know how to do
that. Reviews make a difference.

282
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,593
People have to listen,
so they have to learn...

283
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,850
I don't think the right time to tell the
dog not to pee on the rug is semi-annually.

284
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,787
You don't want to
do the paperwork.

285
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,452
I am concerned
about the rain forest.

286
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,627
I'll do it.

287
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,994
I know.

288
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,832
I don't have syphilis.

289
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,463
You don't know.

290
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,176
How many ways
are there to get it?

291
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,635
You can know who you had sex
with, you can't know who she...

292
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,771
I do.

293
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,280
Not for sure.

294
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:26,843
It's a waste of time. I had a
stroke. You can't keep wasting time.

295
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,313
We were tested
for the Peace Corps.

296
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,617
Ten years ago.

297
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,318
You haven't been with your
wife every minute of every day.

298
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,485
You think I'm naive, don't you?

299
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,496
I think you're... Yeah.

300
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,758
I know my wife.

301
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,129
She's not perfect.

302
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,101
I'm not perfect.
But she loves me.

303
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:49,976
And she's always loved
me. Every minute, every day.

304
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,820
You're 15 minutes late.

305
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,897
Have you heard the good news?

306
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,399
Miley Cyrus is playing a
third night at the Spectrum?

307
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,528
Happiness is possible. And not just in
this life but in the next. Where you can...

308
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:22,700
Oh, you're selling religion! I'm
sorry, I bought some Islam yesterday.

309
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,576
Well, it's where your light
showed signs before mending...

310
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,146
Have a good evening.

311
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,814
You're late. Fifteen minutes.

312
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,248
Sixteen minutes.
My sixteen minutes.

313
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,842
So keep him an
extra sixteen minutes.

314
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,548
You hear that? She doesn't care.

315
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,591
You're going mini-golfing, what's it
matter? You've got a tee-off time?

316
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,092
It matters because you don't
get to decide what matters.

317
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,822
It was my fault. I
had to take a shower.

318
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,593
Which was my fault.

319
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,928
I have to take a dump.

320
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:51,698
Anything else I don't need
to know before you leave?

321
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:57,608
Have fun on your play date.
You've got mommy's numbers, right?

322
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,673
Daddy needs a drink.

323
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,121
I was thinking, if we
discount the niceness issue...

324
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,486
Sit down.

325
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,422
I think it's a heart defect.
Nothing on the echo.

326
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,400
Could be a patent foramen ovale.
Explains the stroke and the syncope

327
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,960
and a PFO wouldn't
show up on a routine echo.

328
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,271
I'm going to do a bubble test.

329
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,069
You got a minute, first?

330
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,703
Sure.

331
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:35,048
I think you've shown remarkable
strength in a difficult situation.

332
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,674
Are you giving me a
performance review?

333
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,843
A good one.

334
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,911
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

335
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,355
There was enough blood left over from
his admission work up to run the VDRL.

336
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,653
You doubted your patient?

337
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,890
No, what I thought
didn't matter.

338
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,674
House said he wouldn't let us go
on until we ruled out neurosyphilis.

339
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,894
It's not neurosyphilis,
it's a PFO.

340
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,529
It's neurosyphilis.
The tests were positive.

341
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,591
It's always the same conversation.
They tell you you must be mistaken,

342
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,211
which is why I always run the tests
twice. Then they blame the other guy.

343
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,517
Which makes sense if they're innocent.
But, obviously, half of them aren't.

344
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,855
They don't seem to get that
they're busted. Scientifically proven.

345
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,723
Unless your spouse cheated, too.

346
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,673
Exactly. That's what you're praying for
in that moment, that she cheated, too.

347
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,742
And then, if she doesn't kill
you, you know that she did.

348
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,291
You'd know she betrayed you.

349
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,963
And then you realize
that that sucks worse.

350
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,937
The test must be wrong.

351
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,139
I ran it twice.

352
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,547
Not that test. The one
I took 10 years ago.

353
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,952
What other explanation is there?

354
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,129
He really sees no
other possibility.

355
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,133
Did you have an affair?

356
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,234
No.

357
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,998
Then why aren't
you angry with him?

358
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,673
You ever know anybody
who's just too nice?

359
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,746
No. It's annoying.

360
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:18,009
Then you realize it's annoying because
they remind you of what you're not,

361
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,985
that you'll never be
as good as they are.

362
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,683
And then you think, why can't I?

363
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,487
And before you know it,

364
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,461
that naive idiot you laughed at

365
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,699
has made you a better person.

366
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:42,373
You really think I've been in love
all these years with a symptom?

367
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,104
If syphilis caused
lesions in his brain,

368
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,942
and the lesions caused
personality changes...

369
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,780
You may notice a change in
him, as his condition improves.

370
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,151
I know my husband.
He's not going to change.

371
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,255
You should get yourself tested.

372
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,355
So much for the bell curve.

373
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,796
How can House be an ass
without it being an illness,

374
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,994
but niceness is a
biological crime?

375
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,760
You got five bucks?

376
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,361
Yeah...

377
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,769
Niceness just cost you five bucks,
being an ass generally turns a profit.

378
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,839
Kutner, could you excuse
us? I need to do Taub's review.

379
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,678
You can stay.

380
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,451
I think it'd be better if
this was done privately.

381
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,045
This isn't going to be done.

382
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,099
What is with you guys?
I've given you advice before.

383
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,386
Not as our boss.

384
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,551
What's the difference?
Advice is advice.

385
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,355
Fair enough. I'll go first.

386
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,065
"You demonstrate a great air of confidence,
which is really pissing me off."

387
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,979
House authorized me to...
How long have you known him?

388
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,114
He's using you. I volunteered
because I knew he wouldn't...

389
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,074
He could care less about the paperwork.
He's using you to screw with you.

390
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,541
He knows it'll annoy
us, we'll stand up to you,

391
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,921
which will force you
to confront the fact that

392
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,456
even though you think
you're our superior,

393
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,641
you're no different from us.

394
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,014
He gave you authority,
to keep you in your place.

395
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,814
It's true.

396
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,412
Thanks.

397
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,615
Not him. What did he say?

398
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,056
Nothing. What's true?

399
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,758
If there's something
wrong with this guy,

400
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,093
it means there's something
wrong with House.

401
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,066
Are you trying to get me drunk?

402
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,866
What time is it?

403
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,775
10:30.

404
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,004
She'll kill you.

405
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,446
I'll get you home
before lights out.

406
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,987
Great, then she'll kill me.
If I get any more drunk...

407
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,415
It might not work.

408
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,559
If you know what I mean.

409
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,564
Really?

410
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,565
You'd think one or more of your
ex-wives would have mentioned that to me.

411
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,070
They told you? Wait.

412
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,732
Why do you want
to get Amber angry?

413
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,173
Because I'm your friend.

414
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,210
No, no, no, you
said you approved.

415
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,255
You said you were
taking the high road.

416
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,941
For how long, the first exit?

417
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:06,281
Hello, and thank you from saving
me from being righteous to death.

418
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,712
<i>Patient's vomiting blood.</i>

419
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,897
Hematemesis could indicate...

420
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,981
<i>Don't put it on the board.</i>

421
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,167
You don't think it's a symptom?

422
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,183
I think it's my marker.

423
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,057
<i>He has syph and what?</i>

424
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,529
And syph. It can
cause hematemesis.

425
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,294
<i>Not everyone agrees.</i>

426
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,858
How could you...

427
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,834
<i>Because if you all
thought it was just syph</i>

428
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,270
you wouldn't have woken me
up in the middle of the night.

429
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,084
If it was just syph, he
wouldn't be getting worse.

430
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,201
<i>He's already on penicillin.</i>

431
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,949
The bleeding's probably
from liver damage,

432
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,675
probably caused by ethanol in
the cleansers or the penicillin.

433
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,547
Two more probablies
than I like to hear.

434
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,177
Liver test and serologies,
are going to take a full day.

435
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,744
Full night, actually.

436
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,414
<i>Guy might not make it to brunch.</i>

437
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,893
Yes, I knew about
your issue with alcohol.

438
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,227
Yes, I intentionally
got you drunk

439
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,132
to provoke an argument,
between you and Amber.

440
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,863
And why I'd do such a thing
is an interesting question.

441
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,600
But what's more interesting is
that you knew as much as I did,

442
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:05,201
and you're the one who's
pouring down the drinks. Why?

443
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,837
Because I thought I was
out having fun with a friend.

444
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,350
I didn't know these
drinks had subtext.

445
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,444
I gotta get home.

446
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,183
GGT's normal, that
rules out alcohol.

447
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,591
What about serum protein?

448
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,753
It's positive.

449
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,860
Kind of assumed he had protein.

450
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,956
It's how much protein
he has that we care about.

451
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,898
He's positive for syphilis.

452
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,733
Do you mind if I give you
a performance review?

453
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:36,799
Not the patient.
House. He has syphilis.

454
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,774
<i>What happened?</i>

455
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,456
<i>Every time I searched
my soul, I found Anna.</i>

456
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,984
<i>Are you going to tell Marie?</i>

457
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,717
<i>I have to.</i>

458
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,284
<i>It will destroy her!</i>

459
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,855
<i>Will it be any worse...</i>

460
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,665
Yes?

461
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,930
You might want
to turn the off TV.

462
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:09,442
I'm multitasking. Also
doing my taxes. And Cuddy.

463
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,771
What did you find out?

464
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,835
Patient has hepatitis.

465
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,847
I assume from your omission of
the word "viral" before the "hep"

466
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,008
that it's not another STD.

467
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:21,019
Put him on steroids and test him
for sarcoid before the liver failure

468
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,680
becomes liver failed.

469
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,951
We're all doing this.

470
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,394
There's more?

471
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,627
You have syphilis.

472
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,156
<i>Love lasts forever.</i>

473
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,200
No, I don't.

474
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,084
One of us found a vial of your
blood in the lab from when we...

475
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,701
Which one of you?

476
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,405
It's treatable.

477
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,708
We filled a prescription.

478
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,217
You okay?

479
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,714
So, this is why he is who he is.

480
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,008
We don't know.

481
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,817
We know. It's not
just a coincidence.

482
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,447
Wilson says he's
always been a jerk.

483
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,616
But he got worse.

484
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,791
After his leg.

485
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,555
The leg was a coincidence.

486
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,253
Did you sleep with him?

487
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,764
So what's going to happen?
What's gonna change?

488
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,038
Maybe he'll be less of a jerk.

489
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,631
Or less of a doctor.

490
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,300
You gotta be a jerk
to be a good doctor?

491
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,038
I don't know. Maybe House does.

492
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,544
Why aren't you answering me?

493
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,138
Because it's none
of their business.

494
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,083
It's none of your business.

495
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:02,553
I think the STD
makes it my business.

496
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,148
Humans are complicated.

497
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,455
Humans are simple.

498
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,462
A million different things
make us who we are.

499
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,464
You change one,
you change everything.

500
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:16,161
If Mozart was better adjusted,

501
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:19,399
decides to play catch one day,
maybe there's no <i>Magic Flute.</i>

502
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,302
You did, didn't you?

503
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,908
Something I need to tell you.

504
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,987
You returned him drunk.

505
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,182
On time. Drunk.

506
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,485
On time. No tag backs.

507
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,824
The purpose of the
time was to give me time.

508
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,158
So you didn't have sex...

509
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,357
I like sex. You
can have it tonight.

510
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,899
<i>The L Word</i> is on.

511
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,731
You don't get to
decide what matters.

512
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,836
Either you're genuinely afraid
I'm gonna make him miserable,

513
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:59,038
or you're afraid I'm gonna make him
happy, or you simply can't stop screwing

514
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,513
with anything that moves. It doesn't
really matter because, whatever the reason,

515
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:07,918
you'll only get worse. Until
either I stop seeing Wilson

516
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,554
or I stop you.

517
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,890
What do you think
I'm going to choose?

518
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,090
If you terminate the agreement, that's
not gonna bring peace to the Mideast.

519
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,292
I'm not terminating
the agreement.

520
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,165
I'm amending the agreement.

521
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,064
I'm adding penalty clauses.

522
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:30,769
Fine. Whoever violates
it gets their finger cut off.

523
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,504
I'm serious. So am I.

524
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,851
You want people to drive safer,

525
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,905
take out the airbags and attach
a machete pointing at their neck.

526
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,349
No one will drive over
three miles per hour.

527
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,929
I'm not cutting...
We'll figure it out.

528
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,512
On your time.

529
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:58,327
You know she's certifiable,
right? I got forms in my desk.

530
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,601
Where is she wrong?

531
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,339
What were you going to tell me?

532
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,975
Nothing.

533
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,310
You're punishing me?

534
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:13,976
I needed to tell you
something privately.

535
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,645
I'm not gonna tell her.

536
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,850
You'll tell her. She's your
girlfriend. You should tell her.

537
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,516
You're my friend.

538
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,616
It's not the same.

539
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,960
Don't sulk.

540
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,697
Where am I wrong?

541
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,669
"Your management
style is counterproductive.

542
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,253
"You gave me authority over the
team just so they could undercut..."

543
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,270
Critiquing the clap-addled?

544
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,780
Sort of tasteless.

545
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,612
I don't feel like waiting
until your genitals cleared up.

546
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,050
You need to formalize
my authority over the team.

547
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,247
No, I don't.

548
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,118
You don't think I'm qualified?

549
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,021
Compared to those three?

550
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,902
You want to punish Cuddy
for hiring me without...

551
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,758
I like Cuddy.

552
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,763
Parts of her.

553
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,628
You want to crush the
team, by crushing me?

554
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,894
I want to empower them.

555
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,631
Those three idiots
need to respect you.

556
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,902
They should respect you.
They should be afraid of you.

557
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,568
So I have to humiliate you.

558
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,683
See, if the team fears you,
they won't question you,

559
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,423
if they don't question you,
they won't get any answers,

560
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,643
if they don't get any
answers, they're useless.

561
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,217
Mocking me saves lives?

562
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,776
Hospital will probably
build you a statue one day.

563
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,280
You know, with a "kick
me" sign, on the back.

564
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,067
So when you think about
it, the more I mock you,

565
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,869
the more it shows that
I have respect for you.

566
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,489
Or you made up that B.S.
because you like humiliating me.

567
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,088
Wouldn't rule that
out completely.

568
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,293
You busy?

569
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,665
Almost done.

570
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:43,299
So just remember, the rabbit goes
around the tree and jumps down the hole.

571
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,945
Negative for sarcoidosis.

572
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,180
Run him for everything
you can think of.

573
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:55,878
Lepto, schisto, hemo and the fourth
Marx Brother nobody ever heard of.

574
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,287
You bitch!

575
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,461
I just went to get us some
lunch. You were asleep.

576
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,191
You moved my book!

577
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,964
Jeff, calm down,
it's just the drugs.

578
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,766
The drugs didn't move my...

579
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,467
Jeff?

580
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,535
My husband's having a heart attack!
Can somebody help me, please?

581
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,407
Somebody help me, please!

582
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,188
She saved his life.

583
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:39,358
Or she scabbed. Depends
on your point of view.

584
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,835
So, what do we think? New
symptom? Or just a wife beater?

585
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,003
Hey.

586
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,740
Time for you took
this baby for a spin.

587
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:57,048
We loaded him full of
prednisone to try to fix the liver.

588
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,279
Good news is, he's
running out of organs to fail.

589
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,447
Prednisone could cause roid rage,
which could cause hypertension,

590
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,580
which results...

591
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,353
Roid rage after six hours?

592
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,588
That rate, by sundown,
he'll have eaten most of us.

593
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:16,191
Still could be the
penicillin, allergic reaction.

594
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,578
How does a fried liver
put him into a rage?

595
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,128
It's not frying his liver,
it's frying his syphilis.

596
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,798
The penicillin's working.
The real patient's emerging.

597
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:26,606
So syphilis prevents
domestic violence.

598
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,942
I'm gonna be even more
attractive to the ladies.

599
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,448
I was about to test for a
heart issue before the syphilis.

600
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,910
PFO could explain
the heart attack,

601
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,820
and reduced blood flow to
the brain could explain the rage.

602
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,653
Well, they're all good ideas.

603
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,158
Okay. Let's take a vote.

604
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,854
How many think
it's the roids talking?

605
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,961
And who's for the penicillin?

606
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,264
And how about whatever she said?

607
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,970
Someone hasn't
raised their hand.

608
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,868
Whatever I decide?

609
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,441
You're setting me up.

610
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,709
Why would I do that?

611
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,010
PFO.

612
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,356
PFOs have it.

613
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,720
I just hope the bubble test is
positive. Or it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

614
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:31,301
We gave van Gogh chelation
therapy. Turned him into a house painter.

615
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,042
Maybe not. Maybe we
just put Hitler on Ritalin.

616
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,383
Are you comparing
House to Hitler?

617
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,509
Oh, God.

618
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:43,083
Just because I don't think he's
Hitler doesn't mean I slept with him.

619
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,317
I don't sleep with everyone
who's better than Hitler.

620
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,226
Maybe Taub's right.
Maybe this is good.

621
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,523
This is not good.

622
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:56,330
He respected our opinions, he
mocked himself, he was civil, he shared.

623
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,900
He didn't care.

624
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,062
He never cares.

625
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,696
He didn't vote. He always
cared about one thing,

626
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,299
solving the puzzle.

627
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,073
But he was irrelevant in that
diagnosis, he had no opinion of his own.

628
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,548
He now cares about nothing.

629
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,111
You had no choice, you had to
treat him. What's done is done.

630
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,765
You know that thing I was
going to tell you? I gotta tell you.

631
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,104
I got to tell someone. You
have to swear not to tell C.B.

632
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,173
Whatever. That's not
swearing, that's shrugging.

633
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,210
It's actually the
opposite of swearing.

634
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,801
I won't tell Amber.

635
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,285
My team thinks
that I have syphilis.

636
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,685
Do you? Not yet.

637
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,118
Why do they think you do?

638
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,787
Because I knew they had
access to an old blood sample.

639
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,989
I knew they'd test it
sometime for something.

640
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,589
Why would you swap your blood?
What are you afraid they'd find?

641
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,831
Shut up, you're missing the point.
Now they think that I'm on penicillin.

642
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,207
Is this some clever practical
joke that I'm not aware of?

643
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,642
And as I get
better, I get nicer.

644
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,316
That's brilliant.

645
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,116
Foreman thinks I
actually value his opinion.

646
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:26,556
Thank God he said PFO or I'd
have had to do some dancing.

647
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,024
You got time for bowling?

648
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,060
Come on, it's work hours.

649
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,326
I'll get my shoes.

650
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,962
So we don't need
to talk about... No.

651
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,666
You're gonna keep
screwing... Yeah.

652
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,201
And you're gonna keep talking
about it. We are who we are.

653
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,136
I'll get my shoes.

654
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,652
Okay, got a good
view of the heart.

655
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:59,723
What if we lower House's
dosage? Maybe stabilize him?

656
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,056
He doesn't get worse,
he doesn't get better.

657
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,256
Quite the line to walk. If we're
wrong, he dies of neurosyphilis.

658
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,059
If we don't, other people die.

659
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,124
Other people who
aren't our boss.

660
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,429
People.

661
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,435
This sucks. The guy
had a gift. I killed...

662
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:16,731
Hi. What...

663
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,174
House doesn't have syphilis.

664
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,939
He switched the blood samples.

665
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:21,979
How do you know that?

666
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,174
House told Wilson.

667
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,945
I wanted to ruin
House's day. See you.

668
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,917
We're idiots. We're not idiots.

669
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,788
Positive blood test
means positive blood test.

670
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,291
Apparently not.

671
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,117
There they are.
Let's see if they...

672
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,321
What are you doing?
We're not done.

673
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,126
He doesn't have syphilis.

674
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:41,791
I know.

675
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,477
Patient tested positive
for syphilis, right?

676
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,607
Is this some sort of recap?

677
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,444
But why did he test
positive for syphilis?

678
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,916
Oh, oh, I know this.

679
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,919
Either, one, he has syphilis.

680
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,144
I was gonna say that.

681
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,383
Or two, the test
was wrong twice.

682
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,791
Or three, he gave us
someone else's blood.

683
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,394
Who? Amber.

684
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,670
Get that idiotic smile out of my
face, I got to go on a killing spree.

685
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,743
Or four, he has something
that tests positive for syphilis.

686
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,816
It's not Chagas. He
worked in Costa Rica,

687
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,144
before he was married.

688
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,776
Is two a spree or do
I have to kill you too?

689
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,849
Chagas wouldn't
explain the niceness.

690
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:41,359
I've heard of remote tribes that
actually practice acts of kindness.

691
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,951
Or the Chagas
caused encephalitis.

692
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,360
The MRI showed no signs...

693
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,955
Until we started him on steroids,
compromised the immune system

694
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,625
and let the infection flare up.

695
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,331
I did another
one. It's not much.

696
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,832
It's plenty.

697
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,010
You figured this out
because I don't have syphilis?

698
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,640
Damn.

699
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,719
It should have been my epiphany.

700
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,157
Good news and bad news.

701
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,830
Good news is, we
know what you have,

702
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:22,698
it's treatable, and
you're going to live.

703
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,065
Really?

704
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,229
What's the bad news?

705
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,638
The cure is a
grueling course of pills.

706
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,005
It's like

707
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,341
one a day for a month.

708
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,472
Now you're just trying
to make me laugh.

709
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,540
Yeah, like that's a challenge.

710
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,244
You have Chagas disease.

711
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,378
It's a parasite. It's been
asymptomatic for 10 years.

712
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,549
Not quite. Your brain's been
swollen, not enough to see,

713
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,286
but enough to alter
your personality.

714
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,486
We're back to that?

715
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,928
He screamed at you, you
don't think he can change?

716
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,727
That was because of the drugs.

717
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,195
So you think drugs are
more powerful than parasites?

718
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,148
I mean, the ones we're gonna give
you to treat the parasites obviously are,

719
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,574
but I stand by the principle.

720
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,513
I'm not worried.

721
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,608
Neither am I.

722
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,048
Neither am I. But that's
because I don't care.

723
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,998
Reviews?

724
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,667
It was brought to my
attention that, on occasion,

725
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,075
I am not respectful
of hospital hierarchy.

726
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,273
The word was "contemptuous."

727
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,583
Well phrased, thoughtful...

728
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,994
Identically phrased.
These are all the same.

729
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:03,432
Because underneath it
all, we are all the same.

730
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,960
And Foreman
refused to type his up.

731
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,336
Well, it's more than I expected.

732
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,109
There's an extra one in there.

733
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,185
"Your treatment of
patients is nonexistent

734
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,987
"because you're not a
doctor, you're an administrator."

735
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,460
Foreman convinced me
that these could be helpful.

736
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,497
"Your management
of employees is,

737
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,022
well, let's face it, they're
outside carrying signs."

738
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,701
The strike ended. The nurses
have been back for two shifts already.

739
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,138
You'd think I'd have noticed. What
exactly did they do around here?

740
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:53,414
"You act like employees should fear
and respect you, but your eyes tell us...

741
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,420
"Actually your eyes tell us nothing,
because we're looking at your boobs,

742
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,565
"which tell us that you're desperate
to have someone jump on you

743
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,253
"and tell you they love you
one grunted syllable at a time.

744
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,762
"What you want, you run away from.
What you need, you don't have a clue.

745
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:10,267
"What you've accomplished
makes you proud.

746
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,337
"But you're still miserable."

747
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,164
Please sign.

748
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,575
I got a call from Amber today. Says
there's been a violation your contract.

749
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,513
You've been seeing
Wilson on her time.

750
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:30,521
She breached confidentiality. You
can let it slide, Officer, we're even.

751
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,786
Yes, you are. You're
both losing fingers.

752
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,695
Look what I found.

753
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:39,787
Nice.

754
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,730
They think you might be
able to come home tomorrow.

755
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,601
Yeah? That's good.

756
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,037
What's the matter?

757
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,410
The ketchup. There's
something wrong with that.

758
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:02,149
Tastes fine. Is
there anything else?

759
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,813
Everything else is great.

760
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,325
I just, I don't know, I guess I
don't like ketchup anymore.

761
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,690
Wonder what else I don't like.

762
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,380
Roll over.

763
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,783
We need a tougher punishment.

764
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,687
You want to come
over to the poopy side?

765
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,957
So where are you
two going Friday night?

766
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,086
Dinner at L'Auberge.

767
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,928
You're lying.

768
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,196
Of course I am.
