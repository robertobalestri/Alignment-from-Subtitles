1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,895
Brock, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,997
Getting ready for
surgery. What's it look like?

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,039
You're operating on my sister.

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,435
And my fiancÃ©e.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,243
You're drunk.
You could kill her.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,452
It's the only way to stop
my hands from shaking.

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,884
I need to drink.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,485
For Anna.

9
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,492
What about our baby?

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,229
Our baby?

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:38,103
Brock! Oh, my God! Brock, are
you okay? Brock, speak to me.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,835
Oh, my God! I
think he's really hurt.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,037
Cut!

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,221
That was scary. I thought
for a second you were really...

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,311
Then you're going to be the
only one in the world who did.

16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,712
This is ridiculous.

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,789
That was great, Evan.

18
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,086
No, it wasn't. It was crap.

19
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,387
The fans are going to love it.

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,155
The fans are crap. I'm crap.

21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,095
This whole damn show is crap!

22
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,030
Sorry, not your fault.

23
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:41,200
Where are you going? My
apartment's on the West Side.

24
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,032
Excuse me, you need
to go the other way.

25
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,968
Hey, did you hear what I said?

26
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,514
What the hell's going on
here? What do you want?

27
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,612
An autographed
picture would be nice.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,613
Oh, and I'm also
going to save your life.

29
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,860
You might want to think about
repositioning the crosswalk.

30
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,063
It's technically not a violation, but
the closer they are to the entrance,

31
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,730
the more likely
they are to be used.

32
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,104
Makes sense.

33
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,699
Listen, I actually wasn't
expecting you until next month.

34
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,270
Yeah, that's the problem with planned
visits, administrators plan for them.

35
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,077
The most recent New Jersey
Hospital Accreditation requirements.

36
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,785
Yeah, I'm familiar with...

37
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,229
Who is that?

38
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,034
I have no idea.
Shall we get started?

39
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,741
Just let me go. I won't press
charges. I'll forget the whole thing.

40
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,300
That's probably true, seeing
as how you have a brain tumor.

41
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,177
You're that nut-job doctor
that keeps calling my publicist.

42
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,911
Actually, I'm the nut-job
Head of Diagnostic Medicine.

43
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,115
I run every day. I don't get headaches.
I'm fine. So, if you don't mind...

44
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,851
Actually, I do mind.

45
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,450
I don't care if you die,
but if Brock Sterling dies,

46
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,929
Anna never finds out he's
the father of Marie's baby.

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,423
Help!

48
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,762
Help!

49
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,930
We're gonna need
a wheelchair here!

50
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,533
Look, in the last month,

51
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,599
your average line reading has
slowed from 2.1 seconds to 2.9.

52
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,679
You're pausing more,
always at the same interval,

53
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,441
every seven to nine words,

54
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,348
which means you're having trouble
reading one side of the teleprompter,

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,861
which means a
peripheral vision problem,

56
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,014
which means a tumor
in your occipital lobe.

57
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,457
Just one test. If there's nothing
wrong, I'll take you right back home.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,861
Make it cab fare. I don't want
you anywhere near my house.

59
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,900
Just put it in my spot.

60
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,071
The Accreditation Board is here
to protect us and our patients.

61
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,809
So, in dealing with
the onsite inspector,

62
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,412
please behave as if it wasn't also an
enormous pain in the ass. Thank you.

63
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,687
Chase, Foreman,
Cameron, up here, please.

64
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,420
Why is House driving a limo?

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,522
Don't know. Don't have to know.

66
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,533
Don't care. CUDDY: Wrong.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,229
Until this inspection is over
you're back on House-watch.

68
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,531
Current case. Past cases.

69
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,648
He doesn't have a current case.

70
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,833
I have a whole department.

71
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,967
And are you going
to fire us if we don't?

72
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,841
I was just asking for your help.

73
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,852
The last time I checked the ER, you
had the best-kept charts in the building.

74
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,085
Last time I checked the 4th-floor
janitor's closet, I found House's charts.

75
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,057
He hasn't filed
anything since you left.

76
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,290
Now, House may not care whether this
hospital's accreditation gets downgraded,

77
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,265
but the people who sign my
paychecks do. So, I repeat: Current. Past.

78
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,096
He doesn't have a current case.

79
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,467
Did he tell you about the limo?

80
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,965
So, I just press this button
every time I see a light?

81
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,202
Tells me where
your blind spots are.

82
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,744
So, the twins,

83
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,225
they're going to turn out
to be yours, aren't they?

84
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,048
I told you, I can't
talk about that stuff.

85
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,146
But you want to be
done with this, right?

86
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,284
One's mine, one's Julio's.

87
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,394
I knew it!

88
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:06,061
Julio knocked her up before her
appendix burst. You got her after.

89
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,559
How can you watch that stuff?

90
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,100
Because it's awesome.

91
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,800
It's preposterous, not one real
moment since I've been on the show.

92
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:18,345
As opposed to shows that represent
the world exactly the way it is, like...

93
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,342
Can't think of any.

94
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,071
What's going on?

95
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:26,777
Hospital is being inspected, and Cuddy
dispatched you to keep an eye on me.

96
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,150
I just parked a Town
Car in an ambulance bay,

97
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,591
and instead of ripping me one,
Cuddy acted like she didn't know me.

98
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,925
It's either an inspection
or an aneurysm.

99
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,089
What's the test say?

100
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,955
As I suspected,

101
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,429
you have significant losses in the
upper right quadrant of your visual field.

102
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,503
Are you serious?

103
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,766
No, it's a joke.

104
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,534
Two guys go into a bar,

105
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,753
and one has significant losses in the
upper right quadrant of his visual field.

106
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,144
The other one says
you're going to need an MRI

107
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,273
to confirm the type and
location of the tumor.

108
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,442
That readout says
his vision's fine.

109
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,541
No, it doesn't.

110
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,642
Yes, it does.

111
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,950
You lied to me?

112
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,322
I kidnapped you, and you're
surprised that I lied to you?

113
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,723
It just means that the
symptoms are intermittent.

114
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,491
You come near me
again, I'm calling the police.

115
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,398
You kidnapped him?

116
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,665
It's sweet that I haven't lost
the ability to surprise you.

117
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,477
Are you mocking me?

118
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,209
My back. My back is killing me.

119
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,511
Don't care. Busy.

120
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,074
Amber's damn mattress.

121
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,712
Well, that sucks.
Don't buy a new one.

122
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,889
Are you being sarcastic?
Because we are buying one.

123
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,017
She's incapable of doing
anything that matters

124
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,562
without turning it
into a zero-sum game.

125
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,825
We're buying a mattress. For us.

126
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,367
Wow, I'm faster
than you right now.

127
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:56,536
It's all about her and whatever hapless
salesman wanders into her sights.

128
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,514
She's going to lie, steal and trade
your testes to get whatever she wants.

129
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,885
Hold on. Just got to do something
before he dials the second "one."

130
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,057
You're going to end up
humiliated, holding her purse

131
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,897
and going home to sleep
on a new mattress you hate.

132
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,489
What the hell are you doing?

133
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,761
He needs a MRI.

134
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,068
Give me one-millimeter
slices from the cortex down.

135
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,906
Any particular reason you
decided to sedate a patient

136
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,911
for a procedure that's
completely painless?

137
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,771
Guy has a history of violent
outbursts during surgical procedures.

138
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,283
Yeah, on TV.

139
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,254
It's Evan Greer. He's the
main stud on House's soap.

140
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,620
Frontal cortex looks
clean. No tumors.

141
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,819
Increase the magnification
on the occipital lobe.

142
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,259
You watch because
you like or because I like?

143
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,063
I was unemployed. I...

144
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,801
Sorry, that's not an
answer, that's an apology.

145
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,647
If we are ever to come out of the
darkness, we have to be proud...

146
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,869
Occipital, frontal and temporal
lobes are clean, so is the optic nerve.

147
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,773
Definitely no tumors.

148
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:06,812
He's fine?

149
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,314
And awake.

150
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,485
What should we tell him?

151
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,216
See if you can talk
him out of suing me.

152
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,786
He kidnapped me! He drugged me!

153
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,625
Perhaps you should
go out the back way.

154
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,624
I'm not going anywhere
you people tell me to go.

155
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,565
It's just someone of your
fame... I figured fans...

156
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,970
You're trying to hide me. You
don't want me making a scene.

157
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,668
The hospital is
being inspected today.

158
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,404
And you want me
to do you a favor?

159
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,639
Not us, our dean of medicine.
And House hates her.

160
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,205
You'd be doing House
a favor by complaining.

161
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,317
Oh.

162
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,688
This hospital is staffed
with lunatics and criminals.

163
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,988
Excuse me, where is Dr. Cuddy?

164
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,593
You okay?

165
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,493
It's my foot. What
did he do to me?

166
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,563
What did House do?

167
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,292
Nothing. I was with
him the whole time.

168
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,197
It's numb. I can't feel it.

169
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,273
I can't walk.

170
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,779
Foot numbness has
a huge differential.

171
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,582
That gets a lot narrower when you
add in peripheral-vision problems.

172
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,417
Which gets a lot wider when there's
no proof he ever had a vision problem.

173
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,035
So House was wrong
about the first symptom,

174
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,459
but the guy just
happened to develop

175
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,859
a second, unrelated
symptom a few hours later?

176
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,455
He already kidnapped and
sedated the guy against his will.

177
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,899
Makes sense he'd also do something
to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.

178
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,064
But it doesn't make sense to
include a symptom that he caused

179
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,472
in a differential he's
so desperate to solve.

180
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,203
Unless he didn't
mean to cause it.

181
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,610
Stick to the filing, sweetheart.
Let the doctors do the doctoring.

182
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,341
Either toxins or
vitamin deficiency...

183
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,525
I'm guessing, when
you drugged him,

184
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,882
you didn't catch him
and ease him to the floor.

185
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,130
He could've pinched a
nerve in his ankle when he fell.

186
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,783
You need to run an EMG
test for motor nerve entrapment

187
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,052
or the inspector
will own your ass.

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,891
Kutner, leave the
room, wait 30 minutes,

189
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,295
come back and tell her
the test was negative.

190
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,993
Is it okay if I use that
time to do the test?

191
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,558
Get out of here.

192
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,162
And the rest of them can
help me with all this stuff.

193
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,571
They're busy, which
is really annoying,

194
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,681
because I wanted to be
able to say that they're busy

195
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,836
for no other reason
than to screw with you.

196
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,674
Research.

197
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,118
So the nut job was right?

198
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,253
Usually is.

199
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,318
He said I was dying.

200
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,989
He's wrong a lot, too.
That's why we do these tests.

201
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,656
Bet it's cool, you know,
being the star of a hit TV show?

202
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,163
It's a daytime soap. It pretty much
puts me one step above dinner theater.

203
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,033
Come on, you're on TV every day.

204
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,164
And who cares what the
critics think? Women love soaps.

205
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:52,837
You get to take pride in your job,
feel good when you go home at night.

206
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,074
You're entertaining people.

207
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,172
I don't care.

208
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,542
Then you've made a
strange career choice.

209
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,552
Look, I'm pandering.

210
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,953
I want to be part of
something that inspires people.

211
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,892
So, quit. Find something
inspiring and do it.

212
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,394
It's not that easy.

213
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,486
Why not?

214
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,833
Just isn't.

215
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,600
<i>It's my heart,
Doctor. It's racing.</i>

216
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,604
<i>I'm sure it's nothing. You're
a healthy woman, Marie.</i>

217
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,207
<i>Shouldn't you examine me?</i>

218
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,874
<i>Why don't you have Rico do it?</i>

219
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,011
You can't tell me you
didn't notice that pause.

220
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,581
Sorry.

221
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,691
<i>She's never waking up.</i>

222
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,251
This is a whole new
experience in super hi-def.

223
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,762
I had no idea Marie
wore an underwire.

224
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,855
It does sound a little forced.

225
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,198
Could be stiffening in his tongue,
which is a symptom of myxedema.

226
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:54,230
It's not the tongue. It's the dialogue.
I think I dated that nurse, though.

227
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,234
No.

228
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,278
What about the way he's
holding that stethoscope?

229
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,044
The thumb and forefinger
are meeting at an odd angle.

230
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,609
Could be a demyelination
from toxic exposure.

231
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,085
Back it up.

232
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,020
What's this, the AV Club?

233
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,650
It's diagnostic.
Everything's under control.

234
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,788
Yeah, excellent job
so far. House, outside.

235
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,665
Keep watching.

236
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,102
You'll never guess what
Rico's got in that box.

237
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,663
<i>Rico doesn't even
know I'm alive.</i>

238
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,676
You have an obsession with an actor
or the character he plays. I feel for you.

239
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,270
You need to work it out.
But I need you to do it

240
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,148
when the hospital's accreditation,
and my job, are not on the line.

241
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:42,245
You want the star of the hottest daytime
drama on TV to die in your hospital?

242
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:46,157
No, I want you to cure him without
committing any more felonies.

243
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,252
I can't do my job if you're
going to tie my hands like that.

244
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,661
Fifty-one weeks out of the year,

245
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,666
I let you run around like a
monkey in a banana factory.

246
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,703
All I'm just asking is that you
tone it down for a few days.

247
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,268
I want that TV.

248
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,536
We're not bargaining.

249
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,271
You want something. Either
you're bargaining or you're begging.

250
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,211
Me keeping my
job is good for you.

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,442
Yes, but it's better for you.

252
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,047
I just want us to
be equally happy.

253
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,952
EMG was negative for nerve entrapment.
Means the foot's a real symptom.

254
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,513
It could be vitamin deficiency.

255
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,623
Or a toxin.

256
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,159
Or atherosclerosis.

257
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,285
Or a toxin.

258
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,057
Why is toxin a better idea?

259
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,496
Might not be. We'll know after I'm finished
searching his set and dressing room

260
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,536
for medically relevant stuff.

261
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,938
Got to go. Need a decision.

262
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,064
You're not going to
cut your own throat.

263
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,165
Yeah, that sounds like me.

264
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:40,738
Test for heavy metals, organics,
bio toxins, and search the home.

265
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,848
I liked the pillow-top.

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,149
I like this one.

267
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,050
Great taste. That
model's top-of-the-line.

268
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,321
How much is it?

269
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,886
$1,999. It's a great price.

270
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,530
And what about...

271
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,964
That's too rich for us.

272
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,192
I don't know. You think...

273
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,398
Honey, we can't afford that,
not with a baby on the way.

274
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,100
Congratulations. Your first?

275
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,235
Yes.

276
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,609
How about I knock 100 bucks
off, maybe throw in free delivery.

277
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,580
Money's really tight right now.

278
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,277
I'm a law clerk, and my
husband just got laid off.

279
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,321
He has an interview
today. Wish him luck.

280
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,590
Good luck.

281
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,818
Fingers crossed.

282
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,894
We might be able
to afford $1,500.

283
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,296
I'd have to check
with my manager.

284
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,833
Thanks. I appreciate it.

285
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,668
Hold this, would you?

286
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,244
911 from work. I better go.

287
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,779
So, am I getting the hard mattress
or do I have to go to my job interview?

288
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,281
Whatever mattress you
want. I'm fine either way.

289
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,612
You... Really?

290
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,418
Really. Just as long as I
get to help you break it in.

291
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,633
Pack your manhood on ice,
maybe the hospital can re-attach it.

292
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,270
You were so wrong.
She's letting me choose.

293
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,713
"You choose" does
not mean you choose.

294
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,614
<i>Really? It sounded
like "You choose."</i>

295
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:29,179
I suppose it's possible she
meant "House is so, so wrong."

296
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:34,727
It's a trap. It means, "If you love
me, you'll buy the one I want."

297
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,853
Amber doesn't do
passive-aggressive.

298
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,693
People who do aggressive
don't like to limit themselves.

299
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,893
Could a leaky space heater cause
vision problems and numbness?

300
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,871
He'd have gotten better at
the hospital. It's not a trap.

301
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,465
Did I hear a question mark
at the end of that sentence?

302
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,910
<i>House, look. She's...</i>

303
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,309
Got to go.

304
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,972
Manager says I
can do that price.

305
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,387
The gin bottles are
all gifts from fans.

306
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,583
Brock Sterling drinks on the
show, but Evan doesn't drink at all.

307
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,355
He's on this whole health
kick right now. Fruits, nuts...

308
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,227
Did you take those
from his dressing room?

309
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,389
No.

310
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,236
You're not going to
marry Brock, are you?

311
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,396
We've been waiting four years
for him to make it official with Anna.

312
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,069
Are you really a doctor?

313
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,906
Glioblastoma. Need more proof?

314
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,079
So, no toxins on the set.
What about his regular life?

315
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,548
Unusual hobbies?
Unsavory friends?

316
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,883
No, I've been out with him.
He's as vanilla as they come.

317
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,445
And by "out" you mean...

318
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,623
Well, I asked him
on a date last month.

319
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,558
We went out a few times, but
we weren't right for each other.

320
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,425
Too small or too large?

321
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,325
Is that medically relevant?

322
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,097
I'm a doctor, and it's
relevant to me, so, yes.

323
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,395
We never got that far.

324
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,771
We made out awhile, then
he said he should go home.

325
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,643
He's a real gentleman.

326
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,110
Now, that'd be interesting.

327
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,979
He's impotent.

328
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,259
A steady diet of sunflower
seeds causes a B6 toxicity,

329
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:19,163
which causes autonomic dysregulation,
which causes a wood-free existence.

330
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,427
One bad night and a
couple of sunflower seeds

331
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,196
and he's got autonomic
dysregulation?

332
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,362
It's more than just one.

333
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,306
He can't even remember the last time
he was able to salute. It's cool, huh?

334
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,639
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen,
and we didn't find anything at the house.

335
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,304
So, all we have to do is
filter the B6 out of his blood.

336
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,848
Prep him for plasmapheresis.

337
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,884
Just because he didn't
salute doesn't mean he can't.

338
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,379
Can you find out where
that voice keeps coming from

339
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,808
and tell it to get
out of my head?

340
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,655
The impotence could be psychological.
He's depressed, hates his job...

341
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,285
Plasmapheresis has risks.

342
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,321
He should spend a night in the sleep
lab, see if he gets a reflex erection.

343
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,232
Confirmation is for
wimps and altar boys.

344
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,460
We don't need
to wait for a reflex.

345
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,736
If he can't get engorged the way God
intended, then he can't get engorged.

346
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,344
I'm not showing him my boobs.

347
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,541
Lack of response to
your chest tells us nothing.

348
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,674
Thirteen, show him...

349
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,805
Where can I find a decent
set of knockers around here?

350
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,355
Your porn's in
the second drawer.

351
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:26,329
All set. Heart monitor, blood-pressure
monitor, and the one on his junk.

352
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,202
This is humiliating.

353
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,347
<i>We're going to close the
blinds to give you some privacy.</i>

354
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,897
<i>The instruments will let
us monitor your response.</i>

355
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,941
I don't get this guy. He has the coolest
gig ever, but he's miserable about it.

356
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,856
Probably figures quitting
won't do him any good.

357
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,371
Figures he'd be
unhappy anywhere.

358
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,992
Our circumstances
affect whether we're...

359
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,178
You're pretty happy
in this job, right?

360
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,276
Sure.

361
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,753
Have you ever had a job
where you were miserable?

362
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,415
I once sold men's fragrances
in a department store.

363
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,426
And were you miserable?

364
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,955
The pay was awful.

365
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,190
It was a miserable job,
but you weren't miserable.

366
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,131
So, what about
you? Are you happy?

367
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,636
Not particularly.

368
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,398
Heart rate and BP are climbing.

369
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,704
Got some activity on the
tumescence monitor, too.

370
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,371
There's nothing wrong with
his naughty. It's not B6 toxicity.

371
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,086
Did he just finish?

372
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,953
Sometimes when you
haven't, you know, for a while...

373
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,892
His heart rate is through
the roof. 220 and climbing.

374
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,992
He's headed for cardiac arrest.

375
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,926
We shocked his heart
back into sinus rhythm.

376
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,602
He's stable, at least for now.

377
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,871
Could be some sort of
atypical septic reaction.

378
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,004
Not without a fever.

379
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,945
Thus the word "atypical."

380
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,479
In that case, it could
be an atypical bunion.

381
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,952
He used to smoke. Could be paraneoplastic
syndrome caused by small-cell lung cancer.

382
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,455
He quit 20 years ago, and
his calcium levels are normal.

383
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,649
Could be Graves' Disease.

384
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,702
Extreme hyperthyroidism
leads to systemic problems,

385
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,662
including numbness, vision
loss and cardiac arrest.

386
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,961
You want to be here.

387
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,234
I have to be here.

388
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,327
Just say the word.
I'll fire Thirteen.

389
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,996
Just sign the forms.

390
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,431
Smart move. I was bluffing.

391
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,139
She's right. We should fry
the thyroid before it fries him.

392
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,175
I know it's more exciting this way,
but shouldn't we confirm you're right

393
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,254
before destroying one of the
most important glands in his body?

394
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,290
If that gland has drawn a
bull's-eye on his heart, then, no.

395
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:35,761
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk for
vascular lesions and all kinds of cancer.

396
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,127
Protocol says we should
do an iodine uptake test.

397
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,466
We?

398
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,825
Anyone else want
to run a useless test

399
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,201
while Brock's thyroid
plots its next lethal move?

400
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,841
It was rhetorical.

401
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,344
You were sure
about B6 toxicity, too.

402
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,708
House is right.

403
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,344
Seriously? I mean, I
am, but you think so?

404
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,485
If he goes into full-on
thyroid storm, he'll die.

405
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,352
We got to nuke his thyroid.

406
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,032
Hang up the phone.

407
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,512
Why? If we're going
to nuke his thyroid...

408
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,802
We're not nuking the guy's
thyroid without proof that it's Graves'.

409
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,535
Do the iodine uptake test.

410
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,633
If House finds out...
When House finds out...

411
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,144
We'll have the test results.

412
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,341
And we'll either do his
procedure or we won't.

413
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,129
What are you doing here?

414
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,494
Just grabbing a snack.

415
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,330
You keep food in the morgue?

416
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,562
If I keep it in the lounge,
everyone else eats it.

417
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,702
That's because it's
everyone else's food.

418
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,672
I thought it was just
everyone else's bags.

419
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,544
The Accreditation Board
will light us on fire for this.

420
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,844
They're not going to find out.

421
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:07,615
Unless, of course, Conway planned on
inspecting the morgue in, say, two minutes.

422
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,452
Is that why you're here?

423
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,889
You're going to get me
fired over a sandwich?

424
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,157
No, over a TV. And you're not going
to get fired because you're going to fold.

425
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,788
No, I won't.

426
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,959
But you're going to push
it, so we need a safe word,

427
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,805
so you can signal your
unconditional surrender.

428
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:30,607
Call me "sweet sauce."
Dr. House. I don't think we've met.

429
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,145
Dr. Jamie Conway.
I've heard your name.

430
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,476
Most people have.
It's also a noun.

431
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,284
I sometimes come down here
to relax, unwind, maybe grab a...

432
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,754
Sweet sauce.

433
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,150
It's a nickname.

434
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,455
An ironic nickname.

435
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:53,922
Wow, it is almost 2:00.
Aren't you supposed to be...

436
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,368
Oh, yeah. Yeah, 'cause those sick blind
kids aren't going to read to themselves.

437
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,435
See you.

438
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:15,549
I recommend skipping C26. Floater,
been in the river at least a week.

439
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,052
Thanks for the
warning. Any time.

440
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,664
Doesn't the doctors'
lounge have that same TV?

441
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,968
No, they've got a 12-inch exactly
like the one that used to be in here.

442
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,973
Your files are done.

443
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:42,273
I'll be doing a dance of joy
just as soon as my leg is healed.

444
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,849
Can you tilt it down?

445
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,248
I know the paperwork annoys you,

446
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:48,617
but patient records are important.
You can't just let them sit there.

447
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,446
I had to, in the
name of science.

448
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,722
I let the crap pile up,

449
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,092
then I see which team
member is most self-flagellating.

450
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,563
Breaks down, clears up the mess.

451
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,058
Surprise was, it turned
out to be you again.

452
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,272
You weren't even
registered as a competitor.

453
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,866
You miss me. You miss me.

454
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,009
You hired Thirteen to replace...

455
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,808
Yeah, all pretty
girls are fungible.

456
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,471
You're avoiding.

457
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:22,213
I miss the job. I miss running
around playing private investigator.

458
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,758
I miss the puzzles.

459
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,160
Seriously, I'll fire Thirteen.

460
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,564
Or Kutner, if you
think Thirteen is hot.

461
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,661
I don't miss you.

462
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,131
That iodine left a
really weird aftertaste.

463
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,177
That's the tracer in it. We'll have
the images in a couple minutes.

464
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,646
You must do okay
with women, huh?

465
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,512
I already asked him that.

466
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,577
And?

467
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,453
It's not all it's
cracked up to be.

468
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,819
He feels unfulfilled.

469
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,016
I doubt it.

470
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,922
I'm lying?

471
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,628
I used to be a plastic surgeon.

472
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,956
I'd talk about my work as
shallow and meaningless.

473
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:12,637
Truth is, I loved every
boob job, every tummy tuck.

474
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,572
Meaning doesn't mean that much.

475
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,005
But you're not a plastic
surgeon anymore.

476
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,538
It's complicated.

477
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,673
Are you happier?

478
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,243
It's complicated.

479
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,480
His thyroid looks normal.

480
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,915
So, that's good news, right?

481
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,323
Everything look
too bright to you?

482
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:35,486
It could be the monitor.

483
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,763
It's not the monitor.
It's the iodine.

484
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,896
It's everywhere. His
body's not filtering it.

485
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,439
His kidneys are failing.

486
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,707
I told you to nuke his thyroid.

487
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,773
It's a good thing we didn't. Kidney
failure means it wasn't Graves'.

488
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,911
So, your test screwed me
and our patient's kidneys.

489
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,431
You practically
poisoned him with iodine.

490
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,448
Which he could have handled
easily if his kidneys were healthy.

491
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,460
All we did was reveal a new
symptom. Usually you're all for that.

492
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,928
It must be the rancid tinge
of betrayal that's put me off.

493
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,124
You were wrong.

494
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,894
So, tell me to my face.

495
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,668
You've never hesitated before.
The board's turning you into a coward.

496
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,636
I did it because it was
the right thing to do.

497
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,004
You did it to pass
an inspection.

498
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,735
Does it matter?

499
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,643
Kidney failure on top of the other
symptoms points to an autoimmune condition,

500
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,944
which means that any of his
other organs could be next.

501
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,820
We've already started dialysis. We
need to run ANA's for autoimmune.

502
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,281
You're right. You and the
team go measure the ceilings.

503
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,252
Excuse me?

504
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,193
Accreditation Board
guidelines state that

505
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:47,198
no object can be less than
18 inches from the ceiling.

506
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,476
Make sure we're in compliance.

507
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,445
There's nothing in our
office that would be less...

508
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,961
I don't mean us. I
mean the whole hospital.

509
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,645
Let's see how this baby handles.

510
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,491
What?

511
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,031
You bought the firm mattress.

512
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,391
I thought that's the
one you wanted.

513
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,867
It was.

514
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,104
Why would you do that?

515
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,195
Because...

516
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,309
Is this a trick question?

517
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,605
I left it up to you.

518
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,913
You were supposed to
get the one you wanted.

519
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,777
I got the one you wanted
because I love you.

520
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:40,944
No.

521
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:48,088
You did it because
that's what you do.

522
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,271
With all your ex-wives, you
did whatever they wanted

523
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,197
because it was easier, and
you ended up resenting them.

524
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,200
Don't you dare do that to me.

525
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,364
What, take care of you?

526
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,234
Have you met me?

527
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,640
I can take care of me.

528
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,303
I need you to take care of you.

529
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,546
I have work to do.

530
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,087
You made it to page eight.

531
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,561
"Mysterious Hospital
Visit for Soap Doc."

532
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,062
Wow, I'll be sure to
send my mom a copy.

533
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,003
They told me I have
an autoimmune disease,

534
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,769
like Lupus or Sarcoidosis.

535
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,678
That's what we're
here to find out.

536
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,847
You really as good as
everyone seems to think you are?

537
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:51,048
Are you really as miserable as
everyone seems to think you are?

538
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:55,025
I just want to do
something that matters.

539
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,857
Nothing matters.

540
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:04,130
We're all just cockroaches,
wildebeests dying on the riverbank.

541
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,505
Nothing we do has
any lasting meaning.

542
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,666
And you think I'm miserable?

543
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,836
If you're unhappy on
the plane, jump out of it.

544
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,511
I want to,

545
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,875
but I can't.

546
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,215
That's the problem with
metaphors. They need interpretation.

547
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,725
Jumping out of
the plane is stupid.

548
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,160
But what if I'm not in a plane?

549
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,589
What if I'm just in a
place I don't want to be?

550
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,832
That's the other
problem with metaphors.

551
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,202
Yes, what if you're actually
in an ice cream truck,

552
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,673
and outside are candy
and flowers and virgins?

553
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:46,940
You're on a plane.
We're all on planes.

554
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,576
Life is dangerous and complicated,
and it's a long way down.

555
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,687
So, you're afraid to change?

556
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,391
No, you're afraid to change.

557
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:05,326
You'd rather imagine that you
can escape, instead of actually try,

558
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,432
because if you fail,
you've got nothing.

559
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,633
So, you'll give up the
chance at something real,

560
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,571
so you that can hold on to hope.

561
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,835
Thing is, hope is for sissies.

562
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,509
When I get out of here, I'm
not going to be afraid anymore.

563
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,187
I mean, how many guys
get a second chance?

564
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:36,193
Too many. Half the people I save
don't deserve a second chance.

565
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,594
Now that I've got mine,
I'm going to set things right.

566
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:45,667
I'm going to start by being a better
father to you and to your sister.

567
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,305
And to your other sister.
And to your other sister.

568
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,341
You realize you're reciting
lines from last season?

569
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,279
We're going to do all
the things I promised.

570
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,981
Just help me get
out of this bed.

571
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,819
Cooling blankets in here.
This guy's brain is about to boil.

572
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,398
Do you know where you
are? What's your name?

573
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,496
Dr. Brock Sterling.

574
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:26,242
Fever rules out autoimmune. He's
septic. He's got a massive infection.

575
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,055
We've got him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

576
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,571
but he's slipped from
delirium into a coma.

577
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:34,142
Good news is last time Brock was
in a coma, he fathered two children.

578
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,654
We need to identify the infection and
get him on more targeted meds fast.

579
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,037
What about pneumococcus?
Causes heart problems and sepsis.

580
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,804
But not the neuropathies in his foot
and eyes. What about tetanus? It fits.

581
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,457
He got a tetanus booster
last year. Lyme disease?

582
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,774
He would have
been sore all over.

583
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,476
There's a thousand infections
that could have caused this.

584
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,937
We can start testing, but he'll
be dead before the cultures grow.

585
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,464
Unless it's a fungus. We could
see that under a microscope.

586
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,137
Test for fungi, parasites,
all creatures great and small.

587
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,839
Where are you going?

588
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,905
To lie down. I need to think.

589
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:12,684
Could be rat bite fever,
but his glands aren't swollen.

590
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,488
Which one are you going to get?

591
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,798
She told me to
get the one I want.

592
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:20,924
So get it.

593
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:26,897
Listeria explains the sepsis,
possibly also the heart problem.

594
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,564
But not the numbness.

595
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,278
If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis,
which then caused the numbness...

596
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,409
I want a waterbed.

597
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,752
Wow.

598
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:48,020
I've always wanted one. I
know it's ridiculous, it's just

599
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:51,860
there's something nice about the
thought of being rocked to sleep in water.

600
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,466
No mocking? No Freudian
analysis of how the waterbed

601
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,768
is really a great big
vagina I want to crawl into?

602
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,702
I'm ignoring you because
you make me sad.

603
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,074
He's on ampicillin, which
means if it was listeria,

604
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,580
he would've shown
some improvement.

605
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:13,949
No, it's a whole thing. You need
special sheets and insurance and...

606
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,580
Who cares? You wanted
one your whole life.

607
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,820
You're a grown-up. You
can afford it. Stores sell them.

608
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,452
Most adults don't go through
life like you do, House,

609
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,360
indulging our every whim.

610
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,666
Then you don't
deserve to be happy.

611
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,598
And yet I am. You?

612
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,810
Amber will think it's stupid.

613
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,547
It is stupid.

614
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,655
Live the dream, Wilson.

615
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,028
It's not an infection.
It's an allergy.

616
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,223
That's why it's not
responding to antibiotics.

617
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,664
This isn't a soap opera, House.

618
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,828
People don't just wake up from
comas the second you give them drugs.

619
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,964
Especially if we give them the
wrong drugs. What do the tests say?

620
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,484
It was negative for fungus and
parasites, but that doesn't mean...

621
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,654
The more infections we rule out, the more
likely it is that it's not an infection.

622
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,739
He has no history of allergies
or asthma. Most importantly,

623
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,545
none of his symptoms remotely
resemble an allergic reaction.

624
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,177
Allergens could trigger
an allergic vasculitis.

625
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,464
That would explain the symptoms.

626
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,751
One in a million times.

627
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,757
Septic infection always
explains his symptoms.

628
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,692
But an infection is never
resistant to every antibiotic.

629
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,201
No, an infection
is rarely resistant.

630
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,529
And allergy never responds to antibiotics.
"Never" beats "rarely." QED, I win.

631
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,502
There were chrysanthemums
in his dressing room.

632
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,937
My God, why didn't you say
he'd been exposed to plant life?

633
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,033
Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.
It's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.

634
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,547
He has an infection. If we
give him steroids, we'll kill him.

635
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,158
He has an allergy. If we don't
give him steroids, we'll kill him.

636
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,182
Not as fast.

637
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,445
Fast enough.

638
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,663
You don't have time for the rest of
the tests. We have to do something.

639
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,122
And what we're doing
right now isn't working.

640
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,821
Hundred milligrams
methylprednisolone.

641
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,453
Patients' names?

642
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,089
It's one patient.

643
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,966
You want to give one patient 100
milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.

644
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:14,096
Perfect, my patient's
a '69 Ford Coma.

645
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,641
Anything over 50 milligrams, I
need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.

646
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,801
It's protocol, and
the inspector's here.

647
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,403
I am 99% certain
that she'll consent.

648
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,143
But for the sake of the
1%, why don't I just...

649
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,281
You're not allowed back here.

650
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,753
Well, tell the inspector
he can put it on my tab.

651
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,022
I didn't mean now.

652
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:51,073
100 milligrams of
methylprednisolone is an overdose.

653
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,906
We were wrong
about the infection.

654
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,173
He's suffering from a
severe allergic reaction.

655
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,738
The team hasn't finished
the test for allergy.

656
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:58,849
His symptoms don't...

657
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,545
In rare cases...

658
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,514
Trust me, at the end of
this conversation, I'm right.

659
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,080
Then confirm it.
Get a blood test.

660
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:09,628
What is it about this
severe and deepening coma

661
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,338
that makes you think
we've got time for protocol?

662
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,140
Protocol has saved your
patient from having his

663
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,463
thyroid destroyed
and his blood drained.

664
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:21,104
If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm
wrong. Don't talk about protocol.

665
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,039
My job's on the line.
Your job is on the line.

666
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,646
Okay, here's what you do.

667
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,910
You wait three minutes,
then you call security.

668
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,425
By the time they get in here
to lock me up, I'll be done.

669
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,553
He gets to live. Your
ass gets to be covered.

670
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:54,470
If he dies, let me know,
so I can pack my things.

671
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:49,460
Tests are negative. Patient's
negative for all floral allergies.

672
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,861
I'm going to restart
the antibiotics.

673
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,368
If he's still alive.

674
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,248
Ampicillin, two grams, IV.

675
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,347
Why? The steroids
worked. House was right.

676
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,446
The test was negative.

677
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,821
He was still right.

678
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,659
It was an allergy.

679
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,093
To what?

680
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,230
Thank you.

681
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,769
I was wrong.

682
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,531
You should have stopped me.

683
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,939
Heard about House's
patient. Bold move.

684
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,545
And you backed him.

685
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:48,712
He was right.

686
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,183
He wasn't even in the
same neighborhood as right.

687
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:53,281
The patient's alive.

688
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,226
Okay, the rules exist
because 95% of the time,

689
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,730
for 95% of people,
they're the right thing to do.

690
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,766
And the other 5%?

691
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,529
Have to live by the same rules.

692
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:07,070
Because everybody
thinks they're in that 5%.

693
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,431
Okay.

694
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,738
I noticed that Dr. Chase...

695
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,161
What are you doing out here?

696
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,099
I can't sleep. I
hate the waterbed.

697
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,270
I actually kind of like it.

698
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,178
No, it's awful.

699
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,977
We're returning it tomorrow.

700
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,513
Okay.

701
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,530
I'm glad you got it, though.

702
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,131
Me, too.

703
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,504
I hope they'll take it back.

704
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,145
They will.

705
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,347
<i>You promised me
you'd stop drinking.</i>

706
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,350
<i>Of course I'm drunk, Anna. They told
me you'd never wake up from that coma.</i>

707
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,556
<i>But how could you get
engaged to my sister?</i>

708
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,732
<i>We fell in love.</i>

709
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,765
<i>What do you want from
me, Anna? I'm just a man.</i>

710
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,203
<i>And I'm just a woman.</i>

711
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,541
<i>And as thrilled as I am
about The Lady Slipper being</i>

712
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,673
<i>the best nightclub Port
Lawrence has ever seen...</i>

713
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,392
Hello. <i>HOUSE: Don't hang up.</i>

714
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,464
What was the verdict?

715
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,869
$200,000 fine.

716
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,739
You should have been fired.

717
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:24,832
Good night, House.

718
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,901
There are bubbles in his glass.

719
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,207
Can this wait until...

720
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,874
My patient. He's
allergic to quinine.

721
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,314
And you got this from bubbles?

722
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,151
<i>His symptoms started
two months ago.</i>

723
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,724
That's also when Brock
started downing gin

724
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:42,959
and tonics like a Brit
staving off malaria.

725
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,758
Gin was fake,
the tonic was real.

726
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:50,425
And tonic water is
loaded with quinine.

727
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,499
Nice job.

728
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,638
You should have been fired.

729
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,105
I'm taking back the TV.

730
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,336
I saved his life.

731
00:42:58,443 --> 00:42:59,502
That wasn't the deal.

732
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,978
The contract clearly
stated no takesie-backsies.

733
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,577
Good night, House.

734
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,947
What are you wearing?

735
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:07,783
Good night, House.

736
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,343
Good night, Cuddy.
