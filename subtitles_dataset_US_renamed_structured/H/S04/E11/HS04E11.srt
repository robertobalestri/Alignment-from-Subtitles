1
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,598
Doc! Help! Doc!

2
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,721
It stopped bleeding.
It stopped bleeding.

3
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,520
That's because your blood is
freezing as it's hitting the air.

4
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,022
Here. Apply pressure on it.

5
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,494
I think my leg is frozen.

6
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,158
That's the least of your problems.
The blade severed your femoral artery.

7
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,302
Am I going to lose my leg?

8
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,607
Frostbite's not too bad.

9
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,706
But I've got to fix your artery
now. This is going to hurt.

10
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,233
Are you going to put that in me?

11
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,852
Glue's the best way to repair
your artery at this temperature.

12
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,724
It looks okay.

13
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,198
Here. Tear off some pieces.
I have to check your foot.

14
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,140
Blood flow looks good.
Your leg should be okay.

15
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,503
I thought I was done.

16
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,515
Yeah, like I'd let
anything happen to you.

17
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,502
You're the only one who
could fix the generators.

18
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,815
Okay. One, two...

19
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,651
Cate. Cate, are you
okay? Are you okay?

20
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,358
Hey.

21
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,833
I need help.

22
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,102
Who am I supposed to get?

23
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,260
Why do I even
give you an office?

24
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,796
New case. Psych department
asked for you personally.

25
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,159
The patient's a crazy person?

26
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,597
You're a crazy person.

27
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,929
The patient's a psychiatrist.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
There's something wrong
with coma guy's cable.

29
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,599
He seems fine with it.

30
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,639
Your patient is an adjunct faculty
member here, but currently...

31
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,779
The budget committee voted to
charge for cable in the patient rooms.

32
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,512
Slippery slope.

33
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,985
Today, we withhold porn.
Tomorrow, it's clean bandages.

34
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,956
Talk to Carlson in Derm, he
runs the budget committee,

35
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,548
after you look at this.

36
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,185
After you talk to
Carlson, maybe I'll...

37
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,627
The patient is trapped
at the South Pole.

38
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,702
Any possibility of
evacuating her?

39
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,243
Well, that wouldn't be any fun.

40
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:41,008
And for the next two months, winds make
it impossible to fly anything in or out.

41
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,921
Could be appendicitis
or a gallstone.

42
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,314
Or a kidney stone.

43
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,250
That wouldn't be any fun.

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,484
If it's appendicitis down there,
her appendix ruptures, she dies.

45
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,834
There's nothing we can do. If
it's a stone, she takes pain meds,

46
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,759
stone passes. There's
nothing we need to do.

47
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,762
Could be a struvite
kidney stone.

48
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,822
Most kidney stones are calcium and benign.
Why would you suspect a struvite stone?

49
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,926
Because he said kidney
stones were boring.

50
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,834
It's possible. She's
on birth control.

51
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,170
Lots of sex could lead
to urinary tract infection,

52
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,732
which could lead to an
infection-laced struvite kidney stone.

53
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,108
Excessive Antarctic drilling,

54
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,580
bad for the environment
and the ladies.

55
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,692
If it's a struvite stone, she
needs to break it up quickly

56
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,427
before the infection
shuts down her kidneys.

57
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,113
This is where it gets fun.

58
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,089
These are the supplies and
medications she has available.

59
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,075
Nothing here that could
break up a kidney stone.

60
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,817
What else do they
have down there?

61
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,164
I just said... I don't mean
medical stuff. Other stuff.

62
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,462
Some geological equipment
breaks ice and rock

63
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,972
the same way we
break kidney stones.

64
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,214
Discovery Channel. I like
watching them blow stuff up.

65
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,748
Who doesn't?

66
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,444
That reminds me.

67
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,044
<i>Coma guy needs cable.</i>

68
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,699
Women's billiards is the only
thing that's keeping him alive.

69
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,283
I'm sure Carlson will
be moved by his plight.

70
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,520
Carlson won't listen.
He says I hit on his wife.

71
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,793
You knew? God, no.

72
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,661
I thought I was
hitting on his daughter.

73
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,495
Look, you're on the
committee. He'll listen to you.

74
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,333
I'm an avid reader of Committees
with Hotties message boards.

75
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,134
Amoxicillin, 500 milligrams, IV.

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,331
Studies conducted
at major hospitals

77
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,940
indicate that happy
patients recover faster.

78
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,106
Studies conducted in my apartment
show that TV makes people happy.

79
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,548
Premium channels have
a particularly striking effect.

80
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,518
Charging patients for cable is
bringing in 13 grand a month.

81
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,718
Until this injustice is righted, I
am going to waste 13 grand a day.

82
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,560
That's $2.49 down.

83
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,329
Get an EKG and a cardiac enzyme.

84
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,301
If those check out, discharge him,
and tell him to get a snow-blower.

85
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,703
How much is 13 grand
divided by 4 cents?

86
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,473
I am not giving you cable.

87
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,410
You're gonna have to somehow
survive with the broadcast networks alone.

88
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,572
I'll be fine on Tuesdays.

89
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,018
If sound waves from the
flaw detector break the egg,

90
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,213
it should safely dissolve
your kidney stone.

91
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,857
<i>This isn't going to work.</i>

92
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,239
Well, there's no
reason it shouldn't.

93
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,528
Sound waves are sound
waves. Stones are stones.

94
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,660
<i>Some are bigger than
others. Some are inside me.</i>

95
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,034
How's it going, Team MacGyver?

96
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,367
Oh, great.

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,773
I can't get cable, but I can
get the South Pole on high-def.

98
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,316
We're almost ready
to start the test.

99
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,007
Test? Did Ford test the Edsel?

100
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:32,447
Did Coke test New Coke? Did
Shakespeare test his final play, <i>Snow Dogs?</i>

101
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,851
<i>I'm guessing you're Dr. House?</i>

102
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,923
<i>I was wondering when
you might drop by.</i>

103
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,853
Could she see me?

104
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,088
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

105
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,529
You think Jagger shows
up for the sound check?

106
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,901
Okay, roadies, off the stage.

107
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,570
Go help Cameron in the ER.

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,132
Why? No way you're
just doing her a favor.

109
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,801
ER is standing room only.

110
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,711
Which means Cameron's
bound to make a mistake.

111
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,313
Find it so I can blackmail her.

112
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,709
As far as you know,

113
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,447
this is way more than just
some silly battle over cable.

114
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,792
<i>Ready.</i>

115
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,555
You might wanna
dial it down a smidge.

116
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,720
<i>I am not doing this.</i>

117
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,357
<i>Your kidney stone theory
hinges on me having sex, but I...</i>

118
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,058
Let me guess. You're as
pure as the driven snow.

119
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,964
<i>Only if the snow
likes to be on top.</i>

120
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,068
<i>But I am here doing
psychological research.</i>

121
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,198
<i>Generally not a good idea to
swap fluids with your subjects.</i>

122
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,675
Struvite stones are possible
in people who don't have sex.

123
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,975
They're certainly possible
in people who claim not to...

124
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,484
I've had no UTI's,
no pain on urination.

125
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,145
You do realize that only
one of us is a real doctor.

126
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,121
<i>You do realize only one of us
has any control over my actions.</i>

127
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,923
Dr. Milton, are you
able to run a CHEM-7?

128
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,019
<i>Yes.</i>

129
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,341
Well, that'd tell us if her
kidney function is declining.

130
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,663
If it is, he's right.

131
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,929
Struvite stone's the
most likely explanation.

132
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,868
If not, she's right.

133
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,542
Sorry. I know how you like to
avoid avoiding confrontation.

134
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,912
While we're waiting for that test to
prove me right, start IV cefuroxime.

135
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,576
Keep the infection in the stone
from wiping out your kidneys.

136
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,847
<i>I'll send the CHEM-7
results when I'm done.</i>

137
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,553
She's a great psychiatrist.
One session, I've got shrinkage.

138
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,159
House wants us to
spy on you, report back.

139
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,597
And you're telling
me this because...

140
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,195
We don't want to do it.

141
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,432
I don't see a problem so far.

142
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,441
If our choice is between pissing
House off or pissing you off,

143
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,101
that's not much of a choice.

144
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,646
So unless I give House cable,

145
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,544
you're gonna make
my life miserable.

146
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,174
Yes.

147
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,243
And you're telling me this so you
won't feel as guilty when you do it.

148
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,516
Yes.

149
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,555
Accommodating House's every
whim is not my job anymore.

150
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,219
But it is ours.

151
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,395
House will get what he wants.

152
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,497
Maybe we should just pay for it
ourselves and tell him she folded.

153
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,103
No.

154
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,539
Your CHEM-7 results showed
your kidney function is declining.

155
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,982
Sounds like a
kidney stone to me.

156
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,575
<i>The decreased function</i>

157
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,589
<i>could be from dehydration caused
by vomiting due to a gallstone.</i>

158
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,990
You agreed that the CHEM-7
would decide if it was a struvite stone.

159
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,723
I agreed to do the test. The
results are up for interpretation.

160
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,231
I'll re-do the test in an
hour when I'm re-hydrated.

161
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,895
Have you noticed any improvement
since starting the cefuroxime?

162
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,369
<i>Not really. Pain's
about the same.</i>

163
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,115
While you're waiting,
we should run another test

164
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,232
with the geology equipment.

165
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,741
You're not taking
the cefuroxime.

166
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,273
She's right-handed.

167
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,973
Means she would put
the IV in her left arm.

168
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,092
Catheter in the arm makes
it hard to bend the elbow,

169
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,426
the way people
do when they drink.

170
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,114
We have a limited supply of
medication, and I am not about to waste it.

171
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,248
Last I checked you had a
limited supply of doctors.

172
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:35,023
<i>Right before I got sick, one of my crew
members severed his femoral artery.</i>

173
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,426
<i>He needs the cefuroxime.</i>

174
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,794
<i>Right. He called dibs.</i>

175
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:42,131
His need is definitive.
Mine is speculative.

176
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,035
You're breathing fast.

177
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,662
<i>It's because I'm pissed off!</i>

178
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,708
Lift up your chin.
Show me your windpipe.

179
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,436
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

180
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,606
It's deviating to the left.

181
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,058
Because her right
lung is collapsing.

182
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,846
Cate, is anyone there with you?

183
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,495
<i>Sean went to the mess.</i>
You need to call someone.

184
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,681
There's no time. Get
a syringe and a needle.

185
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,347
Why am I doing
that? <i>Shut up and look.</i>

186
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,085
She could pass
out. She needs to...

187
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,446
She needs to
re-inflate that lung.

188
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,955
Okay. Now, pull out the plunger.

189
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,056
I want you to stab
yourself in your right side

190
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,034
between the second and third
rib, in the midclavicular line.

191
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,278
By the time we get someone
else there, you'll have suffocated.

192
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,568
<i>Just do it.</i>

193
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,335
See all the good stuff that
happens when you listen to me?

194
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,619
<i>Means it's not a kidney stone.</i>

195
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,030
<i>Right side pain, vomiting,</i>

196
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,441
<i>and now a lung that gets
traumatized without any trauma.</i>

197
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,205
<i>Sounds odd. Probably is odd.</i>

198
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,145
<i>We should discuss
this, then call her back.</i>

199
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,309
No, it's fine. I made sure we got
the South Pole long distance plan.

200
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,410
Her latest kidney
function test shows...

201
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,319
<i>I know what it shows. I ran it.</i>

202
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,142
The more you interrupt, the longer
my grandstanding is going to take.

203
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,660
Since when do you let patients
participate in differentials?

204
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,230
Since the patient and her doctor
happen to be the same person.

205
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,991
<i>Your kidney function is still declining.
Means you have a kidney problem.</i>

206
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,468
But not one that needed
antibiotics. Makes us equally wrong.

207
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,734
No. Makes us both
wrong. Not equally.

208
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,669
You were at least six wronger.

209
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,579
They run a PPD
before you shipped out?

210
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,580
<i>On me and everybody
else here. It's not TB.</i>

211
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,479
<i>Excuse us a second.</i>

212
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,615
Cancer explains her symptoms.

213
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,781
A tumor in her lung or kidney
that threw a clot to the other organ.

214
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,417
And you're worried the tumor
might overhear, realize we're on to it.

215
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,792
Cancer's a hard diagnosis for patients,
even when they're not in the South Pole.

216
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,127
We should figure this
out, maybe bring Wilson in.

217
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,169
<i>Obviously, you two
think I'm in bad shape.</i>

218
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,367
Only if you count
the tumor. House.

219
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,967
Probably in your abdomen.

220
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,455
<i>But you don't have any
advanced imaging equipment.</i>

221
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,159
<i>You also don't have
a surgeon to biopsy it,</i>

222
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,080
<i>any stains to use on the slide,</i>

223
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,084
<i>or an oncologist to analyze it.</i>

224
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,578
<i>I'm too far away
to hold her hand.</i>

225
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,615
<i>I have cancer?</i>

226
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,381
Possibly.

227
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,690
Since the only imaging equipment
you have is x-ray, let's start there.

228
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,821
X-ray your entire body.

229
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,166
<i>I'll upload the images
when I'm done.</i>

230
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,630
Good for you.

231
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,525
<i>She's annoying.</i>

232
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,370
Refused to take the antibiotics
because other people might need them.

233
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,202
She said she cares
about other people?

234
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,469
What a poser.

235
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,510
KUB is clean.

236
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,638
You don't like her
because she's a psychiatrist.

237
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,912
Mmm, I'm a complicated man.
I loathe her for many reasons.

238
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,146
Never before has a
profession been so decried

239
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,211
by someone who
needed it so badly.

240
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,485
You talk a lot of smack
about tranny hookers.

241
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,356
Enlarged mediastinal node.

242
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,486
Lymphoma? Probably,

243
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,553
but we can't confirm
it without a biopsy.

244
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,303
We can't analyze a
biopsy without a stain.

245
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,526
We can't biopsy.

246
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,398
Since they don't have stains
down there, we need a substitute.

247
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,904
She can't biopsy that node
without a surgical team and an OR.

248
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,443
Anything with a strong
color could work as a stain.

249
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,511
Printer ink, food
coloring, coffee.

250
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,706
No, thanks.

251
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,215
I'll find a node closer to the
surface. One she can biopsy.

252
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,276
That makes sense.

253
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,375
That makes sense?

254
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,682
I said it first.

255
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,121
In a shockingly calm manner.

256
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,855
After I've just been jerking
you around for 30 seconds

257
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,556
without you complaining
or analyzing said jerking.

258
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,995
I was being mature.

259
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,233
In a lavender shirt.

260
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,225
You, for some reason, are happy.

261
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,862
How dare you.

262
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,237
The x-rays don't show
any other abnormal nodes.

263
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:18,438
Abnormal nodes can be felt
before they can be seen on an x-ray.

264
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,742
You're wearing that
shirt for someone.

265
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,282
The Health Department.
They frown on topless oncology.

266
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,714
You're gonna do a physical?

267
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,221
Have to. You and Foreman are
going to be here looking for a stain.

268
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,356
I can do the physical. There's
no reason you need to watch.

269
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,092
I can think of at
least three reasons.

270
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,495
<i>One of them is medical.</i>

271
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,567
Where are you?
Not in your office.

272
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,659
You're not in the hospital.
No reason for me to be.

273
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,829
I'm not undressing for
you in your apartment.

274
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,236
<i>You're not in my apartment.</i>

275
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,338
You're three quarters
of a world away.

276
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,244
<i>I promise not to get fresh.</i>

277
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,711
I'm not taking off my clothes.

278
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,807
One of us has to.

279
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,785
Show me your place.

280
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,088
It's got walls, a floor,
and in some places, a roof.

281
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,325
<i>I am not exposing myself
without some reciprocity.</i>

282
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,093
It's my apartment.
It's not my soul.

283
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,130
<i>Living room.</i>

284
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:22,941
Slow down.

285
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,409
<i>Huh!</i>

286
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,505
Lots of books. I'm
betting all medical.

287
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,051
<i>Only if you count Jenna Jameson's
autobiography as a gynecological text.</i>

288
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,710
Fiction is a waste of time.

289
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,644
Unless you can laugh at it?

290
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,883
<i>I love to laugh. Moving on.</i>

291
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,126
Back up.

292
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,160
<i>How bad is the insomnia?</i>

293
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,727
<i>Let me quantify that.</i>

294
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,566
<i>Do you drink two or three scotches
before passing out in front of the TV?</i>

295
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,630
You are so far off.

296
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,469
<i>It's bourbon.</i>

297
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,738
<i>No photos anywhere.</i>

298
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,878
Family and friends
aren't important?

299
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,342
Well, you're sick.

300
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,545
You have 20 people down the hall,
and you've had exactly one visitor.

301
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,984
<i>I don't want to panic anyone.</i>

302
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,491
You don't like people. You
hide on that ice cube, so...

303
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:17,189
<i>Stop projecting. You're antisocial,
so you assume I'm antisocial?</i>

304
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,527
How about if I just get
naked, and you shut up?

305
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,431
<i>If I thought I could get you
naked, I would have led with that.</i>

306
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,698
<i>You'd rather show me
your soul than your leg.</i>

307
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,170
Great. You got
me all figured out.

308
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,401
You going to try and fix me now?

309
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,647
<i>I never said you needed fixing.</i>

310
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,810
He's letting her take
part in the differentials.

311
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,515
Of course he is. He likes her.

312
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,117
Big shock. Spaghetti sauce
doesn't work as a lymph tissue stain.

313
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,327
I'll try the coffee.

314
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,423
He's annoyed by her,
doesn't respect her as a doctor,

315
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,160
constantly insults her.

316
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,931
That's House's
version of courtship.

317
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,036
Oh, God. He's been
wooing me for years.

318
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,666
She's the perfect woman for him.

319
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,610
Willing to literally go to the
end of the earth for her career,

320
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,545
making her unavailable
for a real relationship.

321
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,083
And she's afflicted
with a mysterious illness.

322
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,118
Soy sauce is a no-go.

323
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,319
We're gonna be here all night.

324
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,181
How long does it
take you to get naked?

325
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,089
<i>It's the South Pole.</i>

326
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,986
I wear a lot of layers.

327
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,229
<i>Okay. Ready.</i>

328
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,233
I saw socks.

329
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,529
That's not naked.

330
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,002
Have I mentioned
it's freezing here?

331
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,535
<i>When they discover lymph nodes
in feet, I will take off my socks.</i>

332
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,438
Use your right hand
to palpate the nodes.

333
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,113
Any node you can feel
is the one we can biopsy.

334
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,776
Let's start with your breasts,
move down to the ass, then...

335
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,083
<i>I was thinking go from the
neck and work my way down.</i>

336
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,919
We could,

337
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,190
but I'd never forgive myself if we found
something before we got to your breasts.

338
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,258
I'm starting with the
anterior cervical nodes.

339
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,000
Turn your head.

340
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,233
Locate the SCM muscle.

341
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,902
<i>I know how to find
my lymph nodes.</i>

342
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,209
Did they teach you that before or after
the class on fondling your inner child?

343
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,975
<i>No swelling. No
tenderness. And...</i>

344
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,512
<i>I can hear that, House.</i>

345
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,419
Just thought it
might help you relax.

346
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,522
Anything in the axillary nodes?

347
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,321
All clear.

348
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,056
Both sides.

349
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,495
Now slide your
hand to your sternum.

350
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,665
Probe for nodes
moving slowly downward.

351
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,267
<i>Down to what, House?</i>

352
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,439
<i>Sorry. Can't hear you on
account of your heavy breathing.</i>

353
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,474
<i>I'm supposed to be
on oxygen, you tool.</i>

354
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,383
Hold it.

355
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,551
Your fingers didn't go quite
as deep. Feel that node again.

356
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,557
<i>It's swollen.</i>

357
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,899
Looks like you're
doing a biopsy.

358
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,244
<i>It's pretty numb.</i>

359
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:26,649
Okay. Take a deep breath and
insert the needle into the node.

360
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,156
Come on, Cate.
Let's get this over with.

361
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,823
You used her name.

362
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,825
Just trying to move
things along, Bob.

363
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,465
Okay. I'm in.

364
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,637
You need to pull
back on the syringe.

365
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:56,907
You need to pull harder.

366
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,992
You okay?

367
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,857
Yeah.

368
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,592
"Are you okay?"

369
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,867
It's a valid medical question.

370
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,369
I have never heard you
ask a patient that question.

371
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,781
You've never asked
me that question,

372
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,640
and you've seen me fall
down a flight of stairs drunk.

373
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,803
You've slept with her.

374
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,938
She's 9,000 miles away.

375
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,492
And while a certain
part of me, unfurled...

376
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,007
No, I...

377
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,554
Somehow, you've
been intimate with her.

378
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,020
Why are you following me?

379
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,034
I thought you were following me.

380
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,651
No. You are
definitely following me.

381
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,285
Where are you
going? Out to lunch.

382
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,522
You never go out to lunch.

383
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,273
Which means there's a
reason you're going out to lunch.

384
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,027
I assume that reason
is a human being.

385
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,361
Or a sandwich.

386
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,561
Sandwiches can come here.

387
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,897
So can human beings.

388
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,836
And yet, she's not,
which I find interesting.

389
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,134
I'm leaving, now.

390
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,074
Small world.

391
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,545
Are you going to
follow me into my car?

392
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,712
It's got two doors.

393
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:05,410
Okay, look, the reason
I haven't told you is...

394
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,751
Call off your dogs, House.

395
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,637
Your little helpers are
interrogating my patients,

396
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,994
swiping my charts,
intercepting prescriptions.

397
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,140
Why would you think that I...

398
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,427
Because I'm not a moron.

399
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,763
You had to be pulling
the strings, here.

400
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,212
You think that because
they make me miserable,

401
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,602
I'm going to give you cable.

402
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,636
Let's assume that's true,

403
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,536
and it certainly
sounds like it might be.

404
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,167
What are you going
to do? Nothing.

405
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,905
I resigned from the
budget committee.

406
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:36,449
I only joined the committee to help
the hospital. You made me a liability.

407
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,780
I now have zero influence
over the hospital's cable policy.

408
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,594
Well done.

409
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,608
It didn't work. There's
nothing more that we can do...

410
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,191
Put these up.

411
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,026
"Free Rottweiler puppies.

412
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,130
"Please call after 11:00
p.m. and before 5:00 a.m."

413
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,317
Is this Cameron's home number?

414
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,242
I'd love a new puppy.

415
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,609
My last one was
delicious, very tender.

416
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,238
There's no point
in torturing her.

417
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,944
If she can resign, she can
un-resign. Go to DEFCON 1.

418
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,952
Forget waiting for a
mistake. Make her make one.

419
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,545
You want us to
sabotage another doctor,

420
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,387
possibly harm a patient,
all so you can have cable.

421
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,589
Harm suggests permanent damage.
Get her to screw up, then fix it.

422
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,028
Oh! And this time,

423
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,210
don't tell her what you're
gonna do before you do it.

424
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:34,673
So, how long do I let the lymph
node marinate in the red wine?

425
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,034
It should be ready, now.

426
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,577
Try increasing the
magnification on the camera.

427
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,642
<i>You know, I emailed a couple of
colleagues at the hospital about you.</i>

428
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,448
You're checking up
on me? Not House?

429
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah, well House is
straightforward, brilliant and an ass.

430
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,827
Two out of three good
qualities. Clear majority.

431
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,661
Whereas you, on the other
hand, have a perfect score.

432
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,533
You are responsible,
nice, human.

433
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,597
And yet, you're
House's best friend.

434
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,100
<i>Hold there.</i>

435
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,868
Makes you think he's
secretly nicer than he seems?

436
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,538
<i>Makes me think that you're
secretly a lot less nice than you seem.</i>

437
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,171
<i>Do you always
insult your doctors?</i>

438
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,048
It's not an insult. Indiscriminate
niceness is overrated.

439
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,046
No wonder he likes you.

440
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,519
Based on this slide
you do not have cancer.

441
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,797
Oh!

442
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,889
Thank God.

443
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,230
I do see some inflammation,
which could mean...

444
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,869
Cate?

445
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:39,995
You all right?

446
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,007
My left side. It hurts.

447
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,803
It's the same pain
that I had on the right.

448
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,141
Your other kidney.

449
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,341
No. I hope it's, it's
something, it's maybe...

450
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,575
I'm screwed.

451
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,790
<i>The bad news is you're O for
two in the kidney department.</i>

452
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,264
Is there good news?
You're back at home.

453
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,701
Of course. There's cable.

454
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:12,101
<i>And freedom to work pant-free.</i>

455
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,400
That is good news.

456
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,306
Wilson found signs of
inflammation in your biopsy.

457
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,406
That, plus the two failing kidneys,
points to autoimmune disease.

458
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:24,143
Probably SLE or vasculitis.
Treatment for both is prednisone.

459
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,649
Start with a hundred milligrams.

460
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,515
Autoimmune is just
your latest theory.

461
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,248
Like cancer before that,
and a kidney stone before.

462
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,520
<i>Take the prednisone. You'll get
better. That will be your confirmation.</i>

463
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,856
You practice medicine
like it's a fire sale.

464
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,295
You've wasted
antibiotics, x-rays...

465
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,624
That was not a waste.
We've ruled out...

466
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,497
We have a crew member
here who has asthma.

467
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,629
If he has an episode after I've
used up the prednisone, he'll die.

468
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,416
There's a good chance
he's going to die anyway.

469
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,085
Since there won't be a
doctor there to help him.

470
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,375
<i>Show me proof
that it's autoimmune,</i>

471
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,941
<i>and then I'll take
the prednisone.</i>

472
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,689
We should send her outside.

473
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,953
Right. Let's just tell her to head
north until she runs into a hospital.

474
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,120
Autoimmune diseases are
basically inflammation running wild.

475
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,893
Extreme cold has been used as treatment,
like putting ice on a sprained ankle.

476
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,901
She starts to feel better
outside, we know it's autoimmune.

477
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,493
Is that my wallet?

478
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,868
You can have it back.

479
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,235
I've already been through it.

480
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,437
I like your ice on
the sprain metaphor.

481
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,501
Makes it seem like
we're not killing her.

482
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,307
She'd only need to
be outside five minutes.

483
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,679
Without her mittens. Mom
told me that was a bad idea.

484
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,311
Especially that winter. It was 70
below, and I had dual kidney failure.

485
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,756
This is a good idea. It's perfect
for you. Experimental, risky.

486
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,485
Wilson's right.
You care about...

487
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,324
You didn't touch the cash,
but you took the receipts?

488
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:51,099
A hundred and ninety dollar restaurant
tab. That's dessert, probably booze.

489
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,262
It means you lingered.

490
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,432
Means it's at least
a third date. Means...

491
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,442
Where are you going?
To talk to the people I pay

492
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:58,806
to come up with medical ideas.

493
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,869
There are no ideas.

494
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,608
The test for autoimmune is ANA.

495
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,842
Unless penguins poop
immunoanalyzers...

496
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,442
Before ANA testing,

497
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,919
people had autoimmune diseases.

498
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,387
How did they know?

499
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,356
C3. Before that.

500
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,917
LE Prep. But she doesn't have
any controlled pore glass beads.

501
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,929
You don't need them.

502
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,279
<i>When you shake the test tube,</i>

503
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:27,068
<i>the paperclip will damage
some of your blood cells.</i>

504
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,471
<i>If you have an
autoimmune disease,</i>

505
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,271
<i>your immune system will
gorge itself on the damaged cells.</i>

506
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,590
They'll get big and fat so that you
can see them under a microscope.

507
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
How you doing?

508
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,907
<i>No change.</i>

509
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:42,751
<i>So, how long should I give the
cells to fatten up before I check them?</i>

510
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,449
A couple hours.

511
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,076
Or you could stop being a hypocrite
and take the prednisone now.

512
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,720
<i>Not bending to your will
makes me a hypocrite?</i>

513
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:53,891
If your psych patients demanded lab
results you'd never make a diagnosis.

514
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,161
So, I'm wrong.

515
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:58,431
You sleep like a baby. Your
life is unfolding as you dreamed.

516
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,472
Everyone is miserable.

517
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,564
You don't change that
because people don't change.

518
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,665
You want to believe that

519
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,404
because then you're freed from
any responsibility for your misery.

520
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,003
Oh, shut up.

521
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,347
I get enough of
this from Wilson.

522
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,969
And yet, you keep
hanging out with him.

523
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:19,084
<i>And, from what I hear, you have spent more
time with me than with any other patient.</i>

524
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,293
Sorry about that.

525
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,031
Call me when
you get the results.

526
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,270
How's your patient?

527
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,671
She has an autoimmune disease.

528
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,416
Tell the psych
department she's in denial.

529
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,044
I had to fire Cameron.

530
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,176
What? What happened?

531
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,722
A sixty-five-year-old man came
into the ER with a hip fracture.

532
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,790
Cameron gave him Demerol.

533
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,348
The guy was on an MAOI.

534
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,017
Put him into a
hypertensive crisis.

535
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,152
Is he going to live?

536
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,628
Taub caught the error in time.

537
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,055
If she'd just
admitted the mistake,

538
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,327
maybe I could have
just suspended her, but...

539
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,630
She's packing up. If
you want to say goodbye.

540
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,985
We should be hearing from
the South Pole in a few minutes.

541
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
That's it?

542
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,043
There's nothing to be done.

543
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,875
She screwed up. She's got
no one to blame but herself.

544
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,841
I've got to go talk to Cameron.

545
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,478
Cuddy wouldn't can
her for one screw-up.

546
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,579
And if she did, she
wouldn't come to me.

547
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,933
And if she did, she wouldn't
open with, "How's your patient?"

548
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,755
And if she did...
Why would she lie?

549
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,818
Timeless question.

550
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,694
In this case, she conspired
with your co-workers to teach me

551
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,063
that some things are
more important than cable.

552
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,145
I'm going to have to teach
them that they're wrong.

553
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,230
Come on. South Pole
really should be calling.

554
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:47,038
LE Prep test was negative.
It's not autoimmune.

555
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,213
You're basing that on a test done with
a paper clip. Just take the prednisone.

556
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:55,119
Either find another
diagnosis, or find another test.

557
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,917
There is one way.

558
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:02,122
You can take this experimental
drug called prednisone.

559
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,241
<i>If your kidneys start working...</i>

560
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,889
<i>There is another test.</i>

561
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,630
I think Foreman may
have just broken up, there.

562
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,638
What he actually said
was, "There is no other test."

563
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,419
If you have an
autoimmune disease,

564
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,966
exposure to the cold should
decrease your kidney pain.

565
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,807
<i>If I go outside, we'll
have our answer?</i>

566
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,876
<i>And you knew about this?</i>

567
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,508
I rejected it because
if you're frozen solid,

568
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,678
<i>it's hard to get the
needles into your arms.</i>

569
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,187
How long do I need to stay out?

570
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,313
At least five minutes.

571
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,948
Eight minutes outside
would kill a healthy person.

572
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,924
<i>And healthy people don't
suck on oxygen masks.</i>

573
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,586
<i>Healthy people can pee.</i>

574
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,630
I'll go get Sean, have
him come with me.

575
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,961
Just take the prednisone.

576
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,261
<i>Once I come inside,</i>

577
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,133
if it's autoimmune.

578
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,905
Are you all right?

579
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,373
Oh, I'm sure she's just fine.

580
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,479
Cate?

581
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,809
Do you know if there's anyone
down there who has a cell phone?

582
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,261
<i>It took the station mechanic
20 minutes to respond.</i>

583
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,349
She'd already
slipped into a coma.

584
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,399
Started her on prednisone,
but no improvement.

585
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,171
Means it's not autoimmune.

586
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,875
Good thing she's in a coma.

587
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,324
Or we'd have to
listen to her gloat.

588
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,611
And where are we going?

589
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,582
To find the useful
members of my team.

590
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,929
You're letting
them off the hook?

591
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,788
You happy? Because of you, I'm not gonna
be able to watch <i>Law & Order</i> in Korean.

592
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,914
Why am I here?

593
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,688
Because I want to ask
you about your girlfriend.

594
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,390
I must know who she is, or
you'd have told me her name.

595
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,696
She doesn't have a name.
It's some sort of birth defect.

596
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,861
There's only about 12
people we both know.

597
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,666
And I can't remember
five of their names,

598
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,866
so we're down to
Cuddy, your ex-wives.

599
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,409
Your mama.

600
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,774
You need to run a
kidney function test.

601
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,111
Yes. If only she wasn't in a
coma, we could get her to run a test

602
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,582
to find out why she's in a coma.

603
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,142
The results would
likely be paradoxical.

604
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,155
It can't be Cuddy, because
you're straight. It can't be...

605
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,248
We could talk the
mechanic through the test.

606
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,987
Too complicated.

607
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,787
Unless he's thirsty.

608
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:23,895
Drink her urine?

609
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,767
If it has a strong,
concentrated taste,

610
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,567
it means the problems
are in her kidneys.

611
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,540
<i>Watery taste
means it's her brain.</i>

612
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,436
And then you can fix it?

613
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,543
Let's say, yeah.

614
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,425
<i>How do I get the
urine out of her?</i>

615
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,793
Take a straight
catheter and insert it...

616
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,285
Those are your only questions?

617
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,252
Not, "Is it safe?"

618
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,748
<i>Or, "Is there another way?"</i>

619
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,123
Or, "Are you out of your minds?"

620
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:49,788
You wouldn't ask me if...

621
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,494
Wait a second.

622
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,796
You're in love with her.

623
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,967
That explains why you're so eager
to get her naked, then have a drink.

624
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,334
Because most guys like
to go the other way around.

625
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,878
Why do you care
how I feel about her?

626
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:07,807
Because now I know that I can
get you to do anything to save her.

627
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,940
Tell him how to tap the keg.

628
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,447
You got Cameron fired.

629
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,151
Cuddy wasn't
supposed to find out.

630
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,783
No kidding!

631
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,627
Get me cable. How tough can
that be? You cost a woman her job.

632
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,267
There's only one thing you can
say to keep me from firing you.

633
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,700
Cameron wasn't fired. We...

634
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,169
Wrong.

635
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,503
You know? We're still fired?

636
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,372
That should be a hint as to
what you're supposed to say.

637
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,342
We're sorry. Wrong.

638
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,708
I love you.

639
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:43,573
Wrong.

640
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,849
This is a game? First, we have
to screw with our co-worker,

641
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:49,192
now we have to try to figure
out what you want us to say?

642
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,846
This is insane. I'm not playing.

643
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,119
Right.

644
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,954
You should have
said this two days ago.

645
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,125
Do not play games with me.

646
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,031
Number one, you are going
to lose. You're just not ready.

647
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,626
Number two, the game was to
force you to stop playing games.

648
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,196
I need you to stand up
to me. Challenge me.

649
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,969
I need you to stop
worrying about getting fired.

650
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,170
And go pay for my cable.

651
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:14,971
No!

652
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,476
I didn't mean on this.

653
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,007
Seriously. I need cable.

654
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,386
Milk, milk, lemonade.

655
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,860
It tastes kind of watery.

656
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,328
That's bad news.

657
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,430
Either increased
intracranial pressure

658
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,839
or something's wrong
with her hypothalamus.

659
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,501
<i>How do you figure
out which one it is?</i>

660
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,512
We don't do anything.

661
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,439
You're gonna drill
a hole in her skull.

662
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:57,219
<i>If she regains consciousness,
it's increased intracranial pressure.</i>

663
00:35:58,857 --> 00:35:59,977
And if it's the other thing?

664
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,523
She'll die.

665
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,528
But if it's the hypothalamus,
she's dead, anyway.

666
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,726
If the problem is the pressure
in her brain, and I fix it,

667
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
is she going to be all better?

668
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,566
No, but it'll give us more
time to figure out what's wrong.

669
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,731
<i>I have to get someone
else. I can't do this.</i>

670
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,735
You love her.

671
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,779
You'd do anything to save her.

672
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,214
Not this.

673
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,252
I can't do this.

674
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,296
If she dies because of
something that I did, then I...

675
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,982
Listen. Listen.

676
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,059
I am not going to let
you hurt her. Okay?

677
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:38,161
Now, please. This
is her only chance.

678
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,998
Okay.

679
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,573
That was easy.

680
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,213
Okay. Her head is stabilized,

681
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,318
and the drill bit is sterile.

682
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,551
Place the drill bit against the
upper left part of her forehead,

683
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,957
about an inch above the temple.

684
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,177
It's not going anywhere.

685
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,976
Bone's harder than
wood. Lean into it.

686
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,144
<i>The skull is only a
quarter inch thick.</i>

687
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,583
Once you're midway
through, drill in shorter bursts.

688
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,148
<i>If you come out the other
side, you've gone too far.</i>

689
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,287
Okay. Now, what? Now, what?

690
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,419
Let the fluid drain.

691
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,722
She's waking up.
She's waking up.

692
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,881
Sean?

693
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,320
What's going on?

694
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,822
South Pole doc
is out of her coma,

695
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,927
and now we have a new symptom.

696
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,791
Increased intracranial pressure.

697
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,962
Why are we out here?

698
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,528
That's the patient room.

699
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,599
ICP plus kidney problems
plus lung collapse equals...

700
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,872
The most likely suspect is
a tumor throwing off clots.

701
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,344
We ruled out cancer.

702
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,642
But not clots.

703
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,481
What causes blood clots?

704
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,779
Bacterial endocarditis.

705
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:40,944
Not without a fever.

706
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,011
Deep vein thrombosis
plus an existing PFO.

707
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,216
PFO would have been discovered
on her pre-South Pole physical exam.

708
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,656
What if the clots aren't clots?

709
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,127
Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque
builds up on the arterial walls.

710
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,292
Pieces break off, block blood
flow. Explains everything.

711
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,360
She has zero risk factors.
Forget fat. Think clots.

712
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,529
No.

713
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,941
You're standing up to me?

714
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,032
Maybe.

715
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,669
Just to clarify, you should
do that when you're right.

716
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,475
Sorry for the confusion.

717
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,392
How could a clot... Could
be a different kind of fat.

718
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,907
Fat emboli.

719
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,414
It's a perfect fit. Except
it's completely impossible.

720
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,983
Fat emboli requires an
un-repaired bone breakage.

721
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,426
Between the x-ray and the
exam, I've seen her entire...

722
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,695
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

723
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,437
<i>Take off her socks.</i>

724
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,111
I can... I can do it.

725
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,408
No. I got it.

726
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,319
Your toe is broken.

727
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,520
Oh, my God.

728
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,669
<i>Bits of bone marrow have been
leaking into your bloodstream.</i>

729
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,965
<i>Those fat emboli have caused
blockages in your kidney, lungs, and brain.</i>

730
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,030
It doesn't even hurt.

731
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,801
Cold numbs everything.

732
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,570
Does a particularly great
job on the extremities.

733
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:15,136
You'll need to close the break
to stop the marrow from leaking.

734
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,578
This one you will feel.

735
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,243
<i>Will you do it?</i>

736
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,981
He drilled a hole
in your skull after

737
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:24,249
drinking your pee. I
think he's up for this.

738
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,033
Grab the tip of her toe
with your right hand.

739
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,889
Hold the break with the other.

740
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,552
On the count of
three, pull hard.

741
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,787
<i>One, two,</i>

742
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,561
three.

743
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,343
Splint your toe. You'll be fine.

744
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,246
Thank you, House.

745
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,853
Don't thank me. He's the
one who saved your life.

746
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,975
He likes her.

747
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:39,194
A bottle of the Bordeaux
and some sparkling water.

748
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:48,370
Well, you didn't pick her up, which
means she's coming from work, too,

749
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,433
which means you're
comfortable enough to meet her.

750
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,602
Damn. I thought I lost you
when I walked backwards

751
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,168
through my own
footprints in the snow.

752
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,306
I think I've got it narrowed
down to three possibilities.

753
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,374
Better leave. If you
see her, it'll be cheating.

754
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:00,713
It's not one of your ex-wives.

755
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:01,844
Because they hate me.

756
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:05,185
They don't. They should,
but they don't. I called them.

757
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,725
It's someone new,
but someone I know.

758
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,817
Did you ever consider
being happy for me?

759
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,226
Briefly.

760
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,287
You ordering the wine
before she got here...

761
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,768
Girls are good,
House, and you know it.

762
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,566
You solved your case because
you cared about that girl.

763
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,005
You're demonstrating the
illusion of manly confidence,

764
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,044
which means you haven't
closed the deal, yet.

765
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,238
I closed the deal.
I just like her.

766
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,439
Still?

767
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,073
You knew your patient
hated having cold feet,

768
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:35,620
because you did a physical
exam, because you liked her.

769
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,953
Your theory is I cared, therefore
I let her keep her socks on.

770
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,736
If that's what love is, then I don't
wanna have anything to do with it.

771
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,594
It starts with warm feet,
but leads to other things.

772
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,496
Your mom and I will
explain when you're older.

773
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:50,627
If I'd made her take them off like I
should have, I'd have seen the toe

774
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,033
and solved the case days ago.

775
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,503
But you don't care about her.

776
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,667
Of course not. House
doesn't care about anyone.

777
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,678
Hi.

778
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,941
Sorry I'm late.

779
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,847
Cutthroat Bitch?

780
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,553
I call her Amber.

781
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,684
Was she on your list?
