1
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,078
You like that?

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,057
I don't know.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,356
You want me to
use my butt again?

4
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,032
I don't know how I got here.

5
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,170
How many drinks did I have?

6
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,406
Your scotch hasn't
even arrived yet.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,040
Means I was drunk
when I got here.

8
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,813
8:50.

9
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,715
I remember being at work.

10
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,924
I've lost at least four hours.

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,595
Say five words.

12
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,064
What do you mean?

13
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,896
That's four words.

14
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,432
The accepted diagnostic test for global
memory impairment is five random words.

15
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,129
Are you okay?

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,474
I'm trying to find that out.
Now, give me five animals.

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,306
Cat. Bird.

18
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:27,182
Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.

19
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:33,520
Monkey. Rhino... Either
I'm massively drunk...

20
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,394
You're bleeding.

21
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,128
Or it's someone else's blood.

22
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,101
Can you see a wound?

23
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,773
How bad is it? It's all over.

24
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,645
I have concussion.
Retrograde amnesia.

25
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,618
No keys, no phone,
I've been mugged.

26
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,985
No, you haven't.

27
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,253
You already gave me a twenty.

28
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,383
Did you earn it?

29
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,790
Not yet.

30
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,627
Someone is going to die.

31
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,672
Kenny! Not you.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,002
I saw something. A symptom.

33
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,378
Someone is going to
die unless I find them.

34
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,811
Who?

35
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,508
I have no idea.

36
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,380
Keep the change.

37
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,479
I saw somebody dying.

38
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,420
You saw 30 people
flying into glass and metal.

39
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,481
I saw a symptom
before the crash.

40
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,351
You're concussed. You
don't know what you saw

41
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,603
and you don't know
when you saw it.

42
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,028
A week ago, you noticed
a symptom in a soap star.

43
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,961
Bad argument, since
I was right about that.

44
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,593
But your brain obviously thinks it
happened last night. Wires are crossed.

45
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,161
That's all of it. A few stitches
will hold your brain in place.

46
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,363
Ow!

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,310
Hey, hold your head still unless you
want me to sew your nose onto your eye.

48
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,177
Why was I taking a bus?

49
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,681
Because you were drunk.

50
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,946
What if I saw someone
and I followed them on from

51
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,010
somewhere in Princeton?

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,554
You okay?

53
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,120
Perfect.

54
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,559
Uh...

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,486
You. Get histories
from everyone in here.

56
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,861
Did you just forget his name?

57
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,988
No.

58
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:04,361
Lesbian, find out if anybody on
that bus was taken to other hospitals.

59
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,471
You just forgot mine.

60
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,735
No, Thirteen.

61
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,072
I just wanted to call you a
lesbian. I'm not a lesbian.

62
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,706
I was rounding up from 50 percent.
Find my cane and motorcycle.

63
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,375
Figure out where
I went last night.

64
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,086
Where's your cane and motorcycle,
and where'd you go last night?

65
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,521
You're gonna trust me?
I lie about everything.

66
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,186
You're staying the night. We need
to monitor your brain for swelling.

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,558
How much bigger could it get?

68
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,996
You don't think it's

69
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,694
a little weird that
there's both a giant crash

70
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,863
and a simultaneous,
mysterious symptom sighting?

71
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,372
What if it's not a coincidence?

72
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,775
You mean like the hand of God
reaching down and screwing with you?

73
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,212
That, or the symptom
caused the crash.

74
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,219
You see anybody in
a bus driver's uniform?

75
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,198
Right here, purpura on
Lalph Klamden's neck.

76
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,626
Indicative of leukemia.

77
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,897
It caused a bleed in the
brain, hence the accident.

78
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,429
Indicative of wearing a
seatbelt. It's just a bruise.

79
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,666
I have leukemia?

80
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,300
No, we just ruled that out.

81
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,810
Pay attention. So he
probably had a seizure.

82
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,610
I didn't have a seizure. I
got hit by a garbage truck.

83
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,227
Which you drove into
while you were seizing.

84
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,811
You saw the bus driver exhibiting
the initial stages of a seizure

85
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,719
and didn't bother
telling him to pull over?

86
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,919
Hey!

87
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,654
Nobody leaves here until I
say they can be discharged.

88
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,228
She said I was... Is she me?

89
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,225
You have a fever.

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,768
No, I'm fine.

91
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,235
98.6.

92
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,498
I need him to stay.

93
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,472
Pulse is normal, BP's
normal, everything's normal.

94
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,907
I just have a stiff
neck from the crash.

95
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,638
Stiff neck.

96
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,839
This man has meningitis.

97
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,677
We need to quarantine
the whole ER.

98
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,446
No one leaves here until
their full work-up is complete.

99
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,963
You left here at 5:23 p.m.

100
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,965
Your motorcycle
never made it home.

101
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:17,130
Well, that covers ten seconds out
of the four hours I can't remember.

102
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,628
Where else did you look?

103
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,367
We did pull up a
list of all the injuries.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,880
Twenty-two victims
were brought here,

105
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,901
injuries ranging from a broken
pelvis to a severed right foot.

106
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,278
The other eight were taken
over to Princeton General.

107
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,177
Be helpful if these came
with head shots and resumes.

108
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,245
Twenty-something-year-old Jane Doe,
kidney contusion, laceration on her leg.

109
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,259
Both of which are
expected complications

110
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,592
when someone goes from
60 to 0 in no seconds flat.

111
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,461
Weirdest thing we've
got is a ruptured spleen.

112
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,799
Okay, new plan. We make a list of all
the bars between here and the crash site,

113
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,498
we go there... On it.

114
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,539
You're not gonna
do anything, are you?

115
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,476
We're gonna go to
the ER and do our jobs.

116
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,708
Someone's dying
because I can't remember...

117
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,284
When you remember,
you can page us.

118
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,548
The shortest distance
between here and your memory

119
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,115
is straight through your pre-frontal
cortex. All we have to do is access it.

120
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:17,392
Great idea. I'll build the giant submarine,
you get the miniaturization gizmo.

121
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,956
Medical hypnosis can bring
the brain to a Class 2 Theta state,

122
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,026
increasing focus
and memory retrieval.

123
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,401
You're not gonna make me
do the chicken dance, are you?

124
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,202
Someone in the surgical
department must be trained.

125
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,075
Just relax. Keep letting
go of any intrusive thoughts.

126
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,151
So what? You saw an ad
on the back of a comic book?

127
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,414
I did a rotation in Melbourne.

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,845
Focus on the
sound of your breath.

129
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,982
You're taxing an
already injured brain.

130
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,721
It's like telling him to walk
it off after a broken ankle.

131
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,058
Wilson is done talking now.

132
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,236
Visualize the bus.

133
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,066
The way it looked.

134
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,833
The way it smelled.

135
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,434
The people on it.
What they look like.

136
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,847
This is a waste of

137
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,346
time.

138
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,389
Cool.

139
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,991
Focus on the details.

140
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,357
The bus is empty.

141
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,028
Is this really working?

142
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:34,131
Just focus. Clear your mind.
Think back to how you felt.

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,902
Details you saw.

144
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,072
I can't see out the windows.

145
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,448
And I can see you guys.

146
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,953
Memories further from the
incident should be clearer.

147
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,886
Where were you before
you got on the bus?

148
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,900
Why'd you get so drunk at
5:00 in the afternoon, alone?

149
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,934
I need a reason?

150
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,102
God, I hate "Beer" brand beer.

151
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,941
When he's
hypnotized, can he lie?

152
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,947
He... I could be mistaken,

153
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,178
but I can't actually lie
under hypnosis. Is he lying?

154
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,276
No. What are you
running away from?

155
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,585
When I'm drinking, without you,
what am I running away from?

156
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,820
One of those imponderables.
Can we hold off on your insecurities

157
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,519
until we find this patient?

158
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,757
Do you see anyone in the bar?

159
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:38,534
I see a faceless crowd. How do I
focus? Say something to make me focus.

160
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,972
He's concerned about you. Why
does that mean he's insecure?

161
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,372
Get your girlfriend out of here.

162
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,845
It's a legit question.
Amber's there?

163
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,210
You've got Amber in your head?

164
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,614
You put her in my head.

165
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,462
I can't even have a conversation
with you in my subconscious

166
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,954
without her tagging along.

167
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,683
She'd better have
her clothes on.

168
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,281
Unfortunately.

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,360
I didn't mean to
say that out loud.

170
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,462
Say what out loud?

171
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,465
I didn't say it out loud?

172
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,557
Nothing.

173
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,330
What's going on in there?

174
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,201
If I can't lie, I need
these two out of here.

175
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,640
Let's just ignore Wilson and
Amber from now on, shall we?

176
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,644
I wish it were that...

177
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,646
That's some program they've got
down there in Melbourne. Cheers.

178
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,013
I remember the bartender. Good.

179
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,891
Now you're accessing
your temporal lobe.

180
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,929
Does the bartender
have any odd symptoms?

181
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,727
No, he seems fine.

182
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,694
Is anybody here sick?
Anyone here taking the bus?

183
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,068
You are.

184
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,940
Because you took my keys.

185
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,036
Good. This is good. Now
we can retrace your steps.

186
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,542
Let's go back to the bus.

187
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,441
What's in front of
you? Passengers.

188
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,882
Anything special about them?

189
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,395
Some Emo guitar hero wannabe.

190
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,900
You're focusing on him. Why?

191
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,268
Because nose picking
could mean nasal pruritus.

192
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,705
He's dying.

193
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,877
You a nose picker?
Do I have to answer...

194
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,522
If the answer was no,
you would have answered.

195
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,546
Tilt your head back.

196
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,638
He's fine.

197
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,274
Doesn't even have meningitis.

198
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,410
Just like everybody else we've
had to give meningitis shots to.

199
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,613
You can go.

200
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,121
You have a brain tumor.

201
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,484
You're kidding, right?

202
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,221
If I was kidding, I'd
be dressed like you.

203
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,093
You're fine. A nurse
will sign you out.

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,394
Go home, have fun, relax.
I'm probably just a nut case.

205
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,969
Tilt your head back.

206
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,945
Get your things and go.

207
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,951
You need to rest.
I'm admitting you.

208
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,360
I can't get up!

209
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,460
I can't move my legs!

210
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,474
Your legs are not
your biggest problem.

211
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:35,945
Your biggest problem is I don't
know what your biggest problem is.

212
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,447
So, we have the
who but not the what.

213
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,288
We've only got one
symptom to go on.

214
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,054
Sudden onset paralysis.

215
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,425
We actually have two symptoms.

216
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,997
Only one that we remember.

217
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,589
You did a full
work-up on the guy.

218
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,362
Did you find anything? CT
ruled out subdural hematoma,

219
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,028
stroke, or subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

220
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,935
Guillain-Barré fits.

221
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,719
Just trying to figure out
what Guillain-Barré looks like.

222
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,405
You can't just
eliminate everything

223
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,447
because it doesn't match
what you might have seen.

224
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,725
How about because it doesn't
match what I could have seen?

225
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,981
Guillain-Barré has no external
physical manifestations.

226
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,113
Everything has some external
physical manifestations.

227
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,133
And you're obsessive
enough to notice any of them.

228
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,568
Which means there's
nothing we can rule out.

229
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,255
Elevated white count.
Means transverse myelitis...

230
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,990
Sudden paralysis
while driving a bus.

231
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,794
That's the sort of subtle clue that
only a genius would have noticed.

232
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,771
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

233
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,179
Where are you going?

234
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,847
To smell a bus. Obviously.

235
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,525
Yeah, I'll start him on antibiotics
in case it's transverse myelitis.

236
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,361
You guys go sniff a city bus.

237
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,339
Why are you smelling
the passengers' clothes?

238
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:11,104
Smell is the most powerful
evokerater of memory.

239
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,210
I need to get back on that bus.

240
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,781
Okay. So why are you
taking so much Vicodin?

241
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,444
If Cuddy asks, blocking the
pain helps focus the memory.

242
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,320
You split your head
open. You should rest.

243
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,224
Anything? Hint of

244
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,991
exploded bus.

245
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:36,294
House, that's four Vicodin
in forty seconds. At this rate...

246
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,860
Wish me luck.

247
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,066
I'm going in, Rambo style.

248
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,203
House, do you think this is
gonna work, or are you just stoned?

249
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,278
Both, apparently.

250
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,377
You're wrong. It's not working.

251
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,889
So you're saying I'm not here?

252
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,256
If it was a real memory, you'd be
limping and you wouldn't be talking to me.

253
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,692
I'm obviously a hallucination.

254
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,757
Okay, so I went a little
heavy on the Vicodin.

255
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,461
Better hope so. 'Cause otherwise,
means your brain's bleeding.

256
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,630
We're both in my head. You'd think
one of us would have noticed the blood.

257
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,297
Why haven't you
had a head CT yet?

258
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,309
Who do you want me to treat?
Me or you? Did you have a seizure?

259
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,938
Dumb question. The brain's too
fried during a seizure to form memories.

260
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,710
Dumb answer. I wasn't
asking you, I was asking me,

261
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,394
because you've already
proven that you're not here.

262
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,929
I'm getting a
headache. Is that a clue?

263
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,946
Again, I'm not here.
You're getting a headache.

264
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,584
Stop arguing with a hallucination
and get some treatment.

265
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,991
He can't.

266
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,726
The hallucination is your messed-up
brain's way of reasoning out a problem.

267
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,702
You weren't on the bus.

268
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,904
How do you know?

269
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:50,410
Five-hundred-dollar shoes?
Not on the Princeton cross-town.

270
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,002
Must be another
reason why I'm here.

271
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,277
Yes. What do you
have to tell me?

272
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,648
I was talking to the
passengers on the bus.

273
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,451
You were hallucinating.
You're getting an MRI.

274
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,653
<i>Stop fidgeting.</i>

275
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,923
If you haven't found
the bleed yet, it can't be...

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,334
There's edema and localized swelling
in the section of the temporal lobe

277
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,132
that controls short-term memory.

278
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,266
<i>Also, the penis size
cortex is set to "pathetic."</i>

279
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,969
What didn't you say out loud?

280
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,239
Very little.

281
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,780
<i>When you were under hypnosis,</i>

282
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,475
you were talking to Amber.

283
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,012
I wanted to see her naked.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,689
Seriously, what were you hiding?

285
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,019
I want to see her naked.

286
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,525
You want to see everyone
naked. Why would you hide that?

287
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,828
Some guys get upset when
you objectify their girlfriends.

288
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,459
But if you're okay, I got a digital
video camera, so we could...

289
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,512
<i>Why would I be upset that
you're treating my girlfriend</i>

290
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,376
<i>like you treat every other
woman on the planet?</i>

291
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,240
Unless you're not.

292
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,373
<i>Unless it's deeper than that.</i>

293
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,312
You weren't objectifying her.

294
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:09,483
Trust me, I want to do some very
nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.

295
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,421
You have feelings for her.

296
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,596
This is bad.

297
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,228
It's a longitudinal fracture
of the temporal bone.

298
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,894
I banged my head.

299
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,938
This isn't just a boo-boo.

300
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,667
I'll rest once I figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

301
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,040
Why? Why this guy?

302
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,170
You want patients with
weird, undiagnosed symptoms?

303
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,306
You get five files like that
on your desk every morning.

304
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,112
And you'd never
risk your life for them.

305
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,321
Why is this guy so special that all
of a sudden you've become Batman?

306
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,482
I don't know.

307
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,119
Maybe it's because you have a
cracked skull and you're not yourself.

308
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,925
Go home, go to sleep.

309
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,397
My legs are holding.

310
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,670
Good. Now put all your
weight on your right leg.

311
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,009
The antibiotics
are working. It's TM.

312
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,256
It's 2:00 in the morning.

313
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,943
You should be home resting
what's left of your bruised brain.

314
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,245
Recovery's too fast.

315
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,037
What, the fact that he's getting
better is evidence that we're wrong?

316
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,284
I need to sit.

317
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,291
Recovery slow
enough for you now?

318
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,520
It's my stomach.

319
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,357
Which means it's not
transverse myelitis.

320
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,431
Rapid onset, could
be a perforated ulcer.

321
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,728
Wouldn't explain the paralysis.

322
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,295
Addison's. From a tumor.

323
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,770
It's possible that I
saw his eyelids droop.

324
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,171
We've scanned
his head five times.

325
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,103
You're bleeding.

326
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,611
Little thing called a bus crash.

327
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,115
Just a scalp laceration. It could
be hidden in his optic chiasm.

328
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,980
It's coming from your ear.

329
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,618
Think that's a good thing?

330
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,855
But that would have
affected his eyesight.

331
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,857
I need to take a bath.

332
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,626
Hallucinations and smells were
kind of working, right? Why the bath?

333
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,690
Hypnosis gave me the nose
picker. Smells set off hallucinations.

334
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,532
Sensory deprivation should get
the brain into an alpha-theta phase.

335
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,197
Didn't you see <i>Altered States?</i>

336
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,640
I don't think I was even
born when that movie was out.

337
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,077
Then you're too young to be a doctor.
That movie was released in 1980.

338
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,340
That was 28 years ago.

339
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,780
No it wasn't. Shut up.

340
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,375
Did you just forget
what year it is?

341
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,045
No, I just remembered
how old I am.

342
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,590
I need to give my brain time to transition
so I can embrace my inner monkey.

343
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,557
Or maybe I don't. Get
me some physostigmine.

344
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,973
It crosses the
blood-brain barrier.

345
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,076
And act like a nerve gas, stop your heart,
you'll go to heaven and be omniscient.

346
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,831
Good idea. Not gonna happen.

347
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:15,898
Don't do anything. Even if I escape,
eat a goat or get shot by police.

348
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,172
"Wasn't born yet" means I won't
be entertained by further reference.

349
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,787
I didn't know you rode the bus.

350
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:36,218
I used to drive home after getting
drunk, but some mothers got mad-d.

351
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,424
What are you doing here?
You weren't on the bus with me.

352
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:45,096
Then I guess this isn't
a memory. It's a fantasy.

353
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:50,100
If it's a fantasy,
you'd be wearing this.

354
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,823
You're convinced
your patient is dying

355
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,282
and you wanna waste
your time with a sex fantasy?

356
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,250
Don't blame me, blame my gender.

357
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,678
Well, I'm not here
to indulge that.

358
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,831
I'm here to help you figure
out what symptom you saw.

359
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,966
Your patient was driving
the bus, so all you could see...

360
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,925
Why can't you do both?

361
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:19,632
Your patient was driving the bus, so
all you could see was him sitting down,

362
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,799
most likely facing forward.

363
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,114
From behind I saw his earlobes
wiggling, or his head bobbing.

364
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,362
But not that.

365
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,490
Could indicate
aortic insufficiency.

366
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,066
Marfan's syndrome. Or syphilis.

367
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,000
What if his earlobes
were just drooping?

368
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,545
Ehlers-Danlos?

369
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,841
Or Cutis Laxa.

370
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,143
It's not fatal in adults.

371
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,046
Yes, he's an adult, very
good point, keep going.

372
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,489
I'm distracting you.

373
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,295
No!

374
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,196
Dance, woman.

375
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,568
You'd rather be diagnosing.

376
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,503
I screamed no.

377
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,042
And your own
subconscious ignored you.

378
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,078
Because you'd rather fantasize
about finding symptoms.

379
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,704
How screwed up is that?

380
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,478
Hey, over here. Remember me?

381
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,346
I'm the sick guy.

382
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,646
Tell me what I saw.

383
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,419
Was it the blood
dripping from my ear?

384
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,992
That doesn't make sense
because your shirt wasn't stained.

385
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,059
And because that was me.

386
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,004
I could have had a
subtle hemiballismus,

387
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:03,365
indicating the early
stages of Huntington's.

388
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,276
Huntington's wouldn't
explain the abdominal pain,

389
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,556
and it's only on the table
because we're thinking of Thirteen.

390
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,573
A shuffling gait could
suggest Parkinson's.

391
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,744
Except there's no such
thing as "shuffling sitting."

392
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,016
He moved when he helped
the old lady up the steps.

393
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,149
Who are you?

394
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,719
I'm the answer. Look.

395
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,588
At what?

396
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,256
Here.

397
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,575
You were right.

398
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,485
Help him up.

399
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,082
I got it, it's Parkinson's.

400
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,182
House. Your ear.

401
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,386
Start him on levodopa.

402
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,929
You should sit down.

403
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,487
House!

404
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,238
Get that out of my face.

405
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,912
Welcome back. I'm
Nurse Dickerson.

406
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,417
I don't need your name.

407
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:22,353
And I got your profession from
your super competent technique

408
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,615
of melting my retinas.

409
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,592
Verbal faculties seem to be intact.
Do you remember passing out?

410
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,356
I remember puking
on Cuddy's shoes.

411
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,665
Yeah, skull
fractures tend to hurt.

412
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,827
Would hurt a lot less if you
hadn't swiped my pain pills.

413
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,147
Dr. Cuddy's orders. Wants
me to regulate the amount of...

414
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,436
Wait a second.
You brought muscle?

415
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,305
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

416
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:50,806
Means I was wrong. My
patient doesn't have Parkinson's.

417
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,129
Cuddy knows that's the only
reason I wouldn't want to stay here

418
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,089
with my pain pills,
porn and you forever.

419
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,957
Vomiting means your
brain injury is getting worse.

420
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,420
House's skull fracture extends
all the way down to his ear canal.

421
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:07,365
House is being looked after.
Our other patient has jaundice,

422
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,833
low albumin and no
diagnosis. Wilson's Disease.

423
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,961
Thank you. But Wilson's
wouldn't explain...

424
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,610
Foreman. How did you
eliminate Parkinson's?

425
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,441
Tests confirm the abdominal
pain was caused by liver failure.

426
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,346
I assume you've already
ruled out hepatitis and Wilson's.

427
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,849
You should really be resting.

428
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,215
Give him five minutes.
Brainstorming a few possibilities

429
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,515
<i>isn't going to explode his
brain.</i> And if she's wrong,

430
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,599
that makes this phone
call that much more exciting.

431
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,955
<i>What about hepatic fibrosis?</i>

432
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,459
Can't be, his Alk
phos was normal.

433
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,552
Could be thyrotoxic
periodic paralysis.

434
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:39,131
Did I mention this diagnosis
needs to make sense?

435
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,463
Why doesn't it make
sense? Bus driver's Asian.

436
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,899
His potassium's slightly low.

437
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,731
If he got paralyzed
while driving the bus,

438
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,815
don't you think I would have
gotten off at the next stop?

439
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,832
Not if the next stop was at a
90-degree angle into an SUV.

440
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,809
The bus would have
slowed, I would've noticed.

441
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,004
Phone call's over.

442
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,742
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms.
There's no downside to testing.

443
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:01,150
Genetic test is too
slow. Run the bagel test.

444
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,051
How many more bagels do
I have to eat for this to work?

445
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,219
High carbs plus exercise is
the quickest way to confirm TPP.

446
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:13,231
I've been on this for half an
hour. I'm not gonna collapse again.

447
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,494
Up the speed. Keep eating.

448
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,771
Yeah. <i>HOUSE: So the
carbo-loading marathon</i>

449
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,103
<i>isn't working.</i>

450
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,074
<i>Stop looking
around suspiciously.</i>

451
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,577
To answer your
next two questions,

452
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,240
no, I am not there, and yes,
you are completely predictable.

453
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,893
<i>If the test had worked,
you would have called</i>

454
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,613
<i>to put my delicate
brain at ease.</i>

455
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,119
- I - told you not
to lock the door.

456
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,953
Still wiping.

457
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,755
Put the phone up
to bus driver's grill.

458
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,596
Who are you talking to?

459
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,227
My large colon.

460
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,900
TPP's not consistent with
your patient's labored breathing.

461
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,203
Patient has labored breathing

462
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,354
because he's been on a
treadmill for the last thirty minutes.

463
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,472
Did you take my cell phone?

464
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:05,209
My large colon did. I'm
negotiating its release.

465
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:07,881
<i>Help.</i>

466
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:08,977
What's happening?

467
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,057
<i>The test worked. He collapsed.</i>

468
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,619
You're half right. He's
wheezing, isn't he?

469
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,991
Yeah.

470
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:22,127
Can't wheeze without moving
your chest muscles. This isn't TPP.

471
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,234
Then what is it?

472
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,396
How am I supposed
to know? I'm not there.

473
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,774
Right heart strain. He's
still not oxygenating.

474
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,144
Must be a pulmonary embolism.

475
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,912
So why haven't you
pushed a vial of tPA?

476
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,043
You let him back in?
I asked him back in.

477
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,283
At the tail end of me patiently
explaining how you idiots were idiots.

478
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,789
Pushed tPA 10 minutes ago.

479
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,569
- That means it's not a clot.
- Has to be a clot.

480
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,338
If he had a bagel stuck in his windpipe,
I would have seen it on the echo.

481
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,887
Get him to the
OR to suck it out.

482
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,024
Must have just screwed
up the intubation.

483
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,291
Seal's good.

484
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,893
It's a clot, House.

485
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,264
Wait, wait.

486
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,032
Look at his teeth.

487
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,272
He's got shiny new caps.
He's had recent dental surgery.

488
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:10,281
You can tell us what that means
while we're rolling him to the OR.

489
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,153
House! House!

490
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,451
House!

491
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,620
Get a syringe.

492
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,962
I didn't bring you back here
so you could stage a coup.

493
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:31,227
Listen to me. Dental air drill
pushed an air bubble into his gums.

494
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,829
Dislodged while he's driving.
Caused a myoclonic jerk.

495
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,340
That's what I must have
seen. Then it hit his spine,

496
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,841
his liver, and now his lungs.

497
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,605
Dr. Hadley, open the door.

498
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,408
I'm not plumping
his pillows here,

499
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,649
I'm putting him in the
Trendelenburg position,

500
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,309
move the bubble to
the apex of his heart

501
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,228
so you can suck it out.
Now get the damn syringe.

502
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,314
I can't risk you stabbing him in the heart
looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.

503
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:52,584
Stab him.

504
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,650
Dr. Hadley! See? She
doesn't even know your name.

505
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,626
Stab his heart!

506
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:57,788
Sats at 75.

507
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,274
Yes, he's suffocating.
If you're wrong...

508
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,757
Shut up and make a decision. Keep
standing there, he's dead either way.

509
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,200
Dr. Hadley!

510
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,869
I'm sorry.

511
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,530
Open that door.

512
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,314
Don't shoot! Get him to the OR.

513
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,878
The O2 sats.

514
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,184
It was an air bubble. He's okay.

515
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,529
The other nurse always
used to tuck me in.

516
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,298
I'll be on the couch,

517
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,702
with a shotgun in my lap.

518
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,830
Worrying about me.

519
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,876
Making sure you don't try
and make a limp for the border.

520
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,534
Get some sleep.

521
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,339
I'm not sleepy, Mommy.

522
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,846
Me neither.

523
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,747
Who are you? And
why are you stalking me?

524
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,979
Technically, you're stalking me.

525
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,546
What is that?

526
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,885
A mosquito?

527
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,691
Maybe just a fly.

528
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,328
In the ointment.

529
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,429
So there's something wrong,

530
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:50,365
there's some detail I'm not
noticing that's spoiling the big picture.

531
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:03,922
Is this significant? Or is this dream
just going in a different direction now?

532
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,752
Guess that depends.

533
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,785
What are you going
to do with that?

534
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,030
I have to tie this around you.

535
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,984
I'm cold.

536
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,046
Stay with me.

537
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,291
Why did I say that?

538
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,982
Hey. Go away.

539
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,641
It's not over.

540
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,846
I saved the wrong person.

541
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:21,326
This wasn't just a dream, or a fantasy,
or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.

542
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,868
So the bus driver with the air
bubble was just a coincidence.

543
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,030
No. I got the causation flipped.
The bubble didn't cause the crash.

544
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,336
The crash caused
the bubble to dislodge.

545
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,740
There was no myoclonic
jerk. I saw something else

546
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,936
in someone else.

547
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,411
You're not leaving.

548
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,744
What's the most dangerous
thing a patient could do

549
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,283
when his brain is on
the brink of herniating?

550
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:44,789
Elevated heart rate, BP, which
is exactly why you need to stop.

551
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,235
Instead of sleeping, I'm going to
be pacing around this apartment,

552
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,057
trying to decipher
those visions.

553
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,823
Why does this matter so much?

554
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,228
I don't know.

555
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,798
Heart rate?

556
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,869
127. BP?

557
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,205
Contextual memory, I need to get
back on that bus with all 31 passengers

558
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,106
to remember who and what I saw.

559
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,805
I'm not gonna call in crash
victims because you've gone insane.

560
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,448
Maybe I don't need
the actual victims.

561
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,311
Who's playing Anne
McKeon? Right here.

562
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:19,217
Jane Doe #2 from Princeton
General? Right here.

563
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,350
You, too, that's right.

564
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,759
Goth Kid, at the
back, on the right.

565
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,430
Yeah, here.

566
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,029
Okay.

567
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,899
You think that staring
at pictures on our shirts

568
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,462
is going to be more
effective than hypnosis?

569
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:38,374
If you'd stop talking, the re-enactment
could stimulate activity in my hippocampus

570
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,469
and parahippocampal cortex.

571
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,722
How long do we have to sit here

572
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,942
before you are stimulated?

573
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,213
Stop staring at my breasts.

574
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,621
And don't say,
"Or lack thereof."

575
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,959
You okay?

576
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,432
What did you see?

577
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,737
Just slipped away.

578
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,769
Is that Vicodin?

579
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,474
No, just a little
memory pick-me-up.

580
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,149
Physostigmine?

581
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,776
Are you crazy?

582
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,412
Alzheimer drugs will make
your brain go into overdrive.

583
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,118
That's the point. It'll
speed up my neuronal firing,

584
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,469
turn up the voltage
on my memory.

585
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,825
And blow out your heart.

586
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,328
How many did you take?

587
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,365
Just now, or including the
ones I took on the ride over?

588
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,529
<i>House, this isn't worth...</i>

589
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,807
House?

590
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,815
Why are you here?

591
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,154
You believe in reason above
all else. There must be a reason.

592
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,321
You have something to tell me.

593
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,454
Yes. Who am I?

594
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,432
That's asking, not
telling. Who are you?

595
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,059
You know who I am.

596
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,537
If I did, I'd be passed out in bed
instead of OD'ing on physostigmine

597
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,472
on the 6th Street cross-town.

598
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,704
What's my necklace made of?

599
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,613
Resin. Who am I?

600
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,176
I don't know.

601
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,623
Why the guessing game?

602
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,989
Because you don't
know the answer.

603
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,487
And if I don't, you don't.

604
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:40,164
But you know the clues.

605
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,928
I know what's bugging
your subconscious.

606
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,597
What's my necklace made of?

607
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,103
No.

608
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,844
Who am I?

609
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,918
It doesn't make sense.

610
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,215
What's my necklace made of?

611
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,690
Amber.

612
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,116
I have to tie this around you.

613
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,421
I'm cold.

614
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,526
Stay with me.

615
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,961
Just stay with me.

616
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,591
Sir, are you all right?

617
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,758
Are you all right?

618
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,364
Are you injured anywhere?

619
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,901
They'll take care
of you over there.

620
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,490
- He's coming out of it.
- Strong pulse.

621
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,225
You idiot! Your heart stopped!

622
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,661
Amber.

623
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,603
What? Amber.

624
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,075
It was Amber.

625
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,608
She was on the bus.

626
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,141
You almost kill yourself, and all
we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.

627
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,879
Have you spoken to her?

628
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,981
She's probably working,
she's been on-call.

629
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,425
I called her. She didn't call...

630
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,134
How could she... I don't know.

631
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,473
Jane Doe #2.

632
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,312
Female, late 20s, kidney damage.

633
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,409
Does Amber have a birthmark
on her right shoulder blade?

634
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,953
She was on the bus with me.

635
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,626
She's the one who's dying.
