1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,063
There were some nice guys there,

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:09,406
but they're all so quiet, awkward
smiles and sweaty palms.

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,469
I'm not expecting Brad Pitt
to walk into St. Theresa's,

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:18,485
just someone who makes me laugh,
has a nice smile, full head of hair.

5
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,420
You know, someone
like you, Mr. Franklin.

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,885
It's a shame they're
going to cremate you.

7
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,581
Can I help you?

8
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,922
Martin!

9
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,098
Martin!

10
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,303
My purse is right there. Go
ahead, take whatever you want.

11
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,230
Irene, you call me?

12
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,072
Irene?

13
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,505
Irene!

14
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,792
How are you doing?

15
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,328
I'm fine.

16
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,461
FYI, if you ask me, it's more
the guys' fault than yours.

17
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,558
And House isn't
blameless, either.

18
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,446
If he hadn't pitted us
all against each other...

19
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,235
It was my fault. My mistake.

20
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,939
Was that always there?

21
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,643
Hello?

22
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,278
Sure.

23
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,587
It's House.

24
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,785
<i>Good morning, angels.</i>

25
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,261
<i>As you will see from the file, we
have quite the interesting case.</i>

26
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,766
<i>It's not often you get a
patient who sees dead people.</i>

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,267
What file?

28
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,630
What the hell?

29
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,332
I gave it to Bosley
a half-hour ago.

30
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,203
It was not a half-hour,
it was 10 minutes.

31
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,300
And he made copies
of the ER records first.

32
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,844
Less lip, more whip.

33
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,187
I only agreed to take this case

34
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,343
because you said that this mocha
frapalicious would have whip on it.

35
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,284
Fine. I'll refer the
case to Foreman.

36
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,720
Can't. Mercy fired him.

37
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,950
Gimme. He got fired?

38
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,222
He disobeyed a superior officer under
fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.

39
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,296
How do you know about
it? You keeping tabs on him?

40
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,955
Girls talk.

41
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,457
When Bosley drags
his ancient ass in there...

42
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,332
I'm here.

43
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:01,535
Twenty-four year old funeral cosmetician
suffered a grand mal seizure at work.

44
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,985
Why does he get to be Bosley?

45
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,888
You want to be Bosley? Bosley's,
like, the asexual messenger boy.

46
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,815
She had a vision of being raped
by a cadaver before passing out.

47
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,375
Seizure rules out
psychiatric illness.

48
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,046
No history of epilepsy,
head trauma or drug use.

49
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,989
Bosley keeps his job while they
replace five angels over three seasons.

50
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,538
Could be a tumor
to the temporal lobe.

51
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,925
Not with a normal CT scan.

52
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,053
You mean, it appeared
normal to the doc in the ER.

53
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,530
Way to get right back
on that horse, Thirteen.

54
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,623
No, that was Amber.

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,566
<i>Nice try, Cutthroat Bitch.</i>

56
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,195
<i>That was the worst Thirteen
imitation I've ever heard.</i>

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,740
Funeral home prep rooms
are filled with toxic chemicals.

58
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,777
And cadavers. Everybody in that
place obviously died from something.

59
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,278
I have a question. Is he
the one who's not a doctor?

60
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,076
Bullets aren't contagious,
but infections, parasites...

61
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,086
You said one of us wasn't a
doctor, and you called him a fraud.

62
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,884
<i>He's not a doctor.
Continue, Bos.</i>

63
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,647
Could be an STD.

64
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,022
Why isn't he fired?

65
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,803
You're breaking up.

66
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>Going into a tunnel.</i>

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,990
Dark Religious Nut.

68
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,225
What did you call me?

69
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,299
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

70
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,336
<i>What do you people want
to be called this week?</i>

71
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,495
Cole.

72
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,469
No, I'm never gonna
remember that.

73
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,406
<i>Take Bosley and the other
visible minority to the funeral home.</i>

74
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,309
<i>The rest of you young, white
people, the world is your oyster.</i>

75
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,904
<i>Do an MRI with contrast,
EEG, LP and a blood panel.</i>

76
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,177
And, angels, be careful.

77
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,521
Just because he's religious,
doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.

78
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,922
You want to bet? No.

79
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,087
I want you to stop
being such a jerk to him.

80
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,024
$100.

81
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,638
Smart call. The guy's a wuss.

82
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,537
He'll be the next
one on the train.

83
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,200
Define "kick your ass."

84
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,902
Any physical confrontation?

85
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,206
Or verbal?

86
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,312
Define verbal.

87
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,712
Anything over 70 decibels.

88
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,876
And you can't start
suddenly being nice to him.

89
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,584
You realize what
you're encouraging here.

90
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,053
Yeah. Someone kicking your ass.

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,461
The space inside is
smaller than I thought.

92
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,792
Don't worry, Reena.

93
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,459
The doctors are gonna
take good care of you, right?

94
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,525
Once the Valium
kicks in you'll feel better.

95
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:12,003
And then we'll have some nice,
warm milk when you're done.

96
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,267
I'd rather have more Valium.

97
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,239
Oh, Reena!

98
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,742
Let's wait just a
bit, see how it goes.

99
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,244
Try to lie as still as possible.

100
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,348
Guess Father Time's a
lock for one of the spots.

101
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,977
Thirteen's a lock.

102
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,253
He doesn't have a medical
license and he's still around.

103
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,724
She killed a guy in a
wheelchair and his dog.

104
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,092
He doesn't care about
our qualifications, our ideas,

105
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,994
he just wants to have fun.

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,000
And she's the ultimate fun,
because he can't figure her out.

107
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,467
This game is insane.

108
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,766
So quit. Happy to
lose the competition.

109
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,707
If it's gonna be on your résumé, it's
got to be better to quit than get fired.

110
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,836
Either quit or shut up.

111
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,583
Actually, with House,
getting fired might look better.

112
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,079
Dr. House is a
dangerous egomaniac.

113
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,127
That's why I left. We had
different ideas on how to practice.

114
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,062
Glad to hear it. Tell
me about Mercy.

115
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,067
To be honest, I don't think
Dr. Schaffer really gave me a chance.

116
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,934
Obviously not. You were
there for three weeks.

117
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,698
What happened?

118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,364
I saved a patient's life.

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,807
That's usually not
grounds for dismissal.

120
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,172
Have you spoken to her?

121
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,712
Yes.

122
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,356
Then why are you asking
me what happened?

123
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,905
You have an excellent résumé.

124
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,918
I felt I owed it to you to
hear what you had to say.

125
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,078
What did she tell you?

126
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:37,056
That you defied her instructions
and hospital procedures.

127
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,958
That's what happened,
nothing more I can add to that.

128
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,792
You could tell me
that you were wrong.

129
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,064
Sounds like you didn't leave
House quite soon enough.

130
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,139
<i>Cadavers were
clean, so is her food.</i>

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,007
<i>It's all organic, unprocessed crap.
It's got to be the embalming fluid.</i>

132
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,137
Ethanol can have
psychoactive effects and...

133
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,580
<i>Bosley, tell whoever's
talking that he's an idiot.</i>

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,679
Bosley?

135
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,850
<i>Either tell him he's an idiot,
or tell me why I'm wrong.</i>

136
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,983
You're an idiot.

137
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,826
You actually think that I'd take a patient
who had a seizure in a funeral home,

138
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,332
if the ER hadn't already
ruled out embalming fluid?

139
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,510
I thought we weren't
supposed to trust...

140
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,593
<i>Idiot!</i>

141
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,036
From the old French, <i>idiote,</i>

142
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,199
meaning effeminate,
mentally deficient Moor.

143
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,636
I found something in the
mortuary's files from '05.

144
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,274
A 48-year-old male's cause of
death was listed as pneumonia,

145
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,148
but the symptoms in the
autopsy report didn't fit.

146
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,882
<i>Confusion, memory
loss, depression...</i>

147
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,014
Mad cow. Very cool.

148
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,891
No, she's a vegetarian and only
ate organic vegetables, at that.

149
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,225
Tell him he's an idiot again.

150
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,299
The disease can be
spread by brain tissue.

151
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,498
Which is very cool. Run with it.

152
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,968
So, because the
answer might be cool,

153
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,871
you want us to do a brain
biopsy on a 24-year-old woman?

154
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,204
No, because the
answer is something cool,

155
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:07,076
I want you to do a brain biopsy
on a 48-year-old dead guy.

156
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,808
The guy's already been buried.

157
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,009
We dig him up.

158
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,518
I'm not digging up a
body without a court order.

159
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,230
<i>Don't think of it as
digging up a body.</i>

160
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,747
Think of it as keeping
another one from being buried.

161
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,951
I can't do it.

162
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,196
Are we gonna have another one
of those ecumenical discussions

163
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,894
<i>where I tell you that your beliefs
are ridiculous and you totally cave?</i>

164
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,936
I just got to be home at 6:00.

165
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,095
The Sabbath.

166
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:34,868
The Lord works for six days,
then tells the union he needs a rest.

167
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,843
You know, if I was all-powerful
I think I'd take at least two days.

168
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,209
It's Thursday.

169
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,578
Well, then it must be the kid.

170
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,215
<i>You have oatmeal on your pants.</i>

171
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,331
Do you have a camera in here?

172
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,880
<i>Nope, I was guessing.</i>

173
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,517
<i>He had oatmeal on his pants
yesterday and the day before.</i>

174
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,586
<i>Have one of your wives
look after the spawn.</i>

175
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,958
I'm a single dad.

176
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,234
Where's the single mom?

177
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,138
I have no idea.

178
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,369
<i>Interesting.</i>

179
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,537
You claim a lapse of judgment,

180
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,912
or are you gonna admit that a
lapse in judgment is a lapse in faith?

181
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,814
He's gone.

182
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,112
<i>Fair enough.</i>

183
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,085
Family comes first.

184
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:33,495
Dr. Cuddy? I'm Amber Volakis,
one of Dr. House's new fellows.

185
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,796
Sexual harassment
claims go through HR,

186
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,632
stress-related leaves
through workers comp,

187
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,968
and any accusations
of criminal activities

188
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,271
go directly to the
Princeton-Plainsboro police department.

189
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:48,281
Actually, I was wondering if you needed
any extra help in the clinic tonight.

190
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,978
You're not gonna score any
points with House by kissing my ass.

191
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,520
Understood, but I hear
Dr. House hates clinic duty.

192
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,466
If he were to hear through the grapevine
that I was willing to work overtime,

193
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,335
take some of it off his hands...
My advice to you is to do

194
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,328
whatever House
wants you to do tonight.

195
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,972
And then tomorrow
night you can come back

196
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,158
and I will give you
extra clinic duty.

197
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,201
Does everybody around
here have trust issues?

198
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,699
I don't know what House wants
you to do and I don't want to know.

199
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,804
But if you really have a
problem with it, quit now.

200
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,002
It's only gonna get worse.

201
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,212
All right. Who's up?

202
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,516
Not me.

203
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,868
You haven't done
any digging yet.

204
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:30,982
I'm a surgeon.

205
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,992
If anything happens to
these hands, I'm screwed.

206
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,152
Let Bosley do it.

207
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,538
As long as he can
keep folding laundry,

208
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,121
his career...

209
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,893
Someone's coming.

210
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,546
Hey, shouldn't we be running?

211
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,765
If it's a cop, run.

212
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,670
Security guard, I say
we take him down.

213
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,143
Sorry I'm late.

214
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,361
Where the hell have you been?

215
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,409
I got lost.

216
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,512
We've been here
over three hours.

217
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,114
Really lost.

218
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,386
I brought coffee and donuts.

219
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,196
So, Thirteen, you
grow up around here?

220
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,695
We're digging up a grave
and you want to chit-chat?

221
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,967
I'm just making conversation.
It's what people do.

222
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,398
Why are you hiding everything?

223
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,207
And I'm asking you that question
because you're hiding everything.

224
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,306
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

225
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,906
I'm worried.

226
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,452
No, you're not.

227
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,818
Fine, but I am freaked, because
I don't think you're a freak.

228
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,587
I think you're doing this on purpose
because you know House will be intrigued.

229
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,625
Yeah, I grew up around here.

230
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,295
Honey, I'm home.

231
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,130
Get the crowbar.

232
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,835
No, there's not enough room to
maneuver a crowbar down here.

233
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,843
Oh, God help us.

234
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,151
What the hell?

235
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,243
What is it?

236
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,620
Ankles. They buried the
guy the wrong way around.

237
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,958
The doctors' lounge
is covered in mud.

238
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,593
Thirteen and Cutthroat
Bitch had a disagreement.

239
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,831
Cafeteria was out of Jell-O.

240
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,371
There were pickaxes.

241
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,034
Either you had them dig up a
body, or you're building a railroad.

242
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,840
A little, tiny piece of his
brain. Seemed a waste.

243
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,023
He wasn't using it anymore.

244
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,071
That's your defense?

245
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,083
"We just dismembered him."

246
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,949
They're looking for
Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

247
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,189
You get the results yet?

248
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,054
Does my breath
smell bated to you?

249
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,561
Yes. Let me know
when you hear anything.

250
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,188
And get that mess in the
shower area cleaned up.

251
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,857
I know just the guy.

252
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,492
How many of them
agreed to dig up a grave?

253
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,698
Six. But don't worry, the one
who didn't, didn't stand on principle.

254
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,503
He just had a diaper to change.

255
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,171
I really think there are no
bad choices in this group.

256
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,187
You guys don't wipe your feet
when you come in the house?

257
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,992
Doctors' lounge, let's go.

258
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,225
Why me?

259
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,577
Well, I can't ask the black
guy or one of the chicks to do it.

260
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,933
That would be insensitive.

261
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,698
And you can't ask Bosley

262
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:36,505
because that'd look like you only hired
the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.

263
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,875
You keep stalling,
you're still gonna clean up,

264
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,540
but I won't let
you have the mop.

265
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,251
Sample came back
negative for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

266
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,222
Well, that discussion
didn't last long.

267
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,038
I just don't know
what else there is.

268
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,226
We had an idea, it was wrong.

269
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,891
Well, we could go home.

270
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,129
I mean, we have no idea
what's wrong with her,

271
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,813
which means it could
be completely benign.

272
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,935
Or, on the off chance that it's killing
her, we could take it again from the top.

273
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,338
You've already done everything.

274
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,492
We may have missed something.

275
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,179
I just want to go home.
I'm sure I'm fine now.

276
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,017
Reena, the doctors know best.

277
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,521
You had some serious symptoms...

278
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,457
If I have another one, I'll
come right back. Okay?

279
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,003
If you have it while
you're driving...

280
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,020
You can drive me,
make sure I take it easy.

281
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,097
Who can?

282
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,468
My mother.

283
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,765
Your mother's here?

284
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,833
What are you talking
about? She's right there.

285
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,483
<i>You sampled every bodily fluid,</i>

286
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:03,895
<i>peeked in her brain, violated a
cadaver's privacy, dug up a body,</i>

287
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,555
but missed the fact

288
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,194
that she was still seeing
things that weren't there.

289
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,733
Neurological symptoms
are getting worse.

290
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,675
It'd be nice if one of you
angels/morons had a clue why.

291
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,272
We did a full history. She never mentioned
seeing or hearing anything unusual.

292
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,078
Well, as long as she never said
anything, how were you to know?

293
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,584
Same thing with the spinal
fluid? She tell you that was fine?

294
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,350
The labs were all clear.

295
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,051
Then either we're about to
meet the Alpha and Omega,

296
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,060
or you missed something.

297
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,390
We missed the new symptom.

298
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,674
It's not a new symptom. We
always knew she had hallucinations.

299
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,065
Seeing your dead
mother's a hallucination.

300
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,864
Not knowing she's
dead is a delusion.

301
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,429
You keep this up, you're gonna
have to start wearing sexier clothes.

302
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,910
Carbon monoxide could also cause
delusions. A lot of haunted houses...

303
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,311
There's no headache,
no tachycardia.

304
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,391
I guess they didn't cover
that at your medical school.

305
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,078
What about a hereditary
connection? I mean, she's 24.

306
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,483
Her mother died when she was 25.

307
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,647
In Ukraine, 20 years ago. Good
luck trying to get those records.

308
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,247
So we start new records.

309
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,987
Test for every hereditary
disease that fits the symptoms.

310
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,239
There are at least 40 different
mitochondrial disorders,

311
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,322
another couple hundred...

312
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,095
Start with amyloidosis and you keep
going until you reach zamyloidosis.

313
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,340
Now what are you testing for?

314
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,968
Or should I ask what
you are not testing for?

315
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,957
Well, we could narrow it down if you
could remember what your mother died from.

316
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,281
My mother is not dead.
She's sitting right there.

317
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,033
Do you think we're lying to you?

318
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,680
Leave it alone.

319
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,927
Convincing her that her mother's
dead isn't gonna make her better,

320
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,829
just miserable.

321
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,833
You lose your mother?

322
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,635
Do you think we're trying to
trick you? Why would we do that?

323
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,110
Because you're mean, and
you're not good at your job.

324
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,511
Reena, stop. You're being cruel.

325
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,276
They're wasting time,

326
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,184
doing exactly what the guy in
the wheelchair said they'd do.

327
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,832
A guy in a wheelchair was here?

328
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,347
You know who I'm talking about.

329
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,018
He's been hanging around
ever since they brought me in,

330
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,222
complaining about how
incompetent everyone is.

331
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,327
He said you killed his dog.

332
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,685
It doesn't make any sense.

333
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,829
I'm not interested.

334
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,955
If you weren't interested,
you wouldn't be here.

335
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,641
I thought it was social.

336
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,808
No, you didn't. You always
think there's an agenda.

337
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,145
That's why I left.

338
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,085
That's why you're good.

339
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,156
You need a job. I'll find a job.

340
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,850
I need someone that
understands House.

341
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,924
They'll learn.

342
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,688
I need someone that
can control House.

343
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,059
Keep looking. It
might take a while.

344
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,901
I'll cut the salary of everyone
else on the team 15%,

345
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,437
give it to you.

346
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,336
That's more than
you'll get anywhere else.

347
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,374
What does House say about this?

348
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,708
You're the one person on the
team that he always respected.

349
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,112
This restaurant is 20 minutes out
of your way, half an hour out of mine.

350
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,483
You picked it to make sure
House didn't drop in on us.

351
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,385
It's my decision, not his.

352
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,153
You tell him that, then run back to
your office while I get to deal with him.

353
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,727
I left for a reason.

354
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,990
That reason hasn't changed.

355
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,463
So,

356
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,235
what's the news?

357
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,645
Everything's negative so far.

358
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,646
Yes. Why wait to finish
before reporting to me?

359
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,947
I have things to do, you know.

360
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,381
She's seeing someone else.

361
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,114
That's not news, that's olds.

362
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,316
Damn it. Why did God design
the human body this way?

363
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,517
A guy in a wheelchair.

364
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,288
In a hospital? That's enough
to give you the heebie-jeebies.

365
00:19:55,361 --> 00:20:00,163
He had a dog. She's
seeing Stark, our last patient.

366
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:04,101
Well, if it's Stark, he
wouldn't be haunting a patient,

367
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,698
he'd be haunting the
doctor who killed him.

368
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,851
She probably just overheard
someone talking about it, or...

369
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,138
Probably?

370
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,770
You think there's a possibility
that the alternative is true?

371
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,314
No. Then go away.

372
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,681
We're wasting time. We ran
32 gels, we could run 100 more.

373
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,995
Without knowing
how her mother died...

374
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,851
You're gonna have
to run 100 more.

375
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,978
By you, of course,

376
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,267
I'm only referring to the people
who care enough about human life

377
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,953
to put in a full day.

378
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,619
You want to carpool?

379
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,490
How do you expect me
to respond to this stuff?

380
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,533
Exactly like you just did.

381
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,192
I have a theory. Maybe
you can help me out.

382
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:40,672
Black Mormon means
masochist, means kinky.

383
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,200
I'm thinking that someone got
hurt making the bastard. Am I right?

384
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,471
You leave my son out of this.

385
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,482
I wasn't referring to your kid's
hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.

386
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,484
Why don't we just
ask her how she died?

387
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,487
Because she won't tell us.
She thinks her mother's still alive.

388
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,956
I don't mean ask the patient.
I mean, ask her mother.

389
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,986
Cool.

390
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,729
Come on.

391
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,627
What the hell does that mean?

392
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,570
You guys talking your
own language now?

393
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,439
I'm sorry. I'll try to include
some visual aids next time.

394
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,716
Now, what?

395
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,780
I'm Dr. House. Is
your mom around?

396
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,051
Why should I tell you?

397
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,559
You're just gonna tell
me I'm lying or crazy.

398
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,257
I'm not gonna do that. I really
need to know what she has to say.

399
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,491
What do you want?

400
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:40,709
When you were young, was she...

401
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,965
No, not you. Him.

402
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,038
The man in the wheelchair?

403
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,869
No. He's old.

404
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,579
Actually, looks like you.

405
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,060
Yeah, that's Grandpa House.

406
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,959
Tell him to call
back on a landline.

407
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,156
Terrible reception in here.

408
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,789
How much pain was your mom in?

409
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,923
It's Walter.

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,162
He says his name is Walter.

411
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,258
Can I help you?

412
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,959
My patient's talking
to my Grandpa Walt.

413
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,331
You have a Grandpa Walt?

414
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,596
Nope.

415
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,864
Which is what made me suspect

416
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,304
that maybe she's not
actually seeing into the afterlife.

417
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,604
What is this sudden
obsession with the afterlife?

418
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,873
My only obsession is with the
idiots in the right-here-and-now life

419
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,277
who think there's an afterlife.

420
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,782
And you want me to... Nothing.

421
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:08,219
Just needed a place to hang low for
a while. I'm pretending to be spooked.

422
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,379
Because?

423
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,289
Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead
patient thinks that I believe her,

424
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,722
maybe she'll let me chat
with her mother's ghost.

425
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,821
The one you don't
believe exists.

426
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,991
Exactly.

427
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,830
The ghost is a hallucination,
which is the result of a delusion,

428
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,633
which most likely is the
result of a hereditary disease

429
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,866
that her mother died from
when the patient was four.

430
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,068
And you think you can tap
into her subconscious memory

431
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,236
by tapping into
her hallucination.

432
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,803
Mmm-hmm.

433
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,008
She might not know what
caused her mother's death,

434
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,381
but she will know how
she acted before she died.

435
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,818
You're quite impressed with
yourself right now, aren't you?

436
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,617
Who wouldn't be?

437
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,126
Well, that should
be long enough.

438
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,558
Back in a flash.

439
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,761
Take your time.

440
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,665
Is my grandfather still here?

441
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,764
No.

442
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,537
He should be right back.

443
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,841
He just went to get
some warm milk.

444
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,511
But your mom's
still here, right?

445
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,451
Yes, of course.

446
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,621
I know she's fine, now, but when
you were four or five, she got sick.

447
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:21,785
No.

448
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,227
You sure? She
wasn't in any pain?

449
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,958
I wasn't in pain.

450
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,590
No, she was just tired.

451
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,862
And sometimes she
would stay in bed all day.

452
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,062
Did she ever fall down?

453
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,195
Of course.

454
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,638
Everyone falls
down once in a while.

455
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,641
Sometimes, not that often.

456
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,109
How often?

457
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,748
Maybe it was actually
more than once in a while.

458
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,441
Remember that
time in the bathroom?

459
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,679
Mmm.

460
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,551
A few times.

461
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,559
Once she hit her head on the bathroom
sink. There was blood all over the floor.

462
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,061
I got it on my sweater. I...

463
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,560
They took her away.

464
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,831
Yeah, to the place where
the doctor made her better.

465
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,430
But before that, what
about her arms and legs?

466
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,773
Did she ever walk funny,
like, sort of bent over?

467
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,240
I thought that was from
growing up on the farm!

468
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,510
What about her hands?

469
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,144
Did she ever have any difficulty
sewing, buttoning a shirt?

470
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,253
No.

471
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,959
But sometimes my
hands would shiver.

472
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,829
Like I was cold, but I wasn't.
I never quite understood.

473
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,265
She used to get the
shivers. Like she was cold.

474
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,982
Start her on L-dopa
and bromocriptine.

475
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,919
It's just Parkinson's.

476
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,134
Cole, how's it going
with your patient?

477
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,865
Still seeing stuff.

478
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,464
I hear House is
treating you like crap.

479
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,736
He treats everyone badly.

480
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,641
Yeah, but I heard
you're special.

481
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,975
Well, I can handle it.

482
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:25,142
Maybe you shouldn't. He's gonna
walk all over you if you let him.

483
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,379
That says nothing
about me, just him.

484
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,251
House respects people
who aren't afraid of him.

485
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,757
Get in his face.
Yell, if you have to.

486
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,693
I don't need his respect.

487
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,027
You do if you want the job.

488
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,101
Thanks for the advice.

489
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,002
You have to hold still.

490
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm trying!

491
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,038
Damn! Hold her down!

492
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,113
No!

493
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,581
Stop it! Let me do it.

494
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,847
No, no.

495
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,513
Hold her down!

496
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,290
No! No!

497
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,421
No!

498
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,568
Irene?

499
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,467
Irene?

500
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,903
You stabbed me.

501
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,913
You were having a
nightmare. It wasn't real.

502
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,911
My arm is bleeding.

503
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,713
No. It's okay now,
your arm's not...

504
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:41,288
Lesions aren't
explained by Parkinson's.

505
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,918
Any theories?

506
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,332
What, ghost got your tongue?

507
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,266
I'm fine.

508
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,565
What about vasculitis?

509
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,607
MRI didn't indicate
any cerebral ischemia.

510
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,472
But she has shown some focal
weakness, urinary retention.

511
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,136
Yes. Those are her
big mystery symptoms,

512
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,477
not the hallucinations that
vasculitis doesn't explain.

513
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,140
Unless it's retinal vasculitis.

514
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,318
House, this guy may be smart, and
I'm sure he's great to share a beer with,

515
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,482
but if he doesn't know that visual
symptoms are an electrical issue,

516
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,492
not vascular, two
separate systems...

517
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:20,032
So are the banks and the power grid, but
if I don't pay my bills my lights go out.

518
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:30,368
Vasculitis restricts blood flow to
nerves, messes with electrical function.

519
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,535
Acute intermittent
porphyria is a better fit.

520
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,637
If you're wrong about porphyria,
the treatment could box her kidneys.

521
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,516
Vasculitis is treated with
corticosteroids, relatively harmless.

522
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,297
Start her on the
steroids. House, he's not...

523
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:45,485
Then test for both so
he can stop whining.

524
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:50,791
Big Love, have I humiliated
you in the last half-hour?

525
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,921
No.

526
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,829
Check your e-mail.

527
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,935
How's it going?

528
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,441
Great.

529
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,808
The only way he can turn any more
cheeks is by pulling down his pants.

530
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,370
He's not a wuss. It takes
a lot more strength...

531
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,643
We didn't bet on
how strong he was.

532
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:15,119
So, you're gonna collect $100 and
fire him because he has principles?

533
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:18,487
What's your agenda here? You
obviously don't care about the 100.

534
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,219
He's a decent, smart...

535
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,469
You don't care about the team.

536
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,038
Does it annoy Wilson when you
ask questions and ignore the answers?

537
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,360
Very much.

538
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:29,196
You only care about
who I hire and who I fire

539
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,964
because you miss
going through my mail.

540
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,199
You can't stop controlling me.

541
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,831
No one controls you.

542
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,637
Want your job back? No.

543
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,645
Too bad, you can't have
it. She'll take care of this.

544
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:44,171
You can take it out of the
100 you're gonna owe me.

545
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,980
I met House at a conference
about five years ago.

546
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,023
He's quite a
character. Yes, he is.

547
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,888
Probably one of the best
medical minds of our generation.

548
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,325
I agree. I learned
an awful lot from him.

549
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,695
I'll bet you did. I see here
you just did a stint at Mercy.

550
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,028
Great.

551
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,501
It says here "'07 to Present."
How long were you there?

552
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,734
About a month. Dr. Schaffer was
great, but it just wasn't the right fit.

553
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,038
Wait, was that you with Dr. Schaffer
and the lymphoma patient?

554
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,740
It was... It was a tough situation. I
probably could've handled it better.

555
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:20,444
No, Dr. Schaffer's got a
stick up her rear, good for you.

556
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,077
What made you so
sure it was lymphoma?

557
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,952
There was an unusual lactic
acid level in one of her labs.

558
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,889
I had a similar case
a few months ago.

559
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,985
Beautiful. God, I
wish I had your stones.

560
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,791
Well, my stones
are on the market.

561
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,959
No, I mean, seriously, I
wish I had your stones.

562
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,129
I could cram you down
the board of directors.

563
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,537
But I don't. I'm sorry, man.

564
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,077
Good luck.

565
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,244
When your retinas see something,

566
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,579
they send electrical
signals to your brain.

567
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,881
These lenses will
pick up those signals.

568
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,730
If the signals are
misfiring, it'll confirm

569
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,622
that an old man without a medical
license is smarter than all of us,

570
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,386
that your hallucinations
were caused by...

571
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:03,429
They're not hallucinations.
Tell them, Mom.

572
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,657
Honey, they're doctors.

573
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,632
They must know
what they're doing.

574
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:12,262
If they know what they're doing,
how did they kill that poor man's dog?

575
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,805
Come on, this has got to
be freaking you out a little bit.

576
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,606
I appreciate your concern.

577
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,409
There's nothing to
be ashamed of here.

578
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,425
If the ghost of a man you killed
doesn't screw with your head,

579
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,283
there's something
wrong with your head.

580
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,353
See, that freaks me out.

581
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,125
Someone must
have left it in here.

582
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,530
Absolutely, that makes sense,

583
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,977
some dog was in here
getting his eyes checked

584
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,479
and forgot to put
his jewelry back on.

585
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,698
This isn't working.

586
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,205
You're just making me
sicker, like he said you...

587
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,434
What's wrong?

588
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,444
My stomach, it hurts.

589
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,346
Code in the eye lab.
Lean forward, Irene.

590
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,474
You're gonna aspirate.

591
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,747
I can't. It hurts.

592
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,119
Why won't you help me?

593
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,489
Spleen's ripe to bursting. You
guys thought it was vasculitis?

594
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,011
You used to be on
House's team, right?

595
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,971
Yeah. Got a lot of
blood in here. Sponge.

596
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,505
You got any advice for me?

597
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,575
Nope.

598
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,339
You always put up with his crap?

599
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,470
Yeah.

600
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:30,548
Was it a mistake?

601
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,708
It was irrelevant.

602
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,149
Well, he fired you.

603
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,915
He'll fire you either
way. Eventually.

604
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,223
Dr. Cameron told me
about... Don't want to know.

605
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,522
Why not? Because
House is watching.

606
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,024
Not a metaphor. Look up.

607
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,315
<i>You guys gonna shoot the breeze,</i>

608
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,567
<i>or you gonna do something
about all that bleeding?</i>

609
00:32:56,274 --> 00:33:00,177
That's not coming from
the spleen. It's the liver.

610
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:01,304
It's necrotic.

611
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,575
She's dying from the inside out.

612
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,481
Enlarged spleen and
liver failure are classic AIP.

613
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,735
It's porphyria and
it's moving fast.

614
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,160
PBGs were negative.
If you read the reports...

615
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,289
PBG tests are only conclusive
if done during an attack,

616
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,630
which you would know
if you were a real doctor.

617
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,260
That is just great.

618
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,861
What is? Which one of us is?

619
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,236
Both of you. Together.

620
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,174
Fighting. Passionate to
prove the other one wrong.

621
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,303
Couldn't care less about the
patient, but it all works out the same.

622
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,677
I hate Thirteen.

623
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,114
Not as productively. Continue.

624
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,210
It could still be vascular.

625
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,186
Vasculitis is off the board.

626
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,755
Steroid treatment didn't help.

627
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,654
Vascular isn't just vasculitis.

628
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:49,024
Something's got to be cutting off the
blood supply to her liver and spleen.

629
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,494
Do a visceral angiogram.

630
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,293
This is a joke, right?

631
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,890
He can't be right
every single time.

632
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,697
You're feeding him your
ideas just to embarrass us.

633
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:02,297
If I wanted to embarrass you, I'd
have you mop up the doctors' lounge.

634
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:40,408
Heavenly Father, I pray thee
that thou shalt give the Holy Ghost

635
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,846
unto all them that shall
believe in their words.

636
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,719
Irene, what are you doing?

637
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,345
I need to touch it.

638
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,421
Put your hand down.

639
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,457
No! Give it to me! I want it!

640
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,255
Give it to me! No!

641
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,730
What the angio say?

642
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,485
We couldn't finish.
She started groping me.

643
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,334
And you couldn't let her get to
second base just to get the test done?

644
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,605
I think that's third base.

645
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,647
She was convulsing,
delirious and hyper-salivating.

646
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:18,546
We had to knock her
out with lorazepam.

647
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,415
Well, that's definitely
not vascular.

648
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,886
What do you want us to do?

649
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,152
The question is, what
would Joseph Smith do?

650
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,301
This isn't the time for anti...

651
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,325
Casting out the demons?

652
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,295
The patient's not possessed. She's
dying. You can mock me tomorrow.

653
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,993
You believe that the
book has all the answers.

654
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,535
To morality, not science.

655
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,298
But the book is
inconsistent with science.

656
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,341
You know how many epileptics were
tortured because they were possessed?

657
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,341
How many teenage
witches were stoned to death,

658
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,519
because they took mushrooms?

659
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,944
Just shut up already.
We got a patient dying.

660
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:53,350
You either got to prescribe an exorcism, or
admit to me that Smith was a horny fraud.

661
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,996
I know what she has.

662
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,967
You couldn't have spoken
up 10 seconds ago?

663
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,503
You would have
saved me 100 bucks.

664
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,981
Mushrooms weren't the only thing
that got people stoned to death,

665
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,669
jimsonweed, belladonna,
mandrake root and moldy bread.

666
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:18,868
It's ergot poisoning.

667
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,054
You'd need damp grain that's...

668
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,070
Completely unprocessed
and untreated,

669
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,708
like what's in that organic
rye bread she's been eating.

670
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,387
Should I be going
home? Is it 6:00?

671
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,352
It's why she got worse
on the bromocriptine.

672
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,515
It's an ergot derivative.

673
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,217
There hasn't been
a case in 50 years.

674
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,736
She kept asking for milk. Dairy
products counteract the effects.

675
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,638
You think she knew what
she had and was treating it?

676
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,739
Cravings based on actual needs,

677
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,927
it's a fairly common
evolutionary development.

678
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,100
You okay with an answer
based on evolution?

679
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,467
Yeah.

680
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,639
Hypocrite.

681
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,744
It's the stuff they make LSD from.
The treatment you're on should...

682
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,749
So, I've just been tripping?

683
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,582
It explains the hallucinations,
seizures, delusions...

684
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,522
Constricts the blood vessels,
which explains the necrosis.

685
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,292
She's not here?

686
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,497
I'm sorry, no.

687
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,072
The fact that you're even
willing to accept that answer

688
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,946
means the medicine
is starting to work.

689
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,287
But you'll live.

690
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,421
You're beautiful, Reena.

691
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,588
You too, Mama.

692
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,730
I'm going to miss you.

693
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,667
Mama.

694
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,568
As you know, there
are seven of you and...

695
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,873
One, two, three, four...

696
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,437
Only six roses.

697
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,880
Those are peonies.

698
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,950
But I'm sure they're
part of the rose family.

699
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:20,215
Actually, I'm surprised
there are seven of you.

700
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,988
You punch your boss
and stick around?

701
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,791
Give me the flower and shut up.

702
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,233
Don't overdo it.

703
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:35,637
Now, I would love to keep all of you,
but not enough to do anything about it.

704
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,474
So, according to my arbitrary
schedule, one of you has to go.

705
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,023
You're kidding!

706
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,370
I came up with the
answer. I robbed a grave. I...

707
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,806
Planted a dog collar in the procedure
room just to screw with my head.

708
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,707
No, I never.

709
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,706
What, you don't
believe she did it?

710
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm sure she did it.

711
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,879
That's why she's getting the flower.
It was beautiful, she just overreached.

712
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,478
She got into your head. No, I...

713
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,524
She owned you.

714
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,388
Planting the idea was good.

715
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,986
Letting it fester was good.
Leaving the collar was stupid.

716
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:35,522
Well-known fact, ghosts
don't leave things lying around.

717
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,231
So, am I gone then?

718
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:56,216
Oh, my goodness. I totally
forgot about you two. Well played.

719
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,598
Sorry, Henry.

720
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,900
We had some giggles.

721
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,903
You agreed with everything he said.
You finished each other's sentences.

722
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,972
That's why I got to go.

723
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,118
Don't need someone to tell
you what you're already thinking.

724
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,018
Funny, I was gonna say that.

725
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,556
If you want to hang
out... Yeah, I know.

726
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,119
Call Wilson.

727
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:43,167
The rest of you, 8:00 tomorrow.

728
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,975
Cash will be fine.

729
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,607
I bet you say that
to all the guys.

730
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,942
Take your blood money.

731
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,113
Who are you gonna protect next?

732
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,681
If I told you, it wouldn't work.

733
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,531
I've re-thought some things.

734
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:24,769
Glad to hear it.

735
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,176
I'm prepared to come back
on a number of conditions.

736
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,646
I want the raise you
promised, plus five percent.

737
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,810
I want my own office
and a personal assistant.

738
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,612
That's not unreasonable.

739
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:39,484
I will give you none of those.

740
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,619
You can come back
at your original salary.

741
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,458
What's going on?

742
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,063
You haven't re-thought anything.

743
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,034
You've just been black-balled.

744
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,331
You're "House, Lite" now.

745
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:57,933
The only administrator that will touch
you is the one who hired "House, Classic."

746
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:02,036
The good news is she'll pretend
she's not doing you a favor.

747
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,884
I can start Monday.
