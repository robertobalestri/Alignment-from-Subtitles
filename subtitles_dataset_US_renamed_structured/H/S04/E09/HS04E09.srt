1
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,074
Roman emperors
were the real punks.

2
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,706
Don't say "punk." It's clichÃ©.

3
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,978
Whatever. Let me tell you
about these dinner parties.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,747
Nero loved a good poisoning.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,631
At a dinner party? He'd
arrange one right at the table...

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,015
I don't feel like
going on tonight.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,220
Too bad, 'cause that's what
makes the club feel like paying us.

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,921
Titus, this was all in the book.

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,588
Titus would ply his
guests with wine,

10
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,189
then bind their
privates with a chord.

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,826
Hey! Did you get a new guitar?

12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,395
A '64 teardrop reissue.
Not a mark on it.

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,807
All right.

14
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,444
Can I see it?

15
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,507
Oh, it's nice.

16
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,680
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey,
cut it out, man! Hey!

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,190
You stupid son of
a... You're gonna pay!

18
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,919
It's a hunk of wood, bro.

19
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,585
It should look like
a hunk of wood.

20
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,527
We're not the philharmonic.

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,031
See, look, man.
It's better already.

22
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,293
Hey! It's 10:45.

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,532
How about taking that onstage?

24
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,367
Now I feel like going on.

25
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,188
<i>You're my child, and
so are those quadruplets,</i>

26
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,061
<i>and I'm not gonna
give any of you up.</i>

27
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,567
<i>Don't you dare talk
to me as a mother.</i>

28
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,695
Sign on the door says
"closed for private event."

29
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,664
You're alone.

30
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,436
How much more
private can you get?

31
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,704
Will you pass me a tissue?

32
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,747
Who are you keeping? You
owed me a decision 10 days ago.

33
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,281
Total amnesia.

34
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,042
<i>You're my whole life, you.</i>

35
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,578
And Luisa Maria can't decide if
she's gonna keep the quadruplets.

36
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,454
<i>Then how can you...</i>

37
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,651
She keeps them.
I read it online.

38
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,890
You happy now?
I ruined it for you.

39
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,795
I want two names
by Friday. Fine.

40
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,778
I'll arrange for a patient with a
mysterious illness to come in on Thursday.

41
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,634
Yes. You need more tests.

42
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,263
It's only been two months.

43
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,671
Who knows how they'll react
to freak weather patterns?

44
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,181
They all did fine
in the wind tunnel.

45
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,476
Two names by Friday or the pay
overruns come out of your salary.

46
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,486
<i>I can hurt you. I know that now.</i>

47
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,388
And I move your
parking space to the E lot.

48
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,394
<i>Don't ever leave me, Mom!</i>

49
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,726
Hey.

50
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,628
Who's the sickest
patient you got?

51
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,998
I've got a guy who'll be
dead in the next 10 minutes.

52
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:59,203
Oh. You mean someone who
might actually survive a diagnosis.

53
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,898
There's nothing here.

54
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,377
Just the usual cracked
heads, gunshots, false alarms.

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,609
Who would you pick to
fill your narrow little flats?

56
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,584
So, you can fire them
off my recommendation?

57
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,244
Nice try.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,882
Hey, who do I have to grope to
get some turndown service in here?

59
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,620
Jimmy Quidd. He's
a punk rock singer.

60
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,321
Punk rock star to you.

61
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,057
Repeated trauma,
self-cutting, fever,

62
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,501
arthralgia, hyper-inflated
chest, fatigue, anemia,

63
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,332
blood in the stool and urine.

64
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,395
I've died and gone
to diagnostic heaven.

65
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,239
His blood results show booze,
cocaine, amphetamines, opiates.

66
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,404
The only mystery here is
how he made it to be 38.

67
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,538
I'm 28.

68
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,048
And he lies.

69
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,549
And he's a pain in the ass.

70
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,985
Hey, come on. No.

71
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,386
Wrap him up.
I'll take him to go.

72
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,123
Dizzying array of symptoms,

73
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,830
any of which could be caused
by drugs, trauma, being a loser.

74
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,368
The guy's a walking
pharmacy, could be anything.

75
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,768
Oh, forgot to
mention. Final case.

76
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,033
Get it right, you're hired.

77
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,566
Runner-up will be decided
strictly on some definition of merit.

78
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,909
Endocarditis. Hemorrhagic
lesions on the lungs and gut.

79
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,419
Bronchiolitis obliterans, he
smoked his airways into oblivion.

80
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,848
Endocarditits. I
already said that.

81
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,194
I heard of it before
you mentioned it.

82
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,244
Speed counts.
Find something else.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,464
Could be bacterial meningitis.

84
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,218
You already picked.
I'll take meningitis.

85
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,759
Too late. Go run your tests.

86
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,455
No. He's sick 'cause
he's a drug addict.

87
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,522
No. He has every symptom
you'd expect from a drug addict.

88
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,534
So, you think it's
all too perfect?

89
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,761
Some other disease is
trying to throw us off its trail?

90
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,238
If he had four out of
20 possible symptoms,

91
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,434
he'd be a
garden-variety druggie.

92
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,773
Twenty out of 20, there's
an underlying disease.

93
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,938
Run your tests. FOREMAN: No!

94
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,343
He's weak, in withdrawal,
just spewed blood.

95
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,893
They're gonna rip
off a piece of his lung,

96
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,195
ram instruments down his throat,

97
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,017
and Roto-Rooter his intestines.

98
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,231
It'd be nice if
we didn't kill him

99
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,952
trying to figure out
what's killing him.

100
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,828
One diagnosis,
one test at a time.

101
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,523
O2 sats are low,
hyper-inflated chest.

102
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,692
I need a bronchoscopy to...

103
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,758
You just lost two
points. What for?

104
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,997
For thinking it makes a
difference who goes first.

105
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,370
Only one person can
be right. What points?

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,772
Can't have an objective system

107
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,366
of measurement without numbers.

108
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,412
You lose three for
not knowing that.

109
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:24,678
From now on, only the person
holding this can treat or run tests.

110
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,052
Wanted to give you the serpent
staff with the poison axe-head,

111
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,783
but I left it in my car.

112
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,222
Thank you.

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,462
Don't need you. It's one
thing to hire based on a game.

114
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,935
Don't need your lecture.

115
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,166
It's insane to treat
based on a game.

116
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,003
You're not taking the long view.

117
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,236
The one where we stuff
another patient in a body bag?

118
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,404
No, if we're wrong,
that'll come pretty fast.

119
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,914
The long view is the one
where we pick the best team,

120
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,816
that way we can use all the
bags we save for grocery shopping.

121
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,497
You're not buying
that argument, are you?

122
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,545
No.

123
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,400
In which case, I'm back
to my original position.

124
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,949
Don't need you.

125
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,627
What do you think of Amber?

126
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,602
I screwed up a diagnosis.

127
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,242
You don't seem that upset by it.

128
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:31,211
I diagnosed a guy with
adenocarcinoma three months ago.

129
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,980
Told him he had six months.

130
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,965
So, now you gotta tell him that he's
way behind on his Christmas shopping?

131
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:39,084
He didn't get worse. I
rechecked everything.

132
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,762
Biopsy was a false positive.

133
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,627
Harmless lesions
caused by talc inhalation.

134
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,792
Medical clemency.

135
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,266
Interesting.

136
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,330
Why would you use that word?

137
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,304
Because I'm interested.

138
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,183
When I'm interested,
I describe the things

139
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,971
that make me
interested as interesting.

140
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,944
Most people would
say good, possibly great.

141
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,156
Why aren't you
able to just enjoy...

142
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,582
Why aren't other people
able to just be interested?

143
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,350
Is he in there?

144
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,551
Yeah.

145
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,055
Why'd you go right
for the drug theories?

146
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,791
If he had a history of
shoving cancer into his veins,

147
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,799
I'd have guessed cancer.

148
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,333
Okay. You're an idiot.

149
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,599
Either that or you've decided
you can trust a smoking addict

150
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,732
alone in a bathroom
with an oxygen tank.

151
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,982
I got your new
test results back.

152
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,143
Sorry I'm late.

153
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,314
Who's your colleague?

154
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,450
Dr. House.

155
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,118
Yes, Dr. Wilson.

156
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,926
I really don't need the consult.

157
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,589
I know the prognosis.

158
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,189
Apparently not.

159
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,635
Mr. McKenna, I can't
believe I'm able to say this,

160
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,972
but you're cancer-free.

161
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,910
The biopsy looked like
adenocarcinoma, but it wasn't.

162
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,846
Harmless lesions on
your lungs. You're fine.

163
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,145
I don't get it.

164
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,019
Cool. No, it's...

165
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,754
I know this must
come as a shock,

166
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,854
but I've
double-checked the labs.

167
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,798
I just accepted an
offer on my house.

168
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,432
I've had three goodbye parties.

169
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,131
I'm buying plane
tickets to Venice.

170
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,674
You can still use
those if you're alive.

171
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:39,042
I have to pay a $6,000 broker
commission on a house I'm not selling.

172
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,211
Money I don't have.

173
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,185
Thank you for letting me know.

174
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,925
I would have thought the living
would mean more than the expenses.

175
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,227
It's not about the money.

176
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,977
I have 17 points?

177
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,879
I started you all out on 100.

178
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,508
Then you blew up
part of the building.

179
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,882
Where's Foreman?

180
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,079
He got paged.

181
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,054
By who? Is it about our... Me.

182
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,523
I needed him right
away, somewhere else.

183
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,219
We're hiding from Foreman?

184
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,785
Foreman accused me of
playing games with patient care.

185
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,024
Who gets the eyeball next?

186
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,708
I haven't run my test yet.
It still might be a lung issue.

187
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,463
You can't run your test. The
patient had massive smoke inhalation.

188
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,595
Do a bronchoscopy, it'll
set off a laryngospasm.

189
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,948
I'll do an open-lung
biopsy instead.

190
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,100
You want an invasive surgery
because you screwed up?

191
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,733
The patient snuck a cigarette.

192
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,175
The patient is an addict.

193
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,521
It's not his fault he's jonesing

194
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,889
for whatever he
can get his hands on.

195
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,882
Not his fault he's jonesing?

196
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,349
In what universe does
that make any sense?

197
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,443
Get him on a nicotine patch.

198
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,751
That'll keep up
with his joneses.

199
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,313
Do your biopsy.

200
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,896
How's the new us's
final case going?

201
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,836
It's a moving target. House
keeps moving it, so I can't find it.

202
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,373
So, you decided to focus on
solving the problem in Darfur?

203
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,443
Taub is in there prepping
the patient for a biopsy.

204
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,347
Stay close to Taub, I
stay close to House.

205
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,983
And stay close to the game.

206
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,044
I'm trying to stop the game.

207
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,147
That's your role in the game.

208
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,419
Did you wander over
here to annoy me?

209
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,427
You're not wearing a lab coat.

210
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,258
House doesn't wear one, does he?

211
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,456
Damn!

212
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,141
Now when I walk
away, it's gonna look like

213
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,327
I have a reason other
than just annoyance.

214
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,466
He won't let us finish
prepping him for the biopsy.

215
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,031
Try the other arm.

216
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,340
The problem's not the
arm, it's the entire patient.

217
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,615
Hi.

218
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,958
He let you check his chest.

219
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,995
He let you do anything
except check that arm.

220
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,098
He wallpapered himself
with nicotine patches.

221
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,767
Real rebellion has a point, it's
not just juvenile and purposeless.

222
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,844
Maybe purposelessness
is my purpose.

223
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,577
Mission accomplished.

224
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,412
Amber, it's not the patches.

225
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,509
He's got blood clots
moving through his body.

226
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,350
Means I was wrong.

227
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,081
Oh!

228
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,859
If the clot reaches his
lungs or his heart, it'll kill him.

229
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,426
It's true!

230
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,801
We all know it's true.

231
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,066
You just wasted our time.

232
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,368
And what you're doing?

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,499
I'm not competing.

234
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,703
Where's Taub? Foreman
was following him.

235
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,870
So, you paged Taub.

236
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,971
Didn't see that I
had much choice.

237
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,778
He has schistocytes
on his blood smear

238
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,751
which means DIC's
causing the clotting.

239
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,150
What's causing the DIC?

240
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,155
Drug impurities.
You lost your round.

241
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,233
New symptom, new round.
This has to be drug related.

242
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,535
This is how doctors kill patients,
by seeing the stereotypes...

243
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,994
Drug addicts use
drugs is a stereotype?

244
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,997
Drugs are bad is a stereotype?

245
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,033
Losers lose is... Malaria.

246
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,499
He hasn't left the
country in years.

247
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,196
Malaria's relapsing-recurring.

248
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,947
For all we know, he could
have been sick for years.

249
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,430
It explains not just the DIC and
the bleeding, but the tiredness, fever,

250
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,874
everything we
attributed to drugs.

251
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,377
Oh, yeah. It's much more
likely that this ass punk rocker

252
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,506
was exposed to
malaria than drugs?

253
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,093
If you were always right, then
you wouldn't have just been wrong.

254
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,279
Or let the patient
mainline nicotine.

255
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,185
Or ravaged my anatomical model,

256
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,622
which Grandma House bought
me when I aced my MCATs.

257
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,388
A pharmaceutical rep
left that here on Tuesday.

258
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,792
Grandma does
some part-time work.

259
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,989
The rep was a 30-something babe.

260
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,295
Thank you. I got her hips.

261
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,732
Carry it with pride.

262
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,499
Manipulative bitch, you're
wanted in the loser's circle.

263
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,906
Why do you hate drug addicts?

264
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,045
Your situation is different.

265
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,242
You're taking a
necessary prescription...

266
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,343
I know. I'm fabulous.
And I'm not the patient.

267
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,259
I'm not allowed to have
a problem with junkies?

268
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,053
You're allowed. There's
gotta be a reason.

269
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,855
He's the patient. You don't
know him. Why do you hate him?

270
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,590
He's throwing his life away.

271
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,996
'Cause he's setting
his own terms,

272
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,762
not living in fear
of every pop quiz?

273
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,304
I thought we were
talking about him.

274
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,737
We were never talking about him.

275
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,369
Why are you afraid to lose?

276
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,104
Are you gonna fire me
because I like to win?

277
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,275
Just wanna know the reason.

278
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:51,180
I watched this football game
once, and I noticed something odd.

279
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,783
The winning team
was the happy one.

280
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,820
I did the math.

281
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,558
Our patient's happy.

282
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,655
He's an idiot.

283
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,462
He's a happy idiot.

284
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,500
That screws with your worldview.

285
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,535
There's something freeing
about being a loser, isn't there?

286
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,609
Why are you afraid to...

287
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,443
Mommy didn't love me enough.
Daddy expected too much from me.

288
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,206
Something.

289
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:23,255
Let's assume that's true. I get how
that can make me a screwed up person.

290
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,316
But how is my willingness to do
anything to get the right answer

291
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,157
bad for my patients?

292
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,995
Or put in terms you can
understand, how is it bad for you?

293
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,321
I didn't ask you to
pick up the meds.

294
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,489
I'm trying to be
a good colleague.

295
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,793
You're trying to
boost your score

296
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,214
by prescribing drugs for House.

297
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,593
Why else would you
have a second bag?

298
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,915
Didn't say good
colleague to you.

299
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,163
You realize we
still have a patient.

300
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,382
Don't care about the patient.

301
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,433
You care about this job more
than you care about his life?

302
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,334
I care about my wallpaper
more than I care about his life.

303
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,598
Okay. You're jerking me around.

304
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,104
There's no reason to be
a doctor if you don't care.

305
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,097
I care about life. I just
don't care about his.

306
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,495
He doesn't care, why should I?

307
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,692
My time is better spent...

308
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,735
Kissing up to your boss?

309
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,064
Average doctor cuts off a
patient 18 seconds into a history,

310
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,164
because that's all
the time he's got.

311
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,618
Meanwhile, six of us are
administering to a guy with a death wish.

312
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,008
So, why do you want the job?

313
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,241
Not because I'm maximizing
my service to mankind.

314
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,205
Good for you.

315
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,620
Where is he?

316
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,988
We're gonna spend the next hour

317
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,960
looking for a guy who
doesn't wanna be found.

318
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:45,098
Jimmy Quidd's
greatest stiff. 1989.

319
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,107
A profit-seeking
entity released this?

320
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,972
He put it out himself.

321
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,068
He wanted people to
listen, but apparently

322
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,739
didn't want people
to enjoy listening.

323
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,544
Now, why would
someone... Truly a mystery.

324
00:16:56,616 --> 00:17:00,053
Why would anyone do something
just to aggravate people?

325
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:06,987
Why would you have a
blank liability release form

326
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,790
plus your checkbook
on top of your desk?

327
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,524
Probably because they
were in the second drawer,

328
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,329
in a manila envelope,
under a book,

329
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,165
and you put them
on top of my desk.

330
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,898
You usually keep your
checkbook at home.

331
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,408
It's your go-to excuse for
why you can't lend me money.

332
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,645
You're gonna pay the guy
the six grand, aren't you?

333
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,274
There are other people I
write checks to. I do have cable.

334
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,148
There's no negligence
without injury.

335
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,279
I handed the guy
a death sentence.

336
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,152
He's not distressed
with the death sentence.

337
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,215
He's distressed
with the life sentence.

338
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,488
I gave him three
months of misery.

339
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,326
You gave him three months
of being someone special.

340
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,026
You're paying the guy
because he used to be boring,

341
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,819
and without you, he's
gonna be boring again.

342
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,037
Hi.

343
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,505
Results of the
malaria tests already?

344
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,837
Well, no.

345
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,346
But we were wondering if you'd sent
the patient for any additional tests?

346
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,515
You lost the patient.

347
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:12,552
Taub, you check lost and
found. Thirteen, come with me.

348
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,356
Why do you love drug addicts?

349
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,494
I won't pigeonhole the
patient, so that means I'm...

350
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,331
Perfectly capable of
drawing my own conclusions.

351
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,064
Are you capable of
answering a question?

352
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,748
I think there's more
to him than the drugs.

353
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,796
Admirable, why?

354
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,618
I need a reason for doing
something admirable?

355
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,735
There's always a reason.

356
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,521
He's a patient. You don't
know him. Why do you like him?

357
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,946
Alcoholic parent? Druggie youth?

358
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,949
There's no such thing
as a saint without a past.

359
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,176
Or a sinner without a future.

360
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,381
What makes you so sure that
drugs are a mask for something else?

361
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,253
Drugs are always a
mask for something else.

362
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,553
That's the dumbest
thing I've heard in my life.

363
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,141
You really want this job?

364
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,920
Why, you think you
can talk me into leaving?

365
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,254
You're a person
who likes her privacy,

366
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,118
working for a man who
needs to know everything.

367
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,172
You're a person who
cares about her patients,

368
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,912
working for a man
who cares about games.

369
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,919
I hear him.

370
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:21,789
Neither sleet, nor
mail, nor dread of night.

371
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,294
Hold on.

372
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,060
Malaria's not contagious.

373
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,693
Children, I bid you good night.

374
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,872
Which one of you guys
sapped my powers?

375
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,183
Was it you? Did
you take my powers?

376
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,785
Or maybe it was you.

377
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,051
Well, no matter. See, I'm
feeling stronger already.

378
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:59,024
It's okay. It's okay. He's okay.

379
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,862
Respiration's
good. Pulse is solid.

380
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,198
We need a lot of nurses in here!

381
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:24,079
Dr. Cuddy, the face that
launched a thousand long faces.

382
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,585
Get control of your patient.

383
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,685
Strap him to the
bed if you have to.

384
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,457
I wanna keep all four.

385
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,929
You can have two.

386
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,364
You don't get
negotiation, do you?

387
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,070
I say four, you say three. We
finally settle on three-and-a-half,

388
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,696
which would be
good news for Taub.

389
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,264
You don't want four.
You don't want three.

390
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,176
But if I say three, you get
to keep playing your game.

391
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,808
Who would you pick?

392
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,112
Are you asking my opinion?

393
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,278
If you have any absolute
truths, that would be even better.

394
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,015
You never want my advice.

395
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,490
You spend your life
trying to avoid my advice.

396
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,424
You're a bureaucratic nightmare,

397
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,019
you're a chronic
pain in the ass,

398
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,121
and you're a
second-rate doctor at best.

399
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,825
Am I blushing?

400
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,358
But you do know this stuff.

401
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,600
Can we get this over with?

402
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,304
Taub and Kutner.

403
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,473
Taub will stand up to you. You
won't like him, but you'll respect him.

404
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,078
Kutner shares your
philosophy of medicine.

405
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,053
God knows I don't
need two of you,

406
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,318
but he will actually help you.

407
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,953
It's not malaria, the
blood work is negative.

408
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,463
But we did find the reason for
the DIC. Bad blood fragments.

409
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,291
So if we can figure
out how they got there...

410
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,724
Blood exposure during sex?

411
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,216
Haemolysis from
the malaria meds?

412
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,108
Stop guessing, you'll
spoil the surprise.

413
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,788
If you're looking to get
information out of the guy,

414
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,509
he's not exactly the
bare-your-soul type.

415
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,646
Hey, I was wondering if you
guys know <i>Girl from Ipanema?</i>

416
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,549
What are you doing?
Nothing. What are you doing?

417
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,890
That's mine, man.

418
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,695
You're gonna be
denying that in a second.

419
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:22,264
Next time make sure you
bring enough for the whole class.

420
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,640
He's been sharing
needles with this guy.

421
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,150
Means he injected this guy's
blood, his own blood attacked it,

422
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,705
chewed it up, those were
the fragments we found.

423
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,011
So, DIC was nothing?

424
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,312
We're back to bloody vomit,

425
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,151
and his two dozen other
drug or non-drug symptoms.

426
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,686
Re-check everything.

427
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,694
Throw these guys out
and strap the patient down.

428
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,024
House!

429
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,795
Respiratory failure.

430
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,898
Good news for you, Thirteen.

431
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,733
'Cause that is
definitely not drugs.

432
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,259
<i>The blood clots
were drug related.</i>

433
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:08,277
Coughing up blood and the
respiratory arrests are still on the table.

434
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,354
Inhalants?

435
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,356
If I wanted or needed
your drug diagnosis,

436
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,943
I would have told
Foreman where we are.

437
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,858
He knows where we are.

438
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,962
'Cause he followed you!

439
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,727
I followed Taub. I followed her.

440
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,245
He had a bleeding problem.
That could cause respiratory arrest.

441
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,296
Again, if I wanted to forgive
his Drano drinking ways,

442
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:27,812
I wouldn't ignore
what you just said.

443
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,950
Could be an infection.

444
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,806
No, lumbar puncture's clear.

445
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,071
What lumbar puncture?

446
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,476
You didn't authorize that test.

447
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,741
True, and yet here I
am with the results.

448
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,578
Thirteen thought it
was bacterial meningitis.

449
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,346
And I had the eyeball.

450
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,613
It was a harmless test.

451
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,797
Patient's welfare still counts
for something, doesn't it?

452
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,982
Yep. Minus 50.

453
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:47,458
Chronic pulmonary embolisms
would explain the breathing problem

454
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,995
and the blood
coming from his lungs.

455
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,158
I'll run an ultrasound...
You're not running any tests.

456
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,078
He knows it's not PEs,
the guy's d-dimer's normal.

457
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,179
That doesn't always rule out...

458
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,502
You go in to run one test,
run eight more like she did,

459
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,270
find out which one's right, then
comes back with a brilliant guess.

460
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,834
Is this true? No.

461
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,313
That's too bad, 'cause that would
have earned you 40 points for cleverness.

462
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,850
Points go to Amber.
Foreman, you run the test.

463
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,716
Sure, anything I can
do to help your game.

464
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,756
He's not gonna run the
tests. No. I don't think so.

465
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,388
So, what's wrong with me?

466
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,295
You mean, besides your music?

467
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,233
Oh, sure. Just because I
don't play your kind of music,

468
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,034
it's not music, right?

469
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,167
Yeah, I resent you 'cause
you're not Perry Como.

470
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,739
Look I don't play for
an audience, okay?

471
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,980
Well, then, that stage you
stand on is an odd choice.

472
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,045
I just... I do it for me,
okay? I don't do it for you.

473
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,886
There are three
choices in this life.

474
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,153
Be good, get good or give up.

475
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,128
You've gone for column D. Why?

476
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,863
Simple answer is if you
don't try, you can't fail.

477
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,467
Are you really that simple?

478
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,878
Look, yeah, some
people, they like my music.

479
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,006
Most people can't stand it.

480
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,985
But they just sort of
just shrug and ignore me.

481
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:25,047
But a few, they feel
like they have to tell me

482
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,588
what I'm screwing up,
you know, what I'm wasting.

483
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,461
Why do they care?

484
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,373
You have some peculiar
masses near your heart.

485
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,840
Peculiar, how?

486
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,901
Well, unlike your music, they
elicit some emotional response.

487
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,314
That's odd.

488
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,809
You care if I
appreciate your music,

489
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,480
but you don't care
if you live or die.

490
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,490
Maybe the answer is that simple.

491
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:06,329
I can't apologize enough,
to you, to your family.

492
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,330
There may not be any
technical liability here but...

493
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,305
You're ripping it up
because you think

494
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,141
it would be wrong to
take money from me?

495
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,375
I think it would be wrong to
take so little money from you.

496
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,751
You're out $6,000...

497
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,343
You ruined my life.

498
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,252
I ruined three months.

499
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,868
For the first time in
my life, I was living

500
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:35,522
in the present, 'cause
that's all there was.

501
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:42,128
You're suing me, not for the wrong
diagnosis, but for the right one?

502
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,936
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

503
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,305
You gave me happiness,

504
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,536
and then you took it away.

505
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,717
Definitely no emboli.

506
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,948
It's pretty fuzzy.

507
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,490
Hey, for point and
shoot, I thought I did okay.

508
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,001
It's fuzzy 'cause
he was still shaking,

509
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,494
'cause he was coming
down from the heroin.

510
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,620
Where is everybody else?

511
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,631
Clinic's been quarantined.

512
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,327
Patient came in with
avian flu-like symptoms,

513
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,494
and 50 extra dollars
in spending money.

514
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,333
Can you do this echo again?

515
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,272
Okay, minus five
for ingratitude.

516
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,673
No "Thank you, Dr. House."

517
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,370
No "Here's a bottle of Codeine

518
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,003
"for your troubles,
Dr. House." Oh, no.

519
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,547
I was asking if you
could do it again

520
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,140
after giving him a
sedative to keep him still.

521
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,583
I could. We'd definitely
get the answer,

522
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,985
but since the opiates would
decrease his respiratory drive,

523
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,955
and he already
can barely breathe,

524
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,390
minus 10 for asking
me to kill the patient.

525
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,655
What if it's a
congenital defect,

526
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,663
an anomalous
vessel on his heart?

527
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,165
You know that the heart
does the blood stuff, right?

528
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,030
And the lungs do the breathing?

529
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,832
If the vessel wrapped
around his trachea.

530
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,715
What do you want me to do?

531
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:58,802
MRA.

532
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,004
So you can get a clear
picture of that vessel.

533
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,212
What? Wait, what? What? Why?

534
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,610
You said the picture sucked
because the patient was shaking.

535
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,882
MRA will be worse.

536
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,924
We have to get a picture.

537
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,628
You were doing better
before you had a good idea.

538
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,597
How can we see it if
we don't take a picture?

539
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,032
You can see me, right?

540
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,371
We wanna look at
his heart with our eyes.

541
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,570
So, I kill the patient
on my operating table,

542
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,406
you get to keep
testing your team,

543
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,639
and I take the heat from Cuddy.

544
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,553
If it goes that way,
yeah, that'd be excellent.

545
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,459
His respiratory status
is through the floor.

546
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,645
If there's a vessel and
we don't remove it fast,

547
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,915
best case, he's on
a ventilator for life.

548
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,219
Granted, it'll be a short one.

549
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,853
Who do you think I should hire?

550
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,962
You want me to tell
you in front of him?

551
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,897
Well, it'd be rude to
ask him to leave now.

552
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,699
If you don't do the
surgery, the patient will die.

553
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,647
You'll have had
nothing to do with it,

554
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,649
and everyone will know that
you had nothing to do with it.

555
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,471
And everyone will
know that it's because

556
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,511
you were pissed off
at House for firing you.

557
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,341
You know that's not
why I'm saying no.

558
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,314
Yeah, but that's not
how it's gonna play out.

559
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,982
Keep him and Amber.
You'll get stuff done.

560
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,785
Prep him for surgery.

561
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,290
This isn't an anomalous vessel.

562
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,324
Look at these lymph
nodes. Way too big.

563
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,925
They're the masses you saw.

564
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,826
70 over 40. He's crashing.

565
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,268
Two units of PRBCs.

566
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,806
Starting dopamine.
We're losing him!

567
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,734
So, how's your game going?

568
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,143
It's not whether
you win or lose.

569
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,153
Respiratory failure
and large lymph nodes.

570
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,451
Whatever this is, he's not
gonna be breathing much longer.

571
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,270
Does Foreman being here
means the game's over?

572
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,263
It means the patient's
life is almost over.

573
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,525
You can call it what you want.

574
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,794
We're done, people. Come on!

575
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,534
I need ideas. I don't
care who they come from.

576
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,233
Of course you do.
This is still a game.

577
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,286
You're still gonna reward whoever gets
the right idea, punish whoever's wrong.

578
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,870
Hire who you want.
Get this over with.

579
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,612
Thirteen, Kutner.

580
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,919
I'm sorry. Go home.

581
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,519
Why? It doesn't matter.

582
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,671
He just told me that I gotta...

583
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,129
Lungs are stiff, could be ARDS.

584
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,596
You fluid overloaded him.

585
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,656
Anyone's lungs would
leak after that surgery.

586
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,292
Goodbye. Anaphylactic shock.

587
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,495
No sign of bronchospasm.

588
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,646
What if the lymph
nodes are caused by

589
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,400
chronic stimulation
of his immune system?

590
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,749
Impurities in his
drugs could've...

591
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,484
Street drugs are laced
with all kinds of things.

592
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,068
An immune overreaction
would explain everything.

593
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,703
Drug diagnosis.

594
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,177
That's what you're going with?

595
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,288
That firing thing,
it was all a dream.

596
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,286
Go find where he gets his
drugs and what's in them.

597
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,697
And put him on dimercaprol
for heavy metal poisoning.

598
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,033
Competition works.

599
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,674
So, you're not gonna tell
me who sells you drugs?

600
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,146
What does it matter?

601
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,416
You're dying. Does that matter?

602
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,389
Not really.

603
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,126
I'm not an adult.

604
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,431
Never wanted to be.

605
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,736
So, if the choice

606
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,073
is running out the
clock with a walker,

607
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,571
and a bedpan...

608
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,683
You don't regret anything?

609
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,155
Well, there was a lot of drugs,

610
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:16,232
a lot of drinking,
a lot of fights.

611
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,035
I regret everything else.

612
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,984
You hate me, don't you?

613
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:37,982
Yeah.

614
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,016
I don't care.

615
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,857
What's it like?

616
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,467
It means you have no regrets.

617
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,590
Kind of sticks in
your head, doesn't it?

618
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,390
This guy's amazing.

619
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,821
There's not one redeeming note.

620
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,924
What sort of a
lawyer tells his client

621
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,526
he's got a case because
he's going to live?

622
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,663
I've heard that not all lawyers

623
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,900
are as ethical as the
ones we see on TV.

624
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,170
I don't think this guy
even has a law degree.

625
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,041
Well, the guys
on TV don't, either.

626
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,410
I think he has a medical degree.

627
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,751
It directly affects
my bottom line.

628
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,072
If you have less
money to lend...

629
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,156
I'm trying to take
responsibility.

630
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,591
And I'm trying to teach you
that everyone is out for theirs.

631
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:56,966
You might as well keep yours.

632
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,765
And lend it to you?

633
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,299
You have to control everything.

634
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,036
How come you're going around
asking everyone who you should fire?

635
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,873
I'm asking for input!

636
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,936
I thought you would
have admired the humility.

637
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,346
You like games because
you can control them.

638
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,592
God, I'm gonna put
the record back on.

639
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,450
You like what's interesting,
never mind if it's real or good.

640
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,681
You wanna know why you
offered that guy six grand?

641
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,088
Life just happens, and that
scares the hell out of you.

642
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,716
You think you can cure pain.

643
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,124
You think you can avoid pain.

644
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,094
You think you're
responsible for every failure,

645
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,223
every patient's boring life,
every friend's screwed-up...

646
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:30,360
You don't wanna face it
anymore than my patient does.

647
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,030
Dying's easy. Living's hard.

648
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,403
That can't possibly be
as poignant as it sounded.

649
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,728
Still can't find
the drug source,

650
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,160
but I don't think
that's the problem.

651
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,618
The dimercaprol isn't working,

652
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,918
and Quidd volunteers at a
home for abandoned kids.

653
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,184
Why are you telling me this?

654
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,555
Because his bass player told me.

655
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,820
Is it medically relevant?

656
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:55,917
I don't know.

657
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:59,761
Well, then, why are you... Stop
playing games and do your job.

658
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,032
No.

659
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:18,478
This time I'm firing
Taub and Amber.

660
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,982
This is a joke, right?

661
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,353
It's only a joke if you
come up with the answer.

662
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,858
It's not really
funny if you don't.

663
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,457
Thirteen and Kutner,
you're fired, too.

664
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,656
Foreman? He's a druggie.

665
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:38,169
I was never sure there was
a disease in the first place.

666
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,967
So, all we know
is that he's dying.

667
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,169
Who wants to tell the patient?

668
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,870
Fine, I'll get some
kid to go talk to him.

669
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,973
It's the only people he
gets along with anyway.

670
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,312
Are we still fired?

671
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,182
He works with abandoned kids.

672
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,226
Is it medically relevant?

673
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,026
I think so.

674
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,030
I need a brain biopsy.

675
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,992
For the patient.

676
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,198
You two switch.

677
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,240
You wanna drill into
the skull of a patient

678
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,401
who almost died on the
operating table yesterday?

679
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,915
Why are they here?

680
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,578
Because I wouldn't have gotten
the answer without each of them.

681
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,621
You could have just told me.

682
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,247
I want you to feel guilty.

683
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,223
She thinks the
patient's a loser.

684
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,884
She thinks the
patient's a winner,

685
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,758
just a regular guy
with a regular problem.

686
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,424
He thinks he's gonna be
great once he's all grown up,

687
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,798
and he thinks...
What did you think?

688
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,461
Autoimmune. Right.

689
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,199
Less interesting
but just as important.

690
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:48,399
We can't all be right.

691
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,101
You're all wrong.

692
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,804
My mom always said that
two wrongs don't make a right.

693
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,472
She never said anything
about four wrongs.

694
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,539
I always found that suspicious.

695
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,880
Plain old measles,
constant exposure from

696
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,817
hanging out with
Oliver Twist and his lot.

697
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,878
I assume he's been vaccinated.

698
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,119
Patient's immune system was
shredded with years of drugs.

699
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,252
Early markers of rash and fever

700
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,795
would have been
lost on a druggie.

701
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,125
His immune system overreacted,

702
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,632
which is why his
body went haywire.

703
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,891
That's clever.

704
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,239
You're not doing a biopsy
without neurological symptoms.

705
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,970
If I'm right, the
virus is in his brain.

706
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,069
Wrong course of treatment
could be his last course.

707
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,341
I need a neurological...

708
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,882
He kept swallowing.

709
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,441
Could be neurological, could
be a complex partial seizure.

710
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,384
What did it look like?

711
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,489
Good God, woman, how
much more proof do you need?

712
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,829
If you can induce a seizure,
you can have your biopsy.

713
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,764
Hoes, hup!

714
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,213
<i>We're gonna use flashing lights.</i>

715
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,264
Noxious stimulation,
it'll irritate your brain.

716
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,550
If there's damage
to your neurons,

717
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:59,043
it'll trigger a seizure.
That way we can...

718
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,477
I got something
much more noxious.

719
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:09,183
It's not as commonly used, but
sound can be just as big an irritant.

720
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,261
Now remind me of
your influences here!

721
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,425
'Cause I'm gonna
say Thelonious Monk

722
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,301
and the sound a trash compactor
makes when you crawl inside it.

723
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,639
I don't do it for
you. I do it for me.

724
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,244
What do you think? Is
he seizing or dancing?

725
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,619
Seizing.

726
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,681
Play him the B
side, it's even worse.

727
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,057
Schedule an OR for the biopsy.

728
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,289
See you in the lecture hall.

729
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:23,083
A little mood music,
build the suspense.

730
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,157
Sounds more folky.

731
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:29,898
You seriously have no idea
when to shut up, do you?

732
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,964
Amber, please stand.

733
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,567
You didn't call me
bitch. Is that bad?

734
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,613
You played the game better
than anybody else here,

735
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,719
but for the wrong reasons.

736
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,845
Reasons don't matter.
Results are the only thing...

737
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,412
You were wrong.

738
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,125
Twenty years ago, this was
recorded by Jim Moskowitz,

739
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,361
who later became
known as Jimmy Quidd.

740
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,170
Loves kids, apparently has
a heart, perhaps even a soul.

741
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,136
If you're gonna work for me,

742
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,911
you have to be willing to
be wrong, willing to lose.

743
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,349
Because you just did.

744
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,345
You're fired.

745
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,097
Thirteen, please stand.

746
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,797
You're fired.

747
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,804
You just said I
was right about...

748
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,712
He was a drug addict.

749
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,448
Four applicants, two spots.

750
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,952
If I had three, I'd keep you.

751
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,297
Game over.

752
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,032
You're gonna have
to grow old after all.

753
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,754
You've got measles. We're
blasting you with corticosteroids.

754
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,327
What's wrong with you?

755
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:41,832
I got fired.

756
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,634
Well, what are you doing here?

757
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,302
Trying not to care.

758
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,072
Yeah?

759
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,273
That's not easy.

760
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,813
What the hell did you do?

761
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,485
You told me to hire
Kutner and Taub.

762
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,925
Because I knew you wouldn't.

763
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:10,994
Oops.

764
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,792
I can't let you hire two men.

765
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,957
Now, that is sexist.

766
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,500
You've already got Foreman.

767
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,693
Is he a dude?

768
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,498
Hire a woman, too.

769
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,730
Hire two women?

770
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:23,263
You can have the one that
gives a crap about people.

771
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,870
They both do. Right.

772
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,403
Hire Thirteen.

773
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,251
This was your plan all along.

774
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:49,199
Well, at least the
games are over.

775
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,561
How long have you known me?
