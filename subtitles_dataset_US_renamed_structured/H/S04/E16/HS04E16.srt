1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,095
<i>Previously on</i> House.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,346
<i>I don't know how I got here.</i>

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,430
<i>I saw a symptom
before the crash.</i>

4
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:06,734
Why was I taking a bus?

5
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,241
<i>Medical hypnosis can bring
the brain to a Class 2 Theta state.</i>

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,210
You're taxing an
already injured brain.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,612
Someone's dying
because I can't remember...

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,743
It was Amber.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,113
She was on the bus with me.

10
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,447
She's the one who's dying.

11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,717
Her heart won't stop racing.
No idea what's causing it.

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,783
Sure it wasn't the bus
that landed on her?

13
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:27,826
It's not trauma.

14
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,330
She was stable post-op. This
didn't start until an hour ago.

15
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,866
My God. HOUSE: Delayed
reaction to the trauma.

16
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,733
She lost both kidneys
in the bus crash,

17
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,168
ripped up her femoral artery.

18
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,468
We fixed the artery, got her
on dialysis for the kidneys.

19
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,918
Whatever's doing this to her
heart, it isn't from the crash.

20
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,182
Check her potassium? Of course.

21
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,371
Why didn't you call me?

22
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,675
She's been under the
whole time. She had no ID.

23
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,375
Pushed adenosine? And verapamil.

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,939
And floated a Swan an hour ago.

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,416
Coronary angiography?

26
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,953
Three critical
patients ahead of her.

27
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,421
We'll have her
in within the hour.

28
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,089
We're fifteen minutes away from
Princeton-Plainsboro by ambulance.

29
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,252
You want to move her?
Her heart rate is 130.

30
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,319
She's hemodynamically
stable. We're moving her.

31
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,796
You're not her doctor, you
can't make that decision.

32
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,796
Her husband can.

33
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,063
Right?

34
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,268
Move her.

35
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,621
If the trauma didn't
damage her heart...

36
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,943
Why was she on the bus?

37
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,140
I don't know.

38
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,625
If she had any
underlying condition,

39
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,160
the accident could
have exacerbated it.

40
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,277
Why were you with her?

41
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,376
I don't know.

42
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,354
I'm not hiding anything,
I just don't remember.

43
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,014
What else could
damage her heart?

44
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,450
Wilson. Don't get lost.

45
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,019
I'm barely coherent. I
need your help right now.

46
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,627
V-fib.

47
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,796
Charging.

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,031
Okay. Okay.

49
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,502
Clear! Wait. Wait! Wait!

50
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,133
Protective hypothermia.

51
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,269
You want to freeze her?
Her heart's not beating.

52
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,678
Her heart's already damaged.

53
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,100
You restart it,
it'll keep racing,

54
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,117
shoot off free radicals
and kill her brain.

55
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,780
We ice her down, put her on
bypass until you've diagnosed her.

56
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,155
This is not a solution. All
you're doing is pressing pause.

57
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,660
It gives you more time
to find the diagnosis.

58
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,196
House. This is Amber.

59
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,394
Please.

60
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,571
Cold saline solution.

61
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,541
Core temperature down to 90.

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,878
Bypass circulating.

63
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,819
She's stable.

64
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,193
Why are we doing this?

65
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,391
Bought us time to think.

66
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,874
The trauma must have stimulated
a pre-existing heart condition.

67
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,707
Auto-immune, congenital anomaly,

68
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,713
blood-clotting disorder,
lead poisoning...

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,804
Could be anything.

70
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,577
Great. Let's explore that.

71
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,015
Quick, get her on panacea.

72
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,747
We can narrow it down by
looking for arterial blockages.

73
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,516
How? On an echo?

74
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,200
Can't see wall motion
when there's no motion.

75
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,591
EKG? Nope, heart's
in the off position.

76
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,525
Thallium uptake scan?
Useless on a cold heart.

77
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,564
Yeah, we get it. Her
heart's not beating.

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,941
It's gonna make it
harder to diagnose.

79
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,510
On the other hand, she's not gonna
die while you're whining about it.

80
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,534
What else?

81
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,571
There is another
way to narrow it down.

82
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,607
If you really did see a symptom
in Amber before the crash,

83
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,575
physostigmine helped
your memory last time.

84
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,579
Why not cyanide? He's a
mess, he needs to sleep.

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,848
I had a heart
attack this morning.

86
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,543
I can't do any more
drugs till lunch.

87
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,382
Get her an angiogram. It could
show damage even in a stopped heart.

88
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,944
Rest of you, search
her apartment.

89
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,922
Toxins, heavy metals, drugs...

90
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,323
Anything that might
make her heart race.

91
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,956
I need to know if there's
anything medically relevant

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,846
that you couldn't
share publicly.

93
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,617
Is this a Philanderers
Anonymous intervention?

94
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,279
You were obviously
drinking last night.

95
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,289
Maybe you took Amber to a bar?

96
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,450
I left here on my
motorcycle. Alone.

97
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,085
You ended up drunk
on a bus. Together.

98
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,963
Maybe you met Amber in the bar?

99
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,862
I was not having
an affair with her.

100
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,265
You can't really say that
if you don't remember.

101
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,326
I lost four hours,
not four months.

102
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,497
Maybe it was the first time.

103
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,336
If you drank together, any
chance you did any drugs?

104
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,949
I'll run a tox screen.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,525
You coming?

106
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,802
Correspondence.
Letters to patients.

107
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,898
She could have caught
something from one of them.

108
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,000
Copy it to a thumb
drive. Let's get out of here.

109
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:19,103
Travel. Do you know if she's
been out of the country recently?

110
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,308
It's just video clips. Maybe
she narrates where they are.

111
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,083
<i>And action!</i>

112
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,345
Looks like she
didn't travel very far.

113
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,487
<i>You look beautiful.
You look nervous.</i>

114
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,856
<i>I've never done this before.</i>

115
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,361
<i>I have. Trust
me. You'll love it.</i>

116
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,394
Hey. Not even close to relevant.

117
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,287
As long as we don't
know what's wrong,

118
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,677
we don't know what's relevant.

119
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,716
Yeah, maybe they're having
sex on a pile of asbestos.

120
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,114
Go watch it.

121
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,227
If we were in a
stranger's house,

122
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,378
you'd be watching the video.

123
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,944
You altered your behavior
because you're friends with her.

124
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,816
Are you okay?

125
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,791
We shouldn't be
treating her at all.

126
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,422
I'm gonna search her bathroom.

127
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,617
Are you okay?

128
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,158
Can't really say "yes" when
it's a hallucination asking.

129
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,423
Don't worry, you're
just dreaming.

130
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,461
What symptom did I see in you?

131
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,133
A myoclonic jerk. Boring.

132
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,738
An incredibly rare
neurological symptom is boring?

133
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,776
Am I in someone
else's subconscious?

134
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,074
What did we do last night?

135
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,286
Was I meeting you for a drink?

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,692
Is that all it was?

137
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,031
A man thinks a
woman is beautiful,

138
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,167
admires her intelligence,

139
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,833
admires the way she has
to get whatever she wants.

140
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,937
The things he
likes about himself.

141
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:39,184
And maybe she always
had a little thing for him.

142
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,821
His mind, his blue eyes.

143
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,360
But someone gets between them.

144
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,495
So they decide to meet one night

145
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,693
at an out-of-the-way
little bar...

146
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,403
Does that sound familiar?

147
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,075
Do I feel familiar?

148
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,248
What do you feel?

149
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,746
Electricity.

150
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,291
Electricity.

151
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,126
I know I saw the symptom.

152
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,359
I know the memory is locked in
my brain, now I know how to get it.

153
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,794
No.

154
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,747
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

155
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,364
You need to rest.

156
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,434
I have yet to hear about any
study linking electricity and rest.

157
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,239
Deep brain stimulation.

158
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,312
It's been proven.

159
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,546
Electrical impulses applied
directly to the hypothalamus

160
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,709
can evoke detailed memories.

161
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,910
My mistake.

162
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,984
Drilling a hole

163
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,456
and shooting lightning bolts into an
already cracked skull is very restful.

164
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,956
It's not fatal at all.

165
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,083
She's right. You need to sleep.

166
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,726
Brain activity spiked.

167
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,426
Amber?

168
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,958
Amber? It's me.

169
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,034
Random spikes are common.

170
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,264
Shut up.

171
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,074
It's gonna be okay.

172
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,676
I'm here with you.

173
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,914
The team has found something.

174
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,344
Can you ask her if
we can be excused?

175
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,517
What?

176
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,089
The coronary angio was negative.

177
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,633
So was the tox screen.

178
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,962
That's what you
found? Negative tests?

179
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,368
I could have told you
she doesn't do drugs.

180
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,634
I found these in her
apartment. Sorry.

181
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,941
Prescription diet pills,
SSRIs, amphetamines.

182
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,880
Diet pills cause structural
damage to the mitral valve,

183
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,507
could explain the tachycardia.

184
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,985
She'd have to be an addict to take enough
for her to damage her heart. I'd know.

185
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,352
Did you know she was
hiding them in her vitamins?

186
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,688
We have to warm her back up, get her
heart beating so we can do a CT to confirm.

187
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,384
No. We've been over this.

188
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,239
Starting her heart could
cause brain damage,

189
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,664
could burn out the heart muscle.

190
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,697
Test her heart
without starting it.

191
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,630
Crack her chest open. Reach a
finger inside the pulmonary vein,

192
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,331
run it across the valve.

193
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,237
That's the safer course?

194
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,468
It is if we're wrong.

195
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,636
When did we start
assuming we're wrong?

196
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,759
If this were any
other patient...

197
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,078
If the valve is calcified,
that's our answer,

198
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,845
that's our cure. Go.

199
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,551
Thirteen.

200
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,958
Who found the diet pills?

201
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,224
Kutner.

202
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,199
You didn't even go in
the bathroom, did you?

203
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,132
You're suddenly mute
in the differentials.

204
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,101
A blow-up doll
would be more useful.

205
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,348
And yes, that's the first time

206
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,308
I've ever implied something
negative about a blow-up doll.

207
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,737
It's Amber. I don't...

208
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,930
Normally, I'd be fascinated.

209
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,479
Today, don't care.

210
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,141
Get over whatever
it is and do your job.

211
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,495
Wait. Look at her eye.

212
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,734
She's jaundiced.

213
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:16,997
Her liver's not working.

214
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,096
Diet pills don't kill the liver.

215
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,031
Put her back in ICU.

216
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,190
Liver failure means whatever
this thing is, it's spreading.

217
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,580
Despite the fact
that she's frozen.

218
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,617
Hepatic and heart failure could
mean anti-trypsinase deficiency.

219
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,551
We can stick a
needle in her liver.

220
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,919
We see fibrosis, she's right.

221
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,457
Does Amber drink sherry?

222
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,384
Nocardia fits just as well,

223
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,053
but there's no way we can tell,

224
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,721
since we can't take
her temperature.

225
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,823
I had a dream she
was pouring me a glass.

226
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,097
And since I'm a scotch,
beer, gin and rum man...

227
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,401
If we warm her back up, we should
be able to tell if she's got an infection.

228
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,941
Yes, we can get a diagnosis

229
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,944
by letting the disease run
rampant until it kills her.

230
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,412
If it's spreading, we need
to slow this even more.

231
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,574
We've got to cool
her down further.

232
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,979
I know you love her and
you're scared she's going to die.

233
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,083
But just making her colder
and colder isn't a cure.

234
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,686
It's not dealing
with the reality.

235
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,458
Sherry means something.

236
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,228
Amber doesn't even drink sherry.

237
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,270
House, can we get back to...

238
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,170
If she did drink sherry, it would
mean nothing, but since she doesn't,

239
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,764
my subconscious is obviously
trying to make some other point.

240
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,774
There's a Sharrie's Bar on
Third, right off the bus route.

241
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,446
Wilson's right. We
need to make her colder.

242
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,921
Putting more ice on her is
just delaying the diagnosis.

243
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,291
Not on, in. Fill her
lungs with slurry.

244
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,454
Where are you going?

245
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,157
Taking Wilson out for a drink.

246
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,635
Is this the place?

247
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,709
Maybe.

248
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:09,711
Hey. I assume you
are here for these.

249
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,954
Did you see me here
with a tall, blonde woman?

250
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,789
Yeah, I think she joined you
after scotch number seven.

251
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,187
Did she seem sick?

252
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,660
She sneezed.

253
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,494
I gave her a napkin.

254
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,055
Did you see the
color of the sputum?

255
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,862
I assume sputum means snot.

256
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,193
Look, I see lots of
drunk chicks in here.

257
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,967
I didn't have time to stop and analyze
the color of your girlfriend's boogers.

258
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,906
She's not my girlfriend, genius.

259
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,443
She was hot, you seemed into her

260
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,070
and she bought you drinks.

261
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,011
Last night, she
was your girlfriend.

262
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,754
Blood in her sputum. It could
mean parasites. Any recent travel?

263
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,759
You seemed into her?

264
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,091
If he had a brain, he
wouldn't be tending bar.

265
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,962
Sneezing's a new symptom.

266
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,522
Let's assume the runny
nose means an infection.

267
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,328
What did House have to say?

268
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,430
He told me I was
raised by wolves,

269
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,202
and that's why I use the same
hand for my fork and knife.

270
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:10,800
Whoa.

271
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,039
Not that one. The slurry tube.

272
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,277
I know this is
different. But it's not.

273
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,247
Everyone dies.

274
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,216
She's not dead.

275
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,355
You're reacting this way
because she might be soon.

276
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,555
Yeah. I am. Why aren't you?

277
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,265
I'm an Indian guy named Kutner.

278
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,091
Ever wonder what
happened to my parents?

279
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,431
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I was six years old.

280
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,234
I used to like helping out in
my parent's store after school.

281
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,041
A guy walks in to rob the place,

282
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,576
ends up shooting them both.

283
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,804
Wasn't fair.

284
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,248
Took years, but I had to
accept that's just the way it was.

285
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,609
So, you gonna help me
fill her lungs up, or not?

286
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:09,592
Tell me the liver biopsy showed
infiltrates, minor inflammation.

287
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,170
Yeah. How...

288
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,399
Snot on a napkin.

289
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,407
Add the heart,
the infiltrates...

290
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,636
Hep B.

291
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,641
Start her on IV interferon.
I'll go tell Wilson.

292
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,839
Good idea.

293
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,543
And I'll go nap, because I
was concussed last night

294
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,245
and had a heart
attack this morning.

295
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,288
I'll tell Wilson. You go sleep.

296
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,568
Hepatitis B is a lame diagnosis.

297
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,840
Oh, God, I get less
rest when I'm asleep.

298
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,482
I rise from the dead
and that's reaction I get?

299
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,744
I'm sorry. If I had known,

300
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,117
I would have started a
breakaway Jewish sect.

301
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,450
Hep B fits.

302
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,885
Why are you doing that?

303
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,950
Because Hep B doesn't fit.

304
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,863
Turn her over.

305
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,287
We're about to start her
second course of interferon.

306
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,107
Which she might not need
once you turn her over.

307
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,952
The small of her back.

308
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,249
She's bruised. Why
is that significant?

309
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,723
Look closer.

310
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,619
A rash.

311
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,026
How'd you know what was
on the small of her back?

312
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,690
Well, either I'm still asleep,
or I'm starting to remember.

313
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,871
Looks like an influenza rash.

314
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,937
The flu wouldn't be killing
the organs one by one.

315
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,345
Dermatomyositis.

316
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,780
Wouldn't speed up her heart.

317
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,511
Maybe it's an allergic
reaction to the interferon?

318
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,579
Yes, the symptom I saw on the
bus was a rare interferon allergy

319
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,749
that flares up two
days before you take it.

320
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,291
How'd you see the
rash down there?

321
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,922
I don't know. Maybe
she leaned over.

322
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,263
Maybe it's not a rash at
all. Could be an abscess.

323
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,821
Thirteen, stick a
needle in there.

324
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,149
If there's pus, Foreman's right.

325
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,569
Ultrasound is safer.

326
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,850
I'm not asking you to stick a
needle all the way through her.

327
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,775
Taub, you do it.
No. Wait, I can do it.

328
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,845
No, apparently, you can't.

329
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,052
It's not fluctuant.

330
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,191
Clear, it's not pus.

331
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,726
Means it's vesicular.

332
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,028
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

333
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,223
We had dinner with a friend
last week. We walked their dogs.

334
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,701
I guess she
could've gotten a tick.

335
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,635
It's treatable, doxycycline.

336
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,230
Allow eight hours for the
antibiotics to take effect,

337
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,299
then we warm her
up, shock her heart.

338
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,638
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

339
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,755
If we're wrong, restarting
her heart could kill her.

340
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,179
Run blood cultures first.

341
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,738
Fastest way to test is to treat.

342
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,444
If we're wrong, still should give
us time to try something else.

343
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,682
We are not starting her
heart until we're 100% certain.

344
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,850
We're never 100% certain.

345
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,830
Run the blood cultures.

346
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,299
After we get confirmation,
we'll restart her heart.

347
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,867
He's wrong. And
you know he's wrong.

348
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,272
You can't change your mind just
because a family member starts crying.

349
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,604
They're always scared.

350
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,272
I said run the blood cultures.

351
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,495
Sorry. Wide stance.

352
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,629
You're right.

353
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,004
I'm screwing up.

354
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,574
Why are you screwing up?

355
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,041
I didn't even like her.

356
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,509
Did you hate her?

357
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,011
Not enough to want her dead.

358
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,947
So it's not guilt.
That just leaves fear.

359
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,548
A young woman dying.

360
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,986
A young doctor dying, in
fact. That sound familiar?

361
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,553
Yeah, I'm at risk
for Huntington's.

362
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,989
I've dealt with it.

363
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,589
By not getting tested.

364
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,332
Dealing with it by
not dealing with it.

365
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,768
It's clearly
working beautifully.

366
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,363
You're the champion of not
dealing with your problems.

367
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,499
My grandson gave me
a mug that says that.

368
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,645
Okay. Enough hand-holding.

369
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,805
Deal with it, get back in
there, or pack up your stuff.

370
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,475
You're screwing up this
case worse than I am.

371
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,676
House is gonna kill the patient.

372
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,485
What are you...
What are you doing?

373
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,520
She's up to 80 degrees.

374
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,925
We're gonna restart her heart.

375
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,028
No, you're not.

376
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,530
There's still time to undo
this. Cool her back down.

377
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,009
You weren't taking
the safe approach.

378
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,025
We've got to know if the
antibiotics are working.

379
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,694
Her EEG's slowed.

380
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,732
Amber.

381
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,334
Amber.

382
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,370
Well done.

383
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,556
We still don't know what it is,

384
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,446
but you've just let it
spread to her brain!

385
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,358
This is exactly what I said would
happen. It's in her brain now.

386
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,399
The brain involvement
gives us a new symptom.

387
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,187
That wouldn't be
there if you hadn't...

388
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,658
It's where the
disease was going.

389
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,726
We needed to know that.

390
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,154
This was not your
decision to make!

391
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,323
You went behind my back.
You went behind House's back.

392
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,865
Inside voices.

393
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,298
House wanted to warm her up.

394
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,337
You just guilted him
into changing his mind.

395
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,270
Heart, liver, rash
and now her brain.

396
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,938
Auto-immune fits best.
Crash trauma could've set it off.

397
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,210
Start her on prednisone,
then we'll warm her up again.

398
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,684
House, if this is
some other infection,

399
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,688
the steroids will trash
her immune system.

400
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,025
He's the attending.
You're the family.

401
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,030
Go spend more
time with the patient.

402
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,740
You can't do this.

403
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,143
That's not a good argument.

404
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,042
It's not an argument
at all. I'm sorry.

405
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:04,303
Cuddy's right. I was
afraid to do anything.

406
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,074
I thought if everything just
stopped, it would be okay.

407
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,275
And it's gonna be.

408
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,127
Taub's starting treatment,
we're doing everything...

409
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,312
Not everything.

410
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,484
Before you warm her up...

411
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,960
You said you wanted to
try deep brain stimulation.

412
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,256
But there's no reason.

413
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,906
We know the symptom.
We know what I saw.

414
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,091
What if it's not the rash?

415
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,361
What if you saw the
rash in the ambulance,

416
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,993
or when we were
putting her on bypass?

417
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,971
What if there is still something
else stuck inside your head?

418
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,682
You think I should risk
my life to save Amber's.

419
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,650
I'm inserting the IPG probe
into your ventral hypothalamus.

420
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,016
Give me 3 volts.

421
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,058
<i>- I can't hear him.
- Can't hear who?</i>

422
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,097
Everything's in black and white.

423
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,932
Who was talking? Is Amber there?

424
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,440
You're supposed to be jolting
my hypothalamus. Not petting it.

425
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,702
We don't want to overload it.

426
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:44,953
As long as I'm risking my life,

427
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,707
I might as well be
watching a talkie.

428
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,041
Increasing from 3 to 5 volts.

429
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,052
Sending impulse.

430
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,057
You're not getting them back.

431
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,962
Hey! You take my keys, you
gotta give me a phone call.

432
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,411
Who are you calling?

433
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,783
Dial-a-Wilson.

434
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,258
I was on call.

435
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:42,229
Amber was home.

436
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:46,497
I told her to find you,
have you pick me up.

437
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,591
I said to find Wilson.

438
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,750
He's working.

439
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,351
And I'm willing to suffer
this indignity on his behalf.

440
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,659
Does she seem sick?

441
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,359
Not yet.

442
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,593
Come on, time to go.

443
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:21,607
Need another round and a drink for
what passes for a lady around here.

444
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,503
What's your poison?
Nothing. We're leaving.

445
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,274
We're leaving, leaving,
leaving. Cosmos.

446
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,006
I remember Wilson
buying cranberry juice.

447
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,146
I'll have another, and
she'll have a Cosmopolitan.

448
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,347
The obstinate drunk
thing is not flattering.

449
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,787
Come on, you called for a ride.

450
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,854
Drink your drink, or
I'll drink them both.

451
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:48,657
One, and you leave voluntarily.

452
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,775
Let's go.

453
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,971
Hey! Need another Cosmo, here.

454
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,677
She sneezed.

455
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,674
What color is it?

456
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,479
Thanks.

457
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,424
Looks like snot.
Seems like a cold.

458
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,831
Nothing else?

459
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,561
No.

460
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,239
Where are you going?

461
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,712
You think I paid?

462
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,443
House, what are you
doing? You can barely walk.

463
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,044
Go home. I'll take the bus.

464
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,680
Hey, someone's
gotta pay for this.

465
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,123
Hi.

466
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,128
You forgot something.

467
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,637
Boy, you don't give up, do you?

468
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,640
Yeah, I'm an idiot that way.

469
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,435
You doing this for
me, or for Wilson?

470
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,876
For Wilson.

471
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,382
Well, then, it's even
more impressive.

472
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,786
Damn. Do you have a Kleenex?

473
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,222
I got a sleeve.

474
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,782
I got two, actually.

475
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,294
Gonna need more than
that. I'm getting that nasty flu.

476
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,929
Is that it? The flu? Is there
any rare complication?

477
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,173
No. It'll explain the
rash, but nothing else.

478
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,105
Unless...

479
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,940
What?

480
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,158
Don't do it.

481
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,964
It wasn't the flu.

482
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:09,503
It's what she did for it. She
has amantadine poisoning.

483
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,804
The crash destroyed her kidneys,

484
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,471
her body couldn't
filter the drugs,

485
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,108
she ODs on amantadine,
explains the heart, the liver...

486
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,779
We just need to start on her
dialysis and flush the drugs out.

487
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,688
What? What's wrong?

488
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,456
Amantadine binds with proteins.

489
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,056
Dialysis can't clear
it out of the blood.

490
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,899
There's nothing we can do.

491
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,077
I'm so sorry.

492
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:56,848
Amber.

493
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,388
Amber.

494
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,195
He's seizing. Wilson!
I need help, here.

495
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,541
House suffered a
complex partial seizure.

496
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:21,541
The violent shaking widened his
skull fracture, causing a brain bleed.

497
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,138
<i>We won't know if there's
any cognitive impairment</i>

498
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,684
<i>until he's out of the coma.</i>

499
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,853
<i>He was right about
the amantadine.</i>

500
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,990
<i>Amber's body
couldn't filter it out.</i>

501
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,819
<i>That's what caused her heart
to beat too fast for too long.</i>

502
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,726
<i>It caused irreparable
structural damage.</i>

503
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,027
<i>Didn't matter if they
shocked her or froze her or...</i>

504
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,468
<i>Her heart was dead once it
stopped in that ambulance.</i>

505
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,498
What about a new
heart? Transplant?

506
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,805
All of her organs are
damaged. She can't qualify.

507
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,576
There's nothing we can do.
Nothing we could have done.

508
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,723
We should call time of death.

509
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,791
Technically, she's still alive.

510
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,598
Could probably survive a
few more hours on bypass.

511
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,565
We could wean her off
anesthesia. Wake her up.

512
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,674
Give you a chance to...

513
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,540
It'd be cruel. Don't...

514
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,914
Wake Amber up. See her again.

515
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,609
Tell her what she means to you.

516
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,780
Wake her up to
tell her that she's...

517
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,790
You are waking her up so that you
can both say goodbye to each other.

518
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,399
She would want it.

519
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,382
Hey.

520
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,514
Hey.

521
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,492
You're in the hospital.

522
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,657
I'm on bypass.

523
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,127
Yeah.

524
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,735
Do you remember what happened?

525
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,502
I got on the bus.

526
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,119
I shouldn't have
gotten on the bus.

527
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,882
No. No. It's not your fault.

528
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,519
It's not your fault.

529
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,786
How bad?

530
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:27,494
You had tachycardia, complicated
by complete renal failure.

531
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:36,040
The tachycardia degenerated
into V-fib, followed by hepatic failure.

532
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,720
The flu pills...

533
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,087
Yeah.

534
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm dead.

535
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,566
I love you.

536
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,077
I love you, too.

537
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,423
We should say goodbye.

538
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,760
She didn't even like us.

539
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,923
We liked her.

540
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,061
Did we?

541
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,397
We do now.

542
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,995
What do we say?

543
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,268
We don't need to say anything.

544
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,682
I'm tired.

545
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,556
I think it's time
to go to sleep.

546
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,486
Just a little longer.

547
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:44,826
We're always gonna
want just a little longer.

548
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:49,998
I don't think I can do it.

549
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:56,840
It's okay.

550
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:57,939
It's not okay.

551
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,248
Why is it okay with you?
Why aren't you angry?

552
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:09,920
That's not the last feeling

553
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,157
I want to experience.

554
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,284
BP stable.

555
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,518
Still non-responsive.

556
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,589
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

557
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,820
Heart rate's normal.

558
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:21,631
<i>Respiratory rate is...</i>

559
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,145
You're dead.

560
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,384
Everybody dies.

561
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,249
Am I dead?

562
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,589
Not yet.

563
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,289
I should be.

564
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Why?

565
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,800
Because life
shouldn't be random.

566
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:03,435
Because lonely, misanthropic drug
addicts should die in bus crashes,

567
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:07,172
and young do-gooders in love who
get dragged out of their apartment

568
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,804
in the middle of the night
should walk away clean.

569
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,484
Self-pity isn't like you.

570
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:16,918
I'm branching out from
self-loathing and self-destruction.

571
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,153
Wilson is going to hate me.

572
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,156
You kind of deserve it.

573
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,001
He's my best friend.

574
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,265
I know.

575
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,642
What now?

576
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:40,710
I stay here with you.

577
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,610
Get off the bus.

578
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,914
I can't. Why not?

579
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,053
Because...

580
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,961
Because it doesn't hurt here.

581
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,395
I lied.

582
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:08,033
I don't want to be in pain and
I don't want to be miserable.

583
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,167
And I don't want him to hate me.

584
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:19,679
Well... You can't always
get what you want.

585
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,882
Hey. I'm here.

586
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,753
Blink if you can hear me.

587
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,220
No. Don't try to talk.

588
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,428
Just rest.
