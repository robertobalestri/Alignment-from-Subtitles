1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,899
<i>And now, coming to the line,</i>

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,809
<i>last year's Rookie of
the Year, Casey Alfonso!</i>

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:17,774
<i>In lane two, nine-time
national champion, Tony Kumer.</i>

4
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,289
<i>Tony's got his light on in lane two,
and now Casey is approaching the line.</i>

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,487
How do you feel? Great.

6
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,085
I feel like throwing up my guts.

7
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,340
You always feel
like throwing up.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,941
Come on, Dad. Let's
get this digger on the line.

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,576
You sure you don't
wanna go to law school?

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,592
I hate lawyers! Yeah, so do I.

11
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,194
Go get 'em, baby!

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,839
<i>Okay, looks like
we're ready to go!</i>

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,811
<i>Let's hear it, folks!</i>

14
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:32,720
<i>And it's Casey Alfonso, by
less than half a car length!</i>

15
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,853
<i>What a spectacular
finish for the young female.</i>

16
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,225
Casey Alfonso, with
an amazing finish.

17
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,510
What'd you do at the end there?

18
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,729
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,431
At about 250 feet, the
car got out of shape a bit,

20
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:48,532
but about halfway down, I just
got into the zone or something.

21
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,374
I pedaled it back into the groove.
It was the coolest ride of my life.

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,041
How does it feel to be
nine-time national champion...

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,215
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

24
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,522
Casey? Casey! Casey! Out
of the way. Out of the way!

25
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,933
Casey! Casey! Get me an ambulance.
Ron, get the ambulance! Casey?

26
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,446
Sixty-eight year old
male, non-smoker.

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,961
Sixty-eight's a good run.

28
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,532
That'll leave something in the
lock box for the rest of us. Next?

29
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,871
That's your breakfast?

30
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,377
Technically, it's
Wilson's lunch.

31
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,379
Twenty-month old baby,
persistent rash, fever...

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Too much crying.

33
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,415
Female college student
with... Too much drama.

34
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,442
You don't care about
the crying or the drama,

35
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,817
'cause you won't
see the patient.

36
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,618
And you'd treat Methuselah if
his snot had an interesting color.

37
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,286
Means you've already decided
which case you wanna take next.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,692
Tell me about speed racer.

39
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,857
Female, seizure with visual and
auditory processing deficiency.

40
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,058
I did a consult, and...

41
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,499
What kind of race car?

42
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,592
Dragster.

43
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,361
Continue.

44
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,805
You're gonna take a case
based on the car she drives?

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,604
Nothing says, "Thanks
for saving my life"

46
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,578
like a test drive in a car that
accelerates faster than a space shuttle.

47
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,172
You can't save her life,
'cause she's not dying.

48
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,978
Her labs show
signs of dehydration,

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,042
means the problem's
just likely heatstroke.

50
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,197
Kind of hard to get heat struck
in four and a half seconds.

51
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,554
Not when you're wearing
a three-layer fireproof suit.

52
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,162
Excuse me, Dr. House?

53
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,197
No. Lazy ass
called in sick again.

54
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,860
We can give him the message.

55
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,699
May we talk in private?

56
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,617
So, either it's heatstroke, in which
case we take the afternoon off,

57
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,592
or it's one of the diagnoses that you
guys are gonna have for me in two minutes.

58
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,787
You're in charge.

59
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,886
I know.

60
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,733
Cop? He's not packing.

61
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,532
Your dad's either a
cop or a security guard.

62
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,634
Or she carries a weapon.

63
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,071
You're with the CIA.

64
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,311
One of our employees just
returned from an assignment sick.

65
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,615
Now, we believe he may be the
victim of an assassination attempt.

66
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,584
Sure.

67
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,922
You wanna close the door?

68
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,519
Door?

69
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,497
Well, I assume you're gonna drop
trou at some point during the dance,

70
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,776
I don't see why I should share.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,927
This isn't a joke.

72
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,802
If you're willing to help
us, we need to leave now.

73
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,398
If I have to walk somewhere, there
better be at least five girls involved.

74
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,570
And they better be working
their way through college.

75
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,269
Okay, what have you got?

76
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,508
Hereditary brain
disorder, transient ischemia

77
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,107
or paraneoplastic syndrome.

78
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,744
None of those go away
with IV fluids. It's heatstroke.

79
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,789
Or Cushing's or
calcium deficiency.

80
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:22,855
Who's your friend?

81
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,357
We use the term life partner.

82
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,418
Get a fresh history, neurological
exam and an MRI of her head.

83
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,986
Fifteen minutes
for the lap dance,

84
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,999
a half-hour to scrub
the guilt off my soul...

85
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,034
See you in 45!

86
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,336
Dr. House, we need to hurry.

87
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,374
Yeah, we need to hurry.

88
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,533
Little advice.

89
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,306
I mean, obviously the Village
People played out the whole cop thing.

90
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,610
But come on, CIA?

91
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,777
You seriously expect
anyone to believe that?

92
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,659
It helps when you have props.

93
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,125
Keep your eye on my pen.

94
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,063
Very good.

95
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,573
Any nausea or vomiting
before the seizure?

96
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,074
No.

97
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,509
My dad had some, but he's
always like that before a race.

98
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,689
Could have been food poisoning.

99
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,477
You two eat
breakfast together? No.

100
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,746
Any history of sciatica
or spinal injury?

101
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:25,945
No.

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,347
Abnormal deep tendon reflex.

103
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,549
Really? Let me see.

104
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,889
It's there. I didn't
say it wasn't there,

105
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,056
I said it was abnormal.

106
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,025
We're gonna give
you an MRI to be sure,

107
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,469
but I'm guessing your symptoms were
caused by just dehydration in the heat.

108
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,199
You're guessing?

109
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:51,277
Look, I make a living
driving 300 miles an hour,

110
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,610
which makes the ability to
stay conscious kind of important.

111
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,307
I'm sure it's just heatstroke,

112
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,478
but we're gonna do an
MRI to be extra careful.

113
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,628
You said you left
your cell in your office.

114
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,928
I lied.

115
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,898
I wasn't going to take it.

116
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,905
Just tell you to turn
it off for take-off.

117
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:19,996
I know.

118
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,251
I just wanted to see if you
could tell that I was lying.

119
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,335
Useful information. Yeah?

120
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,435
Where are you?

121
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,209
I'm on a top-secret
mission for the CIA.

122
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,939
Right.

123
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,816
There was nothing on
your race car driver's CT

124
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,752
and the history and
physical were normal.

125
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,187
Her deep tendon reflexes
seemed a bit weak to me.

126
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,418
Areflexia could
mean Miller Fisher.

127
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,687
Yes, areflexia could
mean Miller Fisher,

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,527
but since the reflex was weak,
not absent, it doesn't mean anything.

129
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,793
I'm releasing her. You can
go back to your poker game.

130
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,061
Poker's illegal.

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,262
<i>The CIA would never
allow illegal activity.</i>

132
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,237
<i>Have you considered
Miller Fisher?</i>

133
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,502
Why? What happened?

134
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:00,074
She just had another seizure. And
now she's getting a vertical nystagmus.

135
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,048
We think it's Miller Fisher,
an inflammatory process.

136
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,787
In rare cases, it can cause
respiratory failure, but...

137
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,489
Wait, wait. She
could stop breathing?

138
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,089
You said there was nothing
wrong. You said you were sure.

139
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,067
You just had another seizure.
Clearly there's something wrong.

140
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,129
So, why should I trust
you to figure out what it is?

141
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,072
Where's Dr. House?
I'm at this hospital...

142
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,507
It's gonna be all right.

143
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,545
We just need to start
the plasmapheresis.

144
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,806
No.

145
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,119
It's not going to be all right,

146
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,015
because you obviously don't
have a clue what you're doing.

147
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,144
I'm not letting you touch me.

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,415
Honey!

149
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,888
I wanna see House. Where is he?

150
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,564
It looks a lot better on <i>24.</i>

151
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,575
I take that back.

152
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,779
Dr. Samira Terzi. It's a
pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.

153
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,219
We really appreciate the
consult on such short notice.

154
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,918
There's nothing that gives me more
pleasure than helping out a colleague.

155
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,221
This is Dr. Sidney Curtis
from the Mayo Clinic.

156
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,126
He's also agreed to
help with the diagnosis.

157
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,459
Dr. House.

158
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,693
<i>Curtis on Immunology,</i>
Sidney Curtis?

159
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,766
You've read it?

160
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,565
Nope, but it is
keeping my piano level.

161
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,900
So, where is the
poor sick fella?

162
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,380
What do we do? I don't know yet.

163
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,392
- She needs treatment.
- This is a test, right?

164
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,442
You're reporting back
to him everything we do.

165
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,044
Yeah. And I asked the
patient to be uncooperative.

166
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,565
Personally, I think
she overplayed it.

167
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,491
She's being uncooperative because
you made us all look like idiots.

168
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,803
We're only gonna
look like idiots

169
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,820
if we can't figure out how to
get her to agree to the treatment.

170
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,990
What would House do right now?

171
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,728
Pop a pill, insult us
and trick the patient.

172
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,269
We can do that last part.

173
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,168
She's never met
House before, has she?

174
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,238
Who's got a cane?

175
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,241
House isn't here.

176
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,641
We're not gonna act like him.

177
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,250
What do you want?

178
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,359
I'm gonna do what doctors
aren't supposed to do,

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,691
admit I made a mistake.

180
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,698
I shouldn't have been so
quick to dismiss your symptoms.

181
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,463
But you need to let us
start the plasmapheresis.

182
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,368
What do you want?

183
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,337
Case? Honey, do you
know where you are?

184
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,605
She's burning up.
Start the treatment.

185
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,080
I can't. You've
got my permission.

186
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,141
She's obviously confused.
Doesn't matter anymore.

187
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,551
Miller Fisher doesn't
cause delirium and fever.

188
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,520
I don't know what this is.

189
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,092
I'm afraid there are gonna be some
limitations on his medical history.

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,605
Just let me know what you need
and I should be able to provide it.

191
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,532
FYI, my malpractice insurance
doesn't cover alien autopsies.

192
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,692
That's fine.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,291
X-files are the next wing over.

194
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,361
Where was the patient
when he first fell ill?

195
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,632
Sorry, that's classified.

196
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,251
But assume there aren't too many
places in the world John hasn't been.

197
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,573
And, yes, John's a cover name.

198
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,687
And what makes you think
it was an attempt on his life?

199
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,022
Sorry, can't tell
you that, either.

200
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,015
Well, what can
you tell us? Yeah.

201
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,245
Did Oswald really have
sex with Marilyn Monroe?

202
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,406
Good Lord.

203
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,974
Very professional.

204
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,137
Five days ago he was
185 pounds. Perfect health.

205
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:57,910
Cool.

206
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,513
Fever and delirium rule out...

207
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,323
He's not gonna hire you just
because you called him the most,

208
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,694
especially since it's obvious
he doesn't want to be called.

209
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,097
Symptoms rule out Miller
Fisher. MS fits better.

210
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,227
Progression's too fast.
More likely meningitis.

211
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,680
Areflexia doesn't
fit as well with...

212
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:18,728
Does with amyloidosis.

213
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,138
That's even slower
than MS. It's lupus.

214
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,766
I'm with the little
man on this one.

215
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,539
It's attacking the body and
the brain, classic autoimmune.

216
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:29,640
Flirt all you want, but I should
warn you, <i>shiksas</i> are for practice.

217
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,481
Lupus this aggressive
wouldn't spare her kidneys.

218
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,612
It's primarily neurological.
Let's start her on...

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,451
Then why no plaques on her MRI?

220
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,990
MRI was inconclusive.

221
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,057
Start her on...

222
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,616
So, now you're
sure that it's MS.

223
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,559
Just like you were
sure it was Miller Fisher.

224
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,688
An hour after you were
sure it was heatstroke.

225
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,562
The symptoms fit.
Start her on interferon.

226
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,178
We're not gonna score
any points with House

227
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,068
if we solve this just by
running your errands.

228
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,072
I get that you wanna
be right. You don't?

229
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,684
I'm just trying to save the patient,
not score points with my boss.

230
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,338
Would it hurt the patient if
you let us run some tests?

231
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,211
You've got three hours.

232
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,858
We've run six
complete tox screens,

233
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,259
tested for every heavy metal, poison
and biological agent we can think of.

234
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,161
It says here he ate
a lot of chestnuts.

235
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,860
Hold on a second.

236
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,528
If the squirrel liberation army
is involved, I'm out of here.

237
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,798
Those little rodents are...

238
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,340
Horse chestnuts are poisonous.
If someone switched them...

239
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,035
Horse chestnuts may
look like chestnuts,

240
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,543
but they taste like a
horse's lower than chestnuts,

241
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,856
which makes the theory that he
accidentally ate a couple of hundred

242
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,940
slightly less persuasive.

243
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,778
Seeing as how he was prowling
the back alleys of Tehran...

244
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,084
It wasn't Tehran, it was...

245
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,052
You almost got me.

246
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,995
Unless we know the local environmental
factors, the poisonous flora...

247
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,498
You know I can't tell you that.

248
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,297
Well, then why are we here? You
might as well just Google "poison."

249
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,703
All they would tell me is he
spent the last 11 months in Bolivia.

250
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,937
Who you gonna kill in
Bolivia? My old housekeeper?

251
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,067
We don't kill people.

252
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,579
I'm sorry, who are
you gonna marginalize?

253
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,242
If it is my housekeeper,
she has it coming.

254
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,061
Cleaning the windows
means cleaning both sides.

255
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,747
Am I right or am I right?

256
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,789
What does it matter
what he was doing?

257
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,789
The guy's dying. Not anymore.

258
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,257
I know what's
poisoning him, and who.

259
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,589
John.

260
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,264
It's just pancreatitis.

261
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,663
He's not an alcoholic.

262
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,895
And unless his pancreas
is in his fingers...

263
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,732
Spies can't get
fungal infections?

264
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,032
And the burns on his skin?

265
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,903
Spies can't get sunburns?

266
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,168
Bolivia doesn't have sun?

267
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,678
So, either we go with his
theory of the non-drinking drunk,

268
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,680
or he was poisoned by some group

269
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,615
with the resources to make
it completely untraceable,

270
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,846
some customized isotope.

271
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,753
Let's treat for
radiation poisoning.

272
00:14:55,495 --> 00:15:01,594
The iodine's to protect your thyroid.
Antibiotics are to handle infections.

273
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,727
Should start working
in a couple of hours.

274
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,205
We should celebrate
with a beer or eight.

275
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,742
I don't drink.

276
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,109
Oh, methinks he
doth protest too much.

277
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,307
He's deathly ill. Why
would he lie about drinking?

278
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,546
Guilt over killing a man would
make anyone hit the sauce.

279
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,644
We don't kill people.

280
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:22,780
Right.

281
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,051
You just lie to your
friends and family,

282
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,492
establish false identities, trick
people into betraying their country.

283
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,123
He'd never cover up his
drinking. He's too honest.

284
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,134
Hey! Something I've
always wanted to know.

285
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,830
That poison lipstick that
Ginger used to kiss Gilligan,

286
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,066
why didn't that kill her?

287
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,077
Okay, drum roll!

288
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,844
LP is negative for meningitis.

289
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,182
Sorry, Cole.

290
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,212
Fat pad biopsy
is... Wait for it...

291
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:02,686
Negative for amyloidosis
and Thirteen goes down!

292
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,173
Could we hurry this
up? My son has...

293
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,707
Can I have a kid, too?
I'm working too hard.

294
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,858
I could hook you up.

295
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,544
If I had two minutes and
some anti-nausea meds,

296
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,594
I'd take you up on that.

297
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,501
And for the gold...

298
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,339
Protein's 65, glucose, 70.

299
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,038
It's MS, start
her on interferon.

300
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,189
Now, turn to the last page.

301
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,444
Sed rate's 95, ANA's
weakly positive.

302
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,548
Positive, it's lupus.

303
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,448
Weakly, not lupus. It's MS.

304
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,518
We obviously don't know
what it is. Treat for both.

305
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,351
No. I gave in on the tests.

306
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,914
We're not treating her for two
completely separate diseases

307
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,051
because you think
lupus will win you a prize.

308
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,864
Still think it's lupus?

309
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,958
Yeah.

310
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,435
Me, too.

311
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,769
In case of emergency,
go to the emergency room.

312
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,575
Could be lupus.

313
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,043
That's what we figured.

314
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,238
Then why are you here?

315
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,406
You're an immunologist.
We wanted to confirm...

316
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,441
Who are you looking for me to help
you sell down the river? House or Cuddy?

317
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,952
Foreman.

318
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,654
Sorry. He's pushing MS.

319
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,932
Thinks that because
he's in charge,

320
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,925
he has to prove he's the
smartest guy in the room.

321
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,672
All I've heard about you, you put
the patient above everything else.

322
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,721
That's why everyone
finds you so annoying.

323
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,061
All House cares
about is results. I know.

324
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,933
I'm talking about how
to deal with Foreman.

325
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,336
So am I.

326
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,406
Fever's down to 101.5.

327
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,721
Treatment's working.
Why are we out here?

328
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,289
Trying to figure out
which treatment's working.

329
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,224
It's kind of tacky doing
it in front of the patient.

330
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,910
You put her on steroids, too?

331
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,983
We had no choice.

332
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,095
The sed rate pointed to lupus.

333
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,280
And the ANA ruled it out!

334
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,651
Doctors!

335
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,353
Legs hurt?

336
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,122
I can't feel them at all. I
don't think I can move them.

337
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,877
Vitals stabilizing.

338
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,209
Tummy ache's gone as well.

339
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,546
So, the treatment's working.

340
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,982
You wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy
and hop on the company jet?

341
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,389
Little trip down Mexico way,

342
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,326
and I'm not talking about
the country or the plane.

343
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,127
Do you think acting like an idiot
and talking about sex works on girls?

344
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,644
Well, if it didn't, the human race
would have died out long ago.

345
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,912
You're pretty cheery for someone

346
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,269
who was just proved wrong
about his pancreatitis theory.

347
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,740
I'm appropriately cheery for
someone who's been proved right.

348
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,175
John hasn't
vomited in six hours.

349
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,077
What's to vomit?
I'm eating his lunch.

350
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,649
Withholding nutrients is
the treatment for pancreatitis.

351
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,515
That, and the antibiotics
you put him on.

352
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,554
I did unhook your
iodine, though.

353
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,750
Didn't seem to fit with the whole "I'm
just jerking you guys around" Gestalt.

354
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,053
You're unbelievable.

355
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,651
Let's ask John if he'd rather be
sick honestly or cured dishonestly.

356
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,722
John? John?

357
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,174
Any chance he's just
overwhelmed with gratitude?

358
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,624
Paralysis.

359
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,925
It's a new symptom?

360
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,698
Big white space on the
board where it would fit.

361
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,257
Nice, multicolored markers.

362
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,599
I'm not writing it because we
can't know if it's a real symptom.

363
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,049
When these two went rogue and
pumped her full of steroids, we lost...

364
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,735
Steroids don't cause paralysis.

365
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,743
She was also on interferon.

366
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,370
Giving her both probably
fried her immune system.

367
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,890
Who knows what
infection you could cause...

368
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,906
We consulted an
immunologist, she said we have...

369
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,248
She? You talking
about Dr. Cameron?

370
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,463
She thought lupus was...
She tell you to start treating?

371
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,649
Yes! They've ignored
you, they screwed up

372
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,658
and it's fun watching
you spank them.

373
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,136
But, can we get
back to the medicine?

374
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,154
The last thing any of you give
a damn about is the medicine.

375
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,731
Look.

376
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,002
I'm not saying you're
bad doctors or bad people.

377
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,733
But House is.

378
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,435
He created a nasty
little cutthroat world,

379
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,704
planted you in it, and
is watching you play.

380
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,838
And none of it works
for anyone except him.

381
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,713
And whoever wins.

382
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,184
Given its quick progression,
we gotta assume botulism.

383
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,452
I'll go to her place. Check
out her fridge and pantry.

384
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,892
It's not botulism. It's polio.

385
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,431
Brilliant. We should search her home
for FDR's remains or a time machine.

386
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,048
She could have contracted it from
anyone who's been to Africa, or...

387
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,404
She's been vaccinated.

388
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,498
Vaccines wear off.

389
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,739
There hasn't been a single
American case in over 20 years.

390
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,303
I've seen this disease.
I know what it looks like.

391
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,145
That's why you're finding it,
because you're looking for it.

392
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,310
Polio?

393
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,250
It's crazy. House
wouldn't think so.

394
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,585
So, go find House
and tell him your theory.

395
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,421
Take a personal day.
Seriously. Get out of here.

396
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,362
You don't have
the power to fire me.

397
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,025
But I do have the power
to kick your ass off my case.

398
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,127
I'm starting the
botulism treatment.

399
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,401
The rest of you,
look for confirmation.

400
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,213
He should be
brought up on charges.

401
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,910
Okay, relax.

402
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,077
I'll take your book out
from under my piano.

403
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,883
He's dying of radiation
sickness. He's obviously in pain.

404
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,475
All of which could have been
avoided if you hadn't interfered...

405
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,223
What was that for?

406
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,696
Radiation sickness kills
specific cells at specific times.

407
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,529
His hair should be coming out in
clumps before he's writhing in pain.

408
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,900
Since it's not, I know
who's trying to kill him.

409
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,100
God.

410
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,868
It's blood cancer,
Waldenstrom's.

411
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:52,070
Radiation can cause infections,
which set off neuropathy...

412
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,636
If you had any real
evidence of foul play,

413
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,739
you'd be torturing Bolivians

414
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,446
instead of putting me into a
state of anticipatory sexual arousal.

415
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,816
Can we treat for both?

416
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,551
Bad idea. Unless you're the
one who's trying to poison him.

417
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,560
I'll arrange for
plasmapheresis and chemo.

418
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,493
Are you gonna trust
him after what he did?

419
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,657
I don't have to trust
him to agree with him.

420
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,162
You make a good point.

421
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,106
I've been wrong every time
and she still won't listen to you.

422
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,613
So, either she really likes
me or she really hates you.

423
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,979
And I got a ride in the jet.

424
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,686
Oh, hi. What are you doing here?

425
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,122
Just came to say hi.

426
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,284
Hi again.

427
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,351
Where's Mrs. Bearman?

428
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,521
Sent her home.

429
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,359
I was scheduling her for an MRA.

430
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,008
If we gave MRAs to every
patient with a headache...

431
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,695
This wasn't just a headache,
it was the worst in her life.

432
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,293
And lucky for you,
I'm a neurologist.

433
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,238
She went to a wine and cheese
tasting. Both triggers for migraines.

434
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,638
She's never had
a migraine before.

435
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,142
And I never had
a blueberry bagel,

436
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,489
but for the first
time I had one.

437
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,773
Bagels don't kill people.

438
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,837
This is a classic
ticking bomb aneurism.

439
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,974
Wow. This taught me a lesson.

440
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,315
I guess when I mess with
other people's patients,

441
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,185
I risk looking like
an officious bitch.

442
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,428
We're gonna have to
track down Mrs. Bearman.

443
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,258
Wait. Never mind.

444
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,003
It's funny.

445
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,732
It's not funny, it's
totally immature.

446
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,932
It is funny.

447
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,185
You just can't appreciate
it, because you're the victim.

448
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,838
Yeah. I deserve shame and
ridicule for offering a consult.

449
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,505
Unheard of for a doctor.

450
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,515
You didn't offer
a medical consult.

451
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,710
You offered a
dealing-with-Foreman consult.

452
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,243
For the good of the patient. It's
what House would have done.

453
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,449
Maybe House will hear
about it and tear up with pride.

454
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,116
You think I'm trying
to impress him.

455
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,889
I think that for someone
who's not involved in his team,

456
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,522
you're remarkably
involved in his team.

457
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,533
Let it go.

458
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,091
Let him go.

459
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,136
And that's mature.

460
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,811
One-twenty over 80. Let 'er rip.

461
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,481
Now we got the medical
stuff out of the way,

462
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,150
why don't we meet
back at your place

463
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,717
for some enhanced
interrogation techniques?

464
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,095
My safe word is, "Help,
please, please, stop."

465
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,760
It's two pleases. Anything
less than that, you keep going.

466
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,999
You actually cure this guy, I'll
show you my private water board.

467
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,839
We need to consult an
oncologist about the chemo.

468
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:43,316
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were still euphemizing.

469
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,680
My valet knows
a little oncology.

470
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,982
I was wondering when you'd
grow bored of avoiding my calls.

471
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,926
Oh, I could never grow
bored of ignoring you.

472
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,157
What's the latest protocol
on Waldenstrom's?

473
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,263
Where are you?

474
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,027
CIA headquarters.

475
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,243
<i>How much fludarabine
do you need...</i>

476
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,080
Either you're sprawled naked on
your floor with an empty bottle of Vicodin

477
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,824
or collapsed naked in
front of your computer

478
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,568
with an empty bottle of Viagra.

479
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,785
Please tell me which, because
Chase has another pool going.

480
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,971
They flew me in to help
deal with a sick employee.

481
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,322
How much... <i>WILSON:
Hallucinations?</i>

482
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,440
Damn, I shouldn't have
bet on the Viagra. <i>Okay.</i>

483
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,117
Call the Langley switchboard,
ask for extension...

484
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,881
Thirty-five, seventy-eight.
Three, five, seven, eight.

485
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,355
He asked an awful lot
of questions for a valet.

486
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:29,361
You know, I happen to have a
position available on my penis.

487
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,531
Wait a second, I think
I screwed up that joke.

488
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,433
You offering me a job?

489
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,233
I'd settle for that.

490
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:43,833
As tempting as a position
on your staff is, I like it here.

491
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,435
Pays better, and we've only
had one assassination attempt.

492
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,036
And I'm sure
you're a great boss.

493
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:52,050
That's why your fellows left en
masse a couple of months ago.

494
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,245
I have satellite images.

495
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,552
Inspector Gadget?

496
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,259
My God, you're
actually at the CIA.

497
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,459
You've gotta get down here.

498
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,162
They've got a satellite aimed
directly into Cuddy's vagina.

499
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,866
I told them the chances of
invasion are slim to none, but...

500
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,636
Waldenstrom's.

501
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,406
Recommended dose is 25
milligrams per meter squared.

502
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,811
They do a background
check on you?

503
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,280
Twenty-five milligrams.

504
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,592
They did a background
check on you,

505
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,227
they did a background
check on your friends.

506
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,086
Relax. I'm sure they already know that
you brought heroin back from Afghanistan.

507
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,453
<i>That's not true.</i>

508
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,958
I've never been to Afghanistan.

509
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,955
House?

510
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,491
She's getting worse.

511
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,626
Her fever's risen slightly.

512
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,639
But it's definitely...
What? Botulism?

513
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,444
Right? Because if
you're wrong again,

514
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,989
and you're treating her for
something that she doesn't even have...

515
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,573
The anti-toxin hasn't
had time to work yet.

516
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,585
I know it's hard,
but try to be patient.

517
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,855
Excuse me.

518
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:13,908
I know you're
pissed I interrupted,

519
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,026
but you're gonna be even
more pissed in a second.

520
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,694
You tested her
without telling me?

521
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,536
Yeah. I know, I'm
really, really sorry, but...

522
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,200
On the other
hand, it's positive.

523
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,306
She has polio.

524
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,245
Now what, boss?

525
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,713
Where's House?

526
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,354
He's blown off
four hours of clinic.

527
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,062
He's consulting for the CIA.

528
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,694
Seriously, call Langley,

529
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:54,069
and ask for extension three,
five... It's three, five, three, six?

530
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,607
It's definitely two threes.

531
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,767
I wrote it down. I
have it somewhere.

532
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,176
He's gonna make up twice
his skipped hours in the clinic.

533
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,714
Okey-doke.

534
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,376
And for protecting him, you're
gonna make up twice that.

535
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,510
Why are you punishing
me worse than him?

536
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,351
Because House never
learns. You might.

537
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,124
How are you feeling?

538
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,431
Like crap.

539
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,971
Yeah. Cancer can be that way.

540
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,966
My hair is falling out.

541
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,279
Is that the chemo?

542
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,449
No, that's too quick.

543
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,121
So, what does it mean?

544
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,059
It means you don't have cancer.

545
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,293
Someone actually
did try to kill you.

546
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,797
You're stubborn.
You're arrogant!

547
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:03,908
There's no need to yell.

548
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,638
You may have cost
that man his life.

549
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,440
He's getting the
radiation treatment.

550
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,775
Twenty-four hours too late.

551
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,180
I didn't yell at you when I
thought you were wrong.

552
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,512
I wasn't wrong.

553
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,847
This isn't productive.

554
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,786
There is no
"productive," it's too late!

555
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,825
Because of your inexperience,
your poor judgment

556
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,020
and your failure to
recognize a reckless fool.

557
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,160
Cordyceps sinensis.

558
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,904
It's an herbal treatment
derived from a parasitic fungus.

559
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,205
Comes from caterpillars.

560
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,211
Along with
dimercaprol chelation,

561
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,178
it's been shown to mitigate
bone marrow damage

562
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,978
from radiation poisoning

563
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,550
in monkeys.

564
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,484
Sorry. I was
stubborn and arrogant.

565
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,459
Self-recriminations
won't help her.

566
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,519
Nothing's gonna help
her, she's got polio.

567
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,173
There's no cure, but
there are treatments.

568
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,290
No, she's dying.

569
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,766
Yeah, every death's a tragedy.

570
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,200
Funny how you
weren't so depressed

571
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,469
when she was just dying because
me and Amber screwed up.

572
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,838
And I'm also self-centered,
thanks for clarifying.

573
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,035
Don't forget self-pitying.

574
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,411
Vitamin C. Extremely high doses.

575
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,177
It was experimental
treatment protocol in the '50s...

576
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,450
And they haven't finished yet?

577
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,076
They lost funding.

578
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,088
That's because there's no logical
reason vitamin C would cure polio.

579
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,680
Well, someone thought there was.

580
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,283
Someone thought black people
made excellent farm implements.

581
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,861
I'm not talking
about hurting anyone.

582
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,808
I just want to force-feed
her some orange juice.

583
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,561
You wanna throw in some
bacon and eggs as well?

584
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,035
If there's anything
you learned today,

585
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,538
it's gotta be that
you can be wrong.

586
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,150
John, can you hear me?

587
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:57,080
We're gonna start you on
an experimental treatment.

588
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,052
Tea?

589
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,792
It's a Chinese herb
which has been effective.

590
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,762
I'm dying, aren't I?

591
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,666
Probably.

592
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,344
We're gonna attempt
an experimental protocol.

593
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,446
A new drug?

594
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,210
An old one. Vitamin C.

595
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,978
Ultra-high doses have been shown

596
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,179
to destroy the polio virus
and heal nerve damage.

597
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,188
She could regain
use of her legs?

598
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,656
It's unlikely.

599
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,791
But we're gonna try.

600
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,521
Don't give up.

601
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,606
Nausea's not as bad.

602
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,448
Radiation sickness
has a latency period.

603
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,419
You'll get better
before you get worse.

604
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:14,064
Wanna know what I
really did down there?

605
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,727
Only if it's interesting.

606
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,667
The women there,

607
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,843
during Carnival, they...

608
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,076
They do this dance.

609
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,610
They call it the devil dance.

610
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,514
Not interesting.

611
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,859
I spent the whole
40 days with this

612
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,427
attaché to the
Minister of Defense.

613
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,632
The most buttoned-down
woman you'd ever meet,

614
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,542
except when she did this dance.

615
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,238
She agreed to tell me stuff.

616
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:16,058
Okay, you got half
a good story there.

617
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,058
Karma.

618
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,836
Best way to rid yourself of
that guilt is to confess your sins.

619
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:32,104
This pain, it's
right. It's comforting.

620
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,844
It makes me think that
somehow it all makes sense.

621
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,277
What do you mean 40 days?

622
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,921
When they found out

623
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,517
what she'd told me...

624
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,025
Carnival in Bolivia's
only eight days.

625
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,528
You have any idea what
a chestnut looks like?

626
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,143
You idiot!

627
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,839
Who are you calling an idiot?

628
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:12,179
Whoever knew that John was
stationed in Brazil, not Bolivia.

629
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,242
Brazil?

630
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,321
Well, then, I guess
I'm talking to you, idiot.

631
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,552
It's the same region. It's the
same parasites, same diseases.

632
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,752
But not the same language.

633
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,488
In Bolivia, chestnuts
are chestnuts.

634
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,895
Brazil, on the other hand,
has <i>castanhas-do-pára</i>

635
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,364
literally, chestnuts from Pára,

636
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,165
because it would be stupid for people
from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts.

637
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,832
So, he ate Brazil
nuts. Big deal.

638
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,398
No, he ate a lot of Brazil
nuts, which is a big deal,

639
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,772
because they contain selenium,

640
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:42,541
which in high doses causes
fatigue, vomiting, skin irritation,

641
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,550
discharge from the
fingernail beds and hair loss.

642
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:48,018
Any of that sounding familiar?

643
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,518
Can you treat it?

644
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,953
We already started.

645
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,271
Treatment's chelation, the
same as for radiation sickness.

646
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,527
The only difference is it works
a lot better on nut poisoning.

647
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,591
So, what's the problem?

648
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,230
You're an idiot.

649
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,747
Why is she shivering?

650
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,288
Low serum calcium is a
side effect of the treatment.

651
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,220
I can give her a
calcium supplement.

652
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,656
My arm hurts.

653
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:30,126
The infusion rate has to remain
high for the treatment to work.

654
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,355
Is it working?

655
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,095
You feel that?

656
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,564
Yeah, it hurts.

657
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,137
It's working! This is fantastic.

658
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,848
There's a lot you could
learn at my fellowship.

659
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,818
If you knew the procedures
I could teach you...

660
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,512
Of course, we'd
need a nurse to prep.

661
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,285
I know how to kill a
man with my thumb.

662
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,157
Actually, I was just trying to
make another euphemism for sex.

663
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,490
So was I.

664
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,657
Oh, God. How can
you flirt with this idiot?

665
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:11,396
He lied to us again and again.
He broke laws, ethical codes...

666
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,960
I was right.

667
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,107
That doesn't mean everything.

668
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,773
It means a lot.

669
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:24,482
Dr. Curtis, Dr. House.
I appreciate your help.

670
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,758
Hey. Hey.

671
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:57,044
When you were dying,

672
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,049
you tried to infect me,

673
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,176
because you knew
I'd fight for you

674
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,720
if I thought I was dying, too.

675
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,985
Are you bringing this up now so I'll
forgive you for messing with my patient?

676
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,652
I'm happy I changed jobs.

677
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:13,454
But I know I'll never
have that sort of

678
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,725
excitement.

679
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,302
You miss people
trying to kill you?

680
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,461
No.

681
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:23,339
I miss people doing whatever
it takes to get the job done.

682
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,650
I guess that's why I'm
having trouble giving it up.

683
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,643
I shouldn't have helped
them mess with your patient.

684
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,253
They had to screw with me.
I've gotten everything wrong.

685
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,186
I don't believe it.

686
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,028
You're not gonna
get everything right.

687
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,727
But you're never gonna
get everything wrong.

688
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,122
Morning!

689
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,696
Where have you
been the last two days?

690
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,823
Overslept. We saved speed racer.

691
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,869
She had polio. We
cured it with vitamin C.

692
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah. I cured depression
with tonic water once.

693
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,808
Actually, I think there
was some gin in it, too.

694
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,401
A hundred and fifty
grams over six hours.

695
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,478
It worked.

696
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,447
No, it didn't.

697
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,881
I told you, you
can't cure polio.

698
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:44,047
It means either she's not
cured or she never had it.

699
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:48,492
Since she's walking out of here, I
tested her blood from admittance.

700
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,061
No polio.

701
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,824
Means Brennan
screwed up the lab tests.

702
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,455
Or you screwed
up your lab tests.

703
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,965
You must have. She got better.

704
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,400
So, it's relapsing and
remitting. Maybe porphyria.

705
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,429
Well, that's a stretch.

706
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,737
If she had porphyria, you'd
have seen purple urine.

707
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,778
You think it's more
likely he cured polio?

708
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,978
Well, they believe it.

709
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,607
Her symptoms fit perfectly.

710
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,018
Any alternative is
unbelievably convoluted.

711
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,899
Some doctor would have to poison
her with thallium so it looks like polio,

712
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,892
then fake a lab test,
then give her vitamin C

713
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,657
and stop the poison so
she magically gets better.

714
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,290
Actually, it is kind
of doable, right?

715
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,166
So, what do you think?

716
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:37,970
Shall we test her for thallium
before you contact Stockholm?

717
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,404
You poisoned her?

718
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,406
The really shocking thing

719
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,381
is that Foreman was
right about the heatstroke.

720
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,419
Vitamin C cures
polio. I've seen it.

721
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,614
Yeah. In some bush clinic.

722
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,953
You needed polio in a
place with a proper lab.

723
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:57,325
The only problem is that places
with proper labs don't have polio.

724
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:04,860
There is no money in finding cures
for diseases that only kill poor people.

725
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,462
This will make them do research.

726
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,136
What do you care
if I faked a lab test,

727
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,043
if it saves a few
thousand lives?

728
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,172
I did what I had to do.

729
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,740
Isn't that what
you hired us for?

730
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,385
Which is why I'm
not gonna fire you.

731
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,223
You're gonna quit.

732
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,488
Go on, get out of here.

733
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,803
So, you're just
gonna let him go?

734
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,240
Absolutely.

735
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:48,238
And I'm gonna let him get as far away
as possible before you call the cops.

736
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,680
Guy's a nut job.

737
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,809
Who the hell did
I leave in charge?

738
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,012
Foreman.

739
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:58,750
There was a reason for
that. Next time, listen to him.

740
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:13,004
Where have you been?
And don't say the CIA.

741
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,903
Okay.

742
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,565
By the way, one
of my employees...

743
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,519
Either you're gonna have
to get someone from the CIA

744
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,034
to call and confirm your story,

745
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:24,412
or you're doing eight clinic
hours and Wilson is doing 16.

746
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,181
I was in the Hamptons.

747
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:36,455
I was helping some rich hedge
fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.

748
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,792
Fascinating as that sounds.

749
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:45,401
For your honesty, I
will forgive your hours.

750
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,104
Thank you.

751
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,441
No!

752
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,642
The only thing less likely
than your helping the CIA

753
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,377
is your helping some
rich guy in Long Island.

754
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,045
You're doing your
hours and Wilson's.

755
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,112
I know how to kill a
man with my thumb.

756
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,656
Who doesn't?

757
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,494
Hi.

758
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:17,827
Hi.

759
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,902
I'm gonna take
you up on your offer.

760
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,106
Yeah?

761
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,350
Well, I live a couple
of miles from here.

762
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,121
That's not the offer I meant.

763
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,817
I gave notice today.

764
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,056
You said you were
happy at the company.

765
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,359
I lied.

766
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,934
Doubt you'll hold it against me.

767
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,643
I'll see you at 9:00 on Monday.
