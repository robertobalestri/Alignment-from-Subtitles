1
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,816
It's cold.

2
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,958
Good. Thank you.

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,017
There's a new girl at
the ice cream store.

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,587
She doesn't seem too fond
of buttoning her top button.

5
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,155
Let's go check her out.

6
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,444
What are we
supposed to be doing?

7
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,678
It's almost 4:00.

8
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,220
You got somewhere to be?

9
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,347
We know he likes
to manipulate people.

10
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,448
He's probably testing us.

11
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,254
To find out what?

12
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,124
How long we can look stupid for?

13
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,961
He said he'd be here by 3:00.

14
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,864
He's obviously not coming.

15
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,396
I'm going home.
Nobody follow her.

16
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,805
She Pied Pipered nine people
right out of a job last week.

17
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,310
Would you mind holding
my metaphor for a second?

18
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,408
New patient, 37-year-old male.

19
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,784
Suffers from severe
ascending muscle weakness.

20
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,686
Why are you late? To
see who'd put up with it.

21
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,433
So, if we'd have left, we
would have been fired?

22
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,449
I was going to fire
whoever stuck around,

23
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,257
but since everyone
stuck around...

24
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:49,128
28% curvature of the spine
has caused reduced lung capacity

25
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,932
and he has reduced
the bone mineral density.

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,405
The patient has spinal
muscular atrophy.

27
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,965
It's genetic, incurable.

28
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,940
This is not a
diagnostic mystery.

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,674
You have just given the
state secrets to the enemy.

30
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,716
What enemy? New
patient, new rules.

31
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,343
Today, you're going to split
yourselves into two teams.

32
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,830
The first to figure out what's
threatening to deprive the patient

33
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,050
of the 20 or so miserable
years he's got left

34
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,752
with SMA gets
to keep their jobs.

35
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,124
Take off your numbers.
You look stupid.

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,675
And I think I know
who you are by now.

37
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,460
Wait, how do you
want us to split up?

38
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,060
Good question, Overly
Excited Former Foster Kid.

39
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,262
There's 10 of you.

40
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,498
I was thinking six
against six? No, wait.

41
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,131
How about women versus men?

42
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,802
Excellent suggestion, Fat Twin.

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,038
More interesting than
evens versus odds.

44
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,581
Less interesting than
shirts against skins.

45
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,914
If your sex organs dangle,
you're the Confederates.

46
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,977
If your sex organs are aesthetically
pleasing, you're the Yanks.

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,286
Dr. House? I'd like to
be on the men's team.

48
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,054
Do your sex organs
dangle, Cutthroat Bitch?

49
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,358
Not yet. You've never hired more

50
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,489
than one female
on your team before.

51
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,261
If you're going to
purge an entire gender

52
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,359
it isn't going to
be the danglers.

53
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,065
Sounds logical, if you don't think
about it for more than three seconds.

54
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,835
I just told you that if the
danglers lose, they're out.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,377
So, I can only assume
you're hiding the real reason.

56
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,389
You don't think the women
will be aggressive enough,

57
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,458
will be good enough at
science. They'll be too emotional.

58
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,950
Can I switch teams?

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,584
If the danglers
are okay, I'm okay.

60
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,781
We're not okay. I get it.

61
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,553
You don't like me because
maybe I'm a little bit competitive.

62
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,649
Manipulative.

63
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,354
"Cutthroat Bitch"
is your official title.

64
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,863
It's a game. You can either
play for fun or play to win.

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,866
If you want to win,
you want "Cutthroat".

66
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,998
No, thank you.

67
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,436
First thing we have to
do is get inside his head.

68
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,699
It's not psychological.

69
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,084
I'm not talking about the
patient, I'm talking about House.

70
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,634
He's insane, but
he's not irresponsible.

71
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,256
He wouldn't be playing this game if
he didn't already know the answer.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,112
The first thing we do is
gang-bang the sucker.

73
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,014
There's five of us. We
can run dozens of tests.

74
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,179
We don't need a theory.
We just need brute force.

75
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,847
What about the assist dog?

76
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,120
Picks bacteria-infested things
up with its bacteria-infested mouth,

77
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,352
hands them over to the guy...

78
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,884
It's not the dog,
wouldn't be fair.

79
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,089
To who? Whom.

80
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,827
The men. House
knows I used to be a vet.

81
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,199
If the dog's the answer,
they'd be at a handicap.

82
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,635
What about the dog?

83
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,114
Assist dogs put
everything in their mouth.

84
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,470
Money, doorknobs...

85
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,634
Great. That's not what I said.

86
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,404
Why do you think a
low sodium... I don't.

87
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,571
Patient took a trip to
Thailand two weeks ago.

88
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,172
Hey, write bigger and angle
the board more so they can see it.

89
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,409
This is wrong.

90
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,627
It's only wrong if
they cheat off us.

91
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,928
And if they cheat
off us, they're wrong.

92
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,320
They're not cheating,
but one of them is moving.

93
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,093
Hey. Stop playing with your
sutures or I'll have to re-do them.

94
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,690
Why do you guys keep a D-cell
battery in a urine specimen cup?

95
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,860
Because we pulled it
from a patient's intestine.

96
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,200
Why would somebody
swallow a battery?

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,501
Why do you assume
it was swallowed?

98
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,633
Bed five needs a
bag of Ringer's lactate.

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,303
Would have been worse
if he'd used a nine-volt.

100
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,369
Who said it was a "he"?

101
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,971
False assumptions. You're good.

102
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,425
You're trying to get
me to think like him.

103
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,783
And you're trying to kiss my
ass. Why are you talking to me?

104
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,982
Because House is turning patient
care into a game. It's dangerous.

105
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,992
The patient's going
to suffer. Maybe die.

106
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,002
Wow! You really need a shave.

107
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,101
See what I did there?

108
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,796
Whoa.

109
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,574
Interesting.

110
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,284
I need a crash cart in here!

111
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,292
I didn't do it.

112
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,974
When a person faints,
it's because they're

113
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,513
not getting enough
blood to their brain.

114
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,699
The act of falling
corrects the problem.

115
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,299
You faint again strapped into that
power chair where you can't fall,

116
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,777
you might not wake up.

117
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,541
Killed by an assistive device?

118
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,376
At least my death
would be ironic.

119
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,626
I think when you
went to Thailand,

120
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,085
you picked up a threadworm
called strongyloides.

121
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,396
They usually go
up through your feet.

122
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,685
I didn't do a lot of
walking on the beach.

123
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,692
But I assume you did have
someone lay you down in the sand.

124
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,991
Bare back, bare legs increases
exposure tenfold over bare feet.

125
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,163
Two pills. You'll be all better.

126
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,839
Can I have some
water for those, please?

127
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,338
Hey, take a number!

128
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,656
House didn't say
anything about taking turns.

129
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,773
What's she testing you for?

130
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,749
Don't. They'll spend all
day obsessing over my idea

131
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,979
instead of coming up
with one of their own.

132
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,022
And, hey, I might be wrong.

133
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,919
Seriously. I'm worried
that if we don't know

134
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,467
what she's given you,
there could be conflicts.

135
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,618
No, you're not.

136
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,787
House told me he's
keeping track of all that.

137
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,353
Ten doctors. I should
be getting ten cures.

138
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,162
We need blood, hair, and stool.

139
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,997
You poop and then
you use the wooden

140
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,560
sticks to collect
the fecal matter,

141
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,230
then rub it on the green box.

142
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,364
Hand it to my dog.

143
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,184
Only one of those things
I can do on my own.

144
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,337
And the last couple of days,
I haven't been doing that.

145
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,438
Is it all right with you if we
carry you into the bathroom?

146
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,973
If you want me there, that's the
way you're going to have to do it.

147
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay.

148
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,720
Ready? Mmm-hmm.

149
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,696
One, two, three.

150
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,596
Can I get a little
head support, please?

151
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,998
Thank you.

152
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,748
Why are you here?

153
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,688
My offices are being
used by my teams.

154
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,619
Teams?

155
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,738
Which means this is the only
place where you can yell at me.

156
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,957
You have "teams"?

157
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,089
Two of them.

158
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,859
I wanted to deal
with the yelling today

159
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,764
because I noticed
what you were wearing,

160
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,065
and I wouldn't have
to listen all that closely.

161
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,664
You can't make a
competition out of patient care.

162
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,369
Without competition, we'd
still be single cell organisms.

163
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,878
Can I go now? Not
until after the yelling.

164
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:06,945
What's wrong with him?

165
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,141
I have seven of the
finest minds on it.

166
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,426
Along with three very special...

167
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,510
You wouldn't be doing this
unless you already knew.

168
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,281
I tell you, you tell
them. Game's over.

169
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,219
If you know, you are
obligated to treat...

170
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,952
Well, then, in that
case, I don't know.

171
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,963
Why would a guy
voluntarily shove

172
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,295
a metal object into
an electrical socket?

173
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,894
I'm getting closer and
closer to knowing the answer.

174
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,995
What would happen if
I shut down this game?

175
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,201
I'd fire them all, hire 40
new fellowship applicants

176
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,744
and start the
game all over again.

177
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,780
You do know what's
wrong with him, right?

178
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,214
It would be pretty irresponsible
if I didn't, wouldn't it?

179
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,222
Antibiotics aren't working.

180
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,724
Legionella could explain
the lungs, the fever.

181
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,158
If she had Legionella,
she'd have low sodium.

182
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,991
What can you tell me about her?

183
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,553
She likes body surfing.

184
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,156
Maybe picked up a virus
swimming off Jones Beach.

185
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,812
But she doesn't even have the
energy to finish her crossword anymore.

186
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,956
Her boyfriend said...

187
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,232
That's it.

188
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,705
What is? Blurry vision.

189
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,674
How do you get blurry
vision from not being...

190
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,178
You don't stop a daily ritual that
cures boredom because you're bored.

191
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,804
She stopped doing
her crossword puzzle

192
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,424
because she's having
a hard time reading it.

193
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,384
What causes fever, boggy
lungs, and blurry vision?

194
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,545
Fungal. Aspergillus
would explain

195
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,851
the pneumonia, which
explains the fever.

196
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,614
Start her on amphotericin.

197
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,789
Hey, guys. Great job.

198
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:42,841
If you were going to try to take
yourself out, why choose electricity?

199
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,343
You eat a bullet,
jump off a building...

200
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,437
I love the team
thing, by the way.

201
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,006
Bury yourself alive
in Cuddy's cleavage.

202
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,575
Teamwork, collaboration,
all for the greater good...

203
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,815
It could have been
a suicidal gesture

204
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,151
as opposed to an actual attempt.

205
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,887
Interestingly, the
rain in Spain doesn't

206
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,987
actually fall in the
plain all that much.

207
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,790
But who puts their
internal organs

208
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,892
on a skillet just
to get attention?

209
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,266
Go ask him.

210
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,298
That would be cheating.

211
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,103
Got a diagnosis yet?

212
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,238
Get out of here.

213
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,440
Got a stool sample yet?

214
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,538
How could you know?

215
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,642
Oh, I talked to a nurse.
Pretty brilliant, huh?

216
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,052
I give you a move House will love
straight from one of his former fellows

217
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,487
and you let me join your team.

218
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,822
You're too late. We
already have our diagnosis.

219
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,021
He's lying because he
wants you to go away.

220
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,119
So do I.

221
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,674
How do we know you're
not a double agent?

222
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,609
Find out what we're thinking
then go back to the women.

223
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,465
Because I don't care
what you're thinking.

224
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,436
You want to know why I
want to be on your team?

225
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,699
Because you're idiots.

226
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,367
If I can get the women out
of the competition, I'm in.

227
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,375
And so are two of you.

228
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,519
So what's the big move?

229
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,057
It's called xenodiagnosis.

230
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,426
We let these bugs bite you, then
we test their feces for parasites.

231
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,226
Why can't you test my feces?

232
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,852
Because you've been chugging
milk of magnesia for the past hour.

233
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,166
You've got a lot going in
and nothing coming out.

234
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,799
Testing the bugs' feces is actually
more accurate than testing yours.

235
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,399
Smaller haystack,
easier to find the needle.

236
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,776
You okay? Get the bugs off him.

237
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,751
Get the bugs off him!

238
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:35,914
The test isn't done.

239
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,116
He's choking!

240
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,530
<i>Patchy infiltrates on
the X-ray, but patient</i>

241
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,628
<i>improved with chest
PT and oxygen,</i>

242
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,138
<i>consistent with aspiration.</i>

243
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,334
So, now we have another
symptom to explain.

244
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,970
Why does his throat think
his lungs are his stomach?

245
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,841
And why are your
throats closing up?

246
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,611
Shouldn't we be
in separate rooms?

247
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,564
You think I'm going to run two
differentials at this time in the morning?

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,679
Grumpy, you're first.

249
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,755
I'm not grumpy.

250
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,519
Well, why would I call
you that if you weren't?

251
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,424
It's an unusual combination.

252
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,827
Unusual equals
exotic equals foreign.

253
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,641
It has to be connected
to his trip to Thailand.

254
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,190
You practice medicine overseas?

255
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,531
I was with Doctors Without
Borders for eight years.

256
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,764
Ta-da! It's in my file.

257
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,170
David Blaine hides the
six of hearts in a beer bottle.

258
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,708
It's still impressive.

259
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,641
You like exotic.
Why are you here?

260
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,769
I want this job.

261
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,439
Parent sick? No. I... I just...

262
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,914
This is not the job you want.

263
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,644
This is the job in the
zip code you want.

264
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,741
You engaged?

265
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,842
Yes.

266
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,943
Ta-da!

267
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,615
Am I not allowed to grow
up and change my priorities?

268
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,955
You're allowed to.
People usually don't.

269
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,459
This is not a new symptom.

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,495
Our patient has spinal
muscular atrophy.

271
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,463
He has documented
trouble swallowing.

272
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,794
The choking is not new.

273
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,164
So, if it's nothing new,
what caused the old?

274
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,930
Strongyloides worms
explain the fainting.

275
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,335
We already treated...

276
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,171
So, he's all better,
woman who... Thirteen.

277
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,368
He hasn't gotten any worse.

278
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,809
That's a pretty passive approach

279
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,157
for the daughter
of an alcoholic.

280
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,339
Wrong again.

281
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,110
We could stress his
system, put him on a tilt table.

282
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,183
If he stays conscious,

283
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,378
it means we made the
right diagnosis and we win.

284
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,012
Then, why haven't you?

285
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,783
Six against four.

286
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,422
One of the men is going to
have to join the women's team.

287
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,692
On the other hand,
one of the men isn't

288
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,792
an actual doctor, so
I guess it's pretty fair.

289
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,638
Men, you're in the penalty box.

290
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,764
Who's not the doctor?

291
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,638
Glad you asked about that.

292
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,644
The reason I'm penalizing
you is time management.

293
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,704
In diagnostics, you're always
working against the clock.

294
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,093
The women came up with a
theory and they treated the patient.

295
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,551
You guys just sat
around in a lab,

296
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,281
hoping a series of blind
tests would give you a theory.

297
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,823
You wasted the patient's time.

298
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,984
Now, I'm going to waste yours.

299
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,789
Her gums are turning yellow.

300
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,228
Whatever it is,
it's in her liver now.

301
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,128
Fungal fit perfectly.

302
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,394
We were wrong.

303
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,629
And we're going to keep
being wrong until we're right.

304
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,194
Or until she dies.

305
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,864
Yeah. That was very helpful.

306
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,407
Need a team to tell
me we're mortals.

307
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,578
Look. I'm sorry. You're right.

308
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:19,417
Doesn't hurt to be reminded that
we're dealing with real stakes, here.

309
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,921
Liver failure is a bad
thing, but it's also a clue.

310
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,718
What does it tell us?

311
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,896
I can't let you leave if I
think you're still suicidal.

312
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,869
I wasn't trying to off myself.

313
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,602
No, that's right, you were
just trying to kill the wall.

314
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,544
I check this box, and
your next roommates

315
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,672
are going to be Jesus
and Crazy McLoonybin.

316
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,846
That guy never had a chance.

317
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,546
It's going to sound stupid.

318
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,451
Suddenly, you're shy?

319
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,454
You pooped your
pants in front of me.

320
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,550
It's one of the nasty
side effects of dying.

321
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,299
Last Saturday I
got in a car crash.

322
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,596
A drunk driver came over
the line and hit me, head on.

323
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,032
It was like slow motion.

324
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,643
I saw these headlights,

325
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,079
then,

326
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,445
I saw...

327
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:30,880
Paramedics said I was
technically dead for 97 seconds.

328
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:38,592
It was the best 97
seconds of my life.

329
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,468
Okay, here's what happened.

330
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,668
Your oxygen-deprived
brain was shutting down.

331
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,504
A flood of endorphins and
serotonin was released.

332
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,173
That's what gave
you the visions.

333
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,582
No. Believe me. It
wasn't chemicals.

334
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,454
I've done every
hallucinogenic there is.

335
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,491
This was way bigger than that.

336
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,827
There's something out there.

337
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,726
Something more.

338
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,238
Hey, can I have my knife back?

339
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,330
Nope.

340
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,369
Who the hell isn't a doctor?

341
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,777
House said we can't talk.

342
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,224
He meant we can't
talk about the case.

343
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,944
House is just jerking us around.

344
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,417
That's what he does.

345
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,885
You're not curious.

346
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,751
Only one reason you
wouldn't be curious.

347
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,256
We should talk about the case.

348
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,950
He's punishing
us for wasting time.

349
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,586
Maybe we shouldn't
be wasting this time.

350
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,686
Close that door.

351
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,839
You're going to
get us all fired.

352
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,425
We need to find a link between
fainting and trouble swallowing.

353
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,765
We need to know if it's
dysphagia or full-blown achalasia.

354
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,099
Paraganglioma.

355
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,901
How would a neo-plastic
growth in his abdomen explain...

356
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,340
Not his abdomen. In his neck.

357
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,674
A carotid body tumor
causes trouble swallowing.

358
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,044
Food presses against the vagus
nerve and causes the fainting.

359
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,982
So, if this guy has cancer,
we get to keep our jobs.

360
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,161
If he's healthy, we're fired.

361
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,414
We need a CT to prove it.

362
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,865
And we need the women not to
figure it out while we're sitting here.

363
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,291
And does House's computer
have a built-in microphone?

364
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,647
There is a potential toxicity
with an experimental treatment.

365
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,886
I was never here.

366
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,493
Blood pressure is remaining
stable through 60 degrees.

367
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,160
No pauses on his EKG, no nausea.

368
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,896
Our treatment worked.

369
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,267
I need our patient.

370
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,397
Syncope's cured,
Amber. It's over.

371
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,735
You obviously haven't
stressed his system hard enough.

372
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,823
You crank it up high
enough, anyone will pass out.

373
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,442
This is incredible!

374
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,076
This is the most I've
moved in 20 years.

375
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,114
The tilt table test showed
that the patient's EKG,

376
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,750
BP and pulse remained
normal, despite...

377
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,556
Who are you, Thirteen?

378
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,459
My name's in the file.

379
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,107
The fact that you won't
answer my questions

380
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,861
tells me more about
you than answers could.

381
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,991
No, it doesn't.

382
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,144
We turned the thing
up to 95 degrees...

383
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,467
You don't think that
non-answers tell me anything?

384
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,137
Sure. Just not as
much as actual answers.

385
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,449
That's why they're
called answers.

386
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,784
They tell me you're
hiding something.

387
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,085
Tells you I'm hiding everything.

388
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,941
Tells me you've got
something worth hiding.

389
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,003
Was it Turkish prison? Gay porn?

390
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,325
You killed a man just 'cause he
was asking too many questions?

391
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,908
Can I finish reporting
on the patient?

392
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,111
No need.

393
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,653
See you in an hour or so.

394
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,484
Got to set some stuff up.

395
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,892
Thank you all for
coming to tribal council.

396
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,392
A man of your integrity, I
feel I can trust, Big Love.

397
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,836
And I don't call you that
'cause you're a Mormon.

398
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,602
Where's your team's sixth man?

399
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,438
She went rogue. Broke the rules.

400
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,340
You also sinned. You have
no right to cast the first stone.

401
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,212
And atheists have no
right to quote scripture.

402
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,545
The rules said, "No talking."

403
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,674
I told them not to talk.

404
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,750
Out loud.

405
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,411
We were trying to
save a man's life.

406
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,114
Key word being "trying".

407
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,783
Tilt table test confirmed
that you guys were wrong.

408
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,087
You're fired.

409
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,024
The prodigal son returneth.

410
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,327
You're also fired.

411
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,891
We thought there was a tumor
on the patient's esophagus.

412
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,437
We were right about the area,
wrong about the diagnosis.

413
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,803
Turns out the esophagus is just
straightening. It's scleroderma.

414
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,285
Explains the syncope
and the choking.

415
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,368
He needs steroids.

416
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,139
You did a CT scan? Obviously.

417
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,976
After you were
already proven wrong?

418
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,515
Good for you.

419
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,245
It's too bad you're wrong.

420
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,549
Straightening indicates
weakening, not hardening.

421
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,112
SMA explains the weakening.

422
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,988
Strongyloides infection
explains everything else.

423
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,551
You ladies have the honor to
give the patient a feeding tube.

424
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,723
Discharge him. Show
up for work tomorrow.

425
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,428
The rest of you...
You're a disappointment.

426
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,232
You make me want
to stop dangling.

427
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,010
It was the best two
weeks of my life.

428
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,019
I think I will miss you most
of all, Ridiculously Old Fraud.

429
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,954
Do you think House
could be wrong?

430
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,124
I thought he fired you.

431
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,758
No. He fired the men.

432
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,769
I don't think he's wrong.

433
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,104
If he is, how would I prove it?

434
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,804
I just said I don't think he is.

435
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,540
Well, thinking
isn't good enough.

436
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,515
You have to run a blood test
for anticentromere antibodies.

437
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,050
Would you mind running the labs?

438
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,142
You can't.

439
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,346
Well, I can, but...

440
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,321
No, I was making a statement.

441
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,448
You've been fired.

442
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,151
So, you no longer
have lab privileges.

443
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,369
You weren't coming
here for advice.

444
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:10,056
You were coming here to
con a favor to save your job.

445
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,461
Sorry. I'm not working
for him anymore,

446
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,625
but he can still make
my life miserable.

447
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,365
And you have a chance
to make his life miserable.

448
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,174
I'm insulted.

449
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,974
You conned Cameron by
appealing to her humanity...

450
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,514
I told her what
she wanted to hear.

451
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,425
And you told me what you
thought I wanted to hear.

452
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,942
If it's any consolation, I think
your motives are more interesting.

453
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,750
I cannot believe he fired you.

454
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,320
Go draw his blood.

455
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,258
I'll meet you in the lab
when I'm done here.

456
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,671
Guess you didn't
find your tumor.

457
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,899
The other doctors tell
you that you were fine?

458
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:57,738
Yeah, in the sense it's just
my disease getting worse.

459
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,743
You come to terms
with this disease.

460
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,579
You know it's there.
You know it's waiting.

461
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,055
And every now and again
it takes something away.

462
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,060
Took my walking.
Took my modesty.

463
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,432
Now, it's taking one
of my last pleasures.

464
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,598
Well, there's an outside shot

465
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,070
that something
other than the SMA

466
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,766
is causing your eating problems.

467
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,299
And if it is, we can
fix it, remove that tube.

468
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,016
Is that my blood? It's green.

469
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,156
What does that mean?

470
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,760
It means I'm not fired.

471
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,128
Is he a Vulcan?

472
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,735
If no, what makes
Nimoy bleed green?

473
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,034
Are we officially un-fired?

474
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,098
How do we know she
didn't fake the green blood?

475
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,870
'Cause that would be stupid.

476
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,403
And while she may be
manipulative, borderline evil, shallow...

477
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,540
They get it. I'm not stupid.

478
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,927
What contrast did
you use for the CT?

479
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,010
ICM.

480
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,246
His kidneys aren't working.

481
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,087
They didn't filter the contrast,
which, in ICM, is green.

482
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,384
Ten points.

483
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,860
Okay, let's add kidney
failure to our list of symptoms.

484
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,454
What are these points? Is that
how you're deciding who to fire?

485
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,143
I'm going to fire the next person
who asks me who I'm going to fire.

486
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,277
Now we're on the point system?

487
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,412
What happened to
men against women?

488
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,460
Forget the game.

489
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,614
What do you mean,
forget the game?

490
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,539
I mean, forget the damn game!

491
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,750
This guy's kidneys are failing.

492
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,072
We need to diagnose exactly...

493
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,405
I thought we were diagnosing.

494
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,003
You were diagnosing.
Now, I am, too.

495
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:44,174
I thought that Thirteen was
right about the strongyloides.

496
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,444
I was obviously wrong.

497
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,482
Okay, kidney failure,
aspiration, fainting. Go.

498
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,251
Kidney failure could be the
result of a gram negative bacteria.

499
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,259
Our patient wears
a catheter full-time.

500
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,192
It virtually guarantees
bacterial infection.

501
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,594
Which could have
migrated up to his kidneys.

502
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,465
Infection stresses his already
weakened system, makes his SMA worse.

503
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,435
That explains the
choking and fainting.

504
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,971
Put him on an IV amp and gent.

505
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,098
Our team's scleroderma
diagnosis still holds.

506
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,718
The test could have
been negative because

507
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,119
the blood was tainted
with the contrast.

508
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,577
Do a skin biopsy.

509
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,613
Get a side of lymph
node to confirm.

510
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,545
I could have you fired.

511
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,384
You already had me fired.

512
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,618
Just proves that I can.

513
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,751
Were the men wrong?

514
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,885
No.

515
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,939
That doesn't change the fact...
Why are you yelling at me?

516
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,363
Because performing
tests for someone

517
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,808
who is not a doctor
in this hospital...

518
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,097
You're frustrated. You
want help, I'm here.

519
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,865
If you just need to
vent, leave a message.

520
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,506
I like him better
like this. You?

521
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,546
Patient developed pneumonia.

522
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,775
His lungs are filling fast.

523
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,282
We started him on antibiotics.

524
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,613
Nothing. We were wrong.

525
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,684
And you're here to say?

526
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,776
We were wrong, too.

527
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,321
He doesn't have scleroderma.

528
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,981
Biopsy revealed
no fibrotic changes.

529
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,958
Cervical lymph
node has black flecks.

530
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,017
Just small areas of
necrosis. It's nothing.

531
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,222
You say, "Nothing,"
I say, "Cancer."

532
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,541
It's a bit of a stretch
to jump right to cancer.

533
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,624
I'm not jumping.

534
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,544
Broad specs haven't
worked, so it's not bacterial.

535
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,163
Failing liver despite treatment
suggests it's not fungal.

536
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,103
And her high lactic
acidosis points towards

537
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,108
anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

538
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,905
Also suggests infection, which
is a lot easier and safer to treat.

539
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,947
Large cell lymphoma
is incredibly aggressive.

540
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,059
She'll be dead in a week
if we follow the textbooks.

541
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,094
Unless it's infection, in
which case you irradiate her,

542
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,916
and she'll be dead in a day.

543
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,786
And I know you have
some experience with that.

544
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,925
I've seen doctors
do this before.

545
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,358
Go back to the
scene of the crime,

546
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,862
if you're right this time, you
purge yourself of past ghosts.

547
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,523
I know it's
contrary to protocol.

548
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,226
But I think it's more likely...

549
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,269
Ghosts are there for a reason.

550
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,600
So you don't make
the same mistake twice.

551
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,276
Switch her over to
third-generation cephalosporin.

552
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,609
You want to remove his eye?

553
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:58,844
Who told you?

554
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,476
You booked the OR.

555
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,611
Good.

556
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,987
You can't beat
me in a foot race.

557
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,049
I thought we were dancing.

558
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:11,090
Cervical lymph node
is a garbage dump.

559
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,187
A very small one.

560
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,495
Just one truck comes and it
only comes from one home.

561
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,330
Al Gore would be
appalled. The home...

562
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,427
The home is the
right eye. I get it.

563
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,396
Do a biopsy.

564
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,804
On my way.

565
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,933
You're not doing a biopsy.

566
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,637
You ordered an
orbital exenteration.

567
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,856
Right. Because I don't want
to remove a little, tiny piece,

568
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,657
sit in the lab and confirm
what I already know,

569
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,616
while my patient
drowns in his own fluid.

570
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,551
But if you want me
to, I absolutely will.

571
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,281
How advanced is the pneumonia?

572
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,415
It's taking college courses.

573
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,084
Hey, Wilson!

574
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,889
I'm going to cut
some cripple's eye out!

575
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,895
Want to come watch?

576
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,659
Good times.

577
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,893
We good to go?

578
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:01,072
I thought melanoma
was skin cancer.

579
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,612
Technically, it's cancer
of the pigment cells.

580
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,710
The same cells that
give your iris its color.

581
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,185
Cancer?

582
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,747
Why not? What else
can God throw at me?

583
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,522
Hail, locusts, smiting
of the first born...

584
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,496
All depends on
how evil you've been.

585
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:19,827
House.

586
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,497
If it's cancer, it's spread
everywhere, right?

587
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,397
That's what's in my
lungs? My kidneys?

588
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,999
There is a chance, by removing
the eye, to get the primary tumor,

589
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,510
and three courses of radiation,

590
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:33,937
that could...

591
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,448
Could what? A few months? Years?

592
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,279
More likely months.

593
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,187
Any of your other doctors
have any cheerier diagnoses?

594
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,249
If they do, they're
wrong. This is the answer.

595
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,295
It's the only way to help you.

596
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,262
I already can't
walk. I can't eat.

597
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,967
You're telling me
that the rest of my life

598
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,370
is in this bed, puking and pain?

599
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,867
We can manage the pain.

600
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,605
I'd rather just
get this over with.

601
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:13,317
I've been trapped in this
useless body long enough.

602
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,447
It'd be nice to finally get out.

603
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,755
Get out and go where?

604
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,304
I mean, you think you're
going to sprout wings

605
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,106
and start flying around
with the other angels?

606
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,325
Don't be an idiot.

607
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,991
There is no "after".
There's just this.

608
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,261
House!

609
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,548
You can't let a dying man
take solace in his beliefs?

610
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,742
His beliefs are stupid.

611
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,079
Everybody lies.

612
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,779
Some for good
reasons, some for bad.

613
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,564
This would have been
a fantastic reason to lie.

614
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,216
Hi. Greg House.

615
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,351
Why can't you just let
him have his fairy tale?

616
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,325
If it gives him comfort
to imagine beaches

617
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,795
and loved ones and life
outside a wheelchair...

618
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,355
Are there 72 virgins, too?

619
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,559
It's over.

620
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,864
He's got days, maybe hours left.

621
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,871
What pain does it cause you if he
spends that time with a peaceful smile?

622
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,600
What sick pleasure
do you get in making

623
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,905
damn sure he's filled
with fear and dread?

624
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,878
He shouldn't be making
a decision based on a lie.

625
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,145
Misery is better than nothing.

626
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,325
You don't know there's
nothing. You haven't been there.

627
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,648
Oh, God, I am tired
of that argument.

628
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,119
I don't have to go to
Detroit to know that it smells.

629
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:25,817
Yes. Detroit, the
afterlife, same thing.

630
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,731
You're not getting
enough oxygen,

631
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,156
so we're inserting a tube
directly into your lungs.

632
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,420
It should help us drain
some of this excess fluid.

633
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,758
Should make you a
little more comfortable.

634
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,469
SATs are still dropping.

635
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,698
The fluid's clear.

636
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,707
If this was cancer,
there should be blood.

637
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,276
Call House.

638
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,173
He just paged me.

639
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,186
Dr. House!

640
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,802
Maybe it was

641
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:53,969
just an accident.

642
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,034
It wasn't an accident.

643
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,872
Think his nihilism got the best
of him and he tried to kill himself?

644
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,570
He paged me. He paged you?

645
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,238
Why you? I assume because...

646
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,340
Don't assume anything.

647
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,876
Don't fall into that trap.

648
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,419
Is he okay?

649
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,118
Burned his hand pretty good.

650
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,249
His heart stopped
for nearly a minute.

651
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,193
But your cohort
managed to restart it.

652
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:19,595
But he has not
regained consciousness.

653
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,670
So, since I have you all here,

654
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,171
we should probably talk
about your actual patient.

655
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,141
Clear fluid from the lungs
indicates that it's probably not cancer.

656
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,872
So it would be nice if we
could come up with a new idea.

657
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,884
You're an idiot. You
nearly killed yourself.

658
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,981
That was the whole idea.

659
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,102
You wanted to kill yourself?

660
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,459
I wanted to nearly kill myself.

661
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,860
Is he better?

662
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,954
No.

663
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,158
But he doesn't have cancer.

664
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,064
We think it might be
eosinophilic pneumonia.

665
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,070
Maybe you didn't want to die,
but you didn't care if you lived.

666
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,266
You insisted that I
needed to see for myself.

667
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:04,599
Was he discharged?

668
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,042
No. He's dying.

669
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,379
You've already had two
near-death experiences.

670
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,975
Not that guy, the guy
in the car accident.

671
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,542
With the knife.

672
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,218
I need to talk to him.

673
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,452
He died almost an hour ago.

674
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,804
Apparently, it's bad
to electrocute yourself

675
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,321
within days of suffering
massive internal injuries.

676
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,262
Why did you need to talk to him?

677
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,737
Did you see something?

678
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,968
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

679
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,373
House? What did you see?

680
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,706
Nothing.

681
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,144
Whose idea was that?

682
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,373
Brennan.

683
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,349
"Nothing," you don't want to
talk about it, or, "Nothing..."

684
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,010
Which one's Brennan?

685
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,610
Is he the ridiculously old guy?

686
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,553
House, you've got
to talk about this.

687
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:54,821
If it's aggressive enough it might
have gotten past the steroids.

688
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,053
Start him on cyclophosphamide.

689
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,653
I already did.

690
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,356
Just looking at you hurts.

691
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,661
I'm gonna order up
some extra pain meds.

692
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,203
I love you.

693
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,435
How fast will this work?

694
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,107
New meds should start helping
in minutes, okay? Hang in there.

695
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:20,050
Vacutainer's full. I
need to replace it.

696
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:24,555
I don't think it's working.

697
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,181
Try and relax.

698
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,151
You must be wrong.

699
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,696
Stop talking.

700
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,456
Hurry up and get the
chest tube working.

701
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,126
Okay. I got it.

702
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,604
Can you get Hoover?

703
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,024
I can't...

704
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,825
Can you put my

705
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:07,991
hand

706
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,867
on his head?

707
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,539
It's okay. Don't worry.

708
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,710
I'm not scared.

709
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,194
Oh, God.

710
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,472
Time of death...

711
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,891
You're looking better.

712
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,950
Stark's dead.

713
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,358
What are you doing?

714
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,060
Going to see our patient.

715
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,797
He's dead.

716
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,931
"Dead" is not a diagnosis.

717
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,304
You really shouldn't be...

718
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,240
Shut up and give me my cane.

719
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,238
I assume we're all fired.

720
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,044
Should I fire myself, too?

721
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,815
I thought it was strongyloides,
then I thought it was cancer.

722
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,353
A little help, here?

723
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,922
Ready? One, two...

724
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,263
Why did you call me?

725
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,131
Because if I pooped
myself in front of Wilson,

726
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,276
I'd never hear the end of it.

727
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,996
But why not one of the others?

728
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,446
You always have that
phone in your hand.

729
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,133
We all have cell phones,
that's not the reason. What is?

730
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,539
If I died, you'd
never get the job.

731
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,373
I knew you wouldn't
let that happen.

732
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,913
You don't think anybody
else has any reason to care?

733
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,591
I think this is starting
to come back to me.

734
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,914
It's right, left, then repeat.

735
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,681
Yeah. That works.

736
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,314
What did we miss?

737
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,882
If we knew, he wouldn't be dead.

738
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,155
So, that's it? You're
just gonna give up?

739
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,697
No. We were defeated. It's over.

740
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,264
Patient presented with syncope.

741
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,803
We thought it was thread
worms, gave him ivermectin.

742
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,862
Thank you.

743
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:32,000
The patient seemed better
until his blood turned green.

744
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,635
Can we at least
remove the body before

745
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,044
launching into a purely
academic exercise?

746
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,278
The patient didn't respond
to antibiotics or steroids.

747
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,443
You okay, boy?

748
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,680
What's wrong with the dog?

749
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,524
He's dead.

750
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,565
There are only a
handful of viruses

751
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,658
that can cross between
dogs and humans.

752
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,726
But they may not
be connected at all.

753
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,635
The dog was old.
I've seen it before.

754
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,799
They hang on way past
their normal life expectancy

755
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,308
to take care of their masters.

756
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,742
Did you watch
him take the pills?

757
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,873
The ivermectin. Did
you watch the patient

758
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,747
put them in his mouth
and swallow them?

759
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,683
I don't know. I think so.

760
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,776
What kind of dog is that?

761
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:16,854
English Shepherd.

762
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,098
That's in the
collie family, right?

763
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,181
Not really.

764
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,457
But they share the MDR-1 gene?

765
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,686
Yeah.

766
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,753
What happens when you give a
dog with the MDR-1 gene ivermectin?

767
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,888
They don't.

768
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,160
I mean, it's used to treat
heartworms in most dogs,

769
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,703
but it would be fatal if they...

770
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,003
Look familiar?

771
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,280
I think the last
time you saw it,

772
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,749
it didn't have that dead
dog's teeth marks on it.

773
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,012
I just put it on the bed
tray to get him some water.

774
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,113
When I asked you if you watched
the patient swallow the pills,

775
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,384
the right answer was, "No."

776
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,420
Take his body
down to the morgue.

777
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,804
If you hadn't treated this patient
as a game, he wouldn't be dead.

778
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,643
Feeling much better, thank you.

779
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,308
I'm supposed to
show you sympathy?

780
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,614
He died while his attending
was lying on a hospital bed

781
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,316
because he stuck a
knife in a wall socket.

782
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,326
He died because a
doctor made a mistake.

783
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,827
She was an idiot.

784
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,158
You employed her.

785
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,962
You're responsible.

786
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,247
Dr. Foreman.

787
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,714
How's she doing?

788
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:58,049
Fever's gone. AST and ALT
are back within normal range.

789
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,185
She should be out
of here in a few days.

790
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,420
Gutsy call.

791
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,493
Thanks.

792
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,994
It wasn't a compliment.

793
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,559
If you were wrong,
she'd be dead.

794
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,656
I was sure...

795
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,429
No, you weren't.
You couldn't be.

796
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,764
There's a reason we have rules.

797
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,305
If every doctor did whatever
his gut told him was right,

798
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,569
we'd have a lot more
dead bodies to deal with.

799
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,201
It won't happen again.

800
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,677
Yes, it will.

801
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,942
Because you confuse saving
her life with doing the right thing.

802
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,647
I'm sorry, Dr. Foreman,
you're fired.

803
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,966
As soon as the pathologist
cut into the lungs,

804
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,136
we saw the threadworms.

805
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,005
Do you think
it's fair that I fired

806
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,482
all the other
members of your team

807
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,520
when you guys actually came
up with the right diagnosis?

808
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:07,156
I keep replaying it in my mind.

809
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,059
Did I drop the pills when I
put them on the bed tray?

810
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:13,325
Did I knock them over
when I turned to leave?

811
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,692
You know, he'd be alive.

812
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:20,733
His dog would be alive.

813
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,000
I know.

814
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,407
You forced us to act
on a false assumption.

815
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,500
I know.

816
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:30,036
Everything we built
from that step on,

817
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,083
every test, every
theory, every treatment...

818
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,348
I know. Forget the
lecture and fire me already.

819
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,492
If I was gonna fire you, I
wouldn't be giving you the lecture.

820
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,860
I know you're not gonna let
anything like this ever happen again.

821
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,939
I'll see you tomorrow.

822
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,946
I'm sorry to say,

823
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,079
I told you so.
