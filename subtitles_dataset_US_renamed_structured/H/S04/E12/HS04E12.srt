1
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,789
I don't know about
you, but I'm nervous.

2
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,394
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

3
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,680
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

4
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,807
Many children.

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,817
This is a great thing, Roz.

6
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,786
I am so happy for you.

7
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,253
Thank you, Mrs. Silver.

8
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,587
Yonatan is a good
man, from a good family.

9
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,530
I know you chose well
for me. I've been blessed.

10
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,637
Cross-species mating. I feel
like Darwin in the Galapagos.

11
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,605
Amber and I have
a lot in common.

12
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,042
She's a Cutthroat Bitch,
you cry over <i>Dark Victory.</i>

13
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,945
Bette Davis. Another
strong, assertive woman.

14
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,692
You don't like strong.
You don't like assertive.

15
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,378
You like needy.

16
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,543
She's not dying, is she?

17
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,986
Yes. Go away.

18
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,657
I give it two months.

19
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,221
Hundred bucks.

20
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,958
It's not really fair.
You're not objective.

21
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,613
But, I'm all about
the teaching, so...

22
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,606
We're at four months.

23
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,668
You hid this from me?

24
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,142
I was wrong. Okay?

25
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,609
I thought you'd be upset.

26
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,512
I thought you'd track
me down in hallways...

27
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,292
I shouldn't have
discounted the sex.

28
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,286
She's obviously limber enough to
put off the meltdown for two months.

29
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,753
She's not needy. I
don't need needy.

30
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,155
She's scary. Why does
scary need pathetic?

31
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,623
Are you going to talk to her?

32
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,287
I don't see that I
have any choice.

33
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,992
You're all right with that? No
impulse to save her from me?

34
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,003
I've broken the pattern, House,
which is why this has a chance.

35
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,097
I know you're too suspicious to
accept that without getting out your ruler

36
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,870
and your calipers and your
scanning equipment, so,

37
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,843
go ahead. Get it
out of your system.

38
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,299
Thirty-eight year old female
with loss of bladder control,

39
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,055
blood in her urine and a broken
leg from collapsing at her wedding.

40
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,062
Ampicillin for the UTI,
shiny cast for the leg.

41
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,792
You guys know
Wilson's dating Amber?

42
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,025
No. Wilson and Amber?

43
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,364
I knew.

44
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,738
I asked her out. She said she'd
just started seeing someone.

45
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,968
Cultures were negative for UTIs.
No signs of previous trauma or STDs.

46
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,135
Kidney cancer.

47
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,821
CT was clean for
tumors and kidney stones.

48
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,837
I thought Amber scared
you guys. She does.

49
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,859
But she also has legs that
go all the way up to Canada.

50
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,923
So do Canadians. It doesn't
mean I want to date one.

51
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,487
Her sodium's low. Could be
endometriosis in the bladder.

52
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,184
Low sodium could also be from low food.
Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.

53
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:55,025
Or sodium was absorbed by
a toxin already in her system.

54
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,693
Was it just the legs, or did you
detect something resembling a soul?

55
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,233
She grew on me.

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,768
If there's a toxin in her,
it could be carbolic acid.

57
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,189
I'm talking about
the patient now.

58
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,832
That much carbolic acid, someone
would have had to poison her.

59
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,000
Could have been a Cossack.

60
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,667
If this was 18th-century Poland

61
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,938
and Cossacks were
into household cleansers.

62
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,605
Which is why it's more likely
that the poisoner was poisonee.

63
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,148
Suicide's a sin.

64
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,713
Corollary of, "People
lie," is, "People sin."

65
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,949
And in my world,
"People" includes Jews.

66
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,113
She was getting married.

67
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,383
Hasidic women marry young

68
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,925
so they can start pushing
out little "Hasidlings."

69
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,554
Thirty-eight means a woman not on
anyone's hot list being pushed onto a guy

70
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,707
who's not on anyone's hot
list. No way out. No way out.

71
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,571
Endometriosis fits better than an
epiphany that her life is meaningless.

72
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,628
We should start her on AIs
and do a cystoscopy to confirm.

73
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,607
Fine. Check her innards for bad
cells and her home for bad karma.

74
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,818
The carbolic acid should
be on the shelf right

75
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:46,772
next to the regret
and the self-loathing.

76
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,982
These people are crazy.

77
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,745
Yeah. She should be self-hating.

78
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,584
I'm not self-hating. I hate religious
people who are out of touch with reality.

79
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,316
You only marry someone
you met three times

80
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,255
if they're carrying
your little mistake.

81
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,520
What's their divorce rate?

82
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,290
Cleaners are all organic.
Nothing with carbolic acid.

83
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,592
You like how they hook up?

84
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,634
Romance is just
emotional foreplay.

85
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,433
Candlelight meals, flowers... It's as
much a ritual as anything these people do.

86
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,771
Why not go with someone who's pre-vetted,
shares the same values? Cut to the quick.

87
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,542
Values may give you the big picture, but
time together gives you the little picture.

88
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,172
Does she chew her food too loud?

89
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,122
Will she leave you alone
during the Final Four?

90
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,424
You commit to something deeper.

91
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,562
You let the little
surprises slide.

92
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,645
Surprises kill,

93
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,281
which is why you only commit
when there are no more surprises.

94
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,486
And you have no more
surprises for your wife.

95
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,021
Do you think this came
up on date number two?

96
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,622
You ever heard of a
Hasidic Jew into hard rock?

97
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,897
She's listed as a
producer on all of these.

98
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,806
Where there's rock
and roll and sex,

99
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,703
usually, there's drugs.

100
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,544
I'm Baal T'Shuvah. I became
Hasidic about six months ago.

101
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,675
And before six months ago?

102
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,212
Music business isn't
exactly known for its holiness.

103
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,324
Heroin.

104
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,496
But I've been clean for months.

105
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,927
Yonatan knows

106
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,727
in the broad strokes.

107
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,568
He never actually
asked the details.

108
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:25,577
Says what's important is the person
that I am now, not the person I was then.

109
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,380
How do you go
all the way from...

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,439
I just took a class.

111
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,245
Then I took another class.

112
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,583
And you just completely
left the music business?

113
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,348
Pop music is
considered frivolous.

114
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:41,358
Same reason we don't
watch TV or go to movies.

115
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,759
Your drug use may have
caused some long-term damage.

116
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,800
We're going to need to take a
hair sample to test for latent toxins.

117
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,769
So, you can never
watch <i>Star Wars</i> again.

118
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,483
You figure that I'll hire you, if
you promise to dump Wilson.

119
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,658
How did you... Wilson had a key.

120
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,252
You figure that I'll
make your life hell at first,

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,730
but I'll eventually see how
good you are and keep you.

122
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:23,498
It's a good plan, don't you think?
Perfectly tailored to your personality.

123
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,105
No, it's not. You know it's not.

124
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,714
Means you just want
to stay in my orbit,

125
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,093
because you figure I'll eventually
realize that I made a mistake

126
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,052
and you'll be able
to rub my face in it.

127
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,020
I can't wait. It's
going to be awesome.

128
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,686
No, it's not. And
you know it's not.

129
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,838
'Cause you know that
even if I made a mistake,

130
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,627
I'd never admit that
I made a mistake.

131
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,003
Which means that you're just
toying with Wilson to toy with me.

132
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,539
Your goal is pure
feral vengeance.

133
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,310
Innocent bystander, but
there's a greater good.

134
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,978
No, that's not it.

135
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,713
Because a bag of flaming
poop bypasses the bystander.

136
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,480
So, which is it, House?

137
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,689
Am I in this for you?
Or am I in this for him?

138
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,998
Give him back his sweatshirt.

139
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,703
Pit stains don't become you.

140
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,107
Treatment had no effect,
rules out endometriosis,

141
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,242
and her hair sample was
negative for residue drugs.

142
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,363
This woman lived in the
fast lane till six months ago.

143
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,331
Maybe we're missing
something. She admitted drug use.

144
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,756
Doubt she's holding out on
her days as an asbestos miner.

145
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,952
Cryoglobulinemia might
account for the symptoms.

146
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,528
Except for the one you missed.

147
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,689
Well, there's no
change in her condition.

148
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,941
I'm not talking about
a new symptom,

149
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,059
I'm talking about one that
presented six months ago.

150
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:05,196
Look, she's nuts. But we can't just give
her 10 cc of atheism and send her home.

151
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,710
Religion is a symptom of irrational
belief and groundless hope.

152
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,148
Altered mental status, on the other
hand, is a symptom of porphyria.

153
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,241
She didn't develop uncontrollable
anger, crying, anxiety,

154
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,752
she just decided
to go to Temple.

155
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,789
The woman didn't just
choose to keep kosher.

156
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,088
She went directly to the extremes of
Hasidism and a life of stringent rules.

157
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,287
She became a masochist.

158
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,106
She didn't like her old
life, so she changed it.

159
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,224
People don't change.

160
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,800
They might want to,
might even need to, but...

161
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,564
Taub gave up a six-figure
plastic surgery career for this job.

162
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,572
That mean he has porphyria?

163
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,974
He switched jobs to save his
marriage. He did it to avoid change.

164
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,513
He's right. You don't suddenly choose
crazy without suddenly being crazy.

165
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,482
No. No. If she walked
away from everything,

166
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,076
to go base-jumping
or live with apes

167
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,430
we wouldn't be
having this discussion.

168
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:58,789
We would if she was also tinkling
blood out of her over-excited bladder.

169
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,625
Pump Hadassah full of hematin
and give her a phlebotomy.

170
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,932
Bloodletting?

171
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,163
Porphyria is a rare
genetic disorder

172
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,467
that causes an over-production
of a certain protein.

173
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,740
Draining the blood relieves...

174
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:19,268
A hair test for damage from drugs
showed she has a rare genetic disease?

175
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,814
Not exactly. We're
testing her now to confirm.

176
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,816
You're treating it
before you confirm it?

177
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,114
Blood test results
take 24 hours.

178
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,816
You must have seen something
that makes you suspect it.

179
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,348
Dr. House has a theory.

180
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,121
A theory based on what?

181
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,059
We'd like a different doctor.

182
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,327
I assure you that
Dr. House is our best...

183
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,677
Then we will settle
for second best.

184
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,637
Someone who doesn't think my wife
is sick just because she's religious.

185
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,869
If you prefer, I can give your
wife my second-best diagnosis.

186
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,044
Did you know
Wilson's dating Amber?

187
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,308
I have reviewed the chart.

188
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,816
Someone on your team
must have pointed out

189
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,581
that cryoglobulinemia
also fits the symptoms.

190
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,054
Yes. It fits many
of the symptoms.

191
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,752
My wife's body is sick.
Her mind and soul are fine.

192
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,497
You live according to God's
600 commandments, right?

193
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,826
Six hundred thirteen.

194
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,526
Do you understand them all?

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,159
It takes a lifetime of learning.

196
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,679
But you follow the ones
you don't understand,

197
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,014
because the ones you do understand
make sense and you believe

198
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,564
that the guy who created
them knows what he's doing.

199
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,165
Of course.

200
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,111
So, you will trust my diagnosis,
and you'll let me treat her,

201
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,273
because in this Temple,
I am Dr. Yahweh.

202
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,416
I want a new doctor.

203
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,522
I'm starting her on indomethacin
for the cryoglobulinemia.

204
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,288
People don't change.

205
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,387
For example, I'm going to keep
repeating, "People don't change."

206
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,730
So, alcoholics that successfully
go through treatment don't exist.

207
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,428
They're still alcoholics.

208
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,046
If they never take another
drink as long as they live,

209
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,096
it's only because they
didn't live long enough.

210
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:58,304
If you're dissatisfied with your life,
changing it is a symptom of mental health.

211
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,972
I get why that concept
is strange to you.

212
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,988
O2 sats are 85. She's hypoxic.
We might need to intubate.

213
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,451
What's wrong with her?

214
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,206
Well, it's definitely
not cryoglobulinemia.

215
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,991
Better ask him.

216
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,862
We kept her on oxygen overnight.

217
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,101
Her respiratory rate's stabilized
and her O-sat's back up to 95.

218
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,171
I saw Amber drop off
Wilson this morning.

219
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,836
Yes. The male always
drives the female.

220
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,107
So what caused the
breathing problem?

221
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,821
Pulmonary involvement
rules out porphyria.

222
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,249
She kiss him or he kiss her?

223
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,015
I missed it. The lab tech with
the tongue stud also pulled up.

224
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,112
Wegener's would explain
her elevated sed rate.

225
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,624
Wegener's wouldn't explain
the changed mental status.

226
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,594
Actually, we've been trying to
ignore that part of the white board.

227
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,496
I wrote it in black. I'm always
serious when I use black.

228
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,658
Lupus would explain...
Maybe she didn't change.

229
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,312
Are you agreeing with me,
or are you making a point?

230
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,336
I'm making a point.

231
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,447
That's going to take longer.

232
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:02,238
How do we know that the real Roz isn't
who she is now and who she was then?

233
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,017
Can't we say that
her previous life was

234
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,040
true, without making
her present one a fraud?

235
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,955
The "life is messy"
argument. Nice. Explains

236
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,604
everything without
explaining anything.

237
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,175
If it's lupus, there's a heart
problem we don't know about yet.

238
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,120
Run her through a stress test. If
she has a heart attack, I'm right.

239
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,623
Or we could wait, hope that...

240
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,867
You're afraid to give
her a heart attack.

241
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,154
Of course we're afraid to...

242
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,660
No reason to be afraid.

243
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,959
Unless you think I'm right.

244
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,157
It's Wegener's.

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,129
But we'll have the
crash cart, just in case.

246
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,577
Oh, my God! What are
you guys doing here?

247
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,245
I had a sudden yen for fusion.

248
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,411
I put a different restaurant in my
date book. I'm firing my assistant.

249
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,489
That's okay. Hi, Greg.

250
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,659
And I call you "Greg" because
we're now social equals.

251
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:58,027
I call you "Cutthroat Bitch."
Well, <i>quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

252
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,932
And I speak in Latin, because I
don't try to hide what an ass I am.

253
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,026
I assume you'd like to join us?

254
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,982
It will be easier to observe our
interaction if you're at the same table.

255
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,770
If we ever get seated.

256
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,875
Excuse me.

257
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,035
No, no. I...

258
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,941
We've been waiting for...

259
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,779
Any minute now, she's going to
hit him in the face with your testicles.

260
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,583
She tends to treat... She
tends to treat every event

261
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,590
like it's the last
'copter out of Saigon.

262
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,357
She's the anti-Wilson.
She's a force for evil.

263
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,023
She has an annoying
quality. Perhaps even two.

264
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,931
If I was perfect, I
would date perfect.

265
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,008
You like that.

266
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,134
It's annoying, but
she's good at it.

267
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,802
Wait a second.

268
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,572
This isn't just about the
sex. You like her personality.

269
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,981
You like that she's conniving.

270
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,484
You like that she has no
regard for consequences.

271
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:57,148
You like that she can
humiliate someone if it serves...

272
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,659
Oh, my God.

273
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,086
You're sleeping with me.

274
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,941
<i>I need you to go faster, Roz.</i>

275
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,472
<i>A little harder.</i>

276
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,811
I am going harder, damn it.

277
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,421
What if Dr. House was right?

278
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,153
And Roz did make
a radical change.

279
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,259
Lupus is chronic, but treatable.

280
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,128
And with the treatment, it
would undo the change?

281
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,895
She'll be the way she
was before I knew her?

282
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,096
I don't think it's likely.

283
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,637
Then you don't know for sure.

284
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,906
You'd find someone else.

285
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,275
There isn't someone else.

286
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,510
You've had three dates.

287
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,747
How long have you been married?

288
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:04,916
Twelve years.

289
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,584
And is she the one?

290
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,525
We wouldn't still be
together if she weren't.

291
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,290
I love her as much
now as the day...

292
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,832
Well, you should love her more.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,767
The more you know someone,
the more you should love them.

294
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,840
Okay. That's enough, Roz.

295
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,569
Your heart's as
strong as a battleship.

296
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,028
Does this mean
Dr. House was wrong?

297
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,850
Oh! Oh, my leg!

298
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,021
Heart's strong enough to prove you
wrong about the change in mental status.

299
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,794
Only proves this isn't lupus,

300
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,893
just as the leg pain
proves it isn't Wegener's.

301
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,030
Leg pain could be from nerve
entrapment. We're thinking blood clot.

302
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,668
Do an MRI to look for
the clot. Then do an FMRI.

303
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,870
An MRI alone will detect...

304
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,140
If the clot hasn't dissolved.

305
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,841
An FMRI could show signs
of a near-ischemic stroke

306
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,679
in post-ischemic
parts of the brain.

307
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,877
Give me 10 bucks.

308
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,544
No. I missed lunch.

309
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,817
I thought you went out
with... I missed lunch.

310
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,663
Good symmetrical activity
in both hemispheres.

311
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:22,099
Caudal structures look
okay. She hasn't changed?

312
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,336
Sex, drugs, rock and roll and the 600
rules of God are all in there somewhere.

313
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,774
We oversimplify people. It's
how the human mind works.

314
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,335
Everything's on or off.
Everything's got a category.

315
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,250
You don't like it.

316
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,047
You don't want to
be over-simplified.

317
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,787
<i>Roz, move your right leg.</i>

318
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,857
No one can describe
themselves in 10 words.

319
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,722
Why would we want to
hear anyone else do it?

320
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,092
So you keep it a mystery. No
categories if no one knows anything.

321
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,040
Do you think maybe you're
over-simplifying me, now?

322
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,088
No.

323
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,793
<i>I'm sure you have many reasons
to keep yourself a mystery,</i>

324
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,634
<i>besides the fact
that you're bisexual.</i>

325
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,039
<i>A denial would have worked
before the long vacant stare.</i>

326
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,046
<i>Roz, move your
left leg just an inch.</i>

327
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,914
People who have a problem with
boxes are people who don't fit in them.

328
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,319
You've been working
for House for a long time.

329
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,550
No need for name-calling.

330
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,924
I would ask if this was going to be
lunchtime gossip, but lucky for me...

331
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,189
I don't give a damn.

332
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,158
How's our mental Yentl?

333
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,466
MRI shows no sign of clots,
FMRI shows no problem areas.

334
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,630
Go restart her IV.

335
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,765
What's wrong with it?

336
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,437
Nothing. But like so many of the procedures
we put patients through, it hurts,

337
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,778
which, if she's enjoying it,
will show up in pretty colors.

338
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,817
This is why you wanted an FMRI?

339
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,012
It showed she didn't have a blood
clot, which is diagnostically relevant.

340
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,852
And it can show that she's become a
masochist. Also diagnostically relevant.

341
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,926
And it will be cool.

342
00:19:55,828 --> 00:20:00,630
Either explain which part of my
analysis didn't make sense, or go do it.

343
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,630
It isn't cool.

344
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,374
I'm sorry.

345
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,514
Heavens. Look at
her limbic system.

346
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,456
Her pleasure centers are
lighting up like a Hanukkah bush.

347
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,455
Foreman must have a
touch like an elephant.

348
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,588
<i>Okay, Roz, we've
got what we need.</i>

349
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,925
Yes. It was impressive.

350
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,031
Roz? You all right?

351
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,469
Oh, sorry. I was praying.

352
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,340
All through the procedure?

353
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:53,112
No, when Dr. Foreman apologized, I
knew something bad was going to happen.

354
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,687
She was praying. Could
explain the brain activity.

355
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,333
BP and heart rate are
dropping. She's crashing.

356
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,011
She's stabilizing.

357
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,487
Get her up.

358
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,190
All the way up. On her feet.

359
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,665
Make her do that again.

360
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,204
We've started her on
fludrocortisone and ephedrine.

361
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,715
It's <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

362
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,528
The apes are the humans.
Humans are the apes.

363
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,248
It's Wacky Wednesday,
opposite day.

364
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,799
When you stand up, your BP and
heart rate are supposed to go up. Not...

365
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:09,160
Got it. So, what causes bloody
urine, loss of bladder control, leg pain,

366
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,029
altered mental status and
pressure-blood in direction-wrong?

367
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,396
Pheochromocytoma?

368
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,991
Low catecholamines in the urine

369
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,003
means no pheochromocytoma
in the Jewess.

370
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,936
Could be systemic sclerosis.

371
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,063
Mental status.

372
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,233
She was praying.

373
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,072
She was in pain. You no
longer think she's crazy?

374
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,545
I can see why she'd
be attracted to that life.

375
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,250
You drank the
Manishewitz-flavored Kool-Aid.

376
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,717
I'm not saying I
agree. I'm just saying...

377
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,948
That there's a rational
basis for the irrational.

378
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,785
They have something
that we don't have.

379
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,052
Imaginary friends.

380
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,218
If the toaster's not
working, wiring could be bad.

381
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,371
Which debate is that metaphor
supposed to help us with?

382
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,673
Electrical problem in the heart.

383
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,441
Arrhythmia messes with her
blood flow when she stands,

384
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,797
causes low BP and heart rate.

385
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,302
Could also impact mental
status, everybody's happy.

386
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,871
Run an EP study of her heart.
Find where the wiring's <i>verklempt.</i>

387
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,312
I went by your hotel this morning.
They told me you moved out.

388
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,645
You moved in with CB?

389
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,482
No. Apparently, I
moved in with you.

390
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,131
The very fact that you're resisting
my insight proves to me that...

391
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,283
House. You're right.

392
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,953
Why not? Why not
date you? It's brilliant.

393
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,341
We've know each other for years,

394
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,625
we've put up with all kinds
of crap from each other,

395
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,634
and we keep coming
back. We're a couple.

396
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,379
Are we still speaking
metaphorically?

397
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,736
Amber is exactly what I need.

398
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,570
And you would agree if you
weren't mired in self-loathing,

399
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,634
topped with a thin
crust of megalomania.

400
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,476
Hey. That's my best friend's
girl you're talking about.

401
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,742
I was wrong.

402
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,182
House. You're right.

403
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:44,248
She's not me. Well, she is me.
But, that's not why she's attractive.

404
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,155
She's a needy version of me.

405
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,489
It's hard to imagine
such a mythical creature.

406
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,156
You started seeing
her right after I fired her.

407
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,325
I started seeing
her four months ago.

408
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,063
She told Kutner
it was four weeks.

409
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,468
You lied to me. There
was money on the line.

410
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,304
Because I knew how you'd react and
I knew you wouldn't pay me, anyway.

411
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,139
You knew that I was right.

412
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,204
She wasn't needy. She
was in a bad situation.

413
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,048
There's a difference.

414
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,641
Not to your libido.

415
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,784
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Why are you doing this?

416
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,622
Every time I agree with
you, you find a new argument.

417
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,027
What are you trying to avoid?

418
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:31,501
Well, if you'd looked at me with those
flashing eyes before I was involved...

419
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,428
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

420
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,106
And I use the French
because you're an ass.

421
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,441
Right atrium normal,
no arrhythmia.

422
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:49,386
You can become a D'har Master.
Does that require further explanation?

423
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,979
Right ventricle normal.

424
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,321
In college, I was really
into science fiction.

425
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,554
Not like the guys with
the $600 prosthetic ears,

426
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,741
who could swear in Romulan.

427
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,569
That was embarrassing
to the rest of us who

428
00:24:58,593 --> 00:25:00,391
just thought it was
good, smart literature.

429
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,493
I went to one convention. By senior year,
I was D'har Master in the Klingon Empire.

430
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,814
I'm not going to become Hasidic.

431
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,331
I'm not even going to
become slightly more Reform.

432
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,070
Coronary sinus normal.

433
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,221
You can't have your eyes opened
to something and not act on it.

434
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:18,206
I haven't had my eyes opened. I
just don't think they're crazy anymore.

435
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,380
Then they have
something to offer.

436
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,685
She's living proof that sane people
can make radical changes, but House...

437
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,225
He thinks that he can bully...

438
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,425
I'm sorry?

439
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,255
I think she's telling
you to stop deflecting.

440
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,199
Evil tongue. Gossip.

441
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,863
It's okay. Thanks to the
sedative, you won't remember it.

442
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,906
Words are permanent.

443
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:45,171
Someday, you'll say something
that you wish you could take back.

444
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,506
Hiss bundle is normal. Pathways
are all clean. No arrhythmias.

445
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,095
If the toaster doesn't work and
the wiring in the house is fine,

446
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,864
problem's got to be
in the city's power grid.

447
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,380
Autonomic nerve disorder.
Could be Riley-Day Syndrome.

448
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,857
Congratulations on your wedding.

449
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,418
You have a rare and
incurable degenerative disease.

450
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,096
I'll set her up for a
thermoregulatory sweat test.

451
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,895
She's bisexual.

452
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,898
What?

453
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,702
I could hear them talking
from inside the MRI.

454
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,002
Hear who? I heard the word sex.

455
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,567
It was interesting.

456
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,545
What was interesting?
It doesn't matter.

457
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,275
We're doctors, we never know
what's going to matter. She said sex.

458
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,250
If she wants to tell you,
when she wakes up...

459
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,811
Yeah. These people aren't
going to change you at all.

460
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,117
I need you to sleep with Wilson.

461
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,491
Good morning.

462
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,564
He's involved with an
inappropriate woman.

463
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,500
His people are sheep herders,
and Amber's are cattlemen?

464
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,163
He's combined two of his worst qualities.
His love for me and his love for need.

465
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,174
And as administrator of this hospital,
you have to save your star oncologist.

466
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,007
Wish I could help. But as administrator,
there are some people in accounting

467
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,742
I'm scheduled
to sleep with first.

468
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,176
Wilson has a pattern with women.

469
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,188
He saves them, then he betrays
them, which then causes guilt,

470
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,315
which then causes him
to go save somebody else.

471
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:10,795
For example, a hospital bureaucrat
nearing 40 who has no personal life.

472
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,456
I suggest you go braless.

473
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:16,525
I get that "sleep with" is your
way of saying I should talk to him...

474
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,194
No, I really mean "sleep with."

475
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,934
You're not worried this relationship
will fail, you're worried it'll succeed.

476
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,445
That Wilson will no longer
be at your beck and call 24/7.

477
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,174
That your best
friend will change.

478
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,875
People don't change just
because they wish they could.

479
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,953
And it bugs you that
he wishes he could.

480
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,648
You'll never lose
your friend, House.

481
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:40,056
You're the long-distance
runner of neediness.

482
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,555
As the chamber heats up, Roz's
body temperature should also rise,

483
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,498
making her sweat and
turning the powder purple.

484
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,536
No change in color
means no sweating,

485
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:54,073
which means her central
nervous system is damaged.

486
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,573
I shouldn't see her like this.

487
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,886
We could have a diagnosis as soon
as she comes out of the chamber.

488
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,208
It might be better
if you stayed.

489
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,143
It's disrespectful.

490
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,851
I'm sure she imagined the first time
her husband would see her bare like this,

491
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:08,183
would be celebrating
their marriage.

492
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:13,419
Given the circumstances, I think Roz would
sacrifice modesty to have you with her.

493
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,487
Please. Don't do that.

494
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,429
What? I think it's
nice that you're here.

495
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,523
I think... You think it's sweet

496
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:26,763
that I care for her modesty, but that
it's archaic and ultimately irrelevant.

497
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,206
Our traditions aren't
just blind rituals. They...

498
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,842
They mean something.
They have a purpose.

499
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,415
I respect my wife.

500
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,513
And I respect her body.

501
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,755
Her body temperature's
stopped climbing.

502
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,953
What's going on?

503
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,588
She's having a seizure.
Need a crash cart!

504
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,394
Blankets, too! She's freezing.

505
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,437
She was supposed to
sweat. And she froze.

506
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,736
<i>Return to the
Planet of the Apes.</i>

507
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,777
Hypothermia caused the seizure.

508
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,243
What caused the hypothermia?

509
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,540
Could be infection.

510
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,413
Her white blood
cell count was fine.

511
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,559
When she was admitted. She
could have picked something up here.

512
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,575
A complication
on a complication?

513
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,763
Her body's doing the opposite
of what it's supposed to.

514
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,653
Her body is Wilson.

515
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,849
How do we respond to that?

516
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,517
We accept that he's happy.

517
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,650
We do the opposite.

518
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,752
So, you want us to what?
Send the patient home?

519
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,596
An infection means that
something's been added to the body.

520
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:31,034
Something that should be
expelled. What's the opposite of that?

521
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,595
Something missing from the body.
Could be an enzyme or a hormone.

522
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,642
Cortisol. Could be Addison's.

523
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,869
It fits.

524
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,437
Every symptom.

525
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,981
I'll run a cortisol
stimulation test.

526
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:52,555
Are you sure she doesn't want
to just take you back to her lair,

527
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:56,026
hang you upside-down,
and deposit her eggs in you?

528
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,656
Excellent disguise, House.

529
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,792
You two are really that serious?

530
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:05,326
She's pretty. She's funny.
Maybe she's a little more...

531
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,404
Evil?

532
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,982
Aggressive than
you'd expect for me.

533
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:12,569
But, I'm happy. Can't I just enjoy
what that feels like for a while?

534
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,289
How many people have
looked at you trustingly

535
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,214
while you gave them
a fatal prognosis?

536
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,717
But you knew it was
kinder to tell them the truth.

537
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,847
Amber compulsively
looks out for number one.

538
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,085
You compulsively look out
for the person that you're with.

539
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,492
Your needs are going to feed
her needs until all that's left

540
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,555
is a Wilson chalk
outline on the floor.

541
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,863
Sorry.

542
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,668
Wow.

543
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:50,577
That cortisol stuff is great.
Does it work on everything?

544
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,048
I take it you're feeling better.

545
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,609
Still weak, but, yeah.

546
00:30:56,421 --> 00:31:00,449
You must be so tired. You should
go home and get some sleep.

547
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,027
I'll stay.

548
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:09,963
I never told you, but you are much better
looking than Mrs. Silver led me to expect.

549
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,559
She never liked me.
When I was eight,

550
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,696
I threw up on her shoes
at my uncle's wedding.

551
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,068
Your abdomen's a little swollen.

552
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,474
Is it serious?

553
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:23,140
It's hard to say. Sometimes it can
mean a liver issue. We'll have to test.

554
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,309
Oh. Oh, dizziness is getting...

555
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:31,265
She's going into shock, I need another
liter of saline! Type and cross two units!

556
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,315
What's happening to her?

557
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,157
She's bleeding internally.

558
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,495
She's saying the Sh'ma.
She thinks she's dying.

559
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:49,473
The MRA shows you're bleeding
internally, but not where it's coming from.

560
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,306
The blood can only keep
you stable for so long.

561
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,904
Our best option is to
open you up and search.

562
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,210
But you can fix it.

563
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,910
If we find the leak.

564
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,178
You find the bleeding,
you find the disease?

565
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,589
No.

566
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,968
But it could keep
you alive long enough

567
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:10,087
so Dr. House can find
what's wrong with you.

568
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,493
No.

569
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,648
I don't want to
have the surgery.

570
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,608
It's the only chance you've got.

571
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,305
I don't want to have the
surgery until after sunset.

572
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,674
I'm probably going
to die, anyway.

573
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,651
I just want to share one
Shabbat with my husband.

574
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:45,796
Roz, please. The Torah
commands us to preserve life.

575
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,167
I waited 38 years
to find what I wanted.

576
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,363
I can wait another eight hours.

577
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,041
And I'll leave the
rest to God, okay?

578
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,685
I had her rabbi
call. She's adamant.

579
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,390
She's not a masochist.
She's suicidal.

580
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,323
Nice work, Chase.

581
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,832
Yeah, I should have had
twin rabbis call. Can I go?

582
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,390
We need you.

583
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,896
So, instead of a few days, we now
have a few hours to figure this out.

584
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,038
Nice work, Chase.
Why do you need me?

585
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,045
Saying, "Nice work, Chase"
when you're not here is pointless.

586
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,104
Seriously. We need you.

587
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:43,412
We should X-ray for malformations of
the rib that could cause arterial twisting.

588
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,549
Malformations don't
cause bloody urine.

589
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,956
She's not suicidal.

590
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,391
She made a commitment to
a new life with her husband,

591
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,454
and she wants one meaningful
experience in that life.

592
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,588
She just met the guy.

593
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,344
Taub just met her and he's already
so in love he's ready to let her die

594
00:33:56,368 --> 00:34:00,931
and take her back to the home planet
for a burial in the lava sea of Tormiad.

595
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,701
It's who he might be.

596
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,573
She's connecting with all the
years she's not going to have.

597
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:09,479
A better way of connecting to
those years is to actually have them.

598
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,908
You want more time?

599
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:19,323
Joshua got God to make the sun stand
still. No reason God can't speed it up.

600
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:24,752
And by God, I, of
course, mean you.

601
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,765
Told you we needed you.

602
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,729
It's sundown, Roz.

603
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,398
We're taking you back to your
room for your candlelight dinner.

604
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,442
Ready? One, two, three.

605
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,110
It's too early.

606
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,742
Your sense of time is off
because of the medication.

607
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,664
Good <i>shabbos,</i> Roz.

608
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:10,006
So, you pray, scarf down some
challah, then we can do this?

609
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,123
You wanted to see me?

610
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,292
And you came.

611
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:34,163
I feel pretty confident it'll
be something interesting.

612
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,294
Solve this case
and the job is yours.

613
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,733
Is there a "Drop Wilson"
clause attached to this?

614
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,811
Standard contract
all employees sign.

615
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,350
Why do you have to believe
I have an ulterior motive?

616
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:04,362
For the same reason I believe a crack
whore is going to have sex for crack.

617
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,661
All my life,

618
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,532
I thought I had to
choose between

619
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,932
love and respect.

620
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,669
And I chose respect.

621
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,042
And with Wilson,

622
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,744
I know what it's
like to have both.

623
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,618
And that beats a fellowship.

624
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,841
Could be DIC.

625
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,709
You've changed.

626
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,909
I hope so.

627
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,620
Normal platelet count rules
out DIC. Good try, though.

628
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,956
I read that a
hydatid cyst could...

629
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,466
Would affect the
lungs, not the bladder.

630
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,732
I tested her white cell
count again. Normal.

631
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,148
How long till we
get to cut her open?

632
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,801
When I left, he was still
singing <i>Eshat</i> something.

633
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:01,404
It's the husband's blessing of
his wife. He calls her <i>Eshet Chayil.</i>

634
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:08,412
<i>Woman of Valor. “Strength and honor are
her clothing. She laughs at the future."</i>

635
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,045
Because she's an idiot.

636
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,026
Volvulus of the small
intestine could cause bleeding.

637
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,528
She would have had constipation.

638
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,861
Her value isn't beyond pearls, either.
Because dead people have no value.

639
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,232
Polycythemia vera.

640
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,203
RBC count would be higher.

641
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,335
I need to bring
the light to my face.

642
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,175
<i>Thrombocytopenia.
If it's autoimmune...</i>

643
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,377
<i>Titers were normal.</i>

644
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,215
Parkinson's would
explain the hypothermia.

645
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,779
Not the bloody urine.

646
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:49,123
The woman's not just a
masochist, she's a hypocrite.

647
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,425
<i>The commandment to preserve
life comes before all others.</i>

648
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,067
Actually means she's not a masochist.
She's not following all the rules.

649
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,432
Just the ones that please her.

650
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,767
Right. She walked in crazy and
explained how ritual trumps living,

651
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,602
and you decide it's
a beautiful lifestyle.

652
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,539
I know. She's wrong,

653
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,339
<i>but, if there's nothing more...</i>

654
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,141
<i>Then, the only meaning is here.</i>

655
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,306
<i>But if she thinks
God is there for her,</i>

656
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:14,147
if she lives her life
believing that God is there...

657
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,050
Then, she dies.

658
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:24,152
Things aren't where we want them to
be, just because we want them to be there.

659
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,402
Of course, that doesn't mean
they're where they should be.

660
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,402
Hey. Stop that Jew.

661
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,379
Chase hates working on <i>shabbos.</i>
I'm going to make this easier for him.

662
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,503
Stand her up.

663
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,824
She doesn't do
so well on her feet.

664
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,113
Neither do I. Stand her up.

665
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,830
You can tell all the ladies
at the Mikvah about this.

666
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,066
What did you do?

667
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,042
What are you doing?

668
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,349
Put your hand here. Press hard.

669
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,987
You have nephroptosis. Also
known as "floating kidney."

670
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,761
The kidney is like a chandelier.

671
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,065
It's attached to a ceiling of
intestines and blood vessels.

672
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,870
<i>But your contractor, I think you know
who he is, he hung it with a cheap chain.</i>

673
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,877
<i>It's been hanging
sloppy for years.</i>

674
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,435
<i>Finally, something
shook it loose.</i>

675
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,071
After that, every
time you stood,

676
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,945
your kidney dropped
a few centimeters.

677
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,348
That caused all
of your symptoms.

678
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,716
None of the scans picked it up.

679
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,846
Because we do scans
with patients lying down.

680
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,449
She would have been lying down in
surgery, too. They'd never have found it.

681
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,635
Good chance she'd
never come out.

682
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,683
She'll be all right?

683
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,194
Ultrasound to confirm.

684
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,788
Then, tell Chase, to put
the kidney back on the shelf.

685
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:09,026
The bleed will be nearby.

686
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,292
That's it?

687
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,402
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

688
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,598
Couple hours surgery,

689
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,437
you'll be ready to push
out those 14 children.

690
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,041
You do it both ways, right?

691
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,043
What? The ultrasound.

692
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,882
You do it standing
up and lying down.

693
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:32,080
What else would I mean?

694
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:52,000
I've decided you could do
worse than a female proxy for me.

695
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,755
So, you're going to acknowledge
that people can change?

696
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,317
No. You think I've changed

697
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,329
or Amber's changed? Nope.

698
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,023
Then, you've changed.

699
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,852
If you do change, can it be the
part of you that chases me down halls

700
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,664
trying to change me?

701
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,295
Do you know what this means?

702
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,966
That you made one
good dating choice.

703
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,205
The fabric of the space-time
continuum could unravel.

704
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,906
My world could
expand. I could form

705
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:33,417
a long-term connection,
that isn't with you.

706
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:36,818
And since you put the darkest
possible construction on everything,

707
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,414
you could end
up losing a friend.

708
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,354
You've thought of all this.

709
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,993
And yet, you're
going along with it.

710
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,936
Are you being self-sacrificing?

711
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,234
I'll sacrifice a lab rat.

712
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,774
I'll sacrifice a fly.

713
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,073
I'll sacrifice $200 on a
mudder at Monmouth Park.

714
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,171
I don't sacrifice self.

715
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,247
<i>Shabbat shalom,</i> Wilson.

716
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,845
<i>Shabbat shalom,</i> House.
