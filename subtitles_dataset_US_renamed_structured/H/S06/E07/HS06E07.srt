1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,208
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,300
Then don't eat it.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,142
Used to be a full breakfast
service. They're trying to starve us.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,977
You're worried about the food?

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,313
No, I'm worried about
what the food represents.

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,320
I've got seven scenes to shoot
today on half of what we used to spend.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,549
We're going through a
recession. It is what it is.

8
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,421
Yeah, but nobody's
gonna bail us out.

9
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,757
Free content everywhere,
DVD sales in the toilet,

10
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,094
now the back-office bean
counters are vetoing half my ideas.

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,362
So we can kind of make
it about the performances.

12
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,835
You okay?

13
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,030
Bit of a headache.

14
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,265
If you need an ibuprofen...

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,983
I need you to put your
game face on, right?

16
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,238
Screw the bagels, screw
the sets, screw the wardrobe.

17
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,301
You have any idea
how lucky we are?

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,006
We get to do something we like,

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,538
we get to touch people's
lives, and we get paid for it.

20
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,107
Let's make a movie.

21
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,618
Hey, baby.

22
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,593
All right. Roll camera.

23
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,690
And

24
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,493
action.

25
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,696
What's wrong?

26
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,808
My eyes. They feel
like they're exploding.

27
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,448
All right. Turn
off the damn light.

28
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,541
Get an ambulance. Now!

29
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,423
We're gonna be late for work.

30
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,617
Then we'll be late.

31
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,064
You took a patient's life.
You lied about it for weeks,

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,694
you broke who knows how
many laws and oaths to cover it up,

33
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,338
but I can live with it.

34
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,408
We can get through it together.

35
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,676
You have no idea what
I've been living with,

36
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,275
and what it means
to hear you say that.

37
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,549
But we need to get away
from Princeton-Plainsboro.

38
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,820
You can barely walk by the
rooms where Dibala was treated.

39
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,353
Why should we live with
that hanging over our heads?

40
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,801
If there was ever a
time to turn the page...

41
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,365
Three-month-old with fever,

42
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,173
incessant drooling, and
chronic muscle weakness.

43
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:04,947
Or porn actor Hank Hardwick, born
Henry Lefkowitz, totally clean workup,

44
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,317
collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

45
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,481
Or an infant as
limp as a rag doll.

46
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,650
Yeah. Let's wait till Chase
and Cameron get here.

47
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,936
I have the feeling they'll have
the good sense to side with me.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,259
Doesn't matter who they
side with, I'm still in charge.

49
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,560
We're taking the
limp three-month-old.

50
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,659
Oh, good, you paged
the limpness specialist.

51
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,467
This envelope is oddly
medical-licensed shaped.

52
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,807
Congratulations.

53
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,444
House is back in charge.
We get to treat a porn star.

54
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,855
Congratulations.

55
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,915
Perfect timing for us.

56
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:49,122
We're leaving the team and the
hospital, effective immediately.

57
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,066
It's kind of sudden.

58
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,277
Unless you've been circulating
your résumés for a while.

59
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,237
We're just starting to think about
new jobs, where we want to live.

60
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,569
Moving, too. Interesting.

61
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,800
Are you sure about this?

62
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:03,869
Yes.

63
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,272
We'll miss you.

64
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,373
We'll miss all of you, too.

65
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,146
We'll start clearing
out our things.

66
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,517
Run an STD panel
and a tox screen,

67
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,993
send a C-reactive protein
to look for inflammation

68
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,962
and an ANA to
screen for autoimmune.

69
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,558
The rest of you take a history and
do an LP to rule out viral encephalitis.

70
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,661
Oh, it's just you.

71
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:34,208
Here's hoping you're
good at multitasking.

72
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,178
I get tested for STDs regularly,

73
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,388
so does everyone I work with.

74
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,473
Since I'm guessing you
don't take their word for it...

75
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:47,510
All right. I'm gonna need you to lie on
your side and put your knees to your chest.

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,988
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

77
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,391
My wife used to smoke a little
pot, but I never touch the stuff.

78
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,827
You're married?

79
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,092
Happily. Two years now.

80
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,327
She happy you do porn?

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,801
Very. Since she does it, too.

82
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,036
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

83
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,473
It's a job.

84
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,053
Once you start letting your
work life rule your home life,

85
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,844
especially if you're in the same line of
work, your relationship's gonna be short.

86
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,350
You're gonna feel
a little pressure.

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,885
Any history of sexual abuse?

88
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,682
I defy the cliché.

89
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,848
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

90
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,519
Let me save you some time. There's
not a blotch on my medical record.

91
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,028
Look, I know most of
the people in my field

92
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,360
are drug addicts
with daddy issues.

93
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,425
But I'm a nice Jewish boy from
the 'burbs. I wasn't driven to this.

94
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,939
I chose it. I believe in
it. I actually think it's...

95
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,268
My arms are killing me.

96
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,538
Looks like tetany. Your
muscles are contracting.

97
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,840
Need some meperidine in here.

98
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,346
Oh, God.

99
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:52,142
Jew with megalophallus,
photophobia, and muscle spasm.

100
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,517
You tell me which
is the most unusual.

101
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,893
Four candidates,
three slots on the team.

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,259
Need to know if you've still
got your diagnostic chops.

103
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,594
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day.

104
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,099
I have my weekends again.
I recognize my wife again.

105
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,729
Yeah, I agree, does sound pretty
dull. No wonder you want to work for me.

106
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:14,468
Tox screen was clean, we
ruled out viral encephalitis.

107
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,882
The only obstacle to you
coming back is your wife,

108
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,218
which has never been that
much of an obstacle to you.

109
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,122
Maybe you're right.

110
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,397
The only link between
eye and muscle is the brain.

111
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,331
Tumor, seizure...

112
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,838
Taub seems to think the
link has to be the brain,

113
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,147
but eye and muscle are governed

114
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:53,511
by different parts of the patient's
second-favorite organ, which means it's...

115
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,613
Thailand was wonderful,
thanks for asking.

116
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,448
Of course, yes, it
has to be multi-focal.

117
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,148
I have an interview with a
community health clinic in two hours.

118
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,249
Backup plan's fine, but
Taub's swinging for the fences.

119
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,869
I suggest you don't
divide your attention.

120
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,863
Good point. I won't
divide my attention then.

121
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,308
Taub thinks it's a brain issue,

122
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,925
Thirteen thinks
it's multi-focal.

123
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,778
And neither of them
wants to work here.

124
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,031
Don't take their word for it.

125
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,538
Taub's problem is his wife,
Thirteen's problem is you,

126
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,576
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead African dictator.

127
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,271
None of them has a
problem with the work.

128
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,116
Cerebral vasculitis would explain
both the eye and arm findings.

129
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,311
Steroids to treat, brain
angiogram to confirm,

130
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,322
EMG and a nerve biopsy
while you're at it. I'll be at lunch.

131
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,918
I'd hire all four, but a
five-person team seems unwieldy.

132
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,921
Who would you turn down?

133
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,400
I'll have whatever he's buying.

134
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,368
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

135
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,565
There are a thousand people in the
world who want to be on your staff,

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,574
but you're going after
the four who don't.

137
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:59,079
They don't because their lives are
irrelevantly and annoyingly complicated,

138
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,206
which makes them confused, which
makes them make poor decisions.

139
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,716
And your life is simple?

140
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,685
You went all the way up to the
medical conference to cozy up to Cuddy.

141
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,417
Instead, she's dating one of two people
in the world you think of as a friend.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,288
There's no way
that's not devastating.

143
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,385
So I had an attraction of sorts.

144
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,861
Yeah, the sort in which

145
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,093
your imaginary tryst landed
you in a mental hospital.

146
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,397
And I got help,
and she got Lucas,

147
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,098
who bought me a
ginger ale. It's all fine.

148
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,083
Which won't be true
of my department

149
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,373
unless I can figure out
which doctor I'm not hiring.

150
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,510
I suppose throwing yourself into your
work isn't the worst thing you could do.

151
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,409
What is the worst
thing I could do?

152
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,785
House thinks it's
cerebral vasculitis.

153
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,367
If you could just do the brain angio
while I finish up the blood work...

154
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,518
We're out the door.

155
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,636
He's got me running every
test and treatment by myself.

156
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,458
Which is why you should
be out the door, too.

157
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,590
This is completely
unreasonable, even for House.

158
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,126
You owe me this.

159
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,941
Thank you.

160
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,635
You really believe this
is cerebral vasculitis?

161
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,771
Could be.

162
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,416
House wants to thread a
catheter through his brain,

163
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,883
which could cause a vasospasm,

164
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,263
give steroids, which could
spread infection all over the place,

165
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,414
because it could be.

166
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,081
Sounds like House.

167
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,991
It could also be a severe
vitamin D deficiency.

168
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,825
He has a restrictive diet,
works long hours indoors,

169
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,298
became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

170
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,843
You're saying I
shouldn't do the angio?

171
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,359
House ordered it, Foreman
wants it, of course we should do it.

172
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,962
I'm just saying
we're right to leave.

173
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,631
You sure?

174
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,005
Because right now I'd basically
do anything you asked me.

175
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,706
I'm not interested in guilting
you. We're moving on.

176
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,109
Right after I take the patient
to the phototherapy suite,

177
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,620
blast him with ultraviolet
light and IV vitamins

178
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,316
for his severe
vitamin D deficiency.

179
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,954
Do you guys actually
work together?

180
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,557
We did at first. But now we like
to keep our films pretty separate.

181
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,329
So, do you watch her work?

182
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,530
We're both busy
with our own stuff.

183
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,068
Think what you want, but
we're proud of what we do.

184
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,337
Divorcing sex from
all emotional content?

185
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,005
Emotion is emotional,
sex is mechanical.

186
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,378
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

187
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,542
Certainly not in your world.

188
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,749
We've helped a lot of couples

189
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,687
by taking sex out of
some deep, dark dungeon.

190
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,317
Do what you want without
some big moral comeuppance.

191
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,988
You think you can escape the
consequences, but you can't.

192
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,591
You don't get to make
your own rules and morals.

193
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,397
Well, you're here to treat
him, not lecture us about our...

194
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,303
Hank, are you all
right? Are you okay?

195
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,966
Just a nosebleed.

196
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,574
Inside his leg?

197
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,109
Petechial hemorrhages.

198
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,618
We were wrong, so was Foreman.

199
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,883
Patient's blood won't clot.
We're back to square one.

200
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,191
And you're back in my office.
So much for playing hard to get.

201
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,698
We're just here to help Foreman.

202
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,290
Is that...

203
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,978
He's not without talent.

204
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,235
UV rays made the patient's capillaries
more fragile, hastening the onset of DIC.

205
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,740
Sounds like sepsis... But isn't.

206
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,742
No sign of shock, no
drop in blood pressure.

207
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,902
Can we turn that off?

208
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,242
Right, because Cameron
thinks pornography is evil.

209
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,976
I don't care what he does. I
don't care what you watch.

210
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,628
I just think it's annoying that he
pretends it's some beautiful life

211
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,848
we should all be aspiring to.

212
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,617
Left shift points to bacteremia.

213
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,820
No fever, plus it wouldn't explain
the spasmodic muscle contractions.

214
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,625
The ball-and-chain
smacked you down.

215
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,792
But widespread petechial rash,
nervous system involvement...

216
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,168
It's some kind of blood
infection. Meningococcemia.

217
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,171
Start the patient on
heparin for the DIC,

218
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,177
broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.

219
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,745
Dr. Cameron.

220
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,615
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lock-step with you again.

221
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:03,020
I guess he finally told
you that he iced Idi Amin Jr.

222
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,489
Does that mean he can break
the other nine commandments, too?

223
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,255
Taking the Lord's
name in vain, sure,

224
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,956
but coveting thy
neighbor's wife?

225
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,429
Is she hot?

226
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,489
I've forgiven him.

227
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,194
Not for murder. Not you.

228
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,294
Doesn't matter
how evil Dibala was.

229
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,273
By every conscience-hugging,
Mother-Teresa-loving bone in your body,

230
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,367
you should be leaving
him, not leaving with him.

231
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,321
I thought your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

232
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,555
We're not talking
about my position,

233
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,224
we're talking about yours,
which doesn't add up.

234
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,993
Here's what doesn't add up. If you
were serious about staffing your team,

235
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,646
you would know exactly
which three fellows you wanted.

236
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,713
You plowed ahead with this case
even though you hadn't hired new fellows

237
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,349
because you knew Foreman
would ask Chase and me to help,

238
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,553
giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

239
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,358
I don't want that.

240
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,056
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

241
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,228
A, my firing Chase was the only
reason you left two years ago.

242
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,037
B, when the full horror of his homicide
hits you, your marriage will blow up.

243
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:59,307
And Z, the only obstacle of
you working here will be gone.

244
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,315
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

245
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,586
Meningococcemia's
spread person-to-person.

246
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:14,059
Something you ought to think
about next time you show up for work.

247
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,120
It's okay, your wife's not here.

248
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,241
I'm just telling you what...

249
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,064
You have to lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

250
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,411
But I can tell from
all the questions you

251
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:26,903
ask that you're more
like me than you admit.

252
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:31,502
I'm a guy, I look around every
once in a while, but I love my wife.

253
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,989
I love the fact that she's the
only one that I'm intimate with.

254
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:39,042
And no part of you wants to just toss
this rulebook everyone's forced on you?

255
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,952
No part of you wants a
life of actual commitment?

256
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,513
Is my relationship perfect? No.

257
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,421
Am I ever horny when my wife
has just had sex for nine hours? Yes.

258
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,131
But we are committed to each
other in every way that matters.

259
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,793
In other words,
you're committed,

260
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,360
except when you're
not committed.

261
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,737
Doesn't work so well if
you have a conscience.

262
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,902
Conscience? You mean
that thing that kicks in

263
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:08,107
when there's no logical reason to
behave the way people want you to?

264
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,377
What? You have a fever.

265
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,516
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

266
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,486
Mr. Takayama?

267
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,653
Yes.

268
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,162
I'm really happy with what
the last guy did with my eyes,

269
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,430
but why would broad-spectrum antibiotics
fail to work on meningococcemia?

270
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,768
If you'll excuse me, I've
got a real patient. Mr...

271
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,165
Hitler? Really?

272
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,918
I had to do something
to amuse myself while

273
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,682
your receptionist
fought with her boyfriend.

274
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,009
Who's next?

275
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,778
A guy who needs two decades' worth
of corn chips hoovered out of his neck,

276
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,344
or a guy who can't stand daylight
and whose blood won't clot.

277
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,719
You do the triage.

278
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:50,984
Who's the jerk?

279
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,084
Someone with zero
chance of hiring me back.

280
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,255
I told you. I'm content
at home and at work.

281
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,265
But you're not
content with content.

282
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,358
It's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,

283
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,699
why you cheated
on the wife you love.

284
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,261
At bridge.

285
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,801
My wife and I
play a lot of bridge.

286
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,452
Why you worked on the
case the last time I was here.

287
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,500
I gave you a theory,

288
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,989
just like I'd help a guy who
needs a Heimlich in a restaurant,

289
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,743
and then I shut the
door behind you.

290
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,444
Yeah. But you'd knock over
three other doctors to give it to him.

291
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,329
Metaphorically speaking,
you're a Heimlich addict.

292
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,651
And you're an addiction addict.

293
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,565
Right now, your drug of
choice is your old team,

294
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,801
and like any addict, you're
trying to solve some other problem,

295
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,003
and it's not gonna work. If
you'll excuse me, I have a...

296
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,690
You have a tight schedule
of nose jobs and tummy tucks.

297
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,699
Yes, I do nose jobs, just like the
guy who came here after a car crash,

298
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,361
couldn't even
breathe through his...

299
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,777
Antibiotics wouldn't work if his
sinuses were infected and clogged,

300
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:48,940
if there was a pocket of bacteria
his blood vessels couldn't reach.

301
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,611
You surgically drain his
sinuses, the drugs will work.

302
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,280
Nice.

303
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,356
Tell me that didn't feel good.

304
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,854
See you tomorrow.

305
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,957
Not coming back.

306
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,396
Looks like quite a trip.

307
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,971
It was.

308
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,869
House send you to talk to me?

309
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,006
No.

310
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,711
Then there's nothing to talk
about. I don't want to work for him.

311
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,157
You're a great doctor. House
is right to want you in the mix.

312
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,303
You saying this because
you still have feelings for me

313
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,487
and you want me to come back?

314
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm saying that
shouldn't be an issue.

315
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,657
Do you have
feelings for me or not?

316
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,467
I don't want our work life to have
anything to do with our personal life.

317
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,369
You couldn't keep them separate.

318
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,500
And that's why our
personal life doesn't exist.

319
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,134
None of that has to...

320
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,271
I can't work with you.

321
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,313
Actually, you can.

322
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,286
I was the one who had the
problem. I don't any more.

323
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,928
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

324
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,931
<i>I was... I was...</i>

325
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,931
What were you wrong about?

326
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:26,776
<i>You spent weeks elaborately concealing
the fact that you'd crashed daddy's car.</i>

327
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:31,511
<i>Then you just confessed. Seemed
idiotic, certain to end in disaster.</i>

328
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,783
<i>Instead, you're riding off
into the sunset together.</i>

329
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,220
<i>Any theories on why?</i>

330
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,919
I assume you've already
dismissed the "she loves me" theory?

331
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,551
<i>It's possible.</i>

332
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,572
It would require the
presupposition that everything

333
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,087
she's done for
the last six years

334
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,042
has been completely
inconsistent with her character,

335
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,762
but, yeah, it's possible.

336
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,599
As we've already established,
it's also possible that you're wrong.

337
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,004
<i>Or there's another explanation.</i>

338
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,307
<i>Since you don't have one,
I'm gonna keep looking for you.</i>

339
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,783
Let him drain, then pack it with
anesthetics and sterile gauze.

340
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,478
Do you have any idea
what's going on with House?

341
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,389
He's trying to get
his old fellows back.

342
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,983
It's called stalking.

343
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,962
I am way too busy to
play officer of the court.

344
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,522
That's a shame, since you're
the one who triggered this.

345
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,524
What do you see in Lucas anyway?

346
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,662
I don't see that it's
any of your business.

347
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,365
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

348
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,668
You could've at least told me,

349
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,185
so I wouldn't have coached him on
how to prove his worthiness to you.

350
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,806
I know you're upset with me because
I didn't choose to date your best friend,

351
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,281
but I'm living my life.

352
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,443
For the first time.

353
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:43,319
I'm not gonna change that because
of how it might affect him, or you.

354
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,127
I feel like crap.

355
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:58,435
Yeah, look, our relationship is gonna
be about House or it's gonna be about us.

356
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,970
I vote for it being about us.

357
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,373
House is gonna make
it about him for us.

358
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,537
This is very insulting. You're
apparently shocked by this,

359
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,174
which means that you thought that
there was some way that we could date,

360
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,515
get married, have two
kids, a dog, retire to Florida,

361
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,418
all without House finding out.

362
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,084
Or you thought that we
wouldn't date all that long.

363
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,303
The first means
you're delusional,

364
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,489
the second means I'm delusional.

365
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,941
Technically, it could also mean
you thought House had matured,

366
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,676
but then we're
back to your being...

367
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,168
Shut up.

368
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,870
You're right. I'm sorry.

369
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,406
I'm also flattered.

370
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,619
Yeah, 'cause you acted all
cool and everything with Wilson,

371
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,943
but you feel comfortable enough
with me that you can freak out.

372
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,311
That's cool.

373
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,182
His sinuses are clear. The
antibiotics should work this time.

374
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,786
Why did you forgive me?

375
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,357
I mean, I'm glad, I'm
grateful, but I'm confused.

376
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,674
You've been harder on the
patient than you've been on me.

377
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:09,506
The difference between you and
the patient is that you feel shame, guilt.

378
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,837
That's how I know we're
gonna get through this.

379
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,606
My stomach.

380
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,111
It really hurts.

381
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,386
His liver's failing.

382
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,856
His liver's failing and his
abdomen keeps filling with fluid, so...

383
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,264
It's not meningococcemia.

384
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,394
No matter how much you
finish each other's sentences,

385
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,565
don't count on being a
diagnostic package deal.

386
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,073
Patient's liver's not working.

387
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,111
We don't have time for
your little team-stakes.

388
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,045
Sometimes you're just wrong.

389
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,326
Something genetic, something in
his family history we overlooked?

390
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,978
History and
genetics are spotless.

391
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,630
Plus, every time he had a bad
cough as a kid, he went to a doctor.

392
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,520
Klatskin tumor,
obstructing his bile ducts?

393
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,559
No jaundice, wouldn't
have ocular effects.

394
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,891
But if it's inflammation inside the
bile channels, sclerosing cholangitis.

395
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,773
Could've stopped him from
producing clotting proteins,

396
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,891
damaged his blood cells,
causing small strokes.

397
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,903
Enough, enough! Stop
pummeling Thirteen and Taub.

398
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,641
It fits. Prep the
patient for an ERCP,

399
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,087
see if there's any hope of
opening his blocked bile channels.

400
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,240
And tell them to start
looking for a liver donor.

401
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,549
Dr. Chase.

402
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,417
Your turn.

403
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,056
So what did she say?

404
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,057
She forgave me
because I feel guilty.

405
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,018
That works, too.

406
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:39,156
And now you expect me to
ask you what the "too" refers to?

407
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,566
Only if you're interested. Only if
you have doubts about her answer.

408
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,669
She thinks that you don't
have anything to feel guilty about

409
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,540
because you didn't
kill anybody, I did.

410
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,643
She blames me for
Dibala's murder, not you.

411
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,876
You were barely involved
in that case, she knows that.

412
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,081
But I created the big, bad, evil
climate that allowed it to happen.

413
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,055
You're wrong.

414
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,557
Powerful counter-argument.

415
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:09,391
Why are you doing this? Why
are you trying to screw things up?

416
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,430
You got the tense wrong.

417
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,221
Things are already screwed up.

418
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,534
Which is why you don't just
want to work for me, you need to.

419
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,128
Cameron thinks you're
my personal sock puppet.

420
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:22,972
If you don't stay, it's gonna
be hard to prove you're not.

421
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,567
I have to go.

422
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,324
Last week, my cane
could only do 10 minutes.

423
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,863
What are you doing here?

424
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,628
Waiting for you to take a nap
so I can surge into the lead.

425
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:56,837
What's the best way to restore the liver
in someone with sclerosing cholangitis?

426
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,036
Not getting drawn into this.

427
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,271
You already are.

428
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,779
Because you crashed my workout?

429
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,680
You're doing core training,
which improves balance,

430
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,584
which staves off the most
debilitating symptoms of Huntington's.

431
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,986
You've ended your
self-destructive streak.

432
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,286
You want to do
something significant,

433
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:16,261
something that'll last longer
than the few years you have left.

434
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,855
My team is your
first, best choice.

435
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:23,869
And my first choice is the community
health clinic I interviewed with yesterday.

436
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,404
Absolutely, you should do that.

437
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:29,203
Three hours a week, every doctor
should, because every doctor can.

438
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,369
But you don't want
to be every doctor.

439
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,641
Plus, on my team, you
get to screw with Foreman.

440
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,680
Every way but literally.

441
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,877
Why are you doing it this way?

442
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,412
You're pretending to
assume we're all coming back,

443
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,888
without actually asking us. Why?

444
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:47,791
See, this is why you'd be
miserable wiping noses in a clinic.

445
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,798
You can't ask because
you can't face the rejection.

446
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,094
Why not? What's going on?

447
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,657
Are you asking me to ask you?

448
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,296
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

449
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:05,467
We don't know how much the sclerosing
cholangitis has damaged your liver.

450
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,139
It might be in a
year, might be in 10,

451
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:12,084
but the odds are you're
gonna need a new one.

452
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:18,183
And you should know, while no
transplant committee will say this openly,

453
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:22,388
they'll never grant an organ to
someone working in your profession.

454
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,224
You're saying I
have to change jobs?

455
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,592
You're medically advising
me to change jobs?

456
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,795
Hank, if you're too sick...

457
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,847
She wants me to have some
kind of religious conversion.

458
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,396
She's practically
salivating over it.

459
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,271
I'm just being candid about...

460
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:40,211
So you don't think I'm scum, just
some committee thinks I'm scum?

461
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,043
That your lifestyle has risks.

462
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,983
You work around more sick people,
and germs, and blood than I do.

463
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,681
I'm not gonna live my life
afraid like my parents did.

464
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,920
Barely letting me play outside
and God forbid that I get a scratch.

465
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,988
I'll talk to him. He'll calm down
and realize that this is the only way.

466
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,395
No. No, I won't.

467
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,832
Why does everyone want to
dictate the way I live my life?

468
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,995
Because the way we're
living it is gonna kill you.

469
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,139
Passing the pancreatic duct.

470
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,679
Don't listen to House.

471
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,181
You have no idea what he said.

472
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,080
I know that House
is manipulative.

473
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,150
I know that you're in a
vulnerable state right now.

474
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:24,247
And I know that Cameron wants
your marriage to work, so do you.

475
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,985
So don't listen to House.

476
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,493
House doesn't make my decisions.

477
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,830
I'm in the common bile duct.

478
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,093
What's that mass? Gallstone?

479
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,928
Can we magnify times five?

480
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,040
That's not a gallstone.

481
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,909
His liver's completely
filled with worms.

482
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,712
You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.

483
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,549
They disseminated all over your
body, causing all your symptoms.

484
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,815
How'd I get a parasite?

485
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,689
Most likely through sexual
activity, but we can't be sure.

486
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,457
And what's the treatment?

487
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,962
Two mebendazole pills.

488
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,266
That's it?

489
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,894
You'll be fine. Your liver,
too. Go back to your lives.

490
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,012
You know this is
the doctors' lounge.

491
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,172
I know.

492
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,913
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

493
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,384
You are good at it, by the way.

494
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,019
Why are you reading my charts?

495
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,020
Because I'm worried
about my girlfriend.

496
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,787
Your girlfriend is
a male porn star?

497
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,354
No, I'm dating Lisa Cuddy.

498
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,663
Seriously? Cool, huh?

499
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,179
And if House doesn't have his
team, that'll make her miserable,

500
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,796
which will make me miserable.

501
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:50,309
Which brings us to the fact that you
have elevated noting to an art form.

502
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:51,637
I see the connection.

503
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,008
Most doctors write "9:00 a.m."

504
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,756
if they scrub in at
9:00 or anything near it.

505
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,343
You write "9:03" and you make little
notations when procedures are delayed.

506
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,281
You're easily impressed.

507
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,982
Well, yeah. I was.

508
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:08,050
Until I saw that you had virtually
stopped writing them about four weeks ago.

509
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,561
Been busy. Got a backlog.

510
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:15,192
Yeah, people with your level of
precision don't really just get backlogs.

511
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:20,206
No one knows why
you're leaving PPTH.

512
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,570
Because it's personal.

513
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,366
If something happened...

514
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,810
I mean, if you're leaving to get away
from something that you did, or she did,

515
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,575
or both of you did...

516
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,811
I mean, emotionally, maybe you
want to run away, but in my experience,

517
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:35,878
if you're staring at a pit
bull in some guy's back yard,

518
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:39,057
you're better off staying
right where you are.

519
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,390
Face the problem, that way
it can't bite you in the ass.

520
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,231
Thanks for the folksy wisdom.

521
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,662
Hey, you got any dirt
on any of the other three?

522
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,008
It'd really help me out.

523
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,491
I thought you said those
two pills was all he needed.

524
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,559
Lungs are filling with fluid.

525
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,848
Suction him and
get him on oxygen.

526
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:15,620
Patient's lungs are severely
compromised, liver's still failing.

527
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,720
Worms could easily
have been a coincidence.

528
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,526
Almost be surprising
if he didn't have them.

529
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:23,262
Which means it could be a hematological
problem plus cardiomyopathy.

530
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,794
No. Neck veins are flat,
precordial exam was normal.

531
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,568
What if it's lymphoma?

532
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,474
Peritoneal carcinomatosis
explains the liver failure,

533
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,843
paraneoplastic syndrome
explains everything else.

534
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,785
Lymphoma it is.
Prep him for chemo.

535
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,986
Fax Taub and Thirteen the
latest update on the case.

536
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,559
Seriously?

537
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,206
They have as much right to
know as anyone on the team.

538
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,563
You either like the
diagnosis or you don't.

539
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,433
If you don't, we need to keep
talking. If you do, you need to shut up.

540
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,199
What we don't need
is this stupid game.

541
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,105
You're mad at House,
but you're not mad at me.

542
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,583
Do you want me to be mad at you?

543
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,586
You blame House, not me.

544
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,713
I'm mad at House
because he's an ass.

545
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,849
And I am mad at you, but
I don't want to leave you.

546
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,692
What I did may be the worst
thing I ever did, it may be the best.

547
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,755
I'm either a murderer or a guy
who stopped a mass murderer.

548
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,858
But I did it. Me.

549
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,832
And even if it destroys
me, I'd do it again today.

550
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,315
You don't mean
that. This isn't you...

551
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:39,175
I'm not running away from what I did
because you want to pretend I never did it.

552
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,606
If that's how you feel,

553
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,413
okay.

554
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,020
My strategy is not
completely working.

555
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,464
All four of them
want to work for me,

556
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,729
but all four of them have reasons
why they don't want to work for me.

557
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,136
How do I get them to take one from
column A and none from column B?

558
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,340
Right.

559
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,678
Right, by not saying anything, you're
saying that the answer's inside me?

560
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,876
The answer has nothing
to do with the question.

561
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,782
Then it's not
technically the answer.

562
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,753
Why do you need
three of these doctors?

563
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:28,192
Because I know they're good. Other doctors
fall into the might-be-good category.

564
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,922
It has nothing to do
with them being good,

565
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,691
you think they're
idiots half the time.

566
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,808
But they're comfortable.
You feel abandoned by Cuddy,

567
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,269
so you're reaching out to
people you know for comfort.

568
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,932
Oh, my God, you're right.
I don't need doctors at all.

569
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,732
I just need a good friend.

570
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,167
Cuddy's right.

571
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,180
Maybe, just maybe, if I
don't play along, you'll realize

572
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,775
you can't solve a deeper
problem with a surface solution.

573
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:57,081
Would've been more profound
if you hadn't said anything.

574
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,792
You okay?

575
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,225
Getting through it.

576
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,786
Be a lot easier once you
two are away from here.

577
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,024
Yeah.

578
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,397
He's peeing blood.

579
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,727
BP's rising.

580
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,897
Heart rate is up to 250.

581
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,066
He's going into cardiac arrest.

582
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,139
Charging. Clear.

583
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,636
He's bleeding out.

584
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,238
His body's
completely giving out.

585
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,943
Charging. Clear.

586
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,162
We've got him stabilized,

587
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,155
but no red cells,
no white cells,

588
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,713
practically no platelets either.

589
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,589
Mebendazole can cause adverse
effects, but nothing like this.

590
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,254
He's been off it since
yesterday anyway.

591
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,629
Long passes, wild
guesses, anything.

592
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,762
Hypopituitarism? Could
cause multi-organ failure if...

593
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,306
If his thyroid hormone
wasn't completely normal.

594
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,807
Renal cell carcinoma.

595
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,309
Renal ultrasound was clean.

596
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,743
I'd say aleukemic leukemia,

597
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,490
marrow's not making
enough normal cells, but...

598
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:59,246
Ablate the patient's bone
marrow, find him a donor match.

599
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,281
You want to nuke
the patient's marrow?

600
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,619
He had no evidence of being
anemic or immune-compromised

601
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,667
when he was admitted...
Perfect white count as well.

602
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,989
Ablation could kill him,

603
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,086
or leave him defenseless
against an infection that could.

604
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,655
Then come up with
something better.

605
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,106
He may as well die
while we're treating him.

606
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,469
Okay with you if I bring the other
candidates into the loop now?

607
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,481
The risks, they're
really minimal.

608
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,612
We'll do a series of
painless injections...

609
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,288
Excuse me.

610
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,286
The whole thing can
be done as an outpatient.

611
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,809
You're leaving at 11:00 a.m.?

612
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,016
Trust me, the
case is almost over.

613
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,580
Foreman told me you're
ablating the patient's marrow

614
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,646
on a non-theory that
Foreman himself withdrew.

615
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,089
You're gonna kill the patient.

616
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,790
Is this about me and Lucas?

617
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,867
I want alternatives
for the patient.

618
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,129
So do I.

619
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,973
I want to be on the team.

620
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,322
You think that's gonna
save your marriage?

621
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,351
I don't know.

622
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,031
Four candidates, three spots.

623
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:00,303
I got a tough
decision ahead of me.

624
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,231
<i>Hi. Remy, this is Dr. Turner
from the Pennsauken Free Clinic.</i>

625
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,897
<i>We all loved meeting
you, and the job's yours.</i>

626
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,702
<i>Call me back, let's
pick a start date.</i>

627
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,356
I want it to look natural. I
mean, much younger, but natural.

628
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,453
Can you get rid of the
crow's feet altogether?

629
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,623
Or is it better to
leave a trace of them?

630
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,361
I don't look old enough to
have them anyway, do I?

631
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,493
Absolutely.

632
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,968
I do look old enough?

633
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,036
No.

634
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,265
I'm sorry. Hang on a second.

635
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,148
Why are you here?

636
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:24,417
Because I think we're wrong, which
means something's gonna go wrong.

637
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,023
Or right.

638
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,220
Takayama here.

639
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,456
It's me and Thirteen,
stop the ablation.

640
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,659
Because...

641
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,854
<i>Those threadworms.</i>

642
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,769
Why would his body have gone to
hell just hours after they were gone?

643
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,918
The worms weren't hurting
him, they were helping him.

644
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,238
He has extra-intestinal Crohn's.

645
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,574
<i>He got it from being
raised in too clean,</i>

646
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,409
<i>too overprotective
of an environment.</i>

647
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,790
<i>It's the hygiene hypothesis,</i>

648
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,226
<i>why there's so much autoimmune
disease in the developed world,</i>

649
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,878
and almost none in
the developing world.

650
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,080
<i>The worms were keeping
the Crohn's in check,</i>

651
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,239
teaching his immune
system what it should've

652
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,989
learned from eating
dirt growing up.

653
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,289
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

654
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:08,098
So his life of filth wasn't the
problem, the clean living was.

655
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,731
We'll start him on
methylprednisolone.

656
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,600
And some helminths.

657
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,802
Worms. Cool, huh?

658
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,608
Best out of three?

659
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,111
<i>Have you been a bad boy?</i>

660
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,282
<i>Yeah, that's...</i>

661
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,859
I want to be on the team.

662
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,264
Good news for your wife.

663
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,093
Thanks for the sarcasm.

664
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,766
I reorganized my life to
spend more time with her,

665
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,469
but apparently I don't love
her as much as I thought.

666
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,444
Or you love her more.

667
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,244
This job gives you the thrill you
used to find through philandering.

668
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,810
Better to cheat with
a beaker and an MRI

669
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,516
than one of your platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

670
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,388
I'll let you know.

671
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,080
I told House I want
to work for him again.

672
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,379
Stay on the team.

673
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,014
You were always
more into it than I was,

674
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,785
more interested in diagnostics.

675
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,518
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

676
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,397
Four for four.

677
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,448
I was in love with you.

678
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,208
I was an idiot.

679
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,488
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you,

680
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,616
because I thought
I could heal you.

681
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,124
You almost killed that patient.

682
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,166
If almost not saving
his life means...

683
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,394
You knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

684
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,495
You risked another patient's
life to bait your old team.

685
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,039
Another one?

686
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,506
You did kill Dibala.

687
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,368
By playing God and
teaching us to do the same.

688
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,037
I taught you to
think for yourselves.

689
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,423
You don't even think
of them as people,

690
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,973
they're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

691
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,313
You celebrate their humanity,

692
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,752
I'd rather solve those little
puzzles and save their lives.

693
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,985
Motives do matter.
Lives can't come second.

694
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,720
The patient is alive.
That's what matters.

695
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,227
Not to you.

696
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:54,096
All you care about is that Taub
and Thirteen fell for your game.

697
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,260
You'll poison them just
like you poisoned Chase.

698
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:02,172
Your husband killed a patient
and you're breaking up with me?

699
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,266
You ruined him,

700
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,344
so he can't even
see right from wrong,

701
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,952
can't even see the sanctity
of a human life any more.

702
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,320
I loved you, and I loved Chase.

703
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,565
I'm sorry for you both,

704
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,130
for who you've become because

705
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,134
there's no way
back for either of you.

706
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:46,441
Any idea where I can get a great
big "Mission Accomplished" banner?

707
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:53,208
Got my sanity back, my
license back, and now...

708
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,082
You're kidding. All of them?

709
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,851
Three out of four,

710
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,518
which is almost as
good as four out of five.

711
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,788
Who was the... Cameron.

712
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,524
Wow. I can't believe it.

713
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:11,433
I mean, really.
I can't believe it.

714
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,767
You were right,
House. Good for you.

715
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,933
Yeah. It is.

716
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:25,847
She's broken up with Chase,
and she's leaving the hospital. Still,

717
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,715
three out of four ain't bad.
