159
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,734
I take maybe 1 in 20 cases.

160
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:30,705
A lot of the people I turn down
end up dying.

161
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,440
It's really a good argument

162
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,141

more than one me

163

Wait, just--
just because I'm bisexual?

Well, yeah.

Do you understand
what bisexual means?

171
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,527
It doesn't mean you have sex
with two people at once.

172
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,396
And by the way,
you didn't ask me

173

Truth or dare?

174
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,665
Wait.
You've had a foursome?

<i>No, but now you've asked me</i>

00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:12,372
Oh!

00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:23,648
but he's your stepson.

183
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:27,717
We can't ignore
any possibility.

184
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,822
Walker's been getting
in fights a lot

185
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,457
at school lately.

186
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,659
Last week, he hit another kid
with a book

187
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,529
hard enough
to draw blood.

188
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,903
If he did something
to the baby...

189
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:05,018
We were working
on it.

190
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,554
And we failed.

191
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,122
No, you had a conversation
with house,

192
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,723
then came back,
informed me

193
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,191
I'd been forever poisoned
by him,

194
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,624
and started packing.

195
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,792
It's interesting how your story
leaves out the part

196
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,326
where you murdered
another human being.

197
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,795
A dictator
who was committing genocide.

198
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,397
You thought
about doing it yourself.

199
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:23,931
But I didn't.
<i>Right.</i>

200
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,597
Because you're not toxic
like I am.

201
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:30,067
What do you think
is gonna happen here?

202
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,035
You're gonna logic me
into coming back?

203
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:38,773
<i>There must be over 30</i>
<i>malpractice settlements</i>

204
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,107
in here.

205
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:43,277
He did a brain biopsy
without ct mapping,

206
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:46,980
causing brain herniation
and death.

207
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,114
Look at this one.

208
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,582
Patient lost
four liters of blood

209
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,153
from a botched penisectomy.

210
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,655
On a patient
named Lisa Cuddy?

211
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,792
Damn it.
They're all named Lisa Cuddy.

212
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,594
He's not even here,
and he's screwing with us.

213
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,229
Where's the joy in that?

214
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,968
You really want
to get into his head?

215
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:15,237
Yeah, but I decided against
stabbing myself in the leg

216
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,172
or getting addicted
to pain pills.

217
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,643
You can, uh...
Skip the stabbing.

218
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,344
Where did you--

219
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:25,780
confiscated them from
a drug seeker in that clinic.

220
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,981
Didn't get a chance
to turn 'em in.

221
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:32,187
It is after hours.

222
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,859
I'll take one.

223
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,661
Walk in House's shoes
for a night.

224
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,963
One?

225
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,165
I believe he wears
a larger size.

226
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:50,274
♪ ♪

227
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,344
no cards,
no flowers,

228
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,912
not even a phone call.

229
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,215
Let me guess.
Lighthouse keeper.

230
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:01,352
I was a classics Professor
at Princeton for 26 years.

231
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,121
Mostly research.

232
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,956
So your closest colleagues
died 2,000 years ago.

233
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,158
That must be it.

234
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,459
Not that you have no friends

235
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:12,462
because, say,
you're a miserable bastard.

236
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,034
What do you care?

237
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,070
The next few hours
are gonna be grim.

238
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,939
There'll be nausea, pain,
no company,

239
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,610
as soon as I can
get myself out of here.

240
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,178
I can unlock
the regulator.

241
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,747
You can put yourself
in a narcotic haze,

242
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,216
sleep blissfully
to the end.

243
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,620
Oh, is that a favor
to me or to you?

244
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,721
Win-win.

245
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,623
No, thanks.

246
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:43,159
Are you trying to guilt me
for not taking your case?

247
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:47,229
You think a classicist
doesn't believe in fate?

248
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:48,397
You think Odysseus
would lie whimpering

249
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:50,298
like a loser
in a hospital bed?

250
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:54,268
Come on,
take my offer.

251
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:57,004
Take the drug holiday.
Numb yourself out.

252
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:04,043
I think you're the one
who wants to numb himself out.

253
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,492
Truth.

254
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:20,454
How did your dad react
when you came out to him?

255
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,987
He made me tea.

256
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:23,956
<i>Seriously.</i>
<i>Doesn't matter what I tell him.</i>

257
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,590
He smiles, tells me
he supports me,

258
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,120
and makes me
some peppermint tea.

259
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,254
Truth or dare?

260
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,623
Um, truth.

261
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,724
Are you dating
anyone?

262
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:34,758
Now? No.

263
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,392
Interesting.

264
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,094
You added a modifier.

265
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:40,663
<i>Truth.</i>

266
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,098
Um, when you were dating
Foreman...

267
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,133
No, no. No.
What?

268
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,171
If it was something personal
about him or us,

269
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,372
I just don't think
that's right to answer.

270
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,673
We all work together.

271
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:51,941
That's the whole point
of this game--

272
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:52,942
something personal,
preferably embarrassing.

273
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,176
Just pick something else.

274
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:55,544
You see,
this is your problem.

275
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,512
You act like
you're so liberal and open,

276
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,880
but you are the least--

277
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:00,644
I changed my mind.
Dare. Just no nudity.

278
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:01,812
Yes, nudity.

279
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:06,283
I want you
to show your breasts

280
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,418
to Taub.

281
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:12,326
That is the most
idiotic dare ever.

282
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,160
<i>Have you ever played</i>
<i>this game?</i>

283
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,962
Well, I thought showing me
your breasts

284
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,831
would be
a little exploitative.

285
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,732
Your dare
is in the future, genius.

286
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,533
Hey, if you're saying
you won't do it...

287
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,269
No, no, no, of course
I'll show my breasts to Taub.

288
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:27,603
Tomorrow, perhaps,

289
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:29,871
or maybe some time
next year, you know,

290
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,704
because I'm honor-bound.

291
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,170
Truth or dare?

292
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:40,889
It's understandable that you
wouldn't be happy right now.

293
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,092
Your world is changing.

294
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,229
You scared?

295
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,799
And how do you feel
about your sister?

296
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,670
I hate her.

297
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:57,010
Walker,
this is important.

298
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:59,146
Did you do anything
to the baby?

299
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:02,084
<i>Did you move her</i>
<i>somewhere?</i>

300
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,919
Hide her?
No.

301
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,421
Nobody'd be mad
at you.

302
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,390
I said no,
so stop asking me.

303
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,598
Bad pain day?

304
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,734
Bad pain month.

305
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:23,238
Since I'm not using it...

306
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,173
Oh, if you don't
want the morphine,

307
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:26,674
you must have something
of your own, Hmm?

308
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,611
I was in rehab.

309
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,446
I had a little problem
with the something of my own.

310
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,682
Now all I take
is ibuprofen,

311
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,016
and it's two flights up.

312
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,084
For the whole month?

313
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,386
The pain's migrated.

314
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,221
I think the arterial wall
is damaged.

315
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,556
What, you don't know?

316
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,058
I haven't had
an arteriogram yet.

317
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,927
And you don't want the test.

318
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,764
<i>In case the arterial wall</i>
<i>is fine.</i>

319
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,865
<i>Which would mean</i>
<i>that the pain</i>

320
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:54,703
is coming
from something else.

321
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,937
What's her name?

322
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,807
Interesting...

323
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:03,245
That you jump from physical pain
to long-lost love.

324
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:06,381
You're projecting.

325
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:07,449
So what's <i>her</i> name?

326
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,087
What time is it?

327
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:13,388
What does it matter
to you?

328
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,823
It's "t" minus four hours.

329
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,928
8:20.

330
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,330
Now tell me
who she is

331
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,732
and what are
the pathetically long odds

332
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,699
that she's gonna visit
or call.

333
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,135
Why that's a reason
not to take the morphine.

334
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,244
♪ ♪

Mine is.

339
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,137
Maybe we shouldn't have taken
so many.

340
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:59,301
I'm gonna try
to stand up.

341
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,235
You be careful.

342
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,209
Oh, yeah.
That's working.

343
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,081
I can't feel my face.

344

Way.

346
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,421
Hit me.

347
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:26,958
What?

348
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,030
Hit me
in the face.

349
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:30,331

You know

351
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,103
Now's your chance.
That's a great idea.

352
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:37,572
We start a fight club.

353
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,808
Maybe we...

354
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,776
Oh, my God!

358
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,949

This is your credentials file?

00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:09,132
Hey, give me that.

364
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,867
That's why
you came down here.

365
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,535
Not for the patient file.

366
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,770

367
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:18,004

368
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,542
Okay, Robert.

373
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,891
How can you even ask that?

374
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,259
The first time you slept
with me

375
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:41,559
was because you were
on crystal meth.

376
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:44,295
I was on the drugs
because I was emotional.

377
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:45,563
It was the emotions
that led to the sex,

378
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,866
not the drugs.
Not true.

379
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,268
After that, you refused to let
it go further than just sex.

380
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:52,237
Because I knew
I was falling for you

381
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,239
and I didn't want to.

382
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,440
And that never changed.

383
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,908
You broke off
our vacation

384
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:57,243
because I bought you
a ring.

385
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,244
I got cold feet.

386
00:18:58,312 --> 00:18:59,478
I'm not proud.

387
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:00,613
And then you almost
called off our wedding

388
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,780
because you couldn't
give up the idea

389
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,382
of having
your dead husband's baby.

390
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:04,916
Don't!
Don't bring him up!

391
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,585
Because even then,
you weren't sure about me.

392
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:09,220
Maybe if I was dying
when you married me,

393
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,421
it would have been
a bit different.
That's not fair.

394
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,222
It's not only fair,
it's exactly the point.

395
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,690
He was dying
when you met him,

396
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,159
and he was gone just a year
into the marriage.

397
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,860
So it was all
a honeymoon with him.

398
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,428

match up to that.

399

402
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:26,666

When Gracie was six.

462
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:48,255
I was sort of
forced out, actually,

463
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:51,792
after I'd had an affair
with a student.

464

For sex
or love?

465
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:57,297
Neither.

466
00:22:57,364 --> 00:23:01,902
I'd only married Gracie's mother
because of the baby.

467
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:05,672
But I didn't think
I could handle commitment,

468
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,609
and, like any decent academic,
I proved myself right.

469

in Atlanta.

472
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:17,915
She gets home from work
at 9:00,

473
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:20,784

to speak to her one more time.

474
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:23,920

that I'm better off that way.

483
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:57,555

541
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:14,396
You asked me
how my dad reacted

542
00:28:14,463 --> 00:28:15,864
when I told him
I was bisexual.

543
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,165
And the huntington's.

544
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:19,400
No tea party?
I never told him.

545
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,469
He's been through enough.

546
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:25,239
So he just visits his
heterosexual, healthy daughter,

547
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,776
and you go out to dinner
and a movie

548
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:29,979
and talk about your garden?
I work late.

549
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,246
He's staying
at my house.

550
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,014
It's easier
if I stay elsewhere

551
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,416
as much as I can.

552
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,451
You can't suppress your life
for his convenience.

553
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,753
You don't see
a little irony in that?

554
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,955
That's exactly
what you do for house.

555
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,088
When he moved in with you,

556
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,254
you bought a bigger place
for him.

557
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,054
No wonder
you're not dating anyone.

558
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:48,823
You're right.

559
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:53,527
That woman, the woman
I'm not involved with,

560
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:56,029
her name is Sam carr.

561
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:59,466
But in 1990 and 1991,
it was Sam Wilson.

562
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,367
Your ex-wife?

563
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,268
No, my mother.

564
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:06,067
Yes, my ex-wife.
Ex number one.

565
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:09,335
She friended me
a few weeks ago.

566
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:10,603
We started emailing.

567
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:12,271
It turns out
she's recently divorced,

568
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,639
and I wanted
to ask her out.

569
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:18,376
You can't take a woman
to dinner,

570
00:29:18,444 --> 00:29:19,911
or else house
will go running

571
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,579
straight back
to the loony bin?

572
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:22,580
You're not worried
about house.

573
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:23,848
You're worried
about yourself.

574
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,283
Because she's an ex.

575
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:27,985
So even dinner will mean
it's immediately serious.

576
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:33,289
What are your favorite parts

577
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,524

578
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,264
I liked how I would wake up
in the middle of the night,

579
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:45,232
you'd put your arm around me,
and you wouldn't even wake up.

Do you have kids?

624
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,755
A little girl.

625
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:25,290
I adopted her
last year.

626
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:31,193
I adopted Walker right after
Donald and I got married.

627

No.

633
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:08,726

Okay.

635
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:11,694

639

extra towels?

640

Now.

641
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,937

642
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,805

Sure.

643
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,809

644
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,912
Adrienne, give me
your arm.

645
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:42,583
The hair on her left arm
is standing up.

646
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,050
Asymmetric
neurological function.

647
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,685
She's having
a pilomotor seizure.

648
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:47,119
She seemed fine
a minute ago.

649
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:48,187
She was.

650
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:49,654
She's probably been having

651
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:51,523
complex seizures all day.

652
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:53,725
She would be
basically functional,

653
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:55,060
but more or less
acting on autopilot.

654
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,529
She probably dropped
the towels off twice.

655
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:03,402
She could have taken
the baby.

656
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:10,675
We never really did
have a proper good-bye.

657

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,868
You waited until you knew
she'd be out.

664
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:12,206
Her aunt said
that she starts work late.

665
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:14,975
Every now and then,

666
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:17,811
I just call to hear
her voice on the machine.

667
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:27,055

when she needed me, so...

668

All hospital personnel may leave
their staging areas

721
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:19,375
and report back
to their departments.

722
00:40:19,443 --> 00:40:20,576
Thank you
for your cooperation.

723
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:21,643
We don't have
to tell anybody what we--

724
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,745
mm-mm.

725
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:27,916
You got
the patient file?

726
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,951
I'll grab it.
Thanks.

727
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:32,853
See you tomorrow.

728
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:12,421
I think I'm ready
to take you up on your offer.

a few minutes ago.

731
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,743
Yeah. I know.

732
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:51,153
I'm sorry
I didn't take your case.

733
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,996
Me too.
