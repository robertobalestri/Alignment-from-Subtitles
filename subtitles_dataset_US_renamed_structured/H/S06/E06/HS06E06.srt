1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,873
Sure, let's give up
now. It's no big deal.

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,436
It's just Pharmacide,
just their tour kick-off.

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,679
I mean, who cares if we miss
the most insane party in the world?

4
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,117
Come on, Phoeb.
Victory or death.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,224
Or possibly cake.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,062
Look, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,166
Sorry, your caffeine
fix is on its way.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,462
Will you hold on?

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,508
Hi, we're the DJ's assistants.

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,979
Hold on.

11
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,079
No. I said we both work for him.

12
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,923
You mean "her."
The DJ is a she-jay.

13
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,827
It's okay, Dave,
she's my plus one.

14
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,356
Make that plus two.

15
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,868
You weren't worried, were you?

16
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:19,970
Yes.

17
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,017
And there will be punishment
unless you tell us everything.

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,676
You've been here all night?

19
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,051
After the party, we went up to
the Presidential Suite with the band.

20
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,488
It was ginormous, like 10 rooms.

21
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,321
We had a few drinks
and some weed,

22
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,827
and played <i>Drummer God</i>
on this giant plasma TV.

23
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,864
Which she rocked, by the way.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,455
I think I hate you right now.

25
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,299
Colt took me up to the roof, but by
then the gate to the pool was locked.

26
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:48,331
So no one was up there. So we
just climbed over and jumped down,

27
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,568
and went skinny dipping.

28
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,471
Did you do it?

29
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,143
No. He was so sweet.

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,847
Later, he played his guitar
and he wrote a song for me.

31
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,193
Oh, my God.

32
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,525
Jord, what happened
to your foot?

33
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,723
Maybe you twisted your
ankle when you jumped.

34
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,561
Or it could be your allergies.

35
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,568
My aunt was allergic
to some cold medication,

36
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,037
and her hands swelled up
like the Marshmallow Man's.

37
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,903
Jord, are you okay?

38
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,536
Jordan!

39
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,242
Foreman expects me to read
an x-ray on this itty-bitty screen.

40
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,944
He should have e-mailed
me a larger phone.

41
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,748
Why are you packing?

42
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,056
We're leaving this
afternoon for the conference

43
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,887
on pharmacology
and public policy.

44
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,358
We? We discussed this.

45
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,837
It's been on your
calendar for weeks.

46
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,954
So has Ramadan.

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,296
Think of it as a vacation.
Nice, healthy Adirondack air.

48
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,734
Or not, I don't care.
You're coming with.

49
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,296
You should come with me. State
Pillow-Fighting Championships.

50
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,399
Dollar beers, wet t-shirts.

51
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,376
In the words of the
philosopher Eddie Money,

52
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,106
"I've got two
tickets to paradise."

53
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:35,547
House, when you moved in, I promised
your therapist I'd be here for you.

54
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,642
I can't be here if I'm there,
unless you're there, too.

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,914
So it's not a discussion.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,614
Fine.

57
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,023
I'll let Foreman know that the 16-year-old
patient with the severe edema can wait.

58
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,423
Relax, I got no idea what's wrong
with her, so odds are not fatal.

59
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,156
Still not going.

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,034
She's got rhabdo.

61
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,174
Who wants to come to the
Pillow-Fighting Championships?

62
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,834
Rutgers has got a
great team this year.

63
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,434
So glad their
anchor didn't turn pro.

64
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,777
Sixteen-year-old girl suddenly
has the joints of an 80-year-old.

65
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,325
You think we can
discuss this for a second?

66
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,908
It's rhabdo.

67
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,061
Patient gave you the answer.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,713
She fell down and went boom.

69
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,951
We have to leave in an hour,
so should we eenie meenie?

70
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,221
The fall would explain the lower leg
damage, but not the swollen hands.

71
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,091
Hard landing caused
crushed muscles,

72
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,173
crushed muscles released
toxins into the bloodstream,

73
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,428
toxins caused swelling
in the hands and legs.

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,766
Just another way of saying
it's rhabdo. Fifty-nine minutes.

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,065
She's a credit-card kid.

76
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,631
Parents are architects. They're
working on a project in Shanghai.

77
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,270
Could you be sitting any further away
from Chase and still be in the same room?

78
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,574
It doesn't have to be rhabdo.

79
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,858
The swelling could also be
caused by deep vein thrombosis.

80
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,646
She has allergies,
could be anaphylaxis,

81
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,228
or some heart
condition that we don't...

82
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,689
It can't really be any of
those things since it's rhabdo.

83
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,247
I know it's rhabdo,
Foreman knows it's rhabdo,

84
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,657
deep in his heart, even
Chase knows it's rhabdo.

85
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,925
Isn't it annoying when everybody in
the room knows something you don't?

86
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,191
I'll test for everything.

87
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,534
He's an ass.

88
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,870
Contrast is ready.

89
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,173
She already thinks
I'm cheating on her.

90
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,509
Maybe this is House's way
of telling you to talk to her.

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,415
Sure. "How was your day, honey?
By the way, I killed someone."

92
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:22,021
If I tell her, that's dumping
a burden on her forever.

93
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,089
Okay.

94
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,056
No sign of
obstructions or clots.

95
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,900
Tell me what you
came here for, House.

96
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,638
I've got a legitimate
medical reason.

97
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,044
You must be so proud.

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,411
I've forgotten it.

99
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,883
I guess it's no big deal
since I was only using it

100
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,979
as an excuse to come
check out Patty and Selma.

101
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,349
I feel bad. I haven't
named your testicles.

102
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,657
Word on the street is you set
a new personal best for low-cut.

103
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,721
I don't know why you chose to give
them the names of somebody's aunts.

104
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,666
It's a compliment.
They're always smoking.

105
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:12,602
I remember. I need you to authorize
the medical discharge of a minor.

106
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,369
That's why I'm
holding this in my hand.

107
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,846
Haven't finished
testing yet, but it's...

108
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:25,276
Your outbox is three times
normal size. That's not a metaphor.

109
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,920
There's a lot to be done
before the weekend.

110
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,860
You could take papers home with
you. Unless you're not gonna be home.

111
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,295
Unless you were, for example,
going to a medical conference.

112
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,664
I'm driving up with Wilson.

113
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,793
Me, too.

114
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,336
You aren't on the
registration list.

115
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,133
I love that you checked.

116
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,205
But Wilson said...

117
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,901
That I have a case? Yeah.

118
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:52,309
You're authorizing the discharge
right now. That was a metaphor.

119
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,220
I'm busy right now.

120
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,159
Is he dying? Yeah.

121
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,632
In the next 10 minutes?

122
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,125
Unfortunately, no.
He's in a lot of pain.

123
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:20,035
I thought about it. You're right,
I should go to the conference.

124
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,870
You found out Cuddy's going.

125
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,843
Oh, God, no.

126
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,304
She'll ruin everything.

127
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,149
We leave in two hours.

128
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,947
Please, morphine.

129
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,989
I'm right here. I'm
right here, Joseph.

130
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,974
Two days away. You
think I should pack Bally?

131
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:59,136
You can't leave. You lit a fuse,
you need to watch the bomb go off.

132
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,649
The bomb was gonna go
off on its own if you kept quiet.

133
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,185
So now you either have to
come up with a convincing lie

134
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,413
or tell her the
truth. Your choice.

135
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,620
CK levels point to rhabdo.

136
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,851
Of course.

137
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,726
Except for the part where imaging
shows no sign of muscle crush.

138
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,911
Hi. I'm your doctor,

139
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,972
and this is Lars Ulrich, greatest
metal drummer of all time.

140
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,709
You know the song?

141
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,345
Good. Drumstick.

142
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,751
Here's another drumstick.

143
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,783
I want you to rock out to the
music, the way you did last night.

144
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,396
Come on. This is a
classic medical test.

145
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,899
Hippocrates used it. Let's go.

146
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,875
Come on, you gotta keep
time. Crossover on the high-hat.

147
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,540
Let's head-bang.

148
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,508
House, what are you doing?

149
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,710
Chart said her potassium's low.

150
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,651
Rhabdo elevates potassium.

151
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,712
And the monkey drums.

152
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,555
Ergo, her levels must have
been really low last night.

153
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,323
Which causes...

154
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,930
I can't move them.

155
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,097
Temporary muscle paralysis.
Given this rate of muscle fatigue,

156
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,110
there's no way she could have climbed
stairs and then a fence to the pool.

157
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,579
Low potassium means
no jump, means no trauma.

158
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,014
Tests mean, yes, rhabdo.

159
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,248
Ergo, something else caused both
the rhabdo and the low potassium.

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,484
This time, start by
getting an accurate history.

161
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,022
Be careful, our
patient's a big, fat liar.

162
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,665
What did you
really do last night?

163
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,998
We need to find the cause
of your low potassium.

164
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,834
You could have a kidney
disorder, leukemia, adenoma.

165
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,101
We need to know about
any drugs or alcohol,

166
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,405
anything that might have
threatened your health.

167
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,002
Come on, Jord.

168
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,442
Okay, we didn't spend
the night with the band.

169
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,247
You can't tell our friends.

170
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,551
Have you heard of <i>Stiletto:
Warrior Queen of Space?</i>

171
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,749
It's a comic book, right?

172
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,950
Thank you, yes... Yeah.

173
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,357
And a freaking amazing
new sci-fi series,

174
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,004
and they're filming
the motion picture now.

175
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,963
It's a prequel.

176
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,124
The other girls wouldn't get it.

177
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,191
Only Phoebe
understands my passion.

178
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,727
Only Phoebe understands
"the bushido of the heel."

179
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,569
So what actually
happened last night?

180
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,887
<i>We were with our friends,</i>

181
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,574
<i>trying to get into the Pharmacide
tour party at the Adams.</i>

182
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,641
<i>And then I found out that Jeffrey
Keener was gonna be there.</i>

183
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,084
I follow his tweets.

184
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,016
It's tragic that I
have to explain this.

185
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:10,898
<i>He's the creator of</i> Stiletto <i>issue
number one and the TV show.</i>

186
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,667
He's a god.

187
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,606
So did you guys go up to him?

188
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,734
God, no.

189
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,304
We keep a 10-foot rule.

190
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,019
It's not stalking if you don't go
up to the person and bother them.

191
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,108
So we just followed him around.

192
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,243
Discreetly.

193
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,251
He ditched after half
an hour and went down

194
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,187
to the hotel restaurant
for a late dinner.

195
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,053
And you went with
him? Discreetly.

196
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,163
<i>We played it so cool.</i>

197
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,629
For two hours,
we lived his life.

198
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,660
We did everything he did,
ate the exact same meal he ate.

199
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,870
Cool.

200
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,717
The rest of their
story checks out.

201
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,802
Hotel manager says Mom and Dad
were charged for food and a room,

202
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,279
three pay-per-view
episodes of <i>Stiletto...</i>

203
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,840
You trying to kill yourself? It's
from the same batch the girls ate.

204
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,285
They ate what he ate, and what
100 other healthy people ate.

205
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,846
Dig in, lunch is on the Adams.

206
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,551
What if food is the answer?

207
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,687
Not this food, any food.
Jordan says she ate all of this.

208
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,697
She's 16, all about body image,

209
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,892
and she obviously
worries about fitting in.

210
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,697
Bulimia would account
for her symptoms.

211
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,880
We should do a barium
swallow for Mallory-Weiss tears,

212
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,738
start her on nutritional
supplements, get a psych consult.

213
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,639
Why are you reading
my program guide?

214
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,739
It's not like you plan on
attending any of the presentations.

215
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,046
I like to know how much
boredom I'm missing.

216
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:37,519
"Patient perceptions of complications
in end-stage chemotherapy."

217
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,650
You didn't tell me you
were giving a paper.

218
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,853
And that was wrong?

219
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,271
The last time you
presented a paper,

220
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,730
you gave me an advance
copy and asked for feedback.

221
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:49,030
And you're wondering why I wouldn't
want to repeat that experience?

222
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,367
Oh, look, an '80s party.

223
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,408
Just when you think you've left Flock of
Seagulls behind in your rear-view mirror,

224
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,808
suddenly it's up ahead
like an undead hitchhiker.

225
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,470
Cuddy's going.

226
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,540
Did you pack my legwarmers?

227
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,018
If you want her, ask her out.

228
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,714
My God, man.

229
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,656
She's not some floozy in a bar,

230
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,784
she's the floozy I work for.

231
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,892
There's gotta be no radical
steps here, gotta be subtle.

232
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,693
We happen to
attend the same party,

233
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,597
the chat happens
to turn personal.

234
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,159
Like the frog in
gradually boiling water.

235
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,431
Exactly.

236
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,939
She'll be red and delicious
before she knows it.

237
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,236
That's fun.

238
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,905
What could possibly go wrong?

239
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,113
Chase went to the
gym five times this week.

240
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,378
Okay.

241
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,249
One of those
times, I followed him.

242
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,447
What?

243
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,516
I followed him. And, yes, I know
how humiliating that admission is.

244
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,317
Where'd he go?

245
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,953
The gym. That time.

246
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,106
But I know that something's...

247
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,291
I'm stopping you right there.

248
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,096
This is a conversation you should
be having with Chase, not me.

249
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,103
I've tried having this
conversation with Chase.

250
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,696
No sign of tears.
It's not bulimia.

251
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,967
Is he having an affair?

252
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,703
No.

253
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,436
Why should I believe you?

254
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,639
You shouldn't. You
should believe him.

255
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,644
Baby, how are you? Sweetie.

256
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,888
Jordan.

257
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,481
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate's fine.

258
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,584
BP's dropping. DEREK:
What's happening to her?

259
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,684
No pulse.

260
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,094
Oh, my God. You said
her heart rate was fine.

261
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,191
Cardiac tamponade,
drain the fluid now.

262
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,929
What is going on?

263
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,071
She's bleeding around her heart.

264
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,071
Blood constricted
her heart muscle.

265
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,514
She's on antiarrhythmics, but we don't
know how long we can keep her stable.

266
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,128
<i>Seemed to be triggered by
stress. Her parents had just...</i>

267
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,621
Did her blood pressure drop
during the barium swallow?

268
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,656
Dropped to 50 systolic
in three minutes.

269
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,986
Rules out chronic conditions.

270
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,992
Acute conditions limit
us to toxins, infections...

271
00:14:55,061 --> 00:15:00,159
Could be anything. A gas leak, arsenic
in the wallpaper, fungus in the shower...

272
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,361
I'll get samples from her
room and the restaurant.

273
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,915
<i>Talk to our little Gossip Girl.</i>

274
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,814
You need to know
exactly where she's been

275
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,706
and what she's done
in the last 24 hours.

276
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,868
Oh, I think...

277
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,418
Welcome to the
convention, Dr. Perlmutter.

278
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,751
It's my 25th consecutive year.

279
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,120
Perlmutter loves the '80s.

280
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,432
Do you need me to leave, too?

281
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,497
You might remember
stuff she doesn't.

282
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,305
We didn't do anything
we haven't told you about.

283
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:49,475
We hung out at Jordan's all day, and
then we called a limo to go into the city.

284
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,246
We stopped at Bruce
Springsteen's house.

285
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,681
Jord, don't joke around, okay?

286
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,988
You're really sick.
Just tell him the truth.

287
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:04,286
Bruce let me play the first
electric guitar he ever owned.

288
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,525
My God, why are you lying?

289
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,591
How can you not believe me?

290
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,000
Turn to your right.

291
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,926
Mr. Keener, I really
appreciate you coming.

292
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,011
Oh, it's not that much of a
hike. My room's only six floors up.

293
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,250
Last night, do you
remember two girls, about 16?

294
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,224
That table right there.

295
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,953
They made an impression.

296
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,359
They were hard to miss, with
the giggling and the staring.

297
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,523
I'm sure that
happens to you a lot.

298
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,931
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot more.

299
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,208
She can't control it.

300
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:52,473
A bleed in her brain is affecting
her thalamus, causing her to lie.

301
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,982
We need to know everything.
You two were never apart?

302
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,482
Except for when she
went to go get ice.

303
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,418
But that couldn't
have taken very long.

304
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,487
You don't know?

305
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,921
It was in the
middle of the night.

306
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,152
I woke up when she
came back into the room.

307
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,854
And she told you
she went to get ice?

308
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,350
House.

309
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,252
1980s.

310
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,487
Are you sure? They
weren't specific.

311
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,754
How much did it
cost you to rent that?

312
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,658
It was in Wilson's bag.

313
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:46,660
Dr. Perlmutter. I read your
article on neural degeneration.

314
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,165
You didn't really take
that seriously, did you?

315
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,568
I just wrote that for the money.

316
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,102
Well, hey, there, Jane Fonda,
would you care to dancercise?

317
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,168
Sorry, we were just
about to hit the floor.

318
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,577
Thank you.

319
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,741
Your leg?

320
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,047
I'm okay, as long as
you don't expect rhythm.

321
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,136
You remember the
last time we danced?

322
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,074
Med school. The week we met.

323
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,244
No.

324
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:39,280
I saw you in Endocrinology,
tracked you down to the hoe-down.

325
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,549
I meant we met before
that. In the bookstore.

326
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,150
Ah.

327
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,460
My third day of school.

328
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,089
I hand my syllabus to
the guy behind the counter.

329
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,725
He barely looks at
me, just skims the sheet

330
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,667
and tells me I'm
overly ambitious,

331
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,105
I have a chip on my shoulder
and I know how to party.

332
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,305
I'd forgotten you
knew how to party.

333
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,079
I said, "You're making that up."

334
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,446
Then you said, "Your class
schedule is overloaded,

335
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,781
"but none of your
classes are before 11:00,

336
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:18,189
"and no one takes Professor Lamb's course
unless they have something to prove."

337
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,853
Because Professor Siegal covered the
same ground and was the easier grader.

338
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,558
I tracked you down.
Endocrinology, the party.

339
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,131
And one thing led to another.

340
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,533
And then it didn't.

341
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,367
I was gonna call you.

342
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,139
No, don't do that.

343
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,538
There was no expectations.
I was just as into it...

344
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,345
I was gonna come see you.

345
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,319
Figure out where things
would go from there.

346
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,132
That was the morning I
got the call from the dean,

347
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:54,184
and I was expelled from my first med
school. There didn't seem any point.

348
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,092
I should go to my room and review
papers for the infectious disease panel.

349
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,217
Hello.

350
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,825
Yeah. Thanks for telling me.

351
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,128
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Somebody better be dead.

352
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,370
My patient. Joseph Schultz.

353
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,769
Oh.

354
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,844
Under the circumstances, it was the
best thing that could have happened, right?

355
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,184
Yeah. I just wish
I'd been there.

356
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,156
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

357
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,695
Yes, it was almost 9:30.

358
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,663
Things didn't go as you planned?

359
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,699
We've moved on to a new phase.

360
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,710
I tell Cuddy that I've
always been interested

361
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,396
in her, and she
walks out of the room.

362
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,665
Well, either she just
wasn't ready for that,

363
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:17,904
or maybe she was just surprised
and didn't know how to react.

364
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,473
What are you doing?

365
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,345
Interesting reflex
of guilt just now.

366
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,975
Your patient's been
dying for six weeks,

367
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,885
you couldn't have predicted
that he'd go this weekend.

368
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,388
Or could you?

369
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:42,865
"Euthanasia. Let's tell
the truth. We all do it."

370
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,069
It's a great opening line.

371
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,664
Are you insane?

372
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,939
I didn't want your notes before,

373
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,536
and I don't want them now.

374
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,757
Well, she didn't get ice.

375
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,817
She got out in the lobby.
She could've gone anywhere.

376
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,829
Let's start with for
how long. Fast forward.

377
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,225
Stop. Rewind. Back.

378
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,964
Wherever she went, she was
only gone for like five minutes.

379
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,368
She's holding something.

380
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,685
That's Keener's journal.

381
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,076
He must have left it in
the restaurant that night.

382
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,046
She went back, claimed
it belonged to her.

383
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,113
She was looking for an
excuse to knock on his door.

384
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,251
I know what you're gonna say.

385
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:42,557
I'm not insane. Doctors
are rarely indicted.

386
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,724
I was just thinking
of your career.

387
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,033
But, yeah, if you're one of the
doctors occasionally indicted,

388
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,538
I guess it could affect that.

389
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:59,068
Someone needs to say what life is
really like, now, for people who are dying.

390
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,422
What doctors have to go through.

391
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,540
The decisions we have to make.

392
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,174
Alone. Without guidance.

393
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,517
Someone should say that, in
an unsigned letter to the <i>Times.</i>

394
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,099
I'd be telling the truth. I'd be
saying what we're all thinking.

395
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,455
Who cares?

396
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,755
The oncology department is
subsidized by drug companies,

397
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,728
they don't want it
run by a murderer.

398
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,940
We're all murderers. We just
don't have the guts to admit...

399
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,728
And once again, who cares?

400
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,927
You won't be hirable. Anywhere.

401
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,835
If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

402
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,806
it's that I should do
what I think is right,

403
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,502
and not worry about
the consequences.

404
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,210
Yeah, it's worked
out great for me.

405
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,385
I don't mean to be rude,

406
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,538
but I'm expecting a notes call
from LA. Can we make this quick?

407
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,394
Did Jordan come to
your room the other night?

408
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,629
Let me put it another way. We know
Jordan came to your room the other night.

409
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,103
Look, I've tried to be helpful.

410
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,572
I don't know why you want
to pretend I'm lying to you,

411
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,684
but this is getting
too weird for me.

412
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,301
We need to search your room.

413
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,538
You don't, because
she was never here.

414
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,845
Allison, calm down.

415
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,083
You would cover your ass at
the expense of someone's life?

416
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,814
We know she brought
up your journal.

417
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,922
That was helpful.

418
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:26,120
He'd be crazy to risk his marriage
for a one-night stand. With a teenager.

419
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,327
Sensible people only risk their
marriage for something more serious?

420
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,267
I'm not having an affair.

421
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,498
We're talking about Keener.

422
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,937
Fine.

423
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,373
He doesn't care about his
marriage, what about his career?

424
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,671
Statutory rape would ruin it.

425
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:40,212
It's admitting statutory
rape that could ruin it.

426
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,646
Which is why we'll never
hear the truth out of him.

427
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,411
Roofies OD explains
all her symptoms.

428
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,577
We should start treating
her with flumazenil.

429
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,552
Isn't the MRSA panel going on?

430
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,956
We got kicked out.
She started crying.

431
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:58,122
Yeah, well, discussions of urinary
catheterization will do that to me, too.

432
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,029
The babysitter had an emergency.

433
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,494
Oh, how did you like '80s Night?

434
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,698
House talked with you?

435
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,139
I was being subtle about
it. You left suddenly.

436
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,079
I know House can be
a little much sometimes.

437
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,948
He was sweet. I just know
better than to rely on that.

438
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,886
He's trying.

439
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,388
Yeah. I know.

440
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:30,218
I'm a mother now. I need a guy
I can count on every single day.

441
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,923
That's never been House.

442
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,909
It's not roofies. She's
bleeding behind her kidneys.

443
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,241
We're transfusing another
two units packed red cells,

444
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,745
but she keeps springing leaks.

445
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,941
It looks like a toxic reaction.

446
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,608
Keener must have
given her something.

447
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,380
The guy's a comic book
writer, not a drug dealer.

448
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,564
There's a lot that wouldn't
show up on a standard tox screen.

449
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,750
But he's never
gonna tell us the truth.

450
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,487
We're not going to get
the truth out of her either.

451
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,491
We will if we drug her.

452
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,461
Amobarbital would
suppress her thalamus.

453
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,904
She's on antiarrhythmics.
Amobarbital could stop her heart.

454
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,804
She's already dying.

455
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,634
You're angry at me.

456
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,771
You're taking it out on this guy
'cause you think he's lying to you, too,

457
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:24,681
and you're going to kill
our patient in the process.

458
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,384
We need to know the truth.

459
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,944
We should call House.

460
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,219
Yeah, he'll recommend we
take the cautious approach.

461
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,790
Pretzel?

462
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,961
Those are gonna show up on my
credit card at seven bucks a bag.

463
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,096
There's an all-you-can-
eat buffet downstairs.

464
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,905
Studies show that $10 wine tastes
better if you're told that it costs $90.

465
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,580
I'm sure the same thing
must be true of grape soda.

466
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,580
Have one.

467
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,820
We can toast your
impending unemployment.

468
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,257
Yes, you can sit here
running up my hotel bill,

469
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,765
or you can go get the
woman of your dreams.

470
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,065
I didn't know Angela Merkel
was attending the conference.

471
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,595
I just spoke with Cuddy. She
doesn't think you're reliable.

472
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:25,042
And you will remain
friend-zoned until that changes.

473
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,047
I can't convince her that I've changed
my entire personality in a weekend.

474
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,016
Yeah, but you could
make the first step.

475
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,108
What does she need?

476
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,949
Today, a babysitter.

477
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,690
What are you thinking about?

478
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,852
Fjords.

479
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:46,729
You see? Seriously, I know
this is out of your comfort zone,

480
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,826
but don't scheme,
don't... Just do the deed...

481
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,769
You tell me that I gotta
show her I've changed,

482
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,808
and yet you act like
you don't believe I can.

483
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,036
If I can't convince
my best friend...

484
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,411
I'm sorry, and that's... I
didn't mean... I didn't mean...

485
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,947
I didn't mean...

486
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,815
You drugged me.

487
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,392
She's better off without you.

488
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,061
Words can hurt, you know.

489
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,607
I thought truth serum was only stuff
they gave people in lame spy movies.

490
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:35,011
We know you're scared, and
we know you want to tell the truth.

491
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,810
We're going to help you do that.

492
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,682
<i>What happened between you and
Keener the night you went up to his room?</i>

493
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,292
<i>I couldn't believe
he even talked to me.</i>

494
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,963
<i>I told him how much
his work means to me.</i>

495
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,936
I figured I must sound like a
moron, but he was nice about it.

496
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,774
<i>He said I was special.</i>

497
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,134
Heart rate's increasing.

498
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,237
140's acceptable. Let her talk.

499
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,215
Did he give you
anything, a drink, pills?

500
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,650
<i>He said it was Ecstasy.</i>

501
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,415
<i>But it didn't look like Ecstasy.</i>

502
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,424
<i>And it didn't really make me
feel how Ecstasy usually does.</i>

503
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,221
How did it make you feel?

504
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,228
It just made me really tired.

505
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,129
What did it look like?
A capsule? Tablet?

506
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,690
It was a tablet. Round.

507
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,924
Could be lithium.

508
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,001
<i>He just started touching me.</i>

509
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,667
<i>At first, it seemed
nice, but then...</i>

510
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,279
I didn't want to insult him.

511
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,506
That's enough.

512
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,541
I'm so sorry.

513
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,352
I love you guys so
much and I just...

514
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,122
I feel like I've let you down.

515
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,295
I'm gonna kill him. I'm
gonna kill that son of a bitch.

516
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,729
Before you do that, look here.

517
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,429
Increased periorbital
blood flow throughout.

518
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,870
It means everything she's
been saying has been a lie.

519
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,098
Everything?

520
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:14,411
So you still don't know
what's wrong with her?

521
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,879
Sorry.

522
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,444
I thought you were room service.

523
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,458
Is Something going
on with your patient?

524
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,393
It's quiet in there.
Is Rachel asleep?

525
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,689
I thought maybe you
could use a babysitter.

526
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,829
Actually, I've got her
in daycare downstairs.

527
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:40,905
Oh.

528
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,374
Great. Maybe later.

529
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,630
Hey, House.

530
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,289
Hey, Lucas.

531
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:09,929
This is awkward.

532
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,128
A bit.

533
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,640
That awkwardness would
probably go away if I left.

534
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,125
Hello? It's Foreman.

535
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,076
I'm trying to update
House, but his phone's off.

536
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,562
House!

537
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,728
He's not here.

538
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,171
Patient's losing blood
faster than we can transfuse.

539
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,920
Cameron did an online search,
found out Keener travels with his dog.

540
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,003
We're treating for Rickettsia.
Any idea where he is?

541
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,073
Oh, no! I was supposed to be
giving a paper five minutes ago.

542
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,748
Okay. Okay.

543
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:08,159
Dr. Wilson has asked me to
tender his apologies for his absence.

544
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,593
You'll be hearing
my paper instead.

545
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,427
Unfortunately, there wasn't time
to correct the program schedule.

546
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,062
Euthanasia.
Let's tell the truth.

547
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,433
We all do it. We
just don't talk about it.

548
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:28,336
We play the game. We use other
words, or we don't use any words at all.

549
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Hmm.

550
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,372
Nice phrasing.

551
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,084
Hello.

552
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,385
I don't know what
department I want. I need

553
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:44,855
pants.

554
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,732
Patient S, 55-year-old
man end-stage lung cancer.

555
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:54,296
His pain was beyond the point
where we could even pretend to treat it.

556
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,534
I showed him how to
use the morphine pump.

557
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,839
I told him too much
morphine would kill him,

558
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,870
but not to worry, the machine
only gives out so much.

559
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:06,214
To override it, you need
to enter a special code.

560
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,446
I went to the door
and told the nurse,

561
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,480
"The code is 328."
I said it loudly.

562
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,526
When he first came to my office,

563
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:21,465
I'd told him I would be with
him every step of the way.

564
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,259
But I left him alone at the end.

565
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,067
I broke that promise.

566
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,201
To cover my ass, I failed...

567
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,220
I was wrong when I wrote that.

568
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,655
I've never given any
less than my best.

569
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,556
I'm incapable of turning
away from a responsibility.

570
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:58,933
My friends take advantage
of that fact far too often.

571
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,665
I know that I gave that
man everything I could.

572
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:05,176
And I know that
he knew that, too.

573
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,949
This is a burden no one
should have to carry alone.

574
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,350
And this is a decision no
one should make alone.

575
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,323
Because, frankly, I
don't trust all of you.

576
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,120
Doctor! Doctor!

577
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,758
Doctor! Question!

578
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:32,167
Excuse me, Doctor. Not many
people would have your courage.

579
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,865
Thank you, Dr. Perlmutter.

580
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,445
Hey!

581
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:52,719
Before I start shouting, Foreman
says they're looking at Rickettsia.

582
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,192
Thanks for the
message. Continue.

583
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,455
What the hell?

584
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,472
You think that little shout
out is gonna make me forget

585
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,625
that you drugged me, hid
my pants, stole my speech?

586
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,465
You wanted the paper
out there. It's out there.

587
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,902
And your job is safe.

588
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,166
That was my paper.

589
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,902
You don't ask what I want, you
ignore my wishes, you drug me...

590
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,810
I'm waiting for you to name
something new to our relationship.

591
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,313
You got no good reason
to be angry with me.

592
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,010
Oh, really? I should
be thanking you?

593
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,576
If this was about getting the
story out there, then, yeah.

594
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,815
Of course, if this is actually
about something else,

595
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,483
maybe you feeling impotent
because patients keep dying,

596
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,619
and you think you need to make some
grand, stupid gesture, need to be a hero,

597
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,392
well, then, yeah,
sorry, I did screw it up.

598
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,430
You stepped over the line.
This was not your decision.

599
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,530
My God, there are 10,000
oncologists in this country,

600
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,131
every one of them
loses patients,

601
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,938
but only you would
feel guilty enough...

602
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,909
Of course. We can't even
argue on my schedule.

603
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,614
It's House.

604
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,864
<i>Take down the bags.</i>

605
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,375
It's too soon to tell if
the meds are gonna...

606
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,765
<i>It's not the meds.</i>

607
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,725
It's the blood
that's killing her.

608
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,570
<i>What's everybody doing?
You're stunned, right?</i>

609
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,163
I mean, blood?

610
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,301
She's had internal bleeding,
she needs the blood to...

611
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,540
<i>Is that the mom? I got a
good comeback if it's the mom.</i>

612
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,878
Yes, I'm her mother.

613
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,077
Sure, she needs blood,
if you want to kill her.

614
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,077
<i>Then you'd have nobody
left to neglect. Great plan.</i>

615
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,556
<i>Your daughter has
Vibrio vulnificus,</i>

616
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,788
courtesy of a few scrumptious
oysters on the half shell.

617
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,957
I didn't eat any oysters.

618
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,498
Thus proving that she
did. Boy, that's neat.

619
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,932
A hundred other people
ate those oysters. I ate...

620
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,129
Is that the dad? I got
a good comeback if...

621
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,466
It's Chase.

622
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,178
Oh. Thought the dad might
have been Australian, too.

623
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:53,003
There was nothing wrong with
the oysters. All oysters have Vibrio.

624
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:56,014
But almost no one
has hemochromatosis.

625
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,351
<i>It'd give her a unique susceptibility
to Vibrio, cause the swollen joints.</i>

626
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,616
It got attributed to bulimia,
so she got supplements.

627
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,917
With iron.

628
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,481
<i>Which overcooked the
liver, which caused bleeding.</i>

629
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:10,523
More blood, more iron,
more bleeding, more blood.

630
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,029
Is she going to be okay?

631
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:15,096
Only if we give her high-dose
ceftazidime for the Vibrio

632
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,260
<i>and chelate for the
hemochromatosis.</i>

633
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,271
Now, Cameron, pick up the
phone and give me a dramatic exit.

634
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:37,118
So, how did you two
crazy kids hook up?

635
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,987
I suspected someone in
accounting was skimming money,

636
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,084
and I wanted to
investigate quietly.

637
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,291
And since you introduced me
to the only detective I know...

638
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,128
One thing leads to another.

639
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,966
Why keep it a secret? Were you
protecting me in my fragile state?

640
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,443
You think I was
an unhinged loony

641
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,846
who was about to go off the
rails at a badly-timed bit of news?

642
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:06,680
I just don't advertise
my personal life.

643
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,311
I needed help with the
baby, Lucas drove up.

644
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,083
Yeah, she was worried.

645
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,983
A little worried. As a friend.

646
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:21,426
I had to hide in our room and be
the dirty little secret. Kind of sucked.

647
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,229
I told her it wasn't necessary.

648
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,703
So you had some hallucination
about having sex with her.

649
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,366
I don't think we need to talk...

650
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,605
I mean, I imagine having sex with
women all the time. No big deal.

651
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:38,207
Though I guess if they knew what
I imagined, it could get awkward.

652
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:43,085
And I guess it's different because
in the fantasy, she was your savior.

653
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,216
But I mean, that was
months ago, right?

654
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,850
All the work that you
had to do to get straight.

655
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,226
You've been institutionalized, you've
had way bigger stuff to deal with.

656
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,026
I should shut up.

657
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,132
Can I buy you a ginger ale?

658
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,504
Ginger ale would
be good. With lemon.

659
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,076
Infection's clearing up nicely.

660
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,692
You should be out
of here in a few days.

661
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,651
That is wonderful.

662
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,817
Jack, how are you?

663
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,118
Sweetie,

664
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,957
your father and I think we should
reward ourselves with a little time off.

665
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,239
That meeting's gonna have
to wait a couple of weeks.

666
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,494
We're staying here.

667
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,743
You should think about
where you'd like to go.

668
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,946
Honey, they're saying the specs
are off for the whole foundation.

669
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,370
Can you at least
come talk to him?

670
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,134
Let me see.

671
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,646
You okay? Yeah.

672
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,708
No. Soil engineering
report was fine.

673
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,219
I'm used to it.

674
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,223
So, about what
happened that night...

675
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,832
<i>I never even got up the
courage to knock on his door.</i>

676
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,636
Well, you'll have to
send me their numbers.

677
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,510
Yay!

678
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,257
You want to go driving?

679
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,494
He looks like a guy
who'd be there every day.

680
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,463
Mini-bar's re-stocked. I say we
grab some pretzels for the road...

681
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,901
When you do what I did,

682
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,634
it's not enough to tell
yourself you did nothing wrong.

683
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,608
You need to hear it
from someone else.

684
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:51,674
If not God or society, a
friend, otherwise you go crazy.

685
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,983
What you said to me up there...

686
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,485
Thank you.

687
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:03,221
You're a good friend.
Cuddy should know that.

688
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,340
Yeah, you should let her
know that I drugged you

689
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,994
so you wouldn't confess to
murder. Let's get out of here.

690
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,637
Someone could
have recognized you.

691
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,904
First US conference
I've attended in 15 years.

692
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,308
Perlmutter?

693
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,074
Toronto, all
weekend, airtight alibi.

694
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,057
I'm sorry.

695
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:39,056
I don't know why I
always suspect the worst.

696
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,809
If you say you're
not having an affair,

697
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,632
you're not having an affair.

698
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,139
Oh, God. You are? I'm not.

699
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,580
Okay. Sorry. Again.

700
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,850
If you don't wanna tell,

701
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,856
okay.

702
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,862
But I could help.

703
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:18,093
Whatever this is, it's
eating away at you.

704
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,735
We could get past it together.

705
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,137
I love you no matter what.

706
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,286
We lose patients sometimes.

707
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,255
One of those patients,

708
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,901
Dibala,

709
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,333
we didn't actually lose him.

710
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:02,970
I killed him.
