1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,766
So, I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,329
Seems high to me.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,570
Uh-huh. That's a fair
price for quality like this.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,303
I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,715
What? I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,254
Who am I dealing with
here, Eddie? Him or you?

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,949
Mickey, relax.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,051
Now, if things move forward
with Gorski, he lets us into Philly,

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,686
then maybe I cut you a break.

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,096
You cut me a break now or
maybe you don't get with Gorski.

11
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,573
Marco, I thought we
had an understanding.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
Whoa, whoa.

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,177
Tommy, don't be
stupid. Put the gun down.

14
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,837
First, he shows
you some respect.

15
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,077
All right, just listen to
your boss, all right, moron?

16
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,481
Shut up.

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,951
Just relax, buddy, all right?

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,937
What the hell are you thinking?

19
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,054
I didn't shoot him.

20
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,007
You sure? Look at him, he's
face down in the pavement.

21
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,227
I nailed myself in the foot!

22
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,495
I don't think he's hit.

23
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,613
Well, then, what happened?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,302
Let's get out of here.

25
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,607
Come on, Mickey, wake
up. Mickey! Wake up!

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,241
We almost done here?

27
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,311
Assuming you did this
shaving your forehead.

28
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,851
Okay, then. I'm
ordering a head CT.

29
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,893
No, I don't have a headache,

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,190
I'm not dizzy. Eddie,
I gotta get back.

31
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,820
You gotta stay here.

32
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,092
We'll straighten out that
mess with Marco tomorrow.

33
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,565
Let the doc do his job.

34
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,833
Actually, stitching you up
is really the ER doc's job.

35
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,703
Yeah. Too long of a wait.

36
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,040
Yeah. Also, a lot
of cops in the ER.

37
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,538
Not that you'd care about that.

38
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,515
So, how did this happen?

39
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,355
Yeah, you're right.
It's a stupid question

40
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,618
'cause the answer's
kind of obvious.

41
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,286
No scrapes on your hands means
you didn't try to break your fall,

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,352
means you were either out cold

43
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,796
or totally disoriented
when you went down.

44
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,663
No sign of trauma,
other than the cut,

45
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,634
means no one hit
you in the head.

46
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:53,106
And powder burn on your jacket
sleeve means someone shot a gun.

47
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,040
All right, Eddie.
Come on, let's go.

48
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,637
I don't care what
you guys are into.

49
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:04,116
If you don't get this checked
out, it'll happen again.

50
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,751
What will?

51
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,310
This.

52
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,256
Cool.

53
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:20,996
Thirty-two-year-old man recently
developed loud-noise-induced vertigo.

54
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,503
CT was clean, no internal
bleeding, no edema.

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,937
Everything else is in the file.

56
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,339
Cameron get your
hair in the divorce?

57
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,274
This guy strained his
back three years ago

58
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,436
and that's it.

59
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,989
All the rest of these
pages are blank.

60
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,209
Yes, he won't tell us anything.

61
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,581
Understandable,
since he's a drug dealer.

62
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,954
So he's dangerous
and withholding,

63
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,387
which you find irresistible.

64
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,948
But guys like that,
they never call.

65
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,358
He actually said he
was a drug dealer?

66
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,520
Not out loud.

67
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,860
But he was wearing a
solid-gold Patek Philippe,

68
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,390
his friend had a Rolex, but their
phones were prepaid burners,

69
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,699
so they can toss them
as soon as they're done.

70
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,015
It doesn't matter if this
guy's a drug dealer or not.

71
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,065
Noise-induced vertigo
means ear or brain.

72
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,576
Head CT was clean, so I'm
thinking acoustic neuroma.

73
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,373
We need to do an
ABR to test his hearing.

74
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,576
Acoustic neuroma fits, so does
lidocaine toxicity or benzocaine,

75
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,584
depends what he's
cutting the coke with.

76
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,052
So now he's not just a drug
dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.

77
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,885
He seemed peppy.

78
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,221
You test his ears, I'm
gonna go test his cocaine.

79
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,836
You think this guy is
just going to hand over

80
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,262
a briefcase full of illegal
drugs because you ask nicely?

81
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,696
I hope not.

82
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,561
So, the best coffee's at Geena's

83
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,766
and the best pizza is at Gino's.

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,331
Yeah, and don't mix those up,

85
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,003
'cause the coffee at
Gino's could kill you.

86
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,671
And how's the dry
cleaner on the corner?

87
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,305
Go two blocks over to EcoClean,

88
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,011
the one on the corner used to
shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

89
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,348
Good to know. In retrospect,

90
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,048
I should really
thank those cleaners.

91
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,817
We broke up. This is my stop.

92
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,690
So if you have
any more questions

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,195
about the neighborhood,
I'm your girl.

94
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,893
Uh, favorite sushi place? Maybe
we could get dinner sometime.

95
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,299
Sure, if you promise to bring

96
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,167
that good-looking
guy with the cane.

97
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,169
You mean House?

98
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,140
Your boyfriend's name is House?

99
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,643
He's not my boyfriend.

100
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,838
Oh.

101
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,307
I'm sorry. What do
you call each other?

102
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,046
Husband? Partner? Lover?

103
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,488
We're not gay.

104
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,956
Seriously?

105
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,790
You're going to hear a
series of clicks and hisses.

106
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,628
The sensors measure electronic
activity to your auditory nerve.

107
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,428
How long is this gonna take?

108
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,197
An hour, maybe
an hour-and-a-half.

109
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,398
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

110
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,838
Guy's probably
late to a stabbing.

111
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,503
Impedances look good,

112
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,038
starting at 13 clicks per
second at 50 decibels.

113
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,708
Check this out.

114
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,948
Thirteen's middle
name is Beauregard?

115
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,385
Wave 3 latency is 3.8.

116
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,154
Slightly delayed, but
nothing significant.

117
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,752
That's what sticks out to you?

118
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,889
House is clearly screwing
with us. It's a fake pay stub.

119
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,194
Looks real to me.

120
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,866
There's no way she
makes that much money.

121
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,802
I make that much money.

122
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,440
And apparently, you don't.

123
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,073
I need the drugs.

124
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,441
We're in textiles.

125
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,345
I need the drugs!

126
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,507
Hmm.

127
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,018
Works for Jack Bauer.

128
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,317
Is this really necessary?

129
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,050
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

130
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,423
But way less genre-appropriate.

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,260
Okay, here's the deal.

132
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,421
I need information.

133
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,307
You have reasons not to
give me that information.

134
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,891
So either I can
force it out of you

135
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,868
or I can't.

136
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,106
I wish I could tell you.

137
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,434
Okay. Well, let's
work with that.

138
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,206
Forget the drugs,
let's talk about textiles.

139
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,442
What's your major product?

140
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,816
Is it H? And by
that I mean hosiery.

141
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,887
We deal more with culottes.

142
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,255
Is that with a "C" or a "K"?

143
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,056
"C." Nobody wants K anymore.

144
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,359
Does your friend cut the fabric?

145
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,422
No, he's a sales guy.

146
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,468
Well, he must cut a
culotte here and there.

147
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,561
No one touches the culottes.

148
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,636
Sorry. Can I talk
to you for a second?

149
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,912
I'm interrogating a
suspect. Make it quick.

150
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,452
Everyone in our
building thinks we're gay.

151
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,159
We're grown men, over the
age of 30, who moved in together.

152
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,593
We're two tigers away
from an act in Vegas.

153
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,494
They'll figure out we're
straight, eventually.

154
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,693
"Eventually" is not when I want
to go out with the cute girl in 3B.

155
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,032
Any chance I could get
some water over here?

156
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,537
If only there was some way

157
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,766
to communicate that
information to her,

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,105
perhaps using, I
don't know, sounds.

159
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,872
If only the larynx
was capable of...

160
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,574
She didn't believe me. She
sidestepped my dinner invite.

161
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,845
And a woman would only
reject you because she's worried

162
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,443
you might not be
interested in her.

163
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,987
We were chatting, having fun,

164
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,352
there was definitely a spark.

165
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,721
When she thought you were gay.

166
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,726
You sure your friend
isn't secretly trying...

167
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,352
What is a culotte, anyway?

168
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,023
They're pants that
hang like a skirt.

169
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,663
Just...

170
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,001
Mickey hates the stuff.

171
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,767
He's one of the few guys I trust

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,605
to watch the product overnight.

173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,579
They took him away an hour ago.

174
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,669
You think he's okay?

175
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,581
It's an ear test. I'm
pretty sure he'll live.

176
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,378
Pupils are constricted.
Pulse is bounding.

177
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,856
Airway's clear. We
need a crash cart in here.

178
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,035
It's gotta be his
blood pressure.

179
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,051
We need to get it down
before he strokes out.

180
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,597
At least we know
his ears are okay.

181
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,158
We put the patient
on vasodilators,

182
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,704
got his hypertension
under control.

183
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,171
He got worse
here at the hospital,

184
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,208
means thug life probably
isn't what's making him sick.

185
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,938
Which means we can stop
<i>The Bloodhound Gang</i> routine

186
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,411
and go back to being doctors.

187
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,847
But we're doctors all
the time. It's so boring.

188
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,777
Fine.

189
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,929
Could be sick sinus syndrome.

190
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,717
No chest pain,
shortness of breath.

191
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,588
Brain aneurysm secondary
to polycystic kidney disease?

192
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,959
Normal urinalysis, kidneys
impalpable. Is that a new watch?

193
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,226
I thought I'd give
myself a little treat.

194
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,426
What if it's not his brain,

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,968
but it's on the
way to his brain?

196
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,731
Carotid stenosis.

197
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,670
Get an ultrasound
of his carotids,

198
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,538
see if his arteries are clogged.

199
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,016
How much money do you make?

200
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,985
I want a raise.

201
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,114
And I will be happy
to talk about that

202
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,716
at your next review, in August.

203
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,158
I know that you're
paying me less

204
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,287
than everyone else on the team.

205
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,374
I can't discuss other people's
salaries. You know that.

206
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,642
Now that they
know I'm making less

207
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,110
than they are, they'll
never respect me.

208
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,535
And who told them
how much you make?

209
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,871
It's not fair for me to make
less than the people I supervise.

210
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,875
Salary isn't about fairness.

211
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,377
It's about what you can
leverage in a negotiation,

212
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,744
which isn't much without a
competing offer on the table.

213
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,340
And we both know
you don't have one.

214
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,180
Ultrasound showed no narrowing
or obstruction in the patient's carotid.

215
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,377
Not that he's worried, keeps
asking when he can leave.

216
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,370
<i>A Place in the business
of healing people,</i>

217
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,772
<i>you'd think they'd have
better chicken soup.</i>

218
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,889
You bugged his room?

219
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,432
Our patient sleeps
in the building

220
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,195
where they keep their stash.

221
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,507
Eventually, he'll say something

222
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,560
that gives away where that is.

223
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,148
Then we'll find out
what's making him sick.

224
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,936
But we ruled out
environmental causes.

225
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,475
You ruled out
environmental causes.

226
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,704
And you pretended to agree

227
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,541
just so we'd take
him out of his room

228
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,047
so you could plant the bug.

229
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,447
Carotid stenosis
was a decent idea.

230
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,986
But an even
decent-er idea is that

231
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,918
he's got toxins
stored in his fat cells.

232
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,752
Every calorie he
burns makes him sicker.

233
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,724
If we're going with
toxic exposure,

234
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,727
we should just start testing
for the most likely suspects.

235
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,662
Bug's a better idea than
blindly running tests for days.

236
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,660
Tell him it'll take weeks.

237
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,864
It'll be faster.

238
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,436
What do you mean, weeks?

239
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,204
These tests take time,
there are a lot of possibilities.

240
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,872
I can't sit here this long.

241
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,414
I got things I
gotta take care of.

242
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,712
If you're worried about
all the poor schoolchildren

243
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,308
going without their drugs,

244
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,412
I'm sure someone... I
want to be discharged.

245
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,152
I'll get the forms.

246
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,698
This is ridiculous.

247
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,139
Beats sitting in a lab all day.

248
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,972
In the lab, there
is significantly

249
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,739
less chance of getting killed.

250
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,931
You're too close, slow down.

251
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,099
We're in a car in broad
daylight, what's gonna happen?

252
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,926
You honestly think he
doesn't have a gun in that car?

253
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,327
That he's gonna
use to shoot doctors?

254
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,515
Just back off.

255
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,559
Hey, well played with
the watch, by the way.

256
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,924
Borrowed it from a friend.

257
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,705
How much longer are we
gonna keep lying to him?

258
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,721
Until it's no longer fun.

259
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,229
We all thought he needed to
be taken down a few notches.

260
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,396
So, we're just having
fun, not getting even?

261
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,138
Oh, crap.

262
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

263
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,071
He's gonna get away.

264
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,583
Shut up.

265
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,822
3B. You're Nora, right?

266
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,740
My roommate tells me
you're the one to thank

267
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,199
for all the tips about
the neighborhood. Greg.

268
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,895
Nice to meet you.

269
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,333
I hear you thought
that Wilson and I liked

270
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,000
to polish each other's swords.

271
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,073
And by swords, I mean pistols.

272
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,238
Of course he told
you about that.

273
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,977
Don't worry. Actually, I'm surprised
that it doesn't happen more often.

274
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,814
We're both straight.

275
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,991
Oh, my God, that is beautiful.

276
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,762
We finally have the room to
display it the way it deserves.

277
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,800
Would you help
me get this upstairs?

278
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,239
Absolutely.

279
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,413
Nice shoes, by the
way. Louboutins?

280
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,373
Did you talk to Cuddy?

281
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,939
Shot me down.

282
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,416
So, what are you
going to do now?

283
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,952
I'll wait for my
review in August.

284
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,282
Oh.

285
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,223
What?

286
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,523
Nothing. That's what I
would do. But I'm a coward.

287
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,267
His friend brought
him in 15 minutes ago.

288
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,705
Temp's 105, pulse
is weak and thready.

289
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,435
He's not making any sense.

290
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,806
It's too much money, Eddie.

291
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,368
That wasn't the deal.
That wasn't the deal.

292
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,539
Is he gonna be okay?

293
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,637
Eddie!

294
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,314
We gave him anti-pyretics
and soft steroids

295
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,133
to reduce the fever and
prevent organ damage.

296
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,455
He's no longer delirious.

297
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,391
Patient went out, came
back worse than before.

298
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,742
Points us back to environmental,
tied to wherever he went.

299
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,287
No, it doesn't.

300
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,076
Where's Foreman? He
had a meeting with Cuddy.

301
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,444
What do you
mean, no, it doesn't?

302
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,460
We screwed up the tail,
my car was impounded.

303
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,732
True, amusing, and irrelevant.

304
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,266
Foreman fall for
the pay check thing?

305
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,474
Yeah.

306
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,408
<i>Mazel tov.</i> Should
be fun to watch.

307
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,576
You're off environmental?
Wherever he went,

308
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,847
it wasn't for long enough.

309
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,946
Add in the fever and
infection's way more likely.

310
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,547
And if it is an infection,

311
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,686
his symptoms suggest it's
moved to his brain, which means...

312
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,490
We'll do a lumbar puncture.

313
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,199
Next time you're tailing
someone, take two cars.

314
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,164
You knew we were following you?

315
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,070
I'm sorry, had to lose you.

316
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,909
I had business to take care of.

317
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,345
Right, because
you're a businessman.

318
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,994
You know how many
junkies come into the ER

319
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,486
every week with
their brains melting?

320
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,546
I bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out,

321
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,334
but a liquor store owner
laying on this table,

322
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,986
I'm guessing he
doesn't get attitude.

323
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,919
I hit bone.

324
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,124
His old back injury must
have flattened out his discs.

325
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,394
Sorry, but I've got
to try this again.

326
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,958
Are you okay? Yeah.

327
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,401
An adult wants to get wasted,

328
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,201
why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

329
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,300
Because some of those
substances are against the law.

330
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,244
So your problem
isn't that it's immoral,

331
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,474
your problem
is that it's illegal.

332
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,975
I got the same problem.

333
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,315
I'm in.

334
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,049
Look at his heart rate.

335
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,924
It's normal. I know.

336
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,265
I ran into Nora this morning.

337
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,896
She told me about
your <i>Evita</i> listening party.

338
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,774
The London and New York
recordings are so different.

339
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,369
You were supposed to
tell her that we're straight.

340
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,641
She didn't believe me either.

341
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,046
You're doing this
to mess with me.

342
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,675
Correction. I started
doing this to mess with you.

343
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,913
Now I'm honestly
trying to hit that.

344
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,082
By pretending you're gay
and in a relationship with me?

345
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,888
We're in a relationship,
but we're really unhappy.

346
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,370
Communication's
never been easy for us,

347
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,124
probably because
we're so closeted.

348
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,391
I've got it all figured out.

349
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,127
Nora and I spend the next
few weeks hanging out,

350
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,796
become best girlfriends, I
confide in her about our issues.

351
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:49,309
I can't decide if this plan is
more despicable or illogical.

352
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,209
Then one night, we get drunk,

353
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,976
backrub turns into a front
rub, and the next morning,

354
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,108
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before."

355
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,653
That's quite a
commitment you've made

356
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,155
to jumping the
girl I'd like to date.

357
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,815
I'd like to date her.

358
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,985
In the sense that I'd like
to jump her repeatedly.

359
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,288
I saw her first.

360
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,160
Seriously? You're
invoking the Guy Code?

361
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,859
We're guys. It's a code.

362
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,162
You're only bringing this up

363
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,674
'cause you know
you're going to lose.

364
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:18,963
It's not an infection,

365
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,906
but it might be an
autonomic nerve disorder.

366
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,670
The hair's still bumping me.

367
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,188
Did you get it cut because you're
ready for the next chapter or...

368
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,011
We stuck a needle into
his spinal bodies, twice,

369
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,606
his heart rate stayed normal.

370
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,584
If we add that to his
other symptoms...

371
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,883
That would be a mistake.

372
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,653
She's never gonna fall for it.

373
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,488
Well, then, you've got
nothing to worry about, sweetie.

374
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,923
You're a wuss.

375
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,593
Say that when I'm better.

376
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,798
What, are you gonna beat
me up? That sounds stressful.

377
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:56,365
Maybe you should pop one
of your beta-blockers first.

378
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,206
You have a heart problem?

379
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,837
Medically, no. He
would've told us about that.

380
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,472
Metaphorically...

381
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,024
It's an effect from
operating outside of the law.

382
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,122
Sometimes, I have
to do bad things,

383
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,599
and not always to bad people.

384
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,261
Last few months, that
hasn't been so easy.

385
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,603
A guy got me the pills,
and they control the stress.

386
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,204
Look, don't say anything
to Eddie, all right?

387
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,250
Last thing I need is the guys
thinking that I've gone soft.

388
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,115
When was your last pill before
we originally admitted you?

389
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,951
Um... The night before.

390
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,890
Then we stuck you in here and
you went into beta-blocker withdrawal.

391
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,449
That's what caused
the hypertension.

392
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,137
When he got out of
here, he took another pill,

393
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,424
and the hypertension went away,

394
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,773
which means it was
never a symptom.

395
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,699
We take that off the table,
we've got vertigo, fever...

396
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,464
And stress. He's been
in this game for a while,

397
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,801
either he grew a conscience
over the last few months,

398
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,432
or he's producing
excess adrenaline.

399
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,970
Pheochromocytoma.

400
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,307
What? That's Greek for

401
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,577
"you'll be back doing bad
things to good people in no time."

402
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,244
MRI his adrenal glands.
You're okay with that, right?

403
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,378
You're not gonna put
a pillow over his face?

404
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,895
Oh, great, the cable guy came.

405
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,659
Hello.

406
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,864
Hi, James. We've got
some Kung Pao left.

407
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,870
Oh, God. Right there.

408
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,570
We're having a picnic.

409
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,136
With wine.

410
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,545
I'll pour you a glass.

411
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,639
He doesn't drink.

412
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,740
Oh.

413
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,445
More for us then.

414
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,820
Well,

415
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:57,388
I think I might have
a little Kung Pao.

416
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,333
How did it go with Cuddy?

417
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,374
She told me I needed leverage,

418
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,881
so I told her about an offer

419
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,349
I had to help run the
neuro department at Mercy.

420
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,577
Wow.

421
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,616
Are you really
gonna take the job?

422
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,715
There is no other job.

423
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,953
I bluffed, she called it.

424
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,019
I'm not gonna beg
to be underpaid.

425
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,389
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

426
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,836
House is lying to you.

427
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,165
I know.

428
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,834
And so are you.

429
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,140
It's 2010. I mean, nobody
cares if you're gay any more.

430
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,892
I mean, you don't
have to be in the closet.

431
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,745
I'm not.

432
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,981
Look around you.
Does this really

433
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,180
look like a place gay men live?

434
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,246
Apart from the poster.

435
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,258
Those stools are
our only furniture.

436
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,487
There are no window treatments.

437
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,962
My ex-boyfriend didn't even
know what window treatments were.

438
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,194
Is that Greg's Carpenters
album, or yours?

439
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,397
Look, House hates musicals
and fashion and meringue.

440
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,967
This whole thing is an act
designed to earn your trust

441
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,606
in order to sleep with you.

442
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,481
I get it. Finally.

443
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,110
You're jealous.

444
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:32,989
If you want to spend more time
with Greg, you should just tell him.

445
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,630
You were wrong.

446
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,257
MRI revealed no sign
of a pheochromocytoma,

447
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,165
which means Mickey's
stress is just stress.

448
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,446
We're back to vertigo and fever.

449
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,848
And environmental is back at
the top of our list of suspects.

450
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,283
We're trying to narrow
down the possibilities.

451
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,936
That receiver doesn't
respond to manual stimulation.

452
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,220
Maybe if you
took off your shirt...

453
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,509
Actually, I've resorted
to something more exotic.

454
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,674
I call it reading
the instructions.

455
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:00,208
Turns out, if you screw the
antennae into the wrong sockets,

456
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,312
it doesn't actually work.

457
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,419
We lost Mickey just
outside of Trenton.

458
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,965
It's supposed to search
for an open frequency.

459
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,969
Most buildings there were
built between 1920 and 1940.

460
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,547
We compiled a list of
toxins most common...

461
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:21,564
There's got to be at
least one open frequency.

462
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,508
I need a few minutes
with your friend.

463
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,314
Or stay if you want.

464
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,252
Rectal exam.

465
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,551
I'll check out the cafeteria.

466
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,898
Why the beta-blockers?

467
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,794
What do you mean?

468
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,637
Valium or Xanax
actually reduce stress.

469
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,484
Beta-blockers just control
the symptoms of stress...

470
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,532
Whoa.

471
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,875
Keep the heart from
racing, hands from shaking,

472
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,141
and all those
stage fright issues.

473
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,150
That's why some people
take them when they

474
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,480
perform.

475
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,578
What the hell is that?

476
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,248
This is my bug.

477
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,882
And this...

478
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,191
This...

479
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,453
This is yours.

480
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,660
You bugged your own
room? Are you an informant?

481
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,933
An informant would've
sold his pals out to us

482
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,634
at the first sign of a sniffle.

483
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,040
This guy is a cop.

484
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,608
I don't see how
this is relevant.

485
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:44,089
In the land of No Fun, you got a
really sensible piece of property.

486
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,749
Give him a break.

487
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,327
Knowing this guy's
an undercover cop

488
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,871
doesn't get us any
closer to curing him.

489
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,523
Good point. You
know what they say,

490
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,396
information is not power. Wait.

491
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,265
You're saying we should use
the cop thing to force him to talk.

492
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:01,000
Force? I'm talking about the
womanly art of persuasion.

493
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,398
I said womanly.

494
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,095
If you won't talk to us,
we'll find someone who will.

495
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,647
I mean, you must have
a supervisor, a handler.

496
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:21,182
Good luck with that. You
don't know my real name.

497
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,856
You don't know if I'm
local or state, FBI, DEA,

498
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,899
but by all means,
get on the phone.

499
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,594
I get it. These
guys are lowlifes,

500
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,999
you want them off the street.

501
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,800
Look, they're not just lowlifes.

502
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,238
Eddie killed a snitch
three weeks ago.

503
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,543
Boss's orders.

504
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,539
The boss, he's
one of the biggest

505
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,447
cocaine importers
in the entire state.

506
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,179
And he wants to
expand down to Philly.

507
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:51,622
Tomorrow night, he and
Eddie are meeting the big fish,

508
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,488
and the cops are gonna bust it.

509
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,154
But if you guys get
caught poking around there,

510
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,993
the whole thing gets called off.

511
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,933
That's noble, but you
can't put your life at risk.

512
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,665
I've been undercover
for 16 months.

513
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:12,038
I haven't seen my
wife, my house, my dog.

514
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,641
I've put far too much into this,

515
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,547
and I will not let it fail.

516
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,979
So, just...

517
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:25,388
Just keep me alive
for another 24 hours

518
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,723
and I will tell you
everything you need to know.

519
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,361
Hey. Can I come in?

520
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,096
Nurses out here can't
keep their hands off of me.

521
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,034
Casanova, huh?

522
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,942
You bring me my sandwich?

523
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,674
No, because, guess
what, I don't read minds.

524
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,514
You okay?

525
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,318
He had a GI infarction
caused by a clot

526
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,419
in his superior
mesenteric artery.

527
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,895
We had to remove
a foot of bowel.

528
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,762
Any more clots keep forming,
he may not last 24 hours.

529
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,699
And the moron still won't talk.

530
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,862
Bad guy, cool, good guy, moron?

531
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,030
Pretty much.

532
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,266
Guy's a hero.

533
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,339
He's risking his life to
put these dealers in jail.

534
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,707
Well, I'm sure the dealers

535
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,245
who take their places
will be very grateful.

536
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,009
So, vertigo, fever,
and thrombosis.

537
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,074
We already ruled out
cancer and infection.

538
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,143
He got worse on steroids, which
suggests it's not autoimmune.

539
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,950
So we're stuck
with environmental.

540
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,490
But what kind of environmentals?

541
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,458
Toxins? Parasites? Allergens?

542
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,204
We should just pick the top 10
possibilities and treat for all of them.

543
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,605
Except that treating
for everything could

544
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,598
kill him faster than
whatever's killing him.

545
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:40,724
Got a better idea?

546
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,799
Sort of.

547
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,411
Chase is right, our
patient's holding out

548
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,404
for noble reasons,
protecting his bust.

549
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,962
Anybody else in
that crew got sick,

550
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,907
I'm guessing they'd be
a little more self-serving.

551
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,843
Thanks.

552
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:01,449
Surgery went well. You'll
be able to see him soon.

553
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,754
Used to be all about
Ferberizing your kid,

554
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,556
now they're saying it
could mess them up.

555
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,765
Mine's six-and-a-half.

556
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,834
Mickey's getting worse.

557
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,528
The clot is a very bad sign.

558
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,006
We really need you to
tell us where he's been.

559
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,507
I do that,

560
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,036
a very good chance that I could
end up John Doe at the county ME.

561
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,982
Look, Mickey got sick because
he had the most exposure.

562
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,214
Other guys are at risk,
too, you don't want to...

563
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,178
Are you okay?

564
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,116
I feel dizzy.

565
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,524
Are you diabetic?

566
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,886
No.

567
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,739
When was the last time
you were at your office?

568
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,787
Whoa.

569
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,856
Did you drug me? What?

570
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,697
You're trying to make
me think that I'm sick

571
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,397
so I'll take you to the stash.

572
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,201
Of course not,
but if you are sick...

573
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,209
I don't feel sick,
I feel drugged.

574
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,643
Trust me, I know the difference.

575
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,125
You didn't even
drink half of it,

576
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,141
you'll be fine in an hour.

577
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,312
You think Mickey could die?

578
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,484
It's just a deal.

579
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,386
I'll take you.

580
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,547
You couldn't have
given us a heads up

581
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,199
that he was living
in a dry cleaner?

582
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,934
It's like living in
a vat of poison.

583
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,203
Is that it? Can we
get out of here?

584
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,420
I've got to cover all our bases.

585
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,778
Okay, fine, look.
Back there. Hurry up.

586
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:54,690
What are these? More
chemicals? Not exactly.

587
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,192
If this stuff was the problem,

588
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,749
there would be a
lot more sick people.

589
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,600
Did you call the cops?

590
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,675
No.

591
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,142
No one's supposed to be here.

592
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,916
Come here.

593
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,383
I said no kissing.

594
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,977
Eddie, I didn't
know you'd be here.

595
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:17,932
Look, the deal was just for you.

596
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,721
This guy wants to
watch, it's an extra 50.

597
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,986
Yeah, private party, man.
I got it covered tonight.

598
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,175
Nice.

599
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,475
The jealousy is killing me.

600
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,574
Well,

601
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,745
he clearly cares
about you very much.

602
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,280
Why can't he show
it in a normal way?

603
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:58,396
I'm so tired of all the
silence and the resentment.

604
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,924
I don't know if I can
go back there tonight.

605
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,231
I need some time.

606
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,241
Come stay at my place.

607
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,767
Really?

608
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,039
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,545
It'll be fun, like a sleepover.

610
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:25,115
That would be such
a help. Thank you.

611
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,253
House.

612
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,723
What are you doing here?

613
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,356
I'm here because...

614
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,862
Nothing you can say is
going to change anything.

615
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,638
I love this man.

616
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:54,785
And I am not wasting another
moment of my life denying that.

617
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,526
Gregory House,

618
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,090
will you marry me?

619
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,293
Wow.

620
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,528
This is unexpected.

621
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,669
Say yes.

622
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,242
I'm going to go. No, no, no.

623
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:26,308
You two obviously have
some talking to do. Excuse me.

624
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,257
How's it coming?

625
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,529
So far, nothing.

626
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,164
Carpet, paint, insulation, even
the gross food in the fridge,

627
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,316
everything's coming up clean.

628
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,366
Which leaves the
dry-cleaning chemicals.

629
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,719
Should have the
results in a few minutes.

630
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,236
Foreman's already started
him on inhaled albuterol.

631
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,509
Chances are this case is over.

632
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,414
We have to tell him.
We can't tell him.

633
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,095
It won't change the fact
that Cuddy let him walk.

634
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,112
It'll just let him know it was
all because of a stupid prank.

635
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,691
We have to tell Cuddy. We
confess and beg her to take him back.

636
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,629
If begging worked, he would have
a raise and we wouldn't be screwed.

637
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,222
Albuterol's not helping,

638
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,597
patient started coughing blood.

639
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,159
What about adding
ipratropium? That might...

640
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,431
Don't bother.

641
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,201
We assumed this place
was using perchloroethylene.

642
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,834
Turns out, petroleum solvents.

643
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,375
The drug dealers are
running a green dry cleaner.

644
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,006
I hate to push past the irony,

645
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,913
but our patient's
bleeding into his lungs

646
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,474
and we've got nothing.

647
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,391
The V/Q scan last night
showed a pulmonary aneurysm.

648
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,826
Explains the coughing blood.

649
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,159
Did an embolization
and stopped the bleeding,

650
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,689
but then it started up again this
morning. Three more aneurysms.

651
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,769
These look like
mycotic aneurysms,

652
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,236
indicates a fungal infection.

653
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,982
That'd be consistent with his other
symptoms, the vertigo, the fever...

654
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,552
I didn't see any fungus at the
location, and none of the samples...

655
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,807
Looks like somebody
missed something,

656
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,074
which is embarrassing
for somebody.

657
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,082
And the steroids
we gave him would

658
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,674
have suppressed
his immune system.

659
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,050
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

660
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,149
Somebody's got a good point.

661
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:15,160
One bleed to four in less than 12
hours seems like an uptake to me.

662
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,889
We need to start him
on antifungal meds

663
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,727
before he drowns
in his own blood.

664
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,329
Do it.

665
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,368
How long till it starts working?

666
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,705
Give it a few hours. I'll
be back to check on you.

667
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,186
There you go. Take it easy.

668
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,740
You shouldn't have taken
her there, you imbecile.

669
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,502
They found nothing,

670
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,341
and you could've got
your brains blown out.

671
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,782
I had to do something. I
couldn't just sit and watch and...

672
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,385
You're my friend.

673
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,123
Thanks.

674
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,762
You'd do it for me.

675
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,396
Ah!

676
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,834
I should get going.

677
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,398
Got the big man from
Philly coming in tonight.

678
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,749
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

679
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,754
I mean, Jimmie knows
everything that we know.

680
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,146
No.

681
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,553
For the six months
we put in on this,

682
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,327
you gotta be there.

683
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,671
I'll swing by tomorrow.

684
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,202
Hey, Eddie.

685
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,976
Yeah?

686
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,014
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,309
You know, that I
can't go with you.

688
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,762
It was all our fault.

689
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,701
We were screwing with Foreman,

690
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,036
trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

691
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,269
Obviously, things
got out of control.

692
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,540
Someone does something
stupid and insensitive,

693
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,309
I always figure it was House.

694
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,482
Good to know it's catching.

695
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,745
Look, there is no other job.

696
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,138
He was just trying
to get a raise.

697
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,746
Even if you gave him a little
more money, I know he'd stay.

698
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,791
I'm not giving Foreman a raise

699
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,453
because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

700
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,393
We know. And that's
why we want you

701
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,693
to take it out of
our pay checks.

702
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,366
You two okay with this?

703
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,643
Is there any other option?

704
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,297
We're okay with it.

705
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,603
Foreman is a good team leader.

706
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,767
He deserves it.

707
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,509
Okay, then.

708
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,878
That is what I will do.

709
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,114
And just so you know,

710
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,863
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

711
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:32,289
I haven't seen
Foreman in three days.

712
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:47,504
The phrase "Who's your
daddy?" comes to mind.

713
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,711
You wanna grab some coffee?

714
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,516
Kind of a bad time.

715
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,991
Sorry. You told me to drop by,

716
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,753
so this is when I could make it.

717
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,795
Right. Come in.

718
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,631
This whole thing with
Wilson, it's all my fault.

719
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,505
We're not closeted
because we're not gay.

720
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,273
For real.

721
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,442
Wilson thought you were cute,

722
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,449
I was just yanking his chain.

723
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,579
Maybe that's not
the best phrasing.

724
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,419
So you were only spending
time with me to screw with him?

725
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,391
God, no. I was
spending time with you

726
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,017
because I want to
touch your boobs.

727
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,359
Enough to listen to <i>Evita</i>,
twice, and I really hate <i>Evita.</i>

728
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,865
That's how much
I like your boobs.

729
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,867
Wait. Wait, wait.

730
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:01,573
Wilson, he's a really good
guy and he really likes you.

731
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,018
Well, it's really...

732
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:10,078
It's sweet of you to stick
up for your friend like that.

733
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,656
And you're still trying
to sleep with me.

734
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,789
Maybe I will call him,
it would serve you right.

735
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,696
Wilson's a jerk, too.

736
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,826
At least he tried
to do the right thing.

737
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,632
He's been divorced three times,

738
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,365
he slept with a dying patient.

739
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,408
Sure, he looks like a
Boy Scout, but that...

740
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,259
The aneurysms look mycotic,

741
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,856
but they're not,
they're inflammatory.

742
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,969
Because it's not
a fungal infection.

743
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,164
The hypertension
was a real symptom.

744
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,469
You've been unwittingly
treating it with beta-blockers.

745
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,068
You stopped taking them and
your blood pressure went up.

746
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,009
It's Hughes-Stovin.

747
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,981
Okay, so how do we treat this?

748
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,282
We don't.

749
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,859
Hughes-Stovin is an
autoimmune disease.

750
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,126
Once it's this advanced,
there's not much we can do.

751
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,326
The aneurysms keep multiplying.

752
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,666
Eventually, one
of them will rupture.

753
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,997
Are you sure?

754
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,243
If you die in the next
day or so, I will be.

755
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,073
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

756
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,381
it wouldn't have
made a difference.

757
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,114
You did the right thing.

758
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,688
I think I should
call my wife now.

759
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:58,645
I'm sorry about your patient.

760
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,915
He died a hero in his own mind.

761
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,649
I guess it's better
than nothing.

762
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,053
Ran into Nora in the elevator.

763
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,117
She no longer thinks we're gay,

764
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,753
now she thinks we're
mendacious dirtbags.

765
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,058
Mendacious dirtbag comes
much more naturally to me.

766
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,267
At least we can get rid of that.

767
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,299
I kind of like it.

768
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,365
Unlike this sofa.

769
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,467
It's 500 bucks.

770
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,604
And it reclines.

771
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:37,413
<i>One singular sensation
Every little step she takes</i>

772
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,389
I will punch you in the face.

773
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,790
I'll stop if you
get rid of the sofa.

774
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,653
No chance.

775
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:50,293
<i>One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes</i>

776
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:57,941
<i>One smile and suddenly
nobody else will do</i>
