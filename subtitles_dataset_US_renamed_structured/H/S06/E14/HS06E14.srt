1
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,571
Are you ever coming to bed?

2
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,414
I still say I'm a vegetarian.

3
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,510
You can say that
you're an astronaut,

4
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,077
but that doesn't make it true.

5
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,180
A salmon is not a
vegetable, Frankie.

6
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,568
Well, apparently eight out of
10 commenters agree with you,

7
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,060
except for the part
where you said,

8
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,187
"I believe what I
want to believe."

9
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,606
That, they found
a little judgmental.

10
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,929
You blogged our argument?

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,491
I asked you to quit
talking about me.

12
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,867
I don't want a bunch of
people that I don't know

13
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,982
hearing stuff that's meant
to be between me and you.

14
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,305
I write about my life,

15
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,707
and you're a big part of that.

16
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,777
That's great. I want to
be a big part of your life,

17
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,838
but I don't want to be
a big part of their lives.

18
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,876
Take it down. Erase it,
delete it, make it go away.

19
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,271
Come on, man, it's
2:00 in the morning,

20
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,539
these walls are
made of tissue paper.

21
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,003
I gotta be up in three hours
to do a wiring job out in Edison.

22
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,346
Sorry, we'll try
to hold it down.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,424
Sorry.

24
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,962
Frankie, what happened?

25
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,174
No, no, that's not what you
think. Something's wrong.

26
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,609
We need a police
car at 152 Haverhill.

27
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,204
What are you two talking about?

28
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,349
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,811
Are you all right?

30
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,014
I think it's coming
from my gums.

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,508
What are you doing tonight?

32
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,966
Masturbating.

33
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,195
I'd invite you, but people
are already talking.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,036
It's pathetic. You divide your nights
between porn and the Discovery Channel.

35
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,440
Right, playing <i>Dance Dance
Revolution</i> is a much better choice.

36
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:01,277
Okay, that was a gift from a patient,
and it happens to be great exercise.

37
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,147
I mean, who rents porn anymore?

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,913
Can't you get that
stuff on the Internet?

39
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,753
You can, but you can't get disk
two with the director's commentary.

40
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,893
Come out with me tonight.
I'm going speed dating.

41
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,985
If you mean you're dating
on meth, count me in.

42
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,135
You need to meet somebody.

43
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,373
This way, you meet
20 somebodies.

44
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,389
Over a five-minute
discussion of Proust?

45
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,764
Speed dating's a meat market.

46
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,429
Yeah, dozens of women,
just waiting to be hit on.

47
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,338
Your odds of a happy ending are nearly
as good as staying home and watching porn.

48
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,108
You plan on doing
any work today?

49
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,121
I thought I might do a little
light doctoring in the afternoon.

50
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,851
Twenty-eight-year-old female,
sudden unexplained coagulopathy.

51
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,619
Could be congenital
thrombocytopenia.

52
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,819
Platelets look normal.

53
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,005
The patient makes money
doing freelance photography.

54
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,589
Some photographic
processes produce toxic gases.

55
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,310
She's a blogger. I can't see her
photos being anything but digital.

56
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,271
What does she blog? Politics?
Dominatrix? Cooking? I need recipes.

57
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,018
It's a personal journal. I don't
get putting your whole life online.

58
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,942
It's not that crazy. Privacy's
basically a modern invention.

59
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,469
Towns used to be too small
for anybody to keep any secrets.

60
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,608
What if it's not the platelets, but
the glue that holds them together?

61
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,176
No, thrombin and von
Willebrand factor are normal.

62
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,726
And knowing too
much about each other

63
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,689
is exactly why people leave
small towns and move to the city.

64
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,302
And a lot of people
choose to stay

65
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,990
because in return for zero privacy,
you get community, connection...

66
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,362
Big, red A's for our tunics.

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,060
Connections are for airports.

68
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,659
For people, we have
over 300 cable channels.

69
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,047
Her photos may be digital,

70
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,516
doesn't mean she couldn't have
been exposed to some other toxin.

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,872
We should search the apartment.

72
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,241
Eenie, meenie, minie,
Thirteen and Tiny.

73
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,350
This one's locked.

74
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,679
I'm surprised you took
the pro-community position.

75
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,020
I have friends, I like people.

76
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,253
You also like secrets.

77
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,594
You deny it, that sort
of proves my point.

78
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,999
When we're left to our own
devices, we make lousy choices.

79
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,531
Ignore it.

80
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,940
I can hear you in there. Open
the door or I'm calling the cops.

81
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,555
We're four stories up, but there's
a fire escape on the other wall.

82
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,241
The ledge might
be wide enough...

83
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,976
We're doctors. We
aren't stealing anything.

84
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,419
We are collecting samples.

85
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,551
Who are you? The neighbor.

86
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,835
Did they say that you
could come in here?

87
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,794
Yep. What do you know
about Frankie and Taylor?

88
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,728
Not much. The guy works a
lot, but I see Frankie around.

89
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,029
We argue a few times a week, and
then we go back about our business.

90
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,124
What do you argue about?

91
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,579
Frankie's got some
strong opinions.

92
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,368
Wants to recycle
every molecule of trash.

93
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,431
You take the
anti-recycling position?

94
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,978
Trash piling up for composting is
attracting every rat in the neighborhood.

95
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,774
I had to put down poison.

96
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,524
That's her private drawer,
what are you doing over there?

97
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,127
She says she doesn't have any
secrets, I'm taking her at her word.

98
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,212
Is there any chance Frankie
touched the rat poison?

99
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,727
Touched it? She
grabbed a chunk of it

100
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,281
right out of the mouth of the
schnauzer from down the hall.

101
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,384
Now every time I put the
stuff down, she picks it back up.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,281
You brought a date?

103
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,995
Wilson seemed to
think it was a good idea.

104
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,548
You need to dive
back into the pool.

105
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,093
And he has to swim in ours?

106
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,651
You go to a bar, you
bring your ugly friends.

107
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,663
It's not a beauty pageant.

108
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,359
Life is a beauty pageant.

109
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,265
Little girls who kiss frogs
expect them to turn into you.

110
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,600
Come on, I'm not
that good-looking.

111
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,798
Yeah, you are.

112
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,332
You kind of are.

113
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,343
So you attribute
every relationship

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,505
I've ever had to the
height of my cheekbones?

115
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,324
Not the whole relationship,
just the beginning.

116
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,260
- The rest is your hair.
- This is ridiculous.

117
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,186
Women aren't as distracted
by appearances as we are.

118
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,653
They look deeper.

119
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,451
You wanna bet?

120
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,859
You can't tell anyone you're
a doctor. You're unemployed.

121
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,863
You're also a little slow.
Misunderstand everything they say.

122
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,660
And lose the accent.

123
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,964
A hundred bucks says you still
walk out of here with a dozen names.

124
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,971
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fun is about to start.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,474
When I strike this gong,

126
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,010
each man should sit at the
table you've been assigned.

127
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,570
When I strike it again,
date's over, move on.

128
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,976
I'm an oncologist.

129
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,921
My aunt and my grandma, they
both died from breast cancer.

130
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,557
Do you want to talk about it?

131
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,893
I'm a diagnostician.

132
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,432
I find out what's wrong
with people and I fix it.

133
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,695
Don't all doctors do that?

134
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,568
Yeah, but they
can't dance like I can.

135
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,265
I play video games.

136
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,039
Oh, professionally?

137
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,038
I wish, bro.

138
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,748
After six months of chemo, we
thought he was out of the woods.

139
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,557
I don't want kids. Check.

140
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,717
I'm thinking about
going from a C to a D.

141
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,885
Quadruple check.

142
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,929
And I'm on fire for the Lord.

143
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,763
I'm a chocolatier.

144
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,630
I could tell by your hips.

145
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,761
Yeah, I guess I could
afford to lose a few pounds.

146
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,400
I don't think I know
anybody who died of cancer.

147
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:32,310
Thank God. For you,
I mean. Obviously.

148
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:36,577
Except my cat. She
died a few months ago.

149
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,775
I hate these things.

150
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,912
You here at gunpoint?
Need me to call 911?

151
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,926
Friend dragged me. She
keeps trying to fix my life,

152
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,895
which, admittedly, could
use it, but still, annoying.

153
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,427
You like puzzles.

154
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,333
I hoped my job would let me
play with puzzles all day long,

155
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,802
but it didn't work out that way.

156
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,299
Police detective. Turns
out criminals are idiots.

157
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,470
If they're not gonna bother to
challenge you, what's the point?

158
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,575
Is there a fire
alarm we could pull?

159
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,346
Maybe get out of here.

160
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,452
Except maybe
you're just too swoft.

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,560
I beg your pardon?

162
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,790
Swoft. It's one of your
crossword answers.

163
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,729
I believe it means,
"Lying manipulator

164
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,597
"who tells men anything
they want to hear."

165
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,330
You brought a prop as
a conversation starter,

166
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,748
folded the paper to make it
look read, filled in some answers,

167
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,116
but you couldn't be
bothered to work at it,

168
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,972
so you just put
in random letters.

169
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,602
You have some
natural talent as a liar,

170
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,647
but not enough
brains to see it through.

171
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,545
I'm gonna assume
you're not a cop.

172
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,143
Are the five minutes up?

173
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,031
These women would
welcome a call from you.

174
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,295
And these women would
welcome a call from you.

175
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,799
My.

176
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,414
It's nice to have visitors.

177
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
I'm updating my blog.

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,521
And I'm reading it.

179
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,052
You realize you're
in the same room.

180
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,391
Sorry.

181
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,340
So I've been thinking
about what you said,

182
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,061
and I'm sure I washed my hands
after I threw out the rat poison.

183
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,659
Apparently you did it multiple
times, over a course of days.

184
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,736
Can't be too certain.

185
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,329
You must be Dr. Foreman.

186
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,439
Gotta get back to work. Okay.

187
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,874
Take it easy. Okay.

188
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,577
What? She reads my blog.

189
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,862
Personally, I don't think
you're condescending at all.

190
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,446
That's not what I wrote. When
you were taking my history,

191
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,533
I told you I went white-water
rafting six months ago,

192
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,685
and you said it was
"unlikely to be related."

193
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,159
I was just giving information.

194
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,738
Let's face it, you
got a little snarky.

195
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,482
You can't convey a
tone of voice in writing.

196
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,863
I just put what you said.

197
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,443
If you don't want people to
think you're condescending,

198
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,335
maybe you shouldn't
say condescending things.

199
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,038
Can this wait a second?
'Cause I have to pee.

200
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,104
I think people behave badly because
there are no records of what we say or do,

201
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,980
and nobody believes
anymore that God's watching.

202
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,552
Well, God's not, but I am.

203
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,283
Everything is on the record,
including everything I do.

204
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,154
I don't think my pee is
supposed to be mud-colored.

205
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,128
We were wrong
about the rat poison.

206
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,070
Coagulopathy plus
kidney equals what?

207
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,437
Hemolytic uremic syndrome.

208
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,206
Normal creatinine levels.

209
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,247
She has elevated cholesterol.

210
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,977
Hey, Wilson! I
can't find my pornos.

211
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,643
Have you tried
offering a reward?

212
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,882
Gaucher's Disease. It would affect
her ability to synthesize Vitamin K.

213
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,585
She's on a semi-
vegetarian diet.

214
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,149
Means she gets
plenty of Vitamin K.

215
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,092
Sjogrens is more likely.

216
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,063
I assume you moved them
while you were dusting.

217
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,430
I checked the drawers, window
sill, the DVD player in your room.

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,969
The quiet ones are
always deeply repressed.

219
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,096
I returned them to the store.

220
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,950
She had a fish dinner
a couple of nights ago.

221
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,068
Could be Haff Disease
causing rhabdo.

222
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,634
What? Why did you
return them to the store?

223
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,476
It's no trouble, I had to stop next
door for my dry cleaning anyway.

224
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,160
Sjogrens would inhibit the clotting
enzymes, infiltrate the kidneys,

225
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,728
explains everything.
So does Haff Disease.

226
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,448
I'm not thanking you,
I'm asking you why.

227
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,854
Because if I did happen to
bring a woman home last night,

228
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,587
I wanted it to be
a porn-free zone.

229
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,500
You do realize things don't have
to be socks to go into a sock drawer.

230
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,196
I'm sorry. Horribly,
horribly sorry.

231
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,207
I thought you'd
watched them all.

232
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,777
You completely
ruined my morning.

233
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,905
I had to pull out your
old family photos.

234
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,974
Your mom was pretty hot.

235
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,782
Haff Disease fits
the timing best.

236
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,189
Start her on saline
and Mannitol.

237
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,601
You reading your patient's blog?

238
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,797
No.

239
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,270
You should. Could be some clues.

240
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,677
Too many. It'd be like
doing a whole body scan,

241
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,975
send us up eight blind alleys.

242
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,276
That's why Chase is doing it.

243
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,048
She mentions you.

244
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,245
She's never met me.

245
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,953
You're an unseen presence,
like the Wizard of Oz.

246
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,426
He was a fraud. She couldn't
have gone with Keyser Söze?

247
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,861
Speaking of movies that
don't make any sense,

248
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,923
I stopped at the rental store
to get those pornos back.

249
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,545
I told the guy at the counter I was
so grateful that you'd returned them,

250
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,233
but I wanted them, and guess
what? You only returned two.

251
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,635
You lost the third.

252
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,942
Decent of you to pay for it,
not let them put it on my bill.

253
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,275
You know...

254
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,042
I can explain what happened.

255
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,210
I'm sure you could,

256
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,765
but rather than listen to your
lies, I thought it'd be more fun

257
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,416
to drive all over town
and get another copy.

258
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,890
You have it here?

259
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,941
Oh, God. Oh, God.

260
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,441
Okay, first, that's not me.

261
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,106
It's not... Mostly not...

262
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:48,152
I was in college! I don't... My
roommate was minoring in film.

263
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,250
Are you hyperventilating?

264
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:53,088
Remember that covering your
mouth and one nostril can help.

265
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,596
He had to get this in for some
grade, and he was desperate.

266
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,826
And the only reason I did it was
because no one would ever see it.

267
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,163
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

268
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,034
He's not a director,
he's an artist.

269
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:10,307
The way he plays with light
and darkness and boobs.

270
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,140
Look, that's not me.

271
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,010
<i>What are you? Where
are you taking me?</i>

272
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,707
<i>Be not afraid.</i>

273
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,480
<i>The forest nymphs have taught
me how to please a woman.</i>

274
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,852
That's not me! It's not me.
You can see it's not me!

275
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,686
He added extra scenes so
he could release it as a porno.

276
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,199
Be not afraid, Wilson.
You took risks for your art.

277
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,666
Oh, boy.

278
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:45,472
No one... Hey, look at me.
No one can know about this.

279
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,347
From this moment
on, my lips are sealed.

280
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,515
Sorry. It's okay.

281
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,751
Be not afraid.

282
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,855
Find anything?

283
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,663
Relevant? No.
Interesting? I guess.

284
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,865
There's nothing she doesn't
share. "Angry sex is overrated.

285
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,569
"How can he expect me to be
aroused when I'm so pissed at him?"

286
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,941
Revelations like that might
just earn her a new kidney.

287
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,173
An hour after she blogged
about her kidney failure,

288
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,614
the hospital got a
call from Singapore.

289
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,118
One of Frankie's readers asking
how hard it would be to donate.

290
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,417
How good-looking am I?

291
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,894
I'm not asking if
you're attracted to me,

292
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,864
I'm looking for an
objective answer.

293
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,059
Oh, okay, then it's an
appropriate question.

294
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,228
Last night I acted like a
complete tosser to prove to House

295
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,101
that women don't go
out with me for my looks.

296
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,767
Cost me 100 bucks and my
definition of myself. And women.

297
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,107
So date men, they're
not shallow at all.

298
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,277
Everything's physical. Yes,

299
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,576
we are physical beings.
Some more than others.

300
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,050
Please don't define my entire
gender based on one night.

301
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,952
No. What if the patient's
problem is a physical reaction,

302
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,546
not an emotional one?

303
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,752
What if her lack of arousal
had nothing to do with their fight?

304
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,295
Sjogrens would inhibit
her normal secretions.

305
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,259
Sorry for keeping you up. I thought
it better not to wait till morning.

306
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,965
Oh, it's no problem,
I'm a night owl.

307
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:26,838
So you think I might have this Sjogrens
because of my lack of discharge?

308
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,643
Yes. It's lucky you
wrote about that.

309
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,650
And a little crazy, you're
thinking, to share that much.

310
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:37,190
Not crazy, unusual, to be so
intimate with people you don't know.

311
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,658
But I do know them. They read
my blog, I comment on theirs.

312
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,437
Just because you haven't
met someone physically

313
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,827
doesn't mean you
don't know them.

314
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,297
What about you? Are
you in a relationship?

315
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,831
It recently ended.

316
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,164
Oh, sorry.

317
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,829
Lie flat on your
back, all the way.

318
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,440
But you saw each
other every day, right?

319
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,522
How much did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

320
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,125
Or did you just end up talking
about where you were going to dinner

321
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,948
and who needed
to do the laundry?

322
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,830
Is that what your
relationship with Taylor is like?

323
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,947
No.

324
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,457
Well, maybe a little.

325
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,190
He's great, but sometimes

326
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,663
it's easier to open up to
people who aren't looking at you.

327
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,724
You need to lie flat
for us to get the x-ray.

328
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,396
I'm actually not comfortable on
my back. Can't we do it this way?

329
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,665
Did you strain a muscle?

330
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,832
No.

331
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,100
What's wrong?

332
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,348
I've booked our patient
in for heart surgery.

333
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,684
I was doing a sialogram on her,
and she didn't want to lie on her back.

334
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,554
That's a complaint you hear
from people with heart valve issues.

335
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,753
It fits. Sjogrens
damaged her heart,

336
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,105
causing her clotting problems,
causing her kidneys to fail.

337
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,293
You based all that on the fact
that she didn't want to lie down?

338
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:57,962
That, and the cardiac echo I performed
after she didn't want to lie down.

339
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,768
Her mitral valve is nearly gone,

340
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,571
which means she's nearly gone.

341
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,738
God, you're pretty.

342
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:17,518
So we can replace the mitral valve
with a pig valve or with a plastic one.

343
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,525
From an actual pig?

344
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,653
It's the better choice if you
want to have children someday.

345
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,357
The plastic valve requires
you to be on anticoagulants,

346
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,024
which are known to
cause birth defects.

347
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,898
On the other hand, the
pig valve wears out quickly,

348
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,200
so you'd need to have heart
surgery again in 10 years.

349
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,232
I know that you're on the fence about
having kids, but Taylor really wants them.

350
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,111
It's in the blog.

351
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,617
I'm afraid you two will need to agree
on that decision earlier than planned.

352
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,060
It's your call.

353
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,565
Can you pass me my laptop?

354
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,332
Seriously? I want to
get some feedback.

355
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,563
You really think
that asking strangers

356
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,971
for some off-the-top-of-their-head
response is gonna be helpful here?

357
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,009
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

358
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,949
They've got you two-thirds
of the way to vegan,

359
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,106
what are they gonna say about you
buying your life with the life of a pig?

360
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,047
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

361
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,277
It won't work out that way,

362
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,514
and we're the ones that are
gonna have to live with this.

363
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,986
Please, Frankie.
Don't tell them.

364
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,819
If I start picking and
choosing, I'm being dishonest.

365
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,930
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,945
Thanks.

367
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,162
Though I guess I should thank whoever
taught you how to please a woman.

368
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,473
Maybe it was the forest nymphs.

369
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,376
Get my <i>Vertigo</i> poster back.

370
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,823
Be not afraid,
it's exact change.

371
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,019
Okay.

372
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,225
Hello.

373
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,557
I'm looking to get
something on House.

374
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,002
Couldn't you just ask the
love-nymphs for the secret?

375
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,334
Don't.

376
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:52,003
My mission is to find something that
House would not like to see made public,

377
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,670
and make it public.

378
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,943
In.

379
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,760
But you know him better than
anyone, why do you need my help?

380
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,024
House would never leave
anything secret around the condo.

381
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:05,184
But you've worked in the same
office with him, on and off, for years.

382
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,353
Think back. Were there ever any odd
phone calls or visitors from the past?

383
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,863
He openly brings
prostitutes into the hospital,

384
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,026
and he gambles with bookies
because he's too lazy to go to the OTB,

385
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,864
and you're asking for...

386
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,204
What? What? What?

387
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,737
He's reading <i>The Golden Bowl.</i>

388
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,403
By Henry James?

389
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,609
Yeah. No, he's
not really reading it.

390
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,052
Okay. I don't understand.

391
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,087
That book's at least
400 pages long,

392
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,123
whatever he's reading
is only half that thick.

393
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,455
Maybe he's reading a
version with a smaller font.

394
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,728
He's not using his
reading glasses.

395
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,389
That's a good point.

396
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,263
He took the cover off <i>The Golden
Bowl</i> and put it onto this other book,

397
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,633
so no one would know
what he was reading.

398
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,468
Whatever it is,
he's ashamed of it.

399
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,205
Huh.

400
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,974
I'm going with plastic. It
just makes more sense.

401
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,009
I don't want another
operation later.

402
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,147
That's not why
you're doing this.

403
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,604
Look, when you were first telling
me about why you love the Internet,

404
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,325
you said that no one
has to be alone again.

405
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,800
Whoever you are, whatever you
love, you can connect with someone.

406
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,367
If you want to recreate
the Boston Tea Party,

407
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,963
while dressed as
Imperial Stormtroopers,

408
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,086
you can find the 10 other people in the
world that have always wanted to do that.

409
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,976
That hasn't changed.

410
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,104
But you have.

411
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,975
This thing that you do, it's
not about connection anymore.

412
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,713
It's about an audience.
It's a performance,

413
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,220
and you've got one eye
on the number of hits.

414
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,789
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

415
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,797
You're smart, you're
fun to read, it's okay.

416
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,228
But don't give them this.

417
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,839
Or if you do, don't
expect me to be here.

418
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,347
It's a good cover choice. It's
not like anyone would pick it up.

419
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,391
It's Cameron's favorite book.

420
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,925
I don't even know
what it's about.

421
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,057
Don't do that to yourself.

422
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,891
What the hell?

423
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:33,438
Giving him a computer is
like giving plutonium to Dr. No.

424
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,268
Got it.

425
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,943
<i>"Step by Step: Sermons
for Everyday Life"?</i>

426
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,220
These are literal sermons,
written by a minister.

427
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,426
"Loving thy neighbor even
when thy neighbor's stereo

428
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,687
"is keeping you up at night."

429
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,820
Why would he read this?

430
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,261
Why would he hide it?

431
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,299
He reads the Bible,
he reads the Koran.

432
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,631
He says he likes to know what
mistakes people are making.

433
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,135
You think he's sincere?

434
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,349
You think that he's actually
getting something out of this?

435
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,864
I don't know.

436
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,273
What a hypocrite.

437
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,643
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

438
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,740
You know what?

439
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,251
Don't mention this to anyone.

440
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,415
So what was the point?

441
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,796
Are you going to be
here when I wake up?

442
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,641
I hate that you
don't have a blog,

443
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,509
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

444
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,946
Let's not get into it right now.

445
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,007
We need to get
you through surgery.

446
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,264
I don't want to go in there knowing
you'll stick with me through surgery

447
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,450
'cause that's what good guys do,

448
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,083
but once I'm better,
you'll be gone.

449
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,025
Let's not get into it now.

450
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,761
It hurts.

451
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,090
Is it her heart?

452
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,431
No, it's here. Here.

453
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,205
Get her inside.

454
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,607
Your appendix burst.
We had to remove it.

455
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:31,146
And the biopsy confirms it was full of
abnormal cells consistent with lymphoma.

456
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,191
I have cancer?

457
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,197
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

458
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,462
So, I mean, I guess we do,
what, chemo and all that stuff?

459
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,663
Yes, but apparently you've
had this for some time.

460
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,331
When your appendix burst,
it was like a dam giving way.

461
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,205
Those cells went streaming
throughout your body.

462
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,178
So you're saying you'll treat,
but you don't expect it to work.

463
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,874
That's why no
valve. It's pointless.

464
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:00,616
Our Dean of Medicine has
approved an experimental treatment.

465
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:05,454
We use your unique cancer cell signature
to create a targeted lymphoma vaccine.

466
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,187
Okay. So that'll cure me?

467
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,819
Well, we're not
actually sure what it'll do,

468
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,229
but the intention is to
train your immune system

469
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,234
to recognize and kill cells bearing
the same malignant signature,

470
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,133
while leaving
healthy cells alone.

471
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:22,470
But, as Dr. Foreman
says, it's experimental.

472
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,668
I see.

473
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,487
Without it, what kind of
time are we talking about?

474
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,377
An exact prognosis
is impossible.

475
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,712
How about a guess?
Something, please.

476
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,583
Based on people in situations
like yours, maybe a year.

477
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,027
Baby, whatever we
have to do, we'll do.

478
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,860
I can take care of you.
I can work from home.

479
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,506
Sounds good. Thank
you for letting me know.

480
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,343
We'll start with the
treatment whenever it's ready.

481
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,785
Is she being a good
soldier or is she in denial?

482
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,219
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

483
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,748
Or it could be a symptom.
Some lymphomas affect cognition.

484
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,885
If it is denial, she
needs time to process.

485
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,728
If it's a symptom, hopefully
treatment with the vaccine will help.

486
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,302
Hey, Sandy.

487
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,575
Can I borrow your car?

488
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,475
She gave me the keys.

489
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,574
You're a doctor, she
was doing you a favor.

490
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,949
She barely knows me.

491
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,717
I've been deluding myself that
I'm actually connecting with people.

492
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,661
The first person I ever fell in love
with turned out to be a total tool.

493
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,826
He came across all funny
and charming and thoughtful,

494
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,131
but it was an act.

495
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,330
He saw something he wanted

496
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,669
and he knew he had to
behave a certain way to get it.

497
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:06,473
In retrospect, the fact that I was 17
and he was 30 should've been a clue.

498
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,911
Figuring out who
people are takes time.

499
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,680
And it takes twice as much time
if they're trying to impress you.

500
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,653
Now, I could take from this that
anyone who loans me their car

501
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,916
has an ulterior motive,

502
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,927
or I can accept that it's
just a nice thing to do,

503
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,859
and take people as they come.

504
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,325
You wanna do
the first injection?

505
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:49,288
Why are you reading a
book by a Unitarian minister?

506
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,817
Book club. Oprah
was going on and on...

507
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,190
I'm serious. This is messed up.

508
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,186
A patient wrote it. No.

509
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,528
You've never treated a patient
with this name, I looked it up.

510
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,834
It's an assignment
from my therapist.

511
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,098
No, it wasn't.

512
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,869
No one you respect would give
you this and expect it to be helpful.

513
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:10,975
It's a book!

514
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,443
Of sermons!

515
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,537
For anyone else,
spiritually enlightening.

516
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:17,811
For you, it's practically
a psychotic break.

517
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,156
I know that you have
trouble, sometimes,

518
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,920
with the pain
without the Vicodin.

519
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,326
Is that it? Are you
so out of options

520
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,833
you're looking for answers in
what you consider irrationality?

521
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,698
I'm all right. Trust me.

522
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,832
Are you all right because
you're back on Vicodin?

523
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,070
I said trust me.

524
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,706
I know this means something.

525
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,545
You mind? I haven't
finished it yet.

526
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,367
Thanks for the gift.

527
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,903
Obviously differs from
my own personal beliefs,

528
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:18,306
but if these stories have helped
you through some spiritual turmoil...

529
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,404
Read chapter six,
entitled "Shut the hell up."

530
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,072
I appreciated the inscription

531
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,844
about the benefits of prayer
before medical treatments,

532
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,944
and I think it's great that you have
been called to witness by the Lord.

533
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,046
Chapter two, "Bite me."

534
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,286
Hi.

535
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,865
Thirteen's giving our patient
her third vaccine injection.

536
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,229
She's responding well so far.

537
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,461
How did you get all these
copies? It's out of print.

538
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,902
I called the author. He's got
cartons of the thing in his basement.

539
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,736
You called him?
What did you say?

540
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,641
That I knew some people who
could benefit spiritually from the book.

541
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,541
Did you mention me?

542
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,140
No, but...

543
00:31:58,817 --> 00:31:59,910
Fever's at 104.

544
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,250
The antibodies tripped
her autoimmune response.

545
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,482
The vaccine is killing her.

546
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,052
Well, clearly it's not working.

547
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,791
You have to stop the vaccine.

548
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,458
Sure. Give up and let
her die on schedule.

549
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,661
It's better than speeding
up the schedule.

550
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,068
How quickly did this come on?

551
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,983
She was all right when I woke her
this afternoon for the second injection.

552
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,943
Of the stimulating agent,
which added to the first injection,

553
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,104
switched her immune
reaction into overdrive.

554
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,114
Why was she sleeping?

555
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,140
Who can sleep in a
hospital, during the daytime?

556
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,513
I'm not surprised she's tired.

557
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,019
She's always been a night owl.

558
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,560
Just by treating her, we've
completely disrupted her schedule.

559
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,286
Is that what her blog
says? She's a night owl?

560
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,417
No, she told me.

561
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:45,294
In what tense? Is?
Was? Will have been?

562
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,326
I'm not sure.

563
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,559
What are you onto?

564
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,102
Look at the
time-stamp on this post.

565
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,331
2:30 a.m. Here's
one at 4:00 a.m.

566
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,169
Whatever he's onto doesn't change
the fact that she has lymphoma

567
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,368
and we gave her a dangerous
vaccine. We need to...

568
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,504
Six months ago, she's
posting in the daytime.

569
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:05,816
Two years ago, daytime.
That's her natural rhythm.

570
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,443
Day-night reversal.

571
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,646
Sign of liver disease?

572
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,052
Which doesn't fit lymphoma.

573
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,748
But we know she has lymphoma.

574
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:15,521
We know she has the cell
atypia that indicates lymphoma.

575
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,224
Biopsy her liver.

576
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,571
That was pretty
cool, what I did, right?

577
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:28,766
You wanna make out?

578
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,438
You don't have lymphoma.

579
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,539
But you said my appendix
was full of cancer cells.

580
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,178
Your appendix was full of cells
that showed a lymphocytic atypia.

581
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:45,054
We now think they were a granulomatous
build-up from some unknown cause.

582
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,889
So I'm not dying?

583
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,803
You're actually dying more
quickly than we thought.

584
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,430
Unless we figure out what's
causing your liver failure.

585
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,113
You have three or four days.

586
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,328
What the hell do you mean
I have three or four days?

587
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,924
Well, we're past denial.

588
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,706
Maybe we didn't cause the fever.

589
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,132
We gave her the vaccine and
her fever spiked, seems to me...

590
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,635
Yes, but it persisted after
we took her off the vaccine.

591
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,831
What if it's a new symptom?

592
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,737
Okay, so we add
fever to cell atypia,

593
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,746
coagulopathy,
kidney, heart, liver...

594
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,657
- It has to be an infection.
- But which one?

595
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,980
No one she knows is sick.
She hasn't travelled anywhere.

596
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,495
There's nothing in the history
she gave us, nothing in her blog.

597
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,750
There has to be something
unique to this infection,

598
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,451
something about its
transmission, the way it manifests.

599
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,857
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

600
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,126
There isn't. She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

601
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,671
Start her on broad-
spectrum antibiotics.

602
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:47,305
Since we know everything, we
might as well treat for everything.

603
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:53,203
I picked up one of the copies of
the book that Chase left in the lounge.

604
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,480
If you're going to be this way,

605
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,209
I'm not going to invite
you to my baptism.

606
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,343
The first time I'd seen
the real dust jacket.

607
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,877
The inside back flap,
there's a picture of the author.

608
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,289
Imagine how surprised I
was when I recognized him.

609
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,456
Your biological
father is a minister?

610
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,098
Natural selection is
not an infallible force.

611
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,598
I don't get it.

612
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,903
Okay, he was a
friend of the family,

613
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,909
you'd only known him
when you were a kid.

614
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,309
But if you wanted
to meet him now,

615
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,814
get an idea of what he's like,
why not just go talk to him?

616
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,980
"Hi, it's Greg. You
slept with my mother."

617
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,519
You're capable of it.

618
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,121
I was mildly curious.

619
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,353
Enough to read a book, not
enough to make a phone call.

620
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,761
Please. You didn't read
this, you studied it. Why?

621
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,359
All your life you've
thought this was crap.

622
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,336
You can't suddenly turn around

623
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,704
and build a whole new
world-view based on crap.

624
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,175
Crap.

625
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,947
You better not be faking this just
to get out of a tough conversation.

626
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,657
Do you poop?

627
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,859
Come on. Everybody poops. I
read the book in medical school.

628
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,293
Sinkers or floaters?

629
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,528
This is the Wizard.

630
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,696
Greasy and soft, or
hard and pellet-like?

631
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:38,248
Floaters and the first one.

632
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,180
You just had to be so swoft.

633
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,051
You're a hypocrite,
no lies, no secrets,

634
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,684
but everything
stops at your colon.

635
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,763
Four thousand pages,
not one word about BMs.

636
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,263
And I bet yours
don't smell at all.

637
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,476
Nobody wants to hear about that stuff.
- Readers don't.

638
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,878
People who don't really care
about you don't, but doctors might.

639
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,098
The icky stuff changed,
right? A few months ago.

640
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,434
Well, I became a vegetarian.

641
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,099
A lot of people misunderstand
how a vegetarian diet works.

642
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,941
You take in less unusable material,
and your waste gets more efficient,

643
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,175
harder and rounder. Just
look at the feces of rabbits.

644
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,661
Seriously, I think I might have some.
- Malabsorption.

645
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,052
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

646
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,521
A GI infection that
causes malabsorption,

647
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,286
granulamatous build-up of cells.

648
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,724
It's not contagious, 'cause
no one around her got sick.

649
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,956
Whipple's Disease.

650
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,264
Let's split the credit.
Start her on cotrimoxazole.

651
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,634
We all need some secrets.

652
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,538
So long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

653
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,569
I'm...

654
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,809
I'm gonna be okay?

655
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,375
You'll still need
a new heart valve,

656
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:51,981
and you'll be on meds for a few years,
but basically, yeah, your odds are good.

657
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,805
Thank God.

658
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,177
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

659
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,126
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

660
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,462
Thank God you're an enabler.

661
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,451
Do you think people can
actually know each other better

662
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,068
on the Internet
than face-to-face?

663
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,545
Faces can be distracting,

664
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,048
but there's nothing better than
looking into someone's eyes

665
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,743
and everything
that goes with that.

666
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,653
I don't know. People meet,
they like something superficial,

667
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:01,368
and then they fill in the blanks
with whatever they want to believe.

668
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,917
Why are you so hung up on this?

669
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,589
I refuse to believe it's all because
you just noticed you have a nice face.

670
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,298
I mean, you just
came off a relationship,

671
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,734
you know things
go deeper than...

672
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,102
Is that what this is
about? You and Cameron?

673
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,702
I was the one that pursued her.

674
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:25,447
Maybe I was just filling
in the blanks, maybe...

675
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,685
Maybe her first
reaction was right.

676
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,120
We were just two people
who were in proximity

677
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,400
and found each other attractive,
and I never should have...

678
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:37,589
Paranoia. You felt
something real. So did she.

679
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,396
Don't try to take it back now.

680
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,535
Can I borrow your car?

681
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,063
No.

682
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:58,374
Why would it make more sense
for you to read your father's book

683
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,644
than to go talk with him?

684
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,585
Can you write a book, so
I can stop talking to you?

685
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,475
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis,

686
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,896
you didn't want to hug the guy.

687
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,333
You just wanted to know how
his head works, how he thinks.

688
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,961
Because I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

689
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,972
Because you're
not ordinary, House.

690
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,939
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

691
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,274
I'm your best friend, and half
the time I don't understand you.

692
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:30,611
You're alone, you've
been alone your whole life.

693
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:35,852
When you read that book you
were hoping that somewhere,

694
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,685
underneath all that talk of God,
there would be a way of thinking,

695
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,760
a mind that you could recognize.

696
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,022
You wanted what we all want.

697
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,688
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

698
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:50,860
To look across the gulf and know
there's someone else like you.

699
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,796
At least tell me this, did
you find something there?

700
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,303
Underneath the God stuff,

701
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,637
more God stuff.

702
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,780
Get maintenance
to take that down.
