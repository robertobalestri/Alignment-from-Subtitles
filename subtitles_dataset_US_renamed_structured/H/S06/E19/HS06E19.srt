1
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,086
Who is it?

2
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,186
It's Tom.

3
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,794
Tom, your husband?

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,192
What's he doing here?

5
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,970
Uh, what's going on?

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,323
I'm sorry. I know I'm
not supposed to be here.

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,249
But Evelyn's school
contract is due tomorrow.

8
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,809
I knew I was forgetting
something. Let me find a pen.

9
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:57,950
Hey.

10
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,084
Hey.

11
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,759
Not quite sure what
Emily Post recommends

12
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,819
in this situation, but I'm Tom.

13
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,093
Damien. Hi.

14
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,468
Sorry to intrude, I just... I wasn't
quite sure when she'd be coming home.

15
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,629
No problem.

16
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,536
Thank you so much
for catching this.

17
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:13,869
Yeah.

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,320
I'll get out of your way.
It was good to meet you,

19
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,835
and I'll see you later, hon.

20
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,107
Bye.

21
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,917
So, he seems like a nice guy.

22
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,820
Ooh.

23
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,990
Jules, you okay?

24
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,157
No, my stomach...

25
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,631
Here, lie down.

26
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,160
Ow!

27
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,637
Try to...

28
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,197
Get Tom. Okay.

29
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:48,999
Ow!

30
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,135
Tom!

31
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,457
You know what would be perfect?

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,481
Hmm.

33
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,449
French Toast Tower.

34
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,214
You still go to Mickey's?
What's your cholesterol?

35
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,687
It's my one vice.
I'm keeping it.

36
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,726
As much as I would
love to clog my arteries,

37
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:44,095
I have a 10:00 CT, and I still
have to race home, get changed.

38
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,902
Maybe you could
keep some clothes here.

39
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,062
Maybe I could.

40
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,869
He's just trying to
get into your skirts,

41
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,276
and I don't mean metaphorically.

42
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,975
Well, he's got the legs for it.

43
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,982
So, I will see you tonight?

44
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,386
Yeah.

45
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,752
Bye, House.

46
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,092
Have a nice day.

47
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,894
"Have a nice
day"? How civilized.

48
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,166
I said I'd stay out of it.

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,040
What? Nothing.

50
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,444
Clearly something.

51
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,606
Nope.

52
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,240
House, on a list
of your attributes,

53
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,252
there's nothing that
even rhymes with "coy."

54
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,415
Okay, I may have seen
something in the fridge.

55
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,584
Like the end of
your relationship.

56
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,093
She put the milk in the
door and not on the shelf.

57
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,529
It's not a big deal.

58
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,798
You hate that she did that,
but you didn't say anything.

59
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,745
You're trying to
get us to fight.

60
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,933
No, I'm trying to help. If you
got an issue, let her know.

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,442
I should've known that you
weren't done sabotaging this.

62
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,274
Fine. Stew in your irritation.

63
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,008
Sure, last time it bubbled
over into resentment and rage,

64
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,811
leading ultimately
to a painful divorce

65
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,251
that neither of you have
ever really recovered from,

66
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,188
but I'm sure this
time, it'll be great.

67
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,760
Interesting case,
35-year-old woman

68
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,134
with fever and abdominal pain.

69
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,469
ER ruled out all
the usual suspects.

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,532
Stop before you
interest me to death.

71
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,703
And she's in an open marriage.

72
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,871
That's not interesting.
It's just weird.

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,040
Know what's weirder?

74
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,085
That other humans are
monogamous in the first place.

75
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,612
No other species on
the planet mates for life,

76
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,121
and if you're gonna
bring up swans,

77
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,555
they cheat like everybody else.

78
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,559
They just have
better PR than rabbits.

79
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,494
Animals also eat their
young and kill their rivals.

80
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,394
That make it weird
that most of us don't?

81
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,228
Says the guy whose
opposable thumbs

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,894
have been all over how many
women who aren't his wife?

83
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,301
A functional open
marriage is like a unicorn.

84
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,982
It's a mythical creature
that doesn't exist.

85
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,406
Someone always ends up unhappy.

86
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,775
Our patient's unhappy because she's
suffering from an intestinal blockage.

87
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,974
Boring. Now, I'm gonna have
to find a reason to rule it out.

88
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,812
What about herpes colitis?

89
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,011
She picks up the infection
from one of her partners.

90
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,165
It takes root in her colon.

91
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,244
STD panel was clean.

92
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,366
Chances are this couple
was unhappy in the first place.

93
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,451
This is their attempt to
save something that never...

94
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,990
Go on.

95
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,194
Herpes might not register if she
was exposed in the last six weeks.

96
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,705
But it would show up
on a barium enema.

97
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,300
Wait. You're going to do it?

98
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,939
Gotta see if our patient is a
unicorn or just a slutty horse.

99
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,451
Think how much fun
Taub could be having.

100
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,920
Barium coats the inner
lining of your colon,

101
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:58,015
lets us get a good
look at it on the X-ray.

102
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,535
I can get somebody
else to pick up Evelyn.

103
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,323
I feel like I'm abandoning you.

104
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,987
I'm on painkillers.

105
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,407
I'd rather this not
be what you think of

106
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,765
every time you look at my butt.

107
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,766
Okay, roll onto your side.

108
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,905
It's fill 'er up time.

109
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,180
So, is Evelyn his new squeeze?

110
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,518
She's our daughter.

111
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,923
Must be interesting, growing up
in a production of <i>Oh! Calcutta!</i>

112
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,757
She's six.

113
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,525
She knows as much about our
sex life as any other kid her age.

114
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,866
You can explain
that she's the reason

115
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,134
the two of you stayed married.

116
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,228
You've been in the
room five minutes.

117
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,330
You got us all figured out.

118
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,484
Of course, you left out the
part where we love each other,

119
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,477
and we wanna grow old together.

120
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,021
But you just don't
wanna be young together.

121
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,946
Look, when you think about it,

122
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,880
tons of couples do what we do.

123
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,159
It's just that with
most of them,

124
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,846
one spouse doesn't
know about it.

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,218
We decided things work better

126
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,224
when people tell
each other the truth.

127
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,485
Tank's full.

128
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,224
I'll page the radiology elves.

129
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm not saying I hate it. It
just doesn't go with your eyes.

130
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,862
You hate it.

131
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,203
Little bit.

132
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,540
Any more heartless critiques
of my general appearance?

133
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,011
Nope. All done.

134
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,278
So, is she as
bendy as she looks?

135
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,678
Maya and I are just friends.

136
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,245
No, you and I are friends.

137
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,403
And you don't have coffee
with me three times a week.

138
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,484
She's an interesting person.

139
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,552
She grew up in Ohio.
She has three brothers.

140
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,394
Fascinating. Last week that
Cambodian lab tech was telling us

141
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,331
how he survived
the Killing Fields,

142
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,198
and you left to go get a donut.

143
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,828
So we flirt. It's fun.

144
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,133
It's dangerous.

145
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,037
That woman would totally do you.

146
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,871
You think?

147
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,103
Nothing is gonna happen.

148
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,043
All I'm saying is, if you
want to be on a diet,

149
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:03,072
you might want to stop
hanging out by the dessert cart.

150
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,316
X-ray was clean. She
doesn't have herpes colitis.

151
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,650
Or abdominal pain.

152
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,554
It stopped hurting
during the X-ray,

153
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,768
which means it was just an
intestinal blockage that passed.

154
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,816
We should discharge her.

155
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,295
Absolutely, there's no need
to find any underlying cause.

156
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,924
These things never happen twice.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,128
Take her digestive
system for a test drive.

158
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,966
Give her a
radio-opaque milkshake.

159
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,637
X-ray every 15 minutes
to see if it makes

160
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,970
any unscheduled stops
on the way through.

161
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,202
We'll be here all night.

162
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,506
No, Taub will be here all night.

163
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:35,071
Go talk to the unicorn, then
tell me you don't believe.

164
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,583
I did an abdominal
CT on a kid today,

165
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,451
and found a six-inch
bezoar made entirely of gum.

166
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,515
I mean, who gives a three-year-old
an endless supply of gum...

167
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,155
You okay?

168
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,255
Yeah.

169
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,735
I mean, there was hair in it
and maybe a piece of paper.

170
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,172
<i>So, how long have
you been married?</i>

171
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,806
<i>One of the few drawbacks
of having an open marriage.</i>

172
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,681
<i>Nobody ever asks me about
current events or the weather.</i>

173
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,343
<i>The Yankees look
good this season.</i>

174
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,553
<i>Seven years.</i>

175
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:24,428
<i>And how long have
you, you know...</i>

176
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,264
<i>After three years, we realized</i>

177
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,201
<i>that traditional marriage
was making us both miserable.</i>

178
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,998
<i>Most people get
divorced at that point.</i>

179
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,151
Yeah, we didn't
want to get divorced.

180
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,404
We still loved each other.

181
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,969
<i>We just realized that
expecting one person</i>

182
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,641
<i>to fulfill all of your needs
forever is unrealistic.</i>

183
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,209
<i>There are happy
monogamous couples out there.</i>

184
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,846
Sure, one or two have
the perfect marriage.

185
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,359
Everybody else has figured
out how to settle for less.

186
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,726
I don't want to settle and
end up resenting my husband.

187
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,925
I'd rather get the 10% he
doesn't give me somewhere else

188
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:05,131
so that I can really appreciate
him for the 90% he does.

189
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,835
I think something's wrong.

190
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,402
<i>With your stomach?</i>
My heart is racing.

191
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,557
Try to take deep breaths. I'm
gonna try to slow your heart down.

192
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,222
Is this because of the blockage?

193
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,624
No. It's not working.

194
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,957
Need a crash cart in here!

195
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:40,904
I need a list of all your sexual
partners from the last six months.

196
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,067
Why?

197
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,371
Your wife had an arrhythmia.

198
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,605
The progression of
symptoms from bowel to heart

199
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,613
makes a parasitic
infection most likely.

200
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,615
Since Julia hasn't
been out of the country...

201
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,860
The only place that
I've been recently

202
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,477
is a business trip to Nebraska.

203
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,544
But either of you could
have picked up a bug

204
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,180
from one of your partners.

205
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,590
It's kind of complicated.

206
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,063
How many partners are
we talking about? Ballpark.

207
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,799
None.

208
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,233
None?

209
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:13,239
We have a great sex life.
I don't need anyone else.

210
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,207
So why not just tell her that

211
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,641
and close this whole thing up?

212
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,836
You married?

213
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,210
I was.

214
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,806
Did you ever agree to go
see a chick flick with your wife

215
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,748
or pretend to enjoy
classical music?

216
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,777
Stravinsky never groped my
wife in a Midtown hotel room.

217
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,086
She needs this.

218
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,787
I don't, but I don't want
her to feel bad about that.

219
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,264
He's lying.

220
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,732
Guy's got a license to drill.

221
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,668
Why would he lie
about not using it?

222
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,828
That's not the lie.

223
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,702
The lie is that he gives
a crap how his wife feels.

224
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,765
If they're both screwing
around, that's one thing.

225
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,901
But she has a piece on
the side, and he doesn't?

226
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,411
The only way he'd
be okay with that

227
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,538
is if he's betraying
her in some other way.

228
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,412
Then in his mind,
it makes them even.

229
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,849
My unicorn isn't a unicorn.

230
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,251
It's a donkey with a
plunger stuck to its face.

231
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,290
Right, even a guy
who's not cheating

232
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,291
is doing it for
underhanded reasons.

233
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,951
No, no, no, he's
not being cynical.

234
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,825
He's assuming the husband is
doing something to even the score.

235
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,525
Which means he
thinks there is a score.

236
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,625
Which means,
cheating swans aside,

237
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,693
House believes in monogamy.

238
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,704
He's being romantic.

239
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,333
What I believe is that men are
genetically engineered to be jealous.

240
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,276
Doesn't matter if I think there's
a score. I guarantee you he does.

241
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,813
Any of the wife's
partners pan out?

242
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,116
She's been with two people other
than Tom in the last six months.

243
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,263
Neither of them have been
outside the Tri-State area.

244
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,547
So we're back to the husband.

245
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,730
You just said you
believed he wasn't...

246
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,780
He's doing something
behind her back.

247
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,655
What better cover than a
business trip to Nebraska?

248
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,695
Like that's really a place.

249
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,395
Let's find his travel records
and get back to work.

250
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,401
You seem pretty mellow
about this couple's deal.

251
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,133
Thought you'd be first
in line to shake a finger.

252
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,176
They're still married. I'm not.

253
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,234
Not that I could ever do it.

254
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,213
I was jealous of House, and
Cameron never touched him.

255
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,978
Not counting the
emotional fondling.

256
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,747
When my mom was
dying, my dad had an affair.

257
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,749
He told you this?

258
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,123
I'd seen them
get out of his car.

259
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,873
Two years after Mom
died, they got married.

260
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,629
Must've sucked.

261
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,598
At the time, yeah,

262
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,194
but looking back,
it makes sense.

263
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,498
My mom never knew about it,

264
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,937
and he needed someone
to make him feel less alone.

265
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,601
He took care of my
mom, day in and day out,

266
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,406
for two and a half
years before she died.

267
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,710
He was devoted to her. Loving
someone else didn't change that.

268
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,115
So loving two
people at once is fine

269
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,618
as long as one of them is dying?

270
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,678
Whoever's taking care
of me when I get sick,

271
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,350
I hope they've got someone
else to take care of them.

272
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,486
Tom was telling the truth.

273
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,690
He really did go to Nebraska.

274
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,461
Plane ticket and
restaurant receipts.

275
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,366
Forget Nebraska.

276
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,363
Maybe they just bought
their parasites at the mall.

277
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,373
You know, we should
really throw away that loofah.

278
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,323
They're imported. Sometimes
they're not sterilized.

279
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,509
We think our patient
got amoebiasis from hers.

280
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,574
She going to be okay?

281
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,279
We're treating now.
She should be fine.

282
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,116
It's actually kind of bizarre.

283
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,491
She and her husband
have an open marriage.

284
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,264
They sleep with other people?

285
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,564
Well, she does. Her
husband's totally fine with it.

286
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
That's crazy, right?

287
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,506
And you're bringing
this up because...

288
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,650
I thought it was interesting.

289
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,912
More interesting than
your other cases, I guess.

290
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,782
You talk about your colleagues.
You rant about House.

291
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,520
You don't usually
mention your patients.

292
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,666
Is open marriage
something you want?

293
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,997
No. I mean...

294
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,138
I know you'd never...

295
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,044
All this time and
energy you spent

296
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,548
convincing me you
weren't cheating.

297
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,743
And there's somebody else.

298
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:21,015
I'm not... WAITER: Would
you like some more water, sir?

299
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,730
Okay.

300
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,528
There's a woman at work.
People say she's attracted to me.

301
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,074
But nothing's happened.
Nothing's going to happen.

302
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,632
I'm not having an affair.

303
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,200
But you want to.

304
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,238
No, honey, I'm
trying to be honest.

305
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,376
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.

306
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,250
Be honest then.

307
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,813
Are you attracted to her?

308
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:06,732
Look, she's attractive.
There's an attraction.

309
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,530
Aren't there men who
make you feel that way?

310
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:10,865
Of course, there are.

311
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:15,102
But it never occurs to me to
act on it, because I'm married.

312
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,369
To you.

313
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,608
And that's enough for me.

314
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,808
Aren't I enough for you?

315
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,646
Of course, you are.

316
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,089
Our patient's lost all
movement in her legs.

317
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,584
There are other doctors,
Chris. We're talking.

318
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:39,531
I'm sorry. The
woman's paralyzed.

319
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,462
I'll get a cab.

320
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,910
Tests show no
spinal cord injury,

321
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,011
no cerebral lesions,
no hemorrhage.

322
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,432
We finally got a stool
sample. The loofah's innocent.

323
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,119
No sign of amoebas
or any other parasite.

324
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,061
So paralysis, arrhythmia,
intermittent abdominal pain.

325
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,264
And he nicked himself shaving.

326
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,433
Sorry, that was Taub.
But it was easier to solve.

327
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,667
Means he used the
crappy razor in his locker,

328
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,039
which means he slept here.

329
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,168
Thanks to you.

330
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,576
I brought up open
marriage with Rachel.

331
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,810
It was a disaster.

332
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,655
On the medical front, we've
knocked out sex and foreign travel.

333
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,749
Could be an
electrolyte imbalance.

334
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,453
So the only time
you're not interested

335
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,804
in my marriage is
after you blow it up?

336
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,627
You were the moron who took
marital advice from Tila Tequila.

337
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,223
You pushed me into this.

338
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,845
Figured it would either blow up
your marriage or make it more honest.

339
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,337
Either way, you win.

340
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,270
What about sex?

341
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,449
I'm talking about the patient.

342
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,551
Is that cool with everybody?

343
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,668
We ruled out sex.

344
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,973
We ruled out sex
with other people.

345
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,776
Tom said he and Julia have been
doing it three or four times a week.

346
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,679
And she's got boys on the side.

347
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,186
Increased libido can be a symptom
of adrenocortical carcinoma,

348
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,154
which also explains
her other symptoms.

349
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,487
A woman who likes
sex must be sick?

350
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,069
Just because
everybody in this room

351
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,860
wishes that all women were
horny all the time doesn't make it so.

352
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,897
Get an MRI of
her adrenal glands.

353
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,704
Hi.

354
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,644
Okay if I take the sports page?

355
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,079
Sure.

356
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,722
Would you mind using a coaster?

357
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,621
Oh. Sure. Sorry.

358
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,785
It's okay.

359
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,799
Also, it'd be great
if you'd replace

360
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,496
the toilet paper
when you finish a roll.

361
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,163
And when you
load the dishwasher,

362
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,605
you can't put a big,
flat bowl on the bottom.

363
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:05,167
It traps the water so
nothing on the top gets clean.

364
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,577
And please don't throw banana
peels in the bedroom trash...

365
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,015
I haven't done
any of those things.

366
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,711
You're probably
not even aware...

367
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,946
I hate bananas.

368
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,027
Oh, my God. It was House.

369
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,293
I'm sorry. He's been
trying to get us to fight.

370
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,596
Why would he think that
stuff would make us fight?

371
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,605
Because of the milk.
You put it in the door.

372
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,540
The body of the refrigerator
is the coldest part.

373
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,885
The temperature in
the door fluctuates,

374
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,986
which decreases shelf life...

375
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,947
Wow. When did you get all OCD?

376
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,415
I just want clean dishes
and unspoiled milk

377
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,610
so we can all stay healthy.

378
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,410
Oh. It's about health?

379
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,982
What about the coaster? Does
that replenish my B12 or something?

380
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,186
Can we just drop it?

381
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,319
Sure.

382
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,404
You have this list of annoyances

383
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,702
the entire time we were married?

384
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,743
Get better, Mommy.

385
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,646
I love you, rabbit.

386
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,983
Julia, you have a guest.

387
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,752
Hi. This isn't a good time.

388
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,991
Dr. Hadley, did you say there
was a video game in the playroom?

389
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,929
Maybe you can teach me
how to play one of them?

390
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,329
See you in Radiology.

391
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,366
Get out of my wife's room.

392
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,384
Your relationship with
her stays out of our space.

393
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,637
I was worried about her.

394
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,110
Tom's right. You should go.

395
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,381
So it's fine if we have sex,

396
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,026
but if I drop by to
see if you're okay...

397
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,383
This is our family.

398
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,223
Sorry.

399
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,168
I spent two years of residency

400
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,295
wearing shirts that
were a size too small.

401
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,169
How hard is it to ask me
not to put them in the dryer?

402
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,539
And I only did your laundry
because you were never home.

403
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,702
I didn't ask you to.

404
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,287
Of course you didn't.
You just got annoyed

405
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,041
whenever you didn't
have clean underwear.

406
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,206
I never said I was annoyed.

407
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,910
That's the point. You
didn't say anything.

408
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,976
So I'm getting a lecture
on communication

409
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,216
from someone who had her lawyer
inform me our marriage was over.

410
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,827
Asking for an open
marriage. You got stones.

411
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,334
Conversation sort of got away
from me. It was a train wreck.

412
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
I think it's good
you brought it up.

413
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,100
I read a study that found
men who have multiple copies

414
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,503
of a certain
vasopressin receptor

415
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,098
are twice as likely
to be unfaithful.

416
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,303
Maybe you're just
one of those guys.

417
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:55,405
So my cheating is biologically
predetermined. Fantastic.

418
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,916
Multiply times five. We need
a better look at the medulla.

419
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,144
I thought you'd be relieved.

420
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,058
This gets you off the
hook. It's just genetics.

421
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,521
I'm 5'6" and have
a receding hairline.

422
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,990
I hate genetics.
Medulla's clean.

423
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,769
I don't see you wearing
lifts or hair plugs.

424
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,905
That's because being short
and bald doesn't hurt anybody.

425
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,626
The only thing hurtful about
your other genetic predisposition

426
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,223
is that you keep denying it.

427
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,599
It's not good for you or Rachel.

428
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,533
There's nothing there.
It's not adrenal cancer.

429
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,165
And maybe you're right about me,

430
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,518
but I'm not going
to stop trying.

431
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,703
Rachel's worth it.

432
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,737
Look up there. The
lung. What is that?

433
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,579
You served me
with divorce papers

434
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,730
in the middle of a medical
conference in New Orleans!

435
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,652
I threw a bottle into
an antique mirror.

436
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,418
You exhibited an emotion. I
wish I'd known you were capable.

437
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,549
I loved you.

438
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,837
I thought I was gonna be following
you to Baltimore, remember?

439
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,228
I called about apartments.
I set up interviews.

440
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,007
How could you think that
we still had a real marriage?

441
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,829
We hadn't had a
conversation in months.

442
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,994
Maybe because I was
working two jobs to support us.

443
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,197
No! No, it's because
when you were home,

444
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,762
it was like talking
to a block of ice.

445
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,637
You were obviously
so pissed off at me...

446
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,508
I was killing myself so that you
could take that non-paying internship.

447
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,688
That you said
that I should take.

448
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,789
I was trying to be supportive!

449
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:01,857
Why do I have to be the bad guy?

450
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,350
Expressing yourself does
not make you the bad guy.

451
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,511
Okay, then, you were
being a selfish bitch.

452
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,453
V/Q scan confirmed the
spot on Julia's lung was a clot.

453
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,291
Think there's a chance
the husband's a plushie?

454
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:18,763
If he has a secret, I highly doubt
it's more relevant than the clot.

455
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,511
Clotting disorder would
explain everything.

456
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,867
Question is, which one?

457
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,996
Do you read any of your
departmental memos?

458
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,006
Only the ones labeled NSFW.

459
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,805
Accounting notified you two days
ago about your patient's insurance.

460
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,903
Sorry. That's NNSFW.

461
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,041
Here. He doesn't have any.
Try not to bankrupt them.

462
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,679
I'm long past the number of
procedures that'll bankrupt them.

463
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,189
Julia's got insurance. I saw
the policy number on the forms.

464
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,282
The policy lapsed
due to non-payment.

465
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,838
I already made
three calls about this.

466
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,021
She should have
been aware of that.

467
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,096
No, that's just a mistake.

468
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,933
Of course we have
health insurance.

469
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,466
We're actually a little
behind on the premiums.

470
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,107
But I pulled money out of my
retirement account to cover it.

471
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,657
They said that we'll
be fine in a few...

472
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,708
Why the retirement account?

473
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,681
We'll just give you
a few minutes to...

474
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,156
By "we," she means "she."

475
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,028
I lost all of our savings.

476
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,366
Sounds like a secret to me.

477
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,233
I started her on heparin
to prevent further clots,

478
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,038
but we still don't
know what's going on.

479
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,272
Of course the husband's
secret was money.

480
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,338
If it's not sex, it's
always money.

481
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,883
Unless it's sex for money.

482
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,009
How did he lose it anyway?

483
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,247
It's not medically relevant.
You're not going to care.

484
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,255
Wilson's been teaching
me how to care. Try me.

485
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,690
He builds wind turbines and leases
them out to local power companies...

486
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,227
You're right. I don't care.

487
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:59,356
Clotting disorder. DIC, Factor V
Leiden, Antiphospholipid syndrome.

488
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,024
Vitamin K deficiency also fits,

489
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,420
causes thrombophilia and is
consistent with abdominal pain.

490
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,904
Congratulations,
House. Sam ended it.

491
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,239
What happened?

492
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,671
Go test our patient's blood.

493
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,041
It can wait five minutes.

494
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,376
For everything we discussed.

495
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,379
I'm sorry.

496
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,448
Well, at least you're actually taking
responsibility for once in your life.

497
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,962
I'm sorry that she left,
but it's not my fault.

498
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,463
I didn't even want
to get involved.

499
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,623
You dragged it out of me.

500
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,633
What about the
dishwasher and the banana?

501
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,672
Yeah, she left
because of the banana.

502
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,705
I just wanted you to stand up for
yourself, tell her what you want.

503
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:47,440
If doing that causes her to
walk out for the second time,

504
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,657
well, then your relationship
wasn't going to last anyway.

505
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,206
Or you could've
stayed out of it.

506
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,460
I could've kept my mouth shut,

507
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,214
been annoyed sometimes,
but I'd be happy,

508
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,755
because I'd still be with her.

509
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,189
Now all I have is cold milk.

510
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,729
As long as you're free, you
want to grab some dinner?

511
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,564
Did Tom go home for the night?

512
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:14,368
For starters. I told him to
leave. I don't want him here.

513
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,740
Money is a complicated subject.

514
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,473
Yeah, it's not the money.

515
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,640
I mean, the money is bad, but...

516
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,584
When we first
opened our marriage,

517
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:32,250
I got involved with a guy
who lied about being single.

518
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,793
And one day, his wife calls me.

519
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,730
She's crying, and screaming,
and totally out of control.

520
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,697
And I felt

521
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,731
superior.

522
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,050
I thought, "I don't ever have
to worry about feeling this way,

523
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,704
"because Tom and I are
honest with each other."

524
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,849
Well, here I am.

525
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,690
Hi.

526
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,624
Sorry I didn't make
it home last night.

527
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:14,724
I needed to run some tests.

528
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,636
You know what the worst part
was when you had your affair?

529
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,503
It wasn't the sex.

530
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,575
It was the lies.

531
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:32,443
Realizing that the narrative
of my life was totally wrong.

532
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,612
You weren't stuck in surgery.

533
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,678
You weren't out of town.

534
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,226
I don't wanna go
through that again.

535
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,726
I told you, nothing's going...

536
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,126
Thursday nights.

537
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,566
You have to be home by midnight.

538
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:54,039
You don't bring her here,
you don't talk to her about me,

539
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:57,804
and I don't want to meet
her ever in any context.

540
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:08,644
Are you giving me permission
to sleep with other women?

541
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,417
It's what you want, isn't it?

542
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,118
I want you.

543
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,894
No, you want more than me.

544
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,158
You want that thrill.

545
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,437
But I love you, and I really
believe that you love me.

546
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,032
And we have a
good life together.

547
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,512
And at this point,
either I walk away,

548
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,345
or I try to accept
who you really are.

549
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,811
Tomorrow's Thursday.

550
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,287
Yes, it is.

551
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,873
All our tests came
back negative.

552
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,695
It's not a clotting disorder.

553
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,099
Which means we need to
come up with a better idea.

554
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,072
So what causes problems in
the stomach, heart, nerves...

555
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,506
Oh, my God.

556
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,974
You know what it is?

557
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:17,416
Taub's wife gave the green
light for an open marriage.

558
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,789
He's wearing cologne
but not the stink of shame.

559
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,452
You've got a date?

560
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:27,295
I am going out with Maya
tonight with Rachel's blessing.

561
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,365
<i>Mazel tov?</i>

562
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,067
Maybe the problem
isn't her blood.

563
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,835
Maybe it's the vessels
carrying the blood.

564
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,671
No sign of schistocytes
or hemolysis.

565
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,440
So you're actually going to
sleep with another woman,

566
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,775
then go home to your wife?

567
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,840
Thank God someone's keeping us
focused on what's really important.

568
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,112
Taub was going to
do all of that anyway.

569
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,778
Pulmonary arterial hypertension?

570
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,346
Imaging showed normal
diameter in her pulmonary artery.

571
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:57,522
Here's a thought. Taub's wife
is now totally on the market.

572
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,064
Mind hitting me with her digits?

573
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,866
She would love
that, but duty calls.

574
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,839
What's the matter?

575
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,140
My stomach.

576
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,373
Same pain as before?

577
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,143
Yeah. Worse.

578
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,459
Get the portable
ultrasound in here.

579
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,509
We need to get
a look at her belly.

580
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,985
Help me.

581
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,758
Pain, pain went away,
came back another day.

582
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,657
Question is, what
brought it back?

583
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,725
Physical exam was unrevealing.
Ultrasound was clean.

584
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:37,879
So afterwards, you gonna shower

585
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,180
at your girlfriend's or at home?

586
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,070
Patient. Abdominal pain.

587
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,405
Yeah, he's right. Let's get
this wrapped up before 6:00.

588
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,877
Taub turns back into a
faithful pumpkin at midnight.

589
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,074
The patient was out with her
boy-toy before she came in.

590
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,993
Maybe the pain was
triggered by sexual excitement.

591
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,714
Because lying alone
in a hospital bed,

592
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,880
contemplating bankruptcy? Hot.

593
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,117
My point was that
arousal is a function

594
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,819
of the parasympathetic
nervous system.

595
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,326
If that's where the problem is,

596
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,272
the pain could be triggered
by crying, which seems...

597
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,856
PNS also controls digestion,
which she's been doing

598
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,026
without screaming her head
off since she's been here.

599
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,813
What if what matters isn't when
the pain started, but when it stopped?

600
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,238
It was during an X-ray.
You think that cured her?

601
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,208
No, but House prepped her for
the X-ray with a barium enema.

602
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,073
That wouldn't treat
anything except...

603
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,039
Go.

604
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,210
You're in pain because part of
your intestine folded in on itself.

605
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,495
It's called an intussusception.

606
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,097
It's cutting off blood
flow. We need to fix it

607
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,919
before your bowel
gets necrotic and dies.

608
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,457
Once you do that,
will I get better?

609
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:33,601
When this happens in adults,

610
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,169
it's usually a sign
of abdominal cancer.

611
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,890
We'll fix the overlap, and then
search your intestine for tumors.

612
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,503
Foam?

613
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,633
I have a bad feeling about this.

614
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,439
A friend can't spontaneously buy

615
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:56,505
an overpriced Italian espresso
machine for another friend?

616
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,481
What did you do?

617
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,212
Nothing, that's the beauty.

618
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,120
I genuinely tried
to help Wilson.

619
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,432
I told him to stand
up for himself,

620
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,118
which you know
is legitimate advice.

621
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,217
And his relationship blew up.

622
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,989
Is he okay? He'll be fine.

623
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,121
Point is, I realized something.

624
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:15,998
I do nice things, nice things
happen to me. Karma works.

625
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,366
So you're paying it forward?

626
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:24,836
If this should somehow lead
to Lucas dying or oral sex,

627
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,878
so be it.

628
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,686
You think I should
wear a tie tonight?

629
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,884
This isn't weird at all.

630
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:45,191
I mean, where's
Rachel eating tonight?

631
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,424
Home.

632
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:50,792
What if she's going out, too?

633
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,667
She's allowed to, right?

634
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,639
Of course, it's only fair.

635
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,787
But I don't think she will.

636
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,174
Your wife only eats
dinner at home?

637
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:05,514
If she did go out,
that'd be tough.

638
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,953
But I think I can handle it.

639
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,351
Don't do it unless you're sure.

640
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,947
I know I'd rather be
jealous than a liar.

641
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,426
Got something here.
Kelly clamp and scalpel.

642
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,396
<i>Biopsy showed
non-specific inflammation,</i>

643
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,056
which suggests IBD.

644
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,191
Only that doesn't explain
the cardiac problems.

645
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,259
Or her declining
kidney function.

646
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,669
We ran panels during surgery.

647
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,300
Actually, IBD does make sense,

648
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,038
'cause it can trigger
ankylosing spondylitis,

649
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,444
which would explain
the heart and the kidneys.

650
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,814
Start her on sulfasalazine
and TNF-inhibitors.

651
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,217
And Taub, I'm not gonna see you

652
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,566
before you head
off for Gomorrah.

653
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,102
Just remember, if
you get disoriented,

654
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,955
breathe through your nose
and look for the horizon.

655
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,609
I can't.

656
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,771
I really thought
I could do this.

657
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,182
Logically, it makes
perfect sense.

658
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,881
But all afternoon,

659
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:26,459
all I kept thinking about
was the two of you together,

660
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,999
and you touching her...

661
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,835
Nothing's happened. It's okay.

662
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,804
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,019
'Cause I really wanted...

664
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,636
No.

665
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:45,882
I've been an idiot. I don't need
anything else. I just need you.

666
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,544
You mean that?

667
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,016
I do.

668
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,192
I love you, Rachel.

669
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,559
I love you, too.

670
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,561
Let's go home.

671
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,894
Is that okay?

672
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,135
There are other doctors.

673
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,423
The treatment's not working.

674
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,813
Her left kidney
failed last night.

675
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,092
The other one's right behind it.

676
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,347
It's not ankylosing spondylitis.

677
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,081
Kidney biopsy showed
she had lgA nephropathy,

678
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,989
which could be caused by or
associated with any of these conditions.

679
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,323
We've gone from too
few ideas to too many,

680
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,590
and our patient is
running out of time.

681
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,697
Why the lack of afterglow?

682
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,860
Physio girl not as
freaky as you'd hoped?

683
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,162
I went home with my wife.

684
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,934
After all that?
You chickened out.

685
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,673
I can't hurt Rachel like that.

686
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,374
Sickle cell anemia would've
shown on blood tests.

687
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,815
No flattened intestinal
villi rules out celiac...

688
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,412
Seriously?

689
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,822
Our patient is dying, and we
can't move past my sex life?

690
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,689
Seriously? You
think it'd kill her

691
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,752
if we spent 15
seconds mocking you?

692
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,863
Time's up.

693
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,833
Normal liver enzymes
rules out Hep B and cirrhosis.

694
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,030
Alport and Anti-GBM
antibody are both untreatable,

695
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,232
so if she has them,
we can't help her.

696
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,400
And it can't be
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

697
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,570
No inciting respiratory
infection and no rash.

698
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,840
I don't care what it's not.

699
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,090
I wanna know what it could be.

700
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,209
Well, everything
left on the list.

701
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,446
The list was not created equal.

702
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,852
Neither was man, by the way.

703
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:33,187
Hemochromatosis is a
possibility. Excess iron builds up,

704
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,468
causes problems
throughout the body.

705
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,587
Weil's Syndrome also
affects multiple organ systems.

706
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,187
And it wouldn't
have been treated

707
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,165
by the antibiotic
the ER gave her.

708
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,701
Sarcoidosis makes sense, too.

709
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,795
Good. Treat for those three.

710
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,543
I think you should call Tom.

711
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,615
Am I going to die?

712
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,312
I don't know.

713
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,884
If he walked in here right now,

714
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,856
I'd look at his face, and
all I would think is "liar."

715
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,189
Don't you think
that's kind of unfair?

716
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,750
You say honesty
is all-important,

717
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,238
but you conveniently
ignore the truth

718
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,731
that some truths hurt people.

719
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,393
Tom lied to protect you.

720
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,232
He was covering his ass.

721
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,670
I'm not talking about the money.

722
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,870
Tom hasn't slept with
anyone else in over a year.

723
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,876
He told you that?

724
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,713
So my entire marriage is a sham.

725
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,255
No.

726
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,690
Your husband,
who only wants you,

727
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,523
lied so that you could be happy.

728
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,031
That seems pretty real to me.

729
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:51,835
Yeah?

730
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,471
Hey. Hey.

731
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,910
Listen, I'm sorry.

732
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,183
Me, too. I shouldn't
have said...

733
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:14,226
No. You were right. I
was selfish back then.

734
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,061
I'm trying to change.

735
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,998
And I don't know if
it's House or what,

736
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,767
but you're different, too.

737
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,563
I'm trying.

738
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,136
I always thought that I
was keeping the peace.

739
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,205
But I was just resenting you

740
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,547
and giving you a
reason to leave.

741
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,191
I wish we had this
fight 10 years ago.

742
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,432
Is it okay if we don't
give House the credit?

743
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,103
I recommend it.

744
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,010
0-for-3, her kidney
function is still declining.

745
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,278
We're going to
need to start dialysis.

746
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,183
Glad the husband's back.

747
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,188
After missing so
many little deaths,

748
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,121
he should be here
for the big one.

749
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,522
Top six, anyone?

750
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,356
Polyarteritis Nodosa?

751
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,727
We would've seen some
improvement on prednisone.

752
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,593
Guy's wife is dying.
He stops to buy flowers.

753
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,467
They're from his garden.
Mercury poisoning fits.

754
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,370
Those are lilacs.

755
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,680
My mom used to grow lilacs.

756
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,578
My dad made her get rid of them

757
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,981
'cause there were too many bees.

758
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,044
We ruled out HSP because there
was no inciting respiratory infection.

759
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,319
But in rare cases, it can also
be triggered by a bee sting.

760
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,293
We also ruled it out
because there's no rash.

761
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,262
Maybe we just didn't see it.

762
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,435
Have you been stung
by a bee recently?

763
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,531
About a month ago.

764
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,943
What's going on?

765
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:17,514
I think your wife has
Henoch-Schonlein purpura,

766
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,677
systemic vasculitis
that can cause lesions

767
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,414
and inflammation
throughout the body.

768
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,115
It's pretty awful,

769
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,626
which explains why it was named
after a German. Actually, two Germans.

770
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,992
Lesions can pop up in the heart,

771
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,792
sometimes in the kidneys.

772
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:37,393
But always on the skin. Means
you'd have a rash somewhere.

773
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,663
I don't.

774
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,897
Not that you know of.

775
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,471
Okay, I'm going to have to check
your holes. I'll start with the mouth.

776
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,513
If there's nothing there, then
things might have to get kinky.

777
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,979
Say "ah."

778
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,107
Ah.

779
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,177
I was kind of hoping for kinky.

780
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,812
Is that good or bad?

781
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,325
We'll treat her with high-dose
IVig and cyclophosphamide.

782
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,859
You should be fine.

783
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,086
I'm going to be okay.

784
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,267
I love you.

785
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,600
That is adorable.

786
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,072
Other than you still wanting
to have sex with other dudes

787
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,438
and him bankrupting your family,

788
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,774
I think you kids are
pretty much home free.

789
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,484
And...

790
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,281
You two made up?

791
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,189
No.

792
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,454
You can thank me later.

793
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,018
I'm all in.

794
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,131
All right.

795
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,527
Fold. Jesus.

796
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:52,976
Nervous?

797
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:56,503
I'm getting there. I'm
getting some nervousness.

798
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,438
You need a hand?

799
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,548
Thanks.

800
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,924
Sorry about canceling
the other night.

801
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,594
Me, too.

802
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,447
You wanna go somewhere?
