1
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,135
Hey.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,387
Hey, I'll be right there.

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,004
Take your time.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,709
You mind if I get
a drink of water?

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,876
No, no. Not at
all, help yourself.

6
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,599
Not exactly beach reading, huh?

7
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,412
Do you understand
any of that stuff?

8
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,780
Well, most of these
I can get through.

9
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,706
But that one, I can't
get past the dust jacket.

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,333
Where's Ted? Laid off.

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,853
Company's going
with per diem workers.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,312
You don't have to pay
overtime, health insurance.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,712
Wow, that sucks.

14
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,616
I don't mind. Really. I'm not
a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,556
Uh, if I could just
get you to sign...

16
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,091
Right. Um...

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,487
Hang on one second. I
wanna show you something.

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,433
You're gonna laugh,

19
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,131
but I swear this guy, James
Sidas, looks exactly like you.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,706
Wait, hang on a second.

21
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,506
This guy is you. I saw a
profile <i>Nova</i> did on you.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,379
You're like the youngest
guy to ever graduate MIT.

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,042
Standards were lower back then.

24
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,551
You got an IQ of 178.

25
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,850
Published three
books and 35 papers,

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,787
all before the age of 18?

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,017
Yeah.

28
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,287
Sorry, I really
need to get going,

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,804
so if I could just
get you to sign off...

30
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,458
All right. I'll trade you.
I'll sign if you'll sign.

31
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,928
I'm not that guy any more.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
Come on, man. This is
the most exciting thing

33
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,431
that's happened in
this place in years.

34
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,537
Come on, don't be like that.

35
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,447
I'm paying you a compliment.

36
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,350
It's not that. I'm...

37
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,951
My hand's not working.

38
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,857
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. You okay?

39
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,653
No.

40
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,167
$2.32. Put it on
Dr. Wilson's tab.

41
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,504
I don't know who Dr. Wilson
is, and we don't have tabs.

42
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,167
Do you know who I am?

43
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,677
No. Good.

44
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,478
But, sir...

45
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,572
I got it. It's all right.

46
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,449
Thanks.

47
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,558
Although, I should make
it clear that for two bucks,

48
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,714
all you get is top
half, over the clothes.

49
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,117
Any plans for turkey day?

50
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,026
Going to my sister's
for dinner. Why?

51
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,921
Just making
pleasant conversation.

52
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,966
I heard tell of
folks doing such.

53
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,297
How about we talk about this?

54
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,304
Fifteen-year-old, recurring
migraines and blurred vision.

55
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,566
Great. Really?

56
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,665
Sure. There's no point
putting a band together

57
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,141
if we're not gonna
play any gigs.

58
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,804
Hold on. Take this instead.

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,676
I was expecting more resistance.

60
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:37,616
That was the old me. New me
is static guarded and friction free.

61
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,516
Enjoy your drumstick.

62
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,717
Ready to save some lives?

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,354
Thirty-two-year-old courier,
ataxia, anemia, mild cough.

64
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,127
CT was clear, tox
screen negative.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,998
What are you so excited about?

66
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,003
Why wouldn't I be?
Got all my starters back,

67
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,132
plus a couple of first-class free
agents. I feel like Mike Tomlin.

68
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,241
Probably not as much as
you do, but you get the idea.

69
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,042
Ataxia and anemia, could
be viral, maybe West Nile.

70
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,017
No fever, lymph glands were
normal. Anybody seen Wilson?

71
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,245
Hyperbilirubinemia?

72
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,379
Yeah, like that's a real thing.

73
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,478
Meningitis.

74
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,023
Anemia's a stretch.

75
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,389
Page Dr. James Wilson at 558.

76
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,825
What about sickle cell?

77
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,362
The guy's white.
Whites can get it.

78
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,058
Come on. We get the tennis
elbow and all the money,

79
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,259
let them have sickle cell.

80
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,596
TTP is a better fit.

81
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,896
He's right.

82
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,904
What, you thought I wouldn't
agree with him? Ever?

83
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,120
Well, you didn't agree with him.

84
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,773
That's why he dumped
you. Oh, sorry, it was mutual.

85
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,077
We're cool, okay? Nobody's
angry, nobody's hurt.

86
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,583
Sounds passionate.

87
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,017
TTP makes sense
to me. Not to me.

88
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,130
What if he had a history of...

89
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,090
One big happy family. TTP it is.

90
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,688
Confirm with a blood smear
and ADAMTS13 antibodies.

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,696
<i>Dr. James Wilson,
please dial 558.</i>

92
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,555
Can you cure it?

93
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,100
TTP isn't completely curable,

94
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,534
but the symptoms are manageable
with the proper treatment.

95
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,763
Is this the treatment?

96
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,149
No. First we need to do a blood
test to confirm the diagnosis.

97
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,300
But he's gonna get better?

98
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,785
Honey, that's what she's saying.

99
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,019
I'm gonna be okay. Don't worry.

100
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,171
How can't I worry?
You're in the hospital.

101
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,770
I'm gonna be fine.

102
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,146
Are you sure everything
was fine before?

103
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,760
I mean, given your
educational background,

104
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,129
you'd think you could at least
find a job with a medical plan.

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,644
We have money. Don't worry.

106
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,780
It's not that.

107
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,449
It's just I want to make sure

108
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,254
we have all the
information we should.

109
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,589
My husband wouldn't lie.

110
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,653
It's okay, baby. He's
just doing his job.

111
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,099
He just wants to make sure I'm not
a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.

112
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,966
Or hiding a history
of mental illness.

113
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,335
I work as a courier
because I want to.

114
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,685
It's easy. I don't
have to think.

115
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,870
It's too hard to think?

116
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,936
No. Just unpleasant.

117
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,911
No matter what I did, it
really wasn't good enough.

118
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,110
Then I met Dara.

119
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,461
She didn't care how smart I was,

120
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,977
or what I might
accomplish in the future.

121
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,457
It was the first time in my
life that I was really happy.

122
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,087
So I decided I would
rather be happy than smart.

123
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,232
You all right?

124
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,045
Sorry. I know you're
not okay. I mean...

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,512
She left.

126
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,946
Went back to Chicago.

127
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,384
Any chance of reconciliation?

128
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,780
No.

129
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,833
You sure you don't wanna
grab a drink after work?

130
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,035
I figured we could talk about
the perils of dating doctors.

131
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,459
I wasn't dating Cameron.

132
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,605
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

133
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,690
I know what you're
doing, and I appreciate it.

134
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,961
But I've got it under control.

135
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,060
That's what you said
about the Dibala incident,

136
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,968
and obviously you didn't.

137
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,566
And talking about it obviously
made things so much better.

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,007
Didn't you think there was
something weird about that guy?

139
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,518
Not really. In fact, he
seemed pretty normal.

140
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,214
That's my point.

141
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,950
Guys with IQs off the chart

142
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,720
are usually completely abnormal.

143
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,925
Speaking of House,
why did you come back?

144
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,539
I mean, you must have
taken a major pay cut.

145
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,041
Life's too short to
worry about money.

146
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,226
Your wife feel the same way?

147
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,202
She's happy to cut
back on some things.

148
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,703
Like sex.

149
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,234
Why'd you come
back? Why wouldn't I?

150
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,801
Like Foreman said,
nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.

151
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,971
Schistocytes.

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,578
That means TTP.

153
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,893
Which is what we thought it'd be,
remember? This is a good thing.

154
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,012
This is an easy thing, and House
doesn't take cases that are easy,

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,713
which means it's not TTP.

156
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,157
And he wants to see how long
it takes us to catch up to him.

157
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,295
Schistocytes suggest TTP.

158
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,094
Good, now what?

159
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,061
Normally we'd try
plasmapheresis,

160
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,296
but the patient has an
albumin colloid allergy.

161
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,429
So?

162
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,598
So that means we have
to give him a splenectomy.

163
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,266
Yes, it does.

164
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,214
Wilson? MAN: No.

165
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,452
Do you know where he is?

166
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,618
Not in here.

167
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,594
You're sure you want
us to take out his spleen?

168
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,862
Is that what a splenectomy is?

169
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,092
I thought it was an
ice cream treat. Yuck.

170
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,929
So you do really
think he has TTP.

171
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,128
You're not just testing us.

172
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,728
Yeah. Like I have
time for games.

173
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,308
So, why did you
really take this case?

174
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,607
Isn't it obvious? I'm
fishing for a dinner invite.

175
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,051
Missed you at
breakfast this morning.

176
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,724
And lunch.

177
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,420
I had a dentist appointment.

178
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,656
You know where
Cuddy's sister lives?

179
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,097
You see, this is why I don't
answer your urgent pages,

180
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,964
because they're
not urgent pages.

181
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,971
I've decided what I'm gonna
do about Cuddy and Lucas.

182
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,438
I'm going to break them up.

183
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,032
Of course. It's given
me a purpose in life,

184
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,441
a goal, a raison d'être.

185
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,414
Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited, childish raison.

186
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,041
I think of it more
as benevolent.

187
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,785
There's only two possible
outcomes for their relationship,

188
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,049
they split or they
stay together forever.

189
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,762
If it's split, then the sooner it
happens, the better for everyone.

190
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,090
If it's stay, then my
meddling won't matter.

191
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,060
In fact, if they survive it,

192
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,326
it might even make
their bond stronger.

193
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
How you manage to
elevate your narcissism

194
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,869
to beneficence is masterful.

195
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,834
And I've decided to do
it at Thanksgiving dinner,

196
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,673
just 'cause I'm sentimental.

197
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,889
Dinner's at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back to...

198
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,609
House, don't.

199
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,981
I fished for an invite. Cuddy
wasn't biting, so I'll have to crash.

200
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,987
I have no idea where
Cuddy's sister lives.

201
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,250
Ask and thou shalt receive.

202
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,349
You can't honestly think
I would help you with this.

203
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,123
Not help me, help
Cuddy, remember?

204
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,093
If you don't get it, I'll be forced
to use more nefarious methods.

205
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,691
Happy holidays.

206
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,863
Ah.

207
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,340
Looks great.

208
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,400
So, he's all better?

209
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,241
Probably be on
some long-term meds,

210
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,042
and he's about
10 ounces lighter,

211
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,107
other than that, he
won't even know it's gone.

212
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,714
Did you hear that, honey?
You're gonna be just fine.

213
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,518
When can I get out of here?

214
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,957
If everything checks
out, less than a week.

215
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,587
Good. 'Cause those boxes
aren't gonna deliver colors.

216
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,954
Colors?

217
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,591
Green and orange

218
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,127
and ceiling.

219
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,469
Mr. Sidas, do you know
where you are? Chewing.

220
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,697
Jimmy?

221
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,774
Shirt.

222
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,676
He's stroking. Call
the cath lab, now!

223
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,974
Oh, my God.

224
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,920
Blood flow's restored, appears
to be no permanent damage.

225
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,252
Good news is it turns
out to be an exciting,

226
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,553
action-packed thrill
ride of a case after all.

227
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,390
Bad news is we took
out his spleen for nothing.

228
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,896
Thank God he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

229
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,627
So what looks like
TTP, acts like TTP,

230
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,226
tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?

231
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,772
CNS Vasculitis,
explains the ataxia

232
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,137
and anemia, maybe the stroke.

233
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,698
CT would have
picked up something.

234
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,973
Hi, I'm Greg House. I'm a
friend of your sister, Lisa.

235
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,536
Could be DIC.

236
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,945
Lisa Cuddy.

237
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,655
Sorry, wrong number.
You gonna ask?

238
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,652
I'm sure he's got a
perfectly logical explanation.

239
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,812
Can't be DIC, no hemorrhaging.

240
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,516
And I'm calling all 12 Julia
Cuddys within 100-mile radius.

241
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,957
See? Completely reasonable.
Acquired pancytopenia?

242
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,087
WBC's normal.

243
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,463
Hey, Julia. You're
Lisa's sister, right?

244
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,401
Are you sure? You are number 12.

245
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,768
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

246
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,238
Otis Campbell.

247
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,639
Probably kept her first name.

248
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,885
The mnemonic for toxins.

249
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,640
"O" for organophosphates,
"T" for tricyclics, "I" for insulin...

250
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,238
Or as I remember
it, "Moist Place."

251
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,750
That's "Place" spelled with
two "L"s and a silent "B."

252
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,161
Except the tox
screen was negative.

253
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,586
Standard tox screen. Unstandard
toxins don't show up on it.

254
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,091
Well, you two do an unstandard
tox screen. You two search his home.

255
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,821
Otis Campbell's gotta
be hiding somewhere.

256
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,129
Smartest guy in the world

257
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,960
and this is the best he can do?

258
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,624
Maybe he's doing what he loves.

259
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,226
Delivering boxes was
a childhood dream.

260
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,437
Soda, processed cheese,
marshmallow spread.

261
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,098
Nothing in here is
capable of going bad.

262
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,872
Ibuprofen, eye
drops, cough syrup.

263
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,943
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,711
You never asked me
over before, why now?

265
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:36,449
Just never thought of it. But
now that we're both on the team...

266
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,514
And my wife left me?

267
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,055
Is that a bad reason?

268
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,427
No, but I'm okay.

269
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,564
On both the food and friends.

270
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,125
Mice.

271
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,661
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

272
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,867
But not without a fever.

273
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,137
You have someone to talk to?

274
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,644
Yeah. Who?

275
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,138
What, you want names?

276
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,844
Look, you lost
a friend, I get it.

277
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,044
But I'm not Kutner.

278
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,612
Good. 'Cause Kutner never
used to come over for dinner.

279
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,034
I'm going to pretend there's
something interesting over here,

280
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,720
so you'll shut up.

281
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:30,472
Actually, there is. He's got
sketches of atomic structure.

282
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,012
This one is full of math proofs.

283
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,845
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

284
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,509
This isn't some
homework assignment

285
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,849
his parents forced on him,

286
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,652
this is passion. Why would
he want to stop doing this?

287
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,090
Marriage destroyed his soul?

288
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,499
Ooh.

289
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,834
Or maybe it was just the booze.

290
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,643
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been wonderful.

291
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,549
As have you, Diana. Be well.

292
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,052
Thank you.

293
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,953
You're helping. Voluntarily.

294
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,290
He's done six already.

295
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,987
I figured you might
be getting backed up

296
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,392
with the holiday season and all.

297
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,990
So which one of us slipped through the
wormhole into an alternate dimension?

298
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,058
I have always loved
to travel. And paint.

299
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,194
Lucky number seven.

300
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,636
House, I know you're
trying to be nice.

301
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,800
But I also know you're doing it
because you have an agenda.

302
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,174
Wow. Sexy and smart.

303
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,506
Lucas is a lucky guy.

304
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,642
The question is, is this a
bad agenda or a good one?

305
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,748
Either you're trying
to screw with me,

306
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,416
or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

307
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,991
So which is it?
I'm dying to know.

308
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,439
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving dinner?

309
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,938
Peace in our time!

310
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,942
Only cost me 45
minutes of clinic duty.

311
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,946
This is a three-hour drive.

312
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,782
Have you considered the
possibility that this is a fake address?

313
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,982
You think she'd send me to a
vacant lot for Thanksgiving dinner?

314
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,025
If she's smart. She is.

315
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,062
That's why I ran it through
Motor Vehicles. Good as gold.

316
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,688
This cannot end well.

317
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,428
Don't want it to end well.
You should come as my date.

318
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,397
You're not gonna
want to miss this.

319
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,342
The unstandard tox screen

320
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,002
was as clean as
the standard one.

321
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,047
But we found vodka
stashed away in his place.

322
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,679
What's with the ties?

323
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:56,015
Makes me look adorably
non-threatening. Party or party-hearty?

324
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,489
Liver failure would
explain all the symptoms.

325
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,225
Party.

326
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:09,033
So, the guy's a brainiac and his
secret drug of choice is booze?

327
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,002
It's kind of pedestrian,
don't you think?

328
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,663
Talk to him, he's
a pedestrian guy.

329
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,334
With pedestrian alcoholism. Liver
biopsy can wait until after Thanksgiving.

330
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,105
Yes, assuming the biopsy

331
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,289
is going to tell us exactly
what we expect it to tell us,

332
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,872
it can wait till
after New Years.

333
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,510
On the other hand, Taub and
Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today.

334
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,712
Why us?

335
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,948
Juniority. Welcome back.

336
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,962
What do you want us to do?

337
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,255
Same as me. Have a
happy Thanksgiving.

338
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,259
I'm not an alcoholic.

339
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,199
Yes, you just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

340
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,498
I drink, just not a lot.

341
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,435
Since when do you drink at all?

342
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,873
I have one shot when I get
home from work, baby. That's it.

343
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,375
So why lie to
your wife about it?

344
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,139
Because it's not important.

345
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,322
What difference does it make?

346
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,611
That you drink every
day, by yourself?

347
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,276
I have one lousy drink, okay?

348
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,595
Have you ever seen
me drunk? Ever?

349
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,555
No, but you've obviously been
drinking enough to hurt your liver.

350
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,591
My liver is fine. Hold still.

351
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,919
There we go.

352
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,794
This test is a waste of time.

353
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,641
Hey. This wine?

354
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,652
All right. Very good.
There, we got this...

355
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,326
String beans?

356
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,349
Julia?

357
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,851
No, I'm the house sitter.

358
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,718
They're in Hawaii for the week.

359
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,696
Happy Thanksgiving.

360
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,425
Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.

361
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,498
Happy Thanksgiving.

362
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,659
Cheers. Cheers.

363
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,969
You must be Dr. House.

364
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,870
I was told I should offer
you a turkey sandwich.

365
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,083
Tuna salad. Closest
thing they had to turkey.

366
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,182
Thanks. But I'm hoping
I can still get out of here

367
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,159
and catch the tail end
of dinner with my wife.

368
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,227
Anything?

369
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,389
No cirrhosis, no
scarring, no infection.

370
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,229
Blood panel?
Elevated albumin, 7.2.

371
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,202
That's it? Everything
else is fine.

372
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,432
So it was a waste of time.

373
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,599
Unless, it's not his liver

374
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,612
that's elevating his
albumin, it's his kidneys.

375
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,409
Renal failure.
Explains the anemia.

376
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,881
If he developed hyperkalemia,

377
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,783
that would explain the
ataxia, but the stroke...

378
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,616
Ischemic encephalopathy.

379
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,047
Nice.

380
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,917
Except now we have to
stay and test his kidneys.

381
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,138
Key under the mat.

382
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,318
There's no key under the mat.

383
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,537
Oh, right.

384
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,606
You need to replace one
of your kitchen windows.

385
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,743
I helped myself
to your wine cellar.

386
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,649
I'll leave a buck
on the way out.

387
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,049
You're not right for her.

388
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,214
And you are?

389
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,655
Less wrong.

390
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,724
Ah.

391
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,925
But then I started thinking...

392
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,299
What was I saying?

393
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,770
You were saying it's late and...

394
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,673
She invited me. She
didn't know if she should.

395
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,838
She was trying to figure
out if I really have changed

396
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:19,145
or if I'm still the same
old SOB I've always been.

397
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,655
But she always gave me a chance.

398
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,893
Eight hundred and
thirty-two chances,

399
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,124
and I used up every one of them.

400
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,635
Eight hundred and thirty-two's
her limit, make a note.

401
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,231
How about a cup of coffee?

402
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,006
It's just instant, but...

403
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,074
I'm pathetic.

404
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,685
I don't deserve her.

405
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,051
Okay. Okay. All right.

406
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,925
Here.

407
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,630
Maybe you should crash here.

408
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,596
It's a sofa bed.

409
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,729
I love her.

410
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,040
Patient's liver is fine, it's
his kidneys that are shot.

411
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,480
And where the hell is House?

412
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,041
He left a message on the
machine. He's not coming in today.

413
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,609
So what causes kidney failure?

414
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,710
Rhabdomyolysis.

415
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,017
No edema.

416
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,183
I trust you had a
wonderful Thanksgiving.

417
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:35,285
I don't remember.
So I guess I did.

418
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,860
Multiple myeloma. No bone pain.

419
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,330
You got drunk alone?

420
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,991
No. That would be a sign

421
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,092
that I need to talk
to you about this.

422
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,569
Polycystic kidney disease.

423
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,128
No UTIs or flank pain.

424
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,943
Well, what if his cough
is more than just a cold?

425
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,104
He hasn't been
coughing. It's in his history,

426
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,457
and we found a new bottle of
cough syrup in his medicine cabinet.

427
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,006
Cough could mean
Goodpasture Syndrome,

428
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,675
affects kidneys and lungs.

429
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,912
Start him on
immunosuppressors and dialysis.

430
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,631
We'll do it right after
we run it by House.

431
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,065
He's not answering his pager.

432
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,489
Looks like he's
leaving it up to us.

433
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,890
Us. Not you.

434
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,791
And since we don't disagree,

435
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,194
you can save your
fight for another case.

436
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,095
How long do I have
to be hooked up for?

437
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,765
Four to six hours a day

438
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,867
until we see an improvement.
What if you don't?

439
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,821
Then we keep doing it
until he gets a transplant.

440
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,438
You were sure it was his spleen,

441
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,311
and then you were
sure it was his liver,

442
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,781
which he told you it wasn't,

443
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,227
and now you're
sure it's his kidneys.

444
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,662
It's definitely his kidneys.

445
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,349
We just don't know
why it's his kidneys.

446
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,825
Any word from Cameron?

447
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,223
Nope.

448
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,801
I started seeing a
counselor after my diagnosis.

449
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,063
She's really good.

450
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,768
Why does everyone assume that
everyone works in the exact same way?

451
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,103
We pretty much do.

452
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:59,634
Our egos want us to think
we're all snowflakes, no two alike,

453
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,476
but really, we all
want the same things,

454
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,211
love, forgiveness, chocolate.

455
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,158
Well, what I want is for
everyone to leave me alone.

456
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,885
How do I get that?

457
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,126
What did you say
to Lucas last night?

458
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,798
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

459
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't remember how I got
here, never mind what I said.

460
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,672
Well, I just talked to him.

461
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,122
And he said he
thought it'd be better

462
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,581
if we stopped seeing each other.

463
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,377
Said he didn't realize how much

464
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,976
there still was
between you and me.

465
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,387
And he didn't want to get
caught in the middle of us.

466
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,661
I was drunk.

467
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,172
Whatever I said,
he can't really...

468
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,665
I've had enough, House.

469
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,827
I actually felt bad
about scamming you,

470
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,099
but then you lived down to my
expectations, and then some.

471
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,774
There is no us.

472
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,814
There never will be.

473
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,125
It worked.

474
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,606
Please tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

475
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,360
They split up this morning.

476
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,526
You're the very
first one I've told.

477
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,594
And you think she'll start dating
you? I'm sure she hates you.

478
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,603
But her eyes say,

479
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,199
"How will I ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

480
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,938
What a shame.

481
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,274
They'll get over it.

482
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,213
I meant for you. I'll get
over it faster than they do.

483
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,819
I can't believe that
Lucas fell for my

484
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,752
"I'd never say this
because it's so personal

485
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,223
"except that I'm drunk"
profession of love.

486
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,850
Second oldest trick in the book.

487
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:57,294
You're right. It's his
fault because he's stupid.

488
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,463
He certainly is.

489
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,669
You're stupid.

490
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,340
Well, I'm rubber
and you're glue...

491
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,476
He's not pedestrian,
he's stupid.

492
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,683
Or at least stupider than he
should be. He's a DXM junkie.

493
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,425
Dextromethorphan.
As in cough syrup?

494
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,393
He wasn't taking
it for his cough.

495
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,259
It's cheap, available at
your corner drugstore,

496
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,494
and taken in high
doses, it's a dumb drug.

497
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:38,067
Dumb drug? He
obviously hasn't...

498
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,730
He's smart compared to you,

499
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,365
he's a moron compared
to what he was.

500
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,608
Robotripping lowers the IQ,
it also causes brain damage.

501
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,843
Unless taken with the
proper amount of ethanol,

502
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,384
about one drink per day.

503
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,452
He wasn't abusing the booze

504
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,251
and taking the cough
remedy medicinally,

505
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,191
he was abusing the cough meds
and taking the booze medicinally.

506
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,060
Bravo.

507
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,426
Why would you do that?

508
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,832
If you had a gift, why
would you just throw it away?

509
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,532
I didn't throw it away. I
just turned it down a little.

510
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:18,477
When my brain was on low, everything
didn't seem so miserable any more.

511
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,308
Life was bearable.

512
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,308
I thought that I did that.

513
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,145
You do.

514
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,482
Long-term abuse of DXM
explains all your symptoms.

515
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:33,185
Even, oh, sweet
irony, your cough.

516
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,784
Whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.

517
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,853
We get all traces of
it out of your system,

518
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,764
you'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

519
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,697
I don't think I
can live without it.

520
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,303
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

521
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,002
Make him a genius.

522
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:58,746
I can't believe it. He looks
so much better already.

523
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,454
We were thinking
about calling <i>GQ.</i>

524
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,491
Lavage has removed all
traces of DXM from his body.

525
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,559
You're drawing
again. What is it?

526
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,651
Just doodles.

527
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,857
No, it's not. Come on,
Jimmy, I want to know.

528
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,435
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

529
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,738
It determines the
amount of energy

530
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,905
expended by the
subatomic particles.

531
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,916
I'm thirsty. Could you get
me a juice or something?

532
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,047
Yeah. Of course.

533
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,653
I'm so happy, Jimmy.

534
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,554
I told you.

535
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,494
You know what the difference
between her IQ and mine is?

536
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,731
91 points.

537
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,366
In relation, she's closer to
a gibbon than she is to me.

538
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,878
Having sex with her
would be an act of bestiality.

539
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,142
I assume you didn't marry her

540
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,682
for her skill in
Applied Physics.

541
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,048
I just wish she could spell it.

542
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,310
You really think
you'd be happier

543
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,878
with someone who
could spell better?

544
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,287
No.

545
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,489
That's the problem.
I'm the one who's a jerk.

546
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,090
But I owe her everything.

547
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,230
I want to want to be with her.

548
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,496
And when I'm clear, I...

549
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,671
I can't.

550
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,610
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

551
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,944
Sometimes.

552
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,547
Is the wait always this long?

553
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:43,077
Only on days that end in
"day." Diarrhea, weight loss?

554
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,350
A bit.

555
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,049
Don't you ever shave?

556
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,287
Yeah, once a week.
How about you?

557
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,954
Stomach pain, tenderness?

558
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,556
Every now and then. Are you
this rude to all your patients?

559
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,727
Oh, yes, don't
think you're special.

560
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:00,898
So we got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms,

561
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,807
yet all the physical
signs are perfectly normal.

562
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,639
What do you think I
have? I'm not sure,

563
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:09,079
but I think it's a lame job.

564
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,274
What?

565
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,776
You're a rat. Insurance
company sends you out

566
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,820
to check on the
quality of medical care.

567
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:15,979
That's ridiculous.

568
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,078
Is it really?

569
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,566
'Cause you seem
a lot more interested

570
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,218
in asking questions
than answering them.

571
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,470
Handwriting in your medical
records is obviously not a doctor's,

572
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,757
'cause I can almost read it.

573
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,663
And when you went out for a
urine sample, I looked in your purse.

574
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,610
Found the list of questions
you were supposed to memorize

575
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:32,332
before you came to the
clinic. I was looking for gum.

576
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:33,931
You're an ass.

577
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,065
Put it in your report.

578
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,904
I'll tell you what. I'll
give you 20 bucks

579
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,307
if you'll pretend that I'm not

580
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,845
when we leave this room.

581
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,607
Remember, first ice, then heat.

582
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,778
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

583
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,651
Thank you, Dr. House.

584
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,352
Wait a second. Where's Cuddy?

585
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,258
Gone for the day.

586
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,054
Hey! Hey! Hey!

587
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,428
Sorry, can't remember if I've
mocked you yet for being a male nurse.

588
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,502
I think this counts.

589
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,570
Fair enough.

590
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,139
That isn't the man I married.

591
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,949
Yes, he is. He's just
smarter. Give him some time.

592
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,508
I'm sure... He hates me.

593
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,350
His body is going through
withdrawal. He's adjusting.

594
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,324
Maybe he never
loved me. Not really.

595
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,452
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

596
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,929
Somebody help!

597
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:40,772
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.

598
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,969
Anywhere. Nothing.

599
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,711
We have to talk about this.

600
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,248
It's late. I'm tired.

601
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,124
I know it's a big pay cut,

602
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,936
but I'll always have the
chance to make money.

603
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,520
I won't always have
the chance to do this job.

604
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,760
That's what you think?
That it's about the money?

605
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,169
So it's that I didn't consult
you before I took the job?

606
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,796
That was offensive, but
it's not about that either.

607
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,340
So then...

608
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,811
Can you give
me the first letter?

609
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,179
When we got married,

610
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,186
you were an intern working
30-hour shifts, doing grunt work,

611
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,764
and we both put up
with it because we knew

612
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,450
that it was leading
to something better.

613
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:35,688
In your private practice, you
are the boss. You call the shots.

614
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,354
But now, you're 40 years old,

615
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,489
you're still doing grunt work.

616
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,967
That's what this is about?
You think I'm a wuss?

617
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,564
He made you miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

618
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,541
Vitamin B12 deficiency
gives us anemia, numbness...

619
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:01,619
Not a stroke.

620
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,764
If he has a vascular
malformation...

621
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,689
Anemia's not macrocytic.

622
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,487
Sorry to inconvenience you.

623
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,222
Dying patients can
be so thoughtless.

624
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,456
Don't.

625
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,932
Great comeback. Is that
Oscar Wilde? Come on, people.

626
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,127
Bone marrow malignancy.

627
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,401
Wouldn't produce schistocytes.

628
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,370
Lupus. HOUSE: Gee,
thanks for coming in.

629
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,929
ANA was negative.

630
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:22,931
What about you?

631
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,671
You got any predictable
drivel you'd like to add?

632
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,288
I think they've given
you enough already.

633
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,975
At least they're trying, not
just sitting there like roadkill.

634
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,744
Give me something!

635
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,753
Give me something or
I'll get your ex-smarter half

636
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,618
on the phone and ask her.

637
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,917
House...

638
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,526
You're going to be
pressing charges?

639
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,653
Against the ottoman
I tripped over?

640
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,253
Against Chase.

641
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,857
I'm pretty sure the
ottoman was acting alone.

642
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,035
You free for dinner
this weekend?

643
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,833
At least three other
people saw him do it.

644
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,635
Mass hysteria. Either night?

645
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,869
I can't have doctors
punching each other out.

646
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,207
Oh, my God, who got punched?

647
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,440
And more importantly,
for Chase's sake,

648
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,191
I need to know if he's
able to handle himself

649
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,309
or if I should be
getting him some help.

650
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,977
Chase couldn't have
punched anyone.

651
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,830
He was with me when I
tripped over the ottoman.

652
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,450
If you're not planning on eating
this weekend, maybe a movie?

653
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,857
I'm not doing this, House.

654
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,793
It's not fun anymore.

655
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,293
Just do your job.

656
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,072
I need your help.

657
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,975
What happened to your face?

658
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,253
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

659
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,881
You're a computer. I'm gonna
feed you data, and you analyze it.

660
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:19,033
What are you gonna feed me,

661
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,855
20 years of medical
knowledge, too?

662
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,191
It's not gonna work.

663
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,724
I know. But I don't
have anyone else to ask.

664
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,671
It's lonely, isn't it?

665
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,571
It's not that bad.

666
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,304
Then you're not that smart.

667
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,673
You ever try to kill yourself?

668
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,908
Not quickly.

669
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,006
I did.

670
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,780
Twelve years ago, I jumped off
the top of my eight-story building

671
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,754
into a dumpster bin
the day before pick-up.

672
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:55,783
I broke my collar bone,
my leg and three ribs.

673
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,688
When I was in the hospital,
they put me on narcotics

674
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,699
and suddenly
everything was just better.

675
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:06,127
I didn't feel
isolated or lonely.

676
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:08,897
That's where I met my wife.

677
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:13,935
She was so happy and dumb.

678
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,609
And I was

679
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,053
smart and miserable.

680
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,314
You tell me who the genius is.

681
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,850
I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head

682
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:33,262
and I knew I wanted
to stay that way forever.

683
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,800
Enjoy.

684
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,645
Easier on your
conscience if I die an idiot?

685
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,412
What's a conscience?

686
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:05,593
Which ribs did you break in
the fall? Down the left side?

687
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,998
Yeah, bottom three. But
that was 12 years ago.

688
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,336
This probably cost me my
marriage, so it better be awesome.

689
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,877
Ferrous oxide contrast?

690
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,004
It gets absorbed by the spleen,

691
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,639
unless he doesn't have one,

692
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,708
in which case it's absorbed
by the liver and fries that.

693
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:27,878
You're killing him?

694
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,997
You think I opened him up
and didn't take out his spleen?

695
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,514
All organs do look kind of
the same, red and squishy.

696
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,830
Oh, my God.

697
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,629
Accessory spleens.

698
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,932
Okay, that is amazing.

699
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,837
Twelve years, eight
stories and a dumpster ago,

700
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,205
he broke three ribs,
damaged his spleen.

701
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,904
Bits of it split off, circulated
through his blood stream

702
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,037
until they landed and
attached somewhere else.

703
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:58,083
So, it is TTP.

704
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:02,314
I just didn't remove
all of his spleens.

705
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,448
Sixteen splenectomies,

706
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,992
pretty sure he gets a set
of steak knives with that.

707
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,633
I can outrun you.

708
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,013
Sorry about the nose. And
the eye. And the eyebrow.

709
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,242
Guess I deserved it.

710
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:35,116
Well, if I thought that, I
wouldn't be apologizing.

711
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,519
Your fist slipped?

712
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,855
Everybody kept bugging
me, asking if I was okay.

713
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:45,461
So you bust my nose to
keep people off your back?

714
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,093
Pretty much.

715
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,966
Making people even
more worried about you.

716
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,529
Maybe. But at least they're
not talking to me about it.

717
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,404
Fair enough.

718
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,775
Cheers.

719
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,578
Thank you.

720
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,918
Don't be so grateful.

721
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,518
You'll be delivering packages
for 70 years to pay for it.

722
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:19,128
Well, thanks for our talk.

723
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:22,326
It's been a while since I had
a stimulating conversation.

724
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,511
So what are you going to do?

725
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,163
Go back to my life.

726
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,465
Which one?

727
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,039
The one that has my wife in it.

728
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,734
Robotripping.

729
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,573
How does she feel about that?

730
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,174
Well, she doesn't have to
know. It's worked for 12 years.

731
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,688
Tell your brain I said goodbye.

732
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,895
Einstein's giving
himself a lobotomy,

733
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,733
and you're cool with that?

734
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,770
Ignorance is bliss.

735
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,040
Hold that pose.

736
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:18,212
I'll start with t-shirts and
mugs and see how it goes.

737
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,955
Home early.

738
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,471
What happened to him?

739
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,908
You beat up House?

740
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,878
Just one right hook.

741
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,969
Why? What happened?

742
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,046
You were right.

743
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,414
I told him we need to lay down
some ground rules, it got a little heated.

744
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,478
That's not what I
meant. Is he okay?

745
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,353
Are you going to
be fired? Arrested?

746
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,153
Everything's fine.

747
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,323
Wow.

748
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,379
Dr. Cuddy.

749
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,913
Can we at least be civil?

750
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,718
How's your nose?

751
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,122
It's okay.

752
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,527
Does your kid like animals?

753
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,589
I got tickets to that
holiday carnival.

754
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,192
I hear they have
a nice petting zoo.

755
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,937
I think I was
pretty clear before.

756
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,768
I don't mean with me.

757
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,542
Here. Take them. Enjoy.

758
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,943
No, thanks.

759
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,650
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

760
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:56,085
One of the nurses was selling
them for her kid's scout troop.

761
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,698
I know it doesn't make
things right between us,

762
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,453
but I just wanted to
do something nice.

763
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,225
I don't want them.

764
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,361
Okay.

765
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,236
I'll see you tomorrow.

766
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,278
They didn't split up.

767
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,913
She wouldn't take the tickets.

768
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:31,413
Of course. Windtalker
code for "we never split up."

769
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,117
House, she told
you multiple times

770
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,750
she wants nothing
to do with you.

771
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,022
I wasn't gonna be there.

772
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:41,260
She just felt guilty that I felt
guilty, so she couldn't take them.

773
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,828
Either that or she didn't
want to appease you.

774
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,870
These weren't reparations,

775
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:50,033
just a simple gesture of
remorse, and she slapped it down.

776
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,943
They didn't break up.

777
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,412
She just wanted me to
think that, so I'd back off.

778
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,917
Dare I ask what you're gonna do?

779
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,583
Nothing.

780
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,721
I said they'd either break
up or they'd stay together.

781
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,727
They didn't break up.

782
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,255
And you're okay with that?

783
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,694
It is what it is.

784
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,362
Good for you.

785
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,311
House knows I lied.

786
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,714
Why? What did he say?

787
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,417
Nothing. I could just tell.

788
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,852
You gonna stage another breakup?

789
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,150
No.

790
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,616
Oh.

791
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,285
Hi.

792
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,763
It seems like he's
going to leave us alone.

793
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:47,321
Mmm. Why would he do that?

794
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,991
I'm not completely sure.

795
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:53,996
So, we have his blessing?

796
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,505
I guess so.

797
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,100
I made you some
eggplant Parmesan.

798
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,844
And maybe House
isn't so bad after all.

799
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,819
That would be nice, wouldn't it?
