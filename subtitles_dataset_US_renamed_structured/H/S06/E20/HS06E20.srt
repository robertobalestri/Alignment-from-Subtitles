1
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:15,815
Hey.

2
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,046
Hi!

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,543
Car's full of gas.

4
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,385
You sure?

5
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,420
And if I'm not?

6
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,223
You'll be paying me back
for those damn invitations.

7
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,456
Oh. Well, then never mind.

8
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,991
Ted is a wonderful man, Dad.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,228
He's the second
greatest guy I ever met.

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,231
Guess that's us.

11
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,366
Mmm-hmm.

12
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:14,905
Into this holy estate, these two
persons present now come to be joined.

13
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,501
And so, if any person
may show just cause

14
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,206
why they may not
be joined together,

15
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,874
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

16
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,913
That's what I like to hear.

17
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,321
Do you, Theodore Philip Taylor,

18
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,916
take Nicole Margaret
Murray to be your wife,

19
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,587
and promise before
God and these witnesses

20
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,653
to be her loving
and faithful husband,

21
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,260
in plenty and in want, in joy and
in sorrow, in sickness and in health,

22
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,703
so long as you both shall live?

23
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,847
This isn't funny, Ted. Ted?

24
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,849
Are you all right? Teddy?

25
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,854
Teddy! Ted.

26
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,007
Hey.

27
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,304
Hey.

28
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,177
What time is it?

29
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,681
Happy time.

30
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,050
I'm still asleep.

31
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,918
Just think of this as a dream.

32
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,257
What about House?

33
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,919
I said a dream, not a nightmare.

34
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,361
He's in the next room.

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,864
Sound asleep.

36
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,154
Esteban, hope
you're getting ready.

37
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,223
Hmm.

38
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,965
I met the neighbors.

39
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,169
Sir, do you know this man?

40
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:10,079
I don't need a temporary.
I need a permanent.

41
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,081
Yesterday.

42
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,522
Please do.

43
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,021
Good morning. Hardly.

44
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,958
One of my PAs quit an hour ago,

45
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,861
and I have to reshuffle
next month's schedule.

46
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,196
That's nothing. I woke up in
the wrong bed this morning.

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,463
Any bed you're in
is the wrong one.

48
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,197
That's not what your
mama said. Oh, snap.

49
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,011
I'll be going now.
To human resources.

50
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,174
He started it.

51
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,407
I was in the
neighbors' kid's bed.

52
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,545
Luckily, Esteban still
likes sleeping with Mommy.

53
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,953
How drunk were you?

54
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,820
About yay drunk.

55
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,694
Are you okay? You shouldn't
be drinking at all, much less...

56
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,731
You sound just
like Esteban's mom.

57
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,096
I need you in the clinic.

58
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,362
Sorry, I'm busy.

59
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,199
Tell me you have a case.
You know, even if you don't.

60
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,330
I have a case.

61
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,897
Sounds interesting.
I'll take it.

62
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,569
I owe you one. Now tell
me you don't have a case.

63
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,112
I really do have a case.

64
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,579
We're even.

65
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,484
You guys know how to honeymoon.

66
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,452
This is Dr. House.

67
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,680
Aphasia and syncope.

68
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,847
He can't speak.

69
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,914
"Aphasia" is Greek
for "loss of voice."

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,051
We've ruled out infection,
vocal cord damage and stroke.

71
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,256
A lot of guys
syncope at the altar.

72
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,855
It's Greek for
"having the vapors."

73
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,576
We ruled out all the
common causes of fainting,

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,764
low blood pressure,
hypoglycemia, dehydration.

75
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,267
Don't say "ah."

76
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,036
Do you know what it is?

77
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,014
Roll on your side
and lift up your gown.

78
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,210
There's one thing
they didn't test for.

79
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,278
A test for what?

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,352
Faking.

81
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,515
Ow!

82
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,184
Test was positive.

83
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,693
I can talk.

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,425
I wasn't faking. My voice
just came back right now.

85
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,961
Hey, I'm not the one
you have to convince.

86
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,628
I know he wasn't faking.

87
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,230
Boy, if she's buying that,
she might just be a keeper.

88
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,774
What about the syncope?

89
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,275
Well, that...

90
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,147
She buying this, too?

91
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,614
Why would he fake anything?

92
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,242
<i>Kryo podia.</i> It's
Greek for "duh."

93
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,556
So, you get to keep
the engagement ring.

94
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,719
I don't think he was faking.

95
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,423
That's because you're
more gullible than I am.

96
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,056
For instance, I don't believe

97
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,964
that you called off
your open marriage.

98
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,468
I believe your
wife called it off,

99
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,015
and you called off telling her
that you weren't calling it off.

100
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,133
Guy doesn't throw a
golden ticket in the trash.

101
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,386
Same way a guy doesn't give
up a lucrative medical practice

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,776
to come work for you?

103
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,905
That's exactly why you dabble.

104
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,314
You're compensating for your
professional conquests with sexual ones.

105
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,682
I'm not that predictable.

106
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,687
For example, you're
probably not expecting me

107
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,620
to ask you out
for dinner tonight.

108
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,123
No, thanks.

109
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,268
You won't even consider it?

110
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,316
I did, just very quickly.

111
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,895
Truth is, since I
called this thing off,

112
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,522
my wife has been very grateful,

113
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,430
and I could do
with a down night.

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,493
If I go out with the boss,
nobody can blame me.

115
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,333
Okay.

116
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,873
If you bring your wife.

117
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,217
No, that's the
point. I need a little...

118
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,334
You're lying.

119
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,707
I'm not lying!

120
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,040
Then I'm not going.

121
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,349
Okay. Fontina at 8:30.

122
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,615
You believe me, right?

123
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,819
Of course, I believe you.

124
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,327
Then let's do it.

125
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,920
We'll tell the cab to take us to
AC right now and get it done.

126
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,796
You're serious? You just walked
out of the emergency room.

127
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,631
Exactly, I walked
out. I feel great.

128
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,533
Well, we do have
the clothes for it.

129
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,046
Ted? What's wrong?

130
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,507
Are you... What's wrong?

131
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,050
Oh, my God. Can
somebody help us?

132
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,576
Please! Please, hurry.
Just breathe. Oh, my God.

133
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,215
There's gotta be a better
way to call off a wedding.

134
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,555
A tweet, for example.

135
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,424
Pleural effusion.

136
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,225
You think his lung is faking it?

137
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,896
There's at least 200
cc's of fluid in there.

138
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,562
Okay, let's say all
his symptoms are real.

139
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,247
Explain how one of
them suddenly went away

140
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,740
without using the
words "virgin" or "Mary."

141
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,367
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

142
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,275
it could explain his
other two symptoms.

143
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,779
So whether you
believe him or not,

144
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,373
all we have to figure out
is what caused the PE.

145
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,908
ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil
count ruled out parasites.

146
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,546
And medication he's
not telling us about.

147
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,148
You really don't
trust this guy, do you?

148
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,456
I don't even trust the ER.

149
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,257
Let's rule out
infections ourselves.

150
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,299
Tap his lung, send cultures,
run cytology for cancer,

151
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,129
and check his blood
pressure. We already...

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,760
This time, talk about
nuptials while you do it.

153
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,236
Check his home
for everything else.

154
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,364
He just moved in with his
fiancée three months ago.

155
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,410
Toxic exposure could take
longer than that to manifest.

156
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,706
You check his love nest.

157
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,112
You two check his
swinging bachelor pad.

158
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,911
That somebody else now lives in?

159
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,451
I assume so.

160
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,851
Not the glass!

161
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,188
Place looks like 1960s?

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,429
Could have lead paint.

163
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,970
You think a
27-year-old has pica?

164
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,974
If it gets us out of here before
the owner comes back, yes.

165
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,743
What did you tell
that cute physio?

166
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,645
That I changed my mind.

167
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,478
No, you didn't.

168
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,950
You're more nervous than usual.

169
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:49,456
Because this B&E has actual B.

170
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,684
What...

171
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,023
That's a suspended ceiling.

172
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,362
What are you doing?

173
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,990
I want to see what's above it.

174
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,659
More ceiling.

175
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,999
Made of 40-year-old
acoustic tile.

176
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,669
Asbestosis, I like
it. I'll be in the car.

177
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,672
What the hell?

178
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,012
It's okay. We're doctors.
Nobody was home, so we...

179
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,483
Well, I'm calling the police.

180
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,350
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

181
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,813
Yeah, what about him?

182
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,858
He's our patient at
Princeton-Plainsboro.

183
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,948
Is he okay?

184
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,204
We think he may have
asbestosis from your ceiling tiles.

185
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,164
They're not asbestos. I had
them checked when I moved in.

186
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,290
How sick is he?

187
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,424
Is he a friend of yours?

188
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,025
He was.

189
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,265
Actually, he was my
boyfriend for three years.

190
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,038
I'm not gay. HOUSE: Really?

191
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,911
'Cause it would certainly
explain the cold feet.

192
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,006
Oh, and the boyfriend.

193
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,915
So you're bisexual?

194
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,578
No, I'm straight.

195
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,054
Cotter, the guy
you met, he's gay.

196
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,148
He had a crush on me. I left.

197
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,283
After three years?

198
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,486
It's possible.

199
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,905
Doesn't mean you're gay just
because the guy you're sleeping with is.

200
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,295
We weren't sleeping together...

201
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,708
What's this got to
do with anything?

202
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,633
Lung tap turned
up mononucleosis.

203
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,532
ER doesn't
routinely test for it.

204
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,401
It explains the PE and can
be virtually asymptomatic.

205
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,067
We got to wondering, how
does a 27-year-old get mono?

206
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,372
You're a little old for
the kissing disease

207
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,503
unless your immune
system is compromised.

208
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,138
If there's been any
unprotected sex,

209
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,546
we'll need to test for HIV.

210
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,584
There's been no sex of any kind.

211
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,778
Okay.

212
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,290
I'll go test your fiancée for
HIV. She the curious sort?

213
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,157
Wait.

214
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,888
There may have been
some contact. But I'm not gay.

215
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,766
Sodomy, one of the top 10 most
common household accidents.

216
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,532
I did a lot of stupid things,
but I turned my life around.

217
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,971
I'm as straight as any of you.

218
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,351
You don't have to believe me.

219
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,606
I'm just saying

220
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:55,581
you can test me as long
as you don't tell Nicole.

221
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,214
What business is it of hers?

222
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,397
I don't see anything wrong with
him marrying a straight woman.

223
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,686
How about it'll make
them both miserable?

224
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,452
Just like most
straight marriages.

225
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:09,792
He's got the right to life, liberty
and unhappiness like the rest of us.

226
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,592
Absolutely no
reason to look at me.

227
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,008
I'm not saying
it's a great choice.

228
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,591
Just saying it's his choice.

229
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,727
But it has to be hers
as well, which it can't be

230
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,465
as long as she
doesn't know he's gay.

231
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,733
Which is how it's gonna stay

232
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,166
since we have
no right to tell her.

233
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,675
Like you've never
bent the rules.

234
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,507
You date guys. You date girls.

235
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,672
I assume, at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

236
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,511
I don't lie about who I am.

237
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,060
Patients lying never
bothered you before.

238
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,815
Patients weren't lying about
their sexual orientation before.

239
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,287
So you're only judgmental
when it gets personal?

240
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,416
Does it bother me
that people hurt others

241
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,102
because they're too
weak to face the truth?

242
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,754
Yeah. Sorry about that.

243
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,354
Tell me she's not looking at me.

244
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,130
He's negative? Yep.

245
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,334
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

246
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,144
So maybe being straight did.

247
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,840
Test was negative, no HIV.

248
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,110
Told you.

249
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,179
What you didn't tell us is how
you turned your life around.

250
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,052
That can be pretty hard. It was.

251
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,058
Downright impossible
on your own.

252
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,889
I talked to some people.

253
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,826
It was more than
just talk, wasn't it?

254
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,500
I know this is personal stuff.

255
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,002
I'm here to help
you, not out you.

256
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,201
I had therapy.

257
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,006
Conversion therapy.

258
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,207
Went to a camp for three
weeks of intensive rehabilitation.

259
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,877
They injected him with emetics
while he watched gay porn.

260
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,044
Apomorphine?

261
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,453
Or lithium chloride, or
cyclophosphamide. He doesn't know.

262
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,118
And when that didn't work, they
shot him up with male hormones.

263
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,354
A chemical assault like
that could explain the PE.

264
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,693
And the ECT explains the rest.

265
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,562
They gave him electroconvulsive
therapy to make him straight?

266
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,625
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

267
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,212
Neural damage
accounts for the aphasia.

268
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,296
ECT doesn't cause neural damage.

269
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:04,037
Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's
He-man Quackery Camp.

270
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,514
Run an EEG. See if they
straightened him or just scrambled him.

271
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,426
Sorry, I completely forgot.

272
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,023
My wife just started a
ceramics class Tuesdays at 8:00.

273
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,761
It's a half-hour
drive from here.

274
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,393
She won't be back till 10:30.

275
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,631
She's taking it with
her girlfriend, Marly.

276
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,006
She hopes to make a tea service.

277
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,376
You want to call her?

278
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,709
No need.

279
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,977
I already texted her.

280
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,019
And here she is now.

281
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,549
I think you're still
seeing the physio.

282
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,456
You got a backup
suit in your car.

283
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,689
Don't wanna be
bringing home da stank.

284
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,640
Okay, yes. You're
right. About everything.

285
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,360
But please,
House, don't tell her.

286
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,457
Hi, Rachel.

287
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,503
Hi, Dr. House. I didn't
know you'd be here.

288
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,368
Hi, honey. Got
your text, obviously.

289
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm just leaving. I
got a ceramics class.

290
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,041
Really? I love it.

291
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,637
Even managed to talk
Chris into signing up for one.

292
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,683
Of course, he's in
the beginners' class.

293
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,445
You're in a ceramics class?

294
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,781
Friday nights, right?

295
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,280
Friday nights. Sounded like fun.

296
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,382
You should join Chris's.

297
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,018
You know, I should.

298
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,563
Well, gotta go.

299
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,622
Making a tea service.

300
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,701
Hi. I must've fallen
asleep in the lounge.

301
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,803
- What are they doing?
- An EEG.

302
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,780
What's it for?

303
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,288
We're looking for
neurological damage

304
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,682
that could've caused
his symptoms.

305
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,617
Damage from what?

306
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,018
A head trauma.

307
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,885
He had an accident?

308
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,017
It wasn't an accident. It
was before he met you.

309
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,493
What happened?
Was he hospitalized?

310
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,097
You should ask him about it.

311
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,859
They have the results.

312
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,905
Everything looks normal.

313
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,071
Look at this.

314
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,580
Beta waves are spiking.

315
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,775
What's that mean?

316
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,909
I'm not sure.

317
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,224
He's coding! Crash cart!

318
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,382
What's happening to him?

319
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,582
He's having a heart attack.

320
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,522
Charging. Clear.

321
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,425
EKG showed no abnormalities.

322
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,935
So what caused the arrest?

323
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,130
Four ways to stop a heart.

324
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,005
Electrical problems, restricted
blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be.

325
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,737
Shocks, blocks or bleeds.

326
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,142
I think that's three things.

327
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,736
And cheating.

328
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,614
No, sorry, that's how
you break a heart.

329
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,981
I found a ceramics class in
Trenton on Friday nights that was full,

330
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,752
so my wife couldn't join me.

331
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,522
EP study ruled out shocks.

332
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,793
Now you just have to
find some Pottery by Taub.

333
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,424
The lamer it looks, the better.

334
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,799
So we'll do an angio to
see if it's blocks or bleeds.

335
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,893
You should be a doctor.

336
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,008
I'm going to check out
this new lesbian bar tonight.

337
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,744
Your life is awesome.

338
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,944
You wanna come?

339
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,866
I was telling a 33-year-old
woman that she has breast cancer.

340
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,732
No, you weren't.

341
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,361
How do you know?
Because if you were,

342
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,133
you'd need to see
the pain in her eyes

343
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,798
so she can see the
concern in yours.

344
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:58,038
Why are you setting me
up on dates with my team?

345
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,510
Taub asking me out was quirky,

346
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,605
but Thirteen doing
it is a barking cat.

347
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,842
I'm doing it to help you.

348
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,408
By setting me up with a
hottie that I can't sleep with?

349
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,485
And Thirteen?

350
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,419
I've been spending
more time with Sam.

351
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,649
I know it's been hard on you.

352
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,000
I figured if you had
some company...

353
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,185
I don't need your help.

354
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,195
Then consider it helping
our neighbor's four-year-old.

355
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,197
I gave him a dollar.

356
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,341
How much did you have to pay?

357
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,365
Nothing.

358
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,197
I just told them you
might be feeling down,

359
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,033
and it was in their self-interest
to keep you company.

360
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,600
A hundred bucks.
Foreman held out for 200.

361
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,871
House, I'm worried about you.

362
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,675
You could've ended
up in jail or worse.

363
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,875
Racking you with guilt.

364
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,544
So I do something really
stupid, and you reward me.

365
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,317
Read any parenting manual. That's
not helping me. That's helping you.

366
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,888
Fine, I did it for me, for my
relationship, out of pure self-interest.

367
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,191
Okay.

368
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,458
You'll do it?

369
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,625
For you.

370
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,802
Thank you.

371
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,896
It's not gonna work, though.

372
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,000
Maybe. But how bad can a
night out at a lesbian bar be?

373
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,350
Hey.

374
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,945
How are you doing?

375
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,991
Heart attack at 27.

376
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,122
They said you had a head trauma?

377
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:29,527
I fell off a stepladder and hit
my head. It was a stupid accident.

378
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,633
An accident.

379
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,605
We need to prep
you for your angio.

380
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,167
Valium will help you relax.

381
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,544
We're gonna run a line
through your femoral artery.

382
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,711
Ted? He's having
another heart attack?

383
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,775
I don't think so. His
heart rate seems normal.

384
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,446
Mmm.

385
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,252
Are you okay?

386
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,163
You weren't discussing
wedding plans, were you?

387
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,991
No. I guess I just...

388
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,329
Fainted.

389
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,770
POTS. Postural Orthostatic
Tachycardia Syndrome.

390
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,238
BP plummets when he's upright,

391
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,207
reverts to normal
when he's lying down.

392
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,475
He was lying down both times
we took his blood pressure.

393
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,864
Protracted hypotension could
have induced his heart attack.

394
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,040
Also explains his syncope.

395
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,173
And his aphasia.

396
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,979
He was upright, then you laid
him down on the bed to test him.

397
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,883
BP reverted to normal,
voice came back.

398
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,664
Jabbing him with the needle
had nothing to do with it.

399
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,817
POTS can be brought on by viral
or bacterial infection such as mono.

400
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,725
So load him up
with fludrocortisone.

401
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,457
You didn't read your ceramics
course description, did you?

402
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,499
Yeah. You did?

403
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,829
As I'm sure your wife did.

404
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,369
So we all know they're
doing a Fourth of July theme.

405
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,463
She'll be expecting
something star-spangled.

406
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,638
Nicole?

407
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,838
Yes.

408
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,548
Cotter Macklin. I'm
an old friend of Ted's.

409
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,777
Hi.

410
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,852
How's he doing?

411
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,048
He had a heart attack.

412
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,758
Oh, my God.

413
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:07,424
They have him on some new
meds, really knocked him out.

414
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,492
Well, how are you holding up?

415
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,197
I'm okay. Thanks.

416
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,068
I brought this for him.

417
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,339
That's his favorite
thing in the whole world.

418
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,478
I know.

419
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,680
You weren't at the
wedding, were you?

420
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,524
No, I wasn't invited. Ted
and I had a falling out.

421
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,525
How did you know each other?

422
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,067
We met senior year of college.

423
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,296
Yeah, we shared
a house for a while.

424
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,838
You were roommates.

425
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,305
For three years.

426
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,222
I'm sorry. I just miss him.

427
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,726
I think you should leave.

428
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,123
I shouldn't have done that. Now.

429
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,392
Please?

430
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,566
I hope he gets better.

431
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,520
Hey. How are you feeling?

432
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,822
Mmm. Don't know yet.

433
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:47,025
Your numbers look good. We're
gonna keep you on these meds.

434
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,077
You had a visitor
while you were asleep.

435
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,486
Oh, yeah? Who?

436
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,690
Cotter. Who is he?

437
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,421
I shared a house
with him after college.

438
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,363
I don't know why
he would show up.

439
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,531
That's it? Yeah.

440
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,295
Why? What did he say?

441
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,110
I need to hear it from you, Ted.

442
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,135
One night, I got really
drunk and I went to bed.

443
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,466
And he came into my room,

444
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,472
and one thing led to another.

445
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,779
The whole thing was a mistake.

446
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,717
Are you saying you
had sex with him?

447
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,685
I was drunk and confused...

448
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,883
You're gay?

449
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,982
No.

450
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,131
I thought I was.

451
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,095
I even made up my
mind to tell my family.

452
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,964
I stood in front of the bathroom
mirror, psyching myself up.

453
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,167
But all I could see was disgust.

454
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,177
And that's when I realized

455
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:47,179
I didn't hate the thought of admitting
I was gay because I was ashamed.

456
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,984
I hated the thought
because I wasn't gay.

457
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,383
And that was the
day I went to get help.

458
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,230
So you're not gay?

459
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,223
They cured me, Nicole.

460
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,460
That's what all the
head trauma is about.

461
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:08,473
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but it's all in the past now.

462
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,905
It doesn't matter anymore.

463
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:18,783
What is it?

464
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,322
Oh, my head!

465
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,058
He's got severe headaches.

466
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,493
So do I.

467
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,594
Should I call or raise with
a double gutshot draw?

468
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,863
Nope. What about infection?

469
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,017
That's what we're thinking.

470
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,940
Cerebral infection would explain the
headaches, could've caused POTS.

471
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,619
If it's fungal, could've
spread to the heart.

472
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,942
I was talking about you.

473
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,243
Has the little gent
been wearing a tent?

474
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,913
Remind me why that has
anything to do with you.

475
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,249
A distracted person makes
a distracted professional.

476
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:58,017
And destroying my
marriage will help me focus.

477
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,524
Probably.

478
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,353
Do a spinal tap, run the CSF.

479
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,055
Still talking about you!

480
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,396
But you can do it on the
patient, too, if you want.

481
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,247
What about her?

482
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,481
The bartender?

483
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,490
She's the only one
who's not here for fun.

484
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,150
Trust me, she's not straight.

485
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,320
If your gaydar is so great,

486
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,873
how come you didn't know about
the patient till you met his boyfriend?

487
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,661
Guy walked in with his bride,

488
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,224
it took me awhile
to rotate my dish.

489
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,629
It's unbelievable
what he's doing to her.

490
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,900
You don't think he loves her?

491
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,103
He may love her, but he needs
to have sex with other men.

492
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,738
Taub loves his wife, he needs
to have sex with other women.

493
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,113
Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to
her, too, but it's hardly the same.

494
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,310
To be faithful to his wife,

495
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,250
our patient has to
deny his identity.

496
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,549
Taub just needs to...

497
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,385
Has to resist the
biological imperative.

498
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,516
It is easier to
say no to dessert

499
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,821
than to pretend you don't eat.

500
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,952
Says someone who's
obviously never been on a diet.

501
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,656
My life's a breeze.

502
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:18,430
You're successful, smart, and
you attract everything that moves.

503
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,614
If you wanna focus on the fact

504
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,834
that you're not gonna
see 50, that's your choice.

505
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,841
You know what? I agree with you.

506
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,743
My self-pity's optional.
What about yours?

507
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,944
Yeah.

508
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,081
CSF was negative for infection,

509
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,265
and his headaches are worse.

510
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,655
We were just talking about you.

511
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,192
Please don't.

512
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,157
It's not POTS, we're
back to square one.

513
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,958
Not quite.

514
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,963
You did a spinal tap and
the headaches got worse.

515
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,404
We're maxing him
out on morphine.

516
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,307
He sprung a leak. He's
losing CSF from the tap site.

517
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,868
We made his headaches worse?

518
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,811
<i>Just you, actually.</i>

519
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,293
That still wouldn't explain why he
got the headaches in the first place.

520
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:09,015
Low pressure in his brain caused
the POTS, not the other way around.

521
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,057
Patch the leak, top him
up with artificial CSF.

522
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,968
There. That should
stop the leak.

523
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,562
You should be feeling
some relief soon.

524
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,902
I spoke to my parents.

525
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,677
How are they doing?

526
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,079
They're still worried.

527
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,413
Well, tell them not to be.

528
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,586
Everything's going to be okay.

529
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,758
Ted?

530
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:48,859
What's happening?

531
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:49,986
He's stroking.

532
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,891
Both eyes are responsive.

533
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,125
Tell me your full name.

534
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,258
Theodore Philip Taylor.

535
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,393
This isn't a stroke.
Then what is it?

536
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,038
What's happening to me?

537
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,710
It's really not POTS, we're
really back to square one.

538
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,681
So what's masquerading
as a stroke?

539
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,419
Voted the worst Halloween
costume, by the way.

540
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,788
MRI showed no problems
with blood flow to the brain,

541
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,088
rules out TIA.

542
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,822
Sarcoidosis?

543
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,091
Chest X-rays showed
no hilar masses.

544
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,123
Any luck with the pottery?

545
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,361
Wasn't easy.

546
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,598
Bought a suitably cruddy set of
fife and drum napkin rings online.

547
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,763
Scleroderma?

548
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,206
Skin's fine, ANA was negative.

549
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,800
So what'd that set
you back? Too much.

550
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,310
I got into a bidding
war with some lunatic.

551
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,436
Histoplasmosis.

552
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,913
EIA was clear.

553
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,082
But, hey, could've gone
a lot higher than $215.

554
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,951
You're KissMyAsthma99?

555
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,617
What about MELAS?

556
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,488
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy,

557
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,494
lactic acidosis and
stroke-like episodes.

558
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,063
NILLAS.

559
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:04,134
No, idiot, lactate levels are
stable. We're missing something.

560
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,647
We've run every test
that makes sense,

561
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,981
asked every question
we can think of,

562
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,564
gone over his
history a dozen times.

563
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,280
We know how much
we can trust his history.

564
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,971
If history's written
by the victor,

565
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,071
how do we find out
what really happened?

566
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,139
Talk to the loser.
Call the boyfriend.

567
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,459
Let's get them all
in the same room.

568
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,816
Or we could question them
separately and not torture them.

569
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,048
Or we could get them all in
the same room and get the truth.

570
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:29,987
Oh.

571
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,137
Drinks are on me
and Foreman tonight.

572
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,531
Can't. Pap smear.

573
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,710
We don't want to do it either,

574
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:36,929
but Wilson already paid us.

575
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,163
It's going to suck.

576
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,329
I know.

577
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,869
Where and when?

578
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,338
Any incidents of dizziness?

579
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,313
Seizures?

580
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,412
Blackouts?

581
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,115
Other than our wedding day.

582
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,544
Don't you think I would've
told you if there were?

583
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,020
My sister's birthday.

584
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,318
I was drunk.

585
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,083
You had one martini.

586
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,217
On an empty stomach.

587
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,954
Look, he was just
sitting on the couch,

588
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,463
and then he fell
over and that was it.

589
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,466
Once I slept it off, I was fine.

590
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,161
Well, I stayed up that night,

591
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,466
checking on him
every 15 minutes.

592
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,005
What about sex?

593
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,469
Yes, I have sex with my
girlfriend because I'm not gay.

594
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,070
We have sex.

595
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,169
Thank you.

596
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,882
No problems?

597
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,010
Well, there have
been some issues.

598
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,521
Nic...

599
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,648
Erectile dysfunction?

600
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,420
Every guy has it sometimes.

601
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,865
We never had that problem.

602
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,369
Gee, that must be because
Ted doesn't like girls.

603
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,675
Or because it's vascular.

604
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,602
I know we did an MRA, but arterial
disease causing acute ischemia

605
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:52,576
could explain the heart, neuro
symptoms, maybe even POTS.

606
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,842
Might I suggest
a diagnostic test?

607
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,245
A penile plethysmograph measures
changes in blood flow in your penis,

608
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:05,017
tells us if there's a
circulatory problem.

609
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,117
You just need to
be in the right state.

610
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,218
What's your pleasure?

611
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,857
I feel terrible, I don't think
anything's gonna work.

612
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,366
Then we'll have
to give you a shot.

613
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,733
Where you don't want to get one.

614
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,437
Shot it is.

615
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,110
<i>He kept dreaming</i>

616
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,545
<i>Dreaming</i>

617
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,447
<i>That someday he'd be a star</i>

618
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,882
<i>Superstar, but he didn't get far</i>

619
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,054
<i>But he sure found
out the hard way</i>

620
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,922
<i>That dreams don't
always come true</i>

621
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,069
<i>Dreams don't always come true</i>

622
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,117
<i>Oh, no</i>

623
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,593
<i>No No</i>

624
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,132
<i>He's leaving</i>

625
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,531
<i>Leaving</i>

626
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,434
<i>On that midnight
train to Georgia</i>

627
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,029
<i>Leaving on a midnight train</i>

628
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,767
<i>Yeah, said he's
going back to find</i>

629
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,608
<i>Going back to find</i>

630
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,443
<i>A simpler place and time</i>

631
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,073
<i>Whenever he takes that ride</i>

632
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,618
<i>Guess who's gonna
be right by his side</i>

633
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,617
<i>I'm gonna be with him</i>

634
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,622
<i>I know you will</i>

635
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,318
<i>On a midnight train to Georgia</i>

636
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,486
<i>Leaving on a midnight
train to Georgia</i>

637
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,194
<i>I'd rather live in his world</i>

638
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,289
<i>Live in his world</i>

639
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,995
<i>Than live without him in mine</i>

640
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,503
<i>World His world</i>

641
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,004
<i>His tears My world</i>

642
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,041
<i>His and hers alone</i>

643
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,305
<i>I've got to go, I've
got to go, I've got to go</i>

644
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,142
<i>His and hers alone</i>

645
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,141
Nobody wants to follow that.

646
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,119
The night just
keeps getting better.

647
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,246
To Wilson.

648
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,119
Wilson. Wilson.

649
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,720
Everything looks fine.

650
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,055
You sure?

651
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,729
Medically, that's good news.

652
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,460
You feeling
feverish or sweating?

653
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,198
No, I feel lousy, but I don't
know why I'm sweating.

654
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,367
What is it?

655
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,842
You're not sweating.

656
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,147
You're lactating.

657
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,686
If he can't tell his
fiancée he's gay,

658
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,486
how's he going to
tell her he's pregnant?

659
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,491
His therapists loaded
him with hormones.

660
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,626
Male hormones don't
make you lactate.

661
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,530
Except they can
screw up your thyroid.

662
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,844
That was over three months ago,

663
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,427
we just started
milking him last night.

664
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,439
So something else screwed up
his thyroid. Graves', Hashimoto's...

665
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,839
No. TSH was normal.

666
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:44,448
Pituitary tumor. Could also
explain his libido and heart issues.

667
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,777
And if the tumor's big enough,
his headaches and syncope.

668
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,088
Except we cleared
him for cancer.

669
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,628
Didn't say "cancer,"
prolactinomas can be benign.

670
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,933
Check his prolactin
level and MRI his pituitary.

671
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,781
Sounds like you
had fun last night.

672
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,352
You believe Chase?

673
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,251
I believe Foreman.

674
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,485
And they had fun with
you. What happened?

675
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,621
I realized that they
could be my friends.

676
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,533
You're serious.

677
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,969
And then I sobered up.

678
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,539
You weren't that drunk.

679
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,599
You managed to find your way
into your own little bed last night.

680
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,475
I think I sleep better
in rocket-ship sheets.

681
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,571
No. You want to
blame this on the booze,

682
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,810
but that's easy. Change is hard.

683
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,544
And wisdom is
knowing the difference

684
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,281
between what you can change...

685
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,094
And what you were born with.

686
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,360
And cowardice is labeling what
you don't wanna change as innate.

687
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,958
I was winning this argument.

688
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,232
Pituitary MRI...

689
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,535
Was normal.

690
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,536
How are the headaches?

691
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,842
Terrible.

692
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,077
Give me your head.

693
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,277
What the hell?

694
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,561
I know, it's the
first time you heard

695
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,486
that sentence with a
possessive pronoun.

696
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,463
Oh, wow, that's better.

697
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,429
Okay. Enough.

698
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,940
How cool is that?

699
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,600
You have a Chiari Malformation,

700
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,546
a narrowing in the base of your
skull that can cut off CSF flow.

701
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,413
But it wasn't a problem until
the ECT at Breeder Boot Camp

702
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,510
caused your brain to swell
just enough to plug the opening.

703
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,954
And when your brain pressed
up against your pituitary,

704
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,890
it signed you up for
La Leche League.

705
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,004
You still won't be pitching
a tent for your lady,

706
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,521
but that's just because,
you know, she's a lady.

707
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,692
Its orthostatic effect
was mimicking POTS.

708
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,293
It also does an uncanny
Christopher Walken.

709
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,570
Unfortunately, if you treat
it like POTS, it gets worse.

710
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,575
So, as far as that goes, oops.

711
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,121
Proper treatment is surgery.
We'll get you in right away.

712
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,444
So, how did I get this thing?

713
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,709
Overbearing mother.

714
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,350
Kidding, CM's congenital.

715
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,253
Like so many other things,
you were born that way.

716
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,134
Thought you might
be running low, so...

717
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,301
Thanks.

718
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,880
I'm not coming back.

719
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,147
Ted, this is a mistake.

720
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,051
I know you're
hurting, and I'm sorry...

721
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,750
I'm talking about hurting her.

722
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,019
I love her.

723
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,517
Ted...

724
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,564
Thank you for your support.

725
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,493
We both really appreciate it.

726
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:27,862
Good luck.

727
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,855
Hey.

728
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,167
You know what
I've been thinking?

729
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,467
It's your birthday
in three weeks.

730
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,136
What do you say we re-book the
church and make it a doubleheader?

731
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,542
I don't know, Ted.

732
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:14,849
Less than a week ago, we were
standing at the altar perfectly happy.

733
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,911
Nothing's changed.

734
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,081
Really?

735
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,022
I still love you.

736
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,417
Do you still love me?

737
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,157
Yes, but...

738
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,861
Then that's all that matters.

739
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,100
But I think that
you still love him.

740
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:42,876
I'm not gay, Nicole.
I promise you.

741
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,379
How can you promise me that?

742
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:51,184
Because I believe that we get
to choose how we live our lives.

743
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,384
And I've made my choice.

744
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,792
So now, I have to make mine.

745
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,732
I'm so sorry.

746
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,891
Nic...

747
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,025
I'm sorry.

748
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,434
Nic!

749
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,564
No. No.

750
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,071
I'm not saying goodbye.

751
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,374
Yeah.

752
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,250
I want to marry you!
I have to marry you!

753
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,023
Nic.

754
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,929
It's Friday night.

755
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,999
I called it off.

756
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,698
For real this time.

757
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,673
Frees you up for the next one.

758
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,109
One day at a time.

759
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,339
Napkin rings.

760
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,775
My way of saying thanks.

761
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,376
For trying to wreck
your marriage?

762
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,319
For trying to save it.

763
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,414
And I get napkin rings.

764
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,959
Expensive ones.

765
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,440
I hired a replacement for my PA.

766
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,007
She seems great.

767
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,973
Good work.

768
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,416
You, too.

769
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,852
Your patient's going
home tomorrow.

770
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,822
He doesn't have a home.

771
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,161
You want to grab a bite to eat?

772
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,598
So Wilson got to you, too.

773
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,033
No, this is just me.

774
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,126
Lucas?

775
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,296
Working late.

776
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,303
I'm buying.

777
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,577
Not that hungry.

778
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,446
Okay.

779
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,983
I just want us to be friends.

780
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,795
Funny.

781
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,801
That's the last
thing I want us to be.
