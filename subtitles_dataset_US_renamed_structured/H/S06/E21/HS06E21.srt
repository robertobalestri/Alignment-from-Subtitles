1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,052
Okay, therafy me.

2
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,962
You're late.

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,196
You're fat.

4
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,201
It's unusual.

5
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,712
You know how far the parking
lot is? My leg's been hurting.

6
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,213
Anything been on your mind
lately? Any particular stress?

7
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,910
Nope. Probably just gonna rain.

8
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,007
Hmm.

9
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,452
You like the new Monet
reproduction in the waiting room?

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,353
The <i>Water Lilies?</i>

11
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,621
I was late. I wasn't
focusing on the decor,

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,891
but it sounds appropriately
bland and calming.

13
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:06,263
Stress can also make
you absent-minded.

14
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,234
I'm not stressed.

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,270
Beyond the stress induced by
you telling me how stressed I am.

16
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,032
Just an ordinary week.

17
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,938
Okay.

18
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,742
Tell me about it.

19
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,449
<i>I had a patient...</i>

20
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,922
House?

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,459
Good, I have a case for you.

22
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,052
Beer?

23
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,289
Amnesia.

24
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,098
She was found jogging
in the street, disoriented.

25
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,226
She almost got hit by a truck.

26
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,497
The MRI showed no abnormalities.

27
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,097
No ID on her, just her jogging
clothes and her heart rate monitor.

28
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,439
We know absolutely
nothing about her.

29
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,205
We know she has money.

30
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,179
Blaze Outriggers,
400 bucks a pair.

31
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,349
People who have money
don't just disappear.

32
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,079
Sooner or later, someone is
gonna show up looking for her.

33
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,279
Can I have something to eat?

34
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,880
She just ate 15 minutes ago.

35
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,049
She keeps forgetting.

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,424
You don't eat because you
remember it's time to eat,

37
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,694
you eat because you're hungry.

38
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,890
Her metabolism is in high gear.

39
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,593
She is an extreme
long-distance runner who...

40
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,693
<i>Why were you in the ER?</i>

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,631
That's your question?

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,132
You're a psychotherapist, you're
hearing about a great amnesia case,

43
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,905
and all you're asking
me is geography?

44
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,843
Just curious.

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,042
I was avoiding Wilson.

46
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,216
It's not something you couldn't
have seen eight miles away.

47
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,756
<i>Wilson's a processor.</i>

48
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,695
<i>I knew there were some things
that he'd want to process with me.</i>

49
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,164
<i>At length.</i>

50
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,928
Sam's moving in.

51
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,666
If it's before Friday, your
assistant wins the pool.

52
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,174
I was just wondering
what your plans were.

53
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,210
Tonight? In life.

54
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,709
Sam likes you...

55
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,113
But she wants me to move out.

56
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,445
No.

57
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,877
I want you to move out.

58
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,614
I didn't know things with
Sam would happen so quickly.

59
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,388
I didn't... I don't want
to make a mistake here.

60
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,587
I've made a lot of mistakes.

61
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,254
By moving too quickly.

62
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,797
Given your usual
rate of commitment,

63
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,060
I'm surprised you're
not already re-divorced.

64
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,933
I could help you find a place.

65
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,114
What's wrong with my old place?

66
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:30,008
Nothing. I just thought you
might want to find somewhere new.

67
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,568
Somewhere...

68
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,778
Where I didn't abuse
drugs and hallucinate?

69
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,477
Yes.

70
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,309
I'm fine.

71
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,386
<i>You're fine?</i>

72
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,653
Your best friend is tossing
you out, and you're fine?

73
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,288
Why wouldn't I be?

74
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,633
You're not feeling a
little betrayed and angry?

75
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,669
Wilson bought a
two-bedroom condo

76
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,317
specifically so that you
could move in with him.

77
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,207
It wasn't that long ago.

78
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,277
You don't feel a
little jerked around?

79
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,611
He couldn't foresee Sam
coming back into his life.

80
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,016
That's a very rational
defense of your friend,

81
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,385
and I'm not buying it.

82
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,616
Based on what?

83
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,988
Based on the fact
that you were late,

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,203
and you didn't notice the
pictures in the outer office.

85
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,388
Those aren't symptoms.

86
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,555
They are to me.

87
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,758
And here's another one,
you took the case. Hmm.

88
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,461
No negotiating. No bargaining.

89
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,835
No clinic hours changed hands.

90
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,415
Were you looking for
something to distract you

91
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,599
from the fact that your best
friend just threw you out?

92
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,405
The case was interesting.

93
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,504
It's not organic,
it's not mysterious.

94
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,744
Most likely some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

95
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,218
that made the patient's brain
choose to forget everything.

96
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,380
Or not.

97
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,351
Here.

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,058
Loss of differentiation
between gray and white matter.

99
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,390
It's subtle.

100
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,072
But it's in the area
that controls memory.

101
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,031
Not likely it's a coincidence.

102
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,033
Bacterial infection?

103
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,498
Do I need to know this?

104
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,924
Fine, I'll give you the
Cliff Notes version.

105
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,134
Chase, MS. Taub,
physical trauma.

106
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,870
I could tell you why
we ruled them out.

107
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,309
Or not.

108
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,711
It's probably a toxin, and we
need to find it before it kills her.

109
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,011
We should search her house.

110
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,278
Good luck with that.

111
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,820
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

112
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,516
The distributor can match the
number to the store that sold it.

113
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,854
She's a serious athlete.

114
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,970
She might have been there
often enough to be remembered.

115
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,087
Brilliant.

116
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,790
Did he really say that?

117
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,991
Subtextually.

118
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,131
Long shot.

119
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,794
Even if the store clerk
does know who she is,

120
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,446
the store's probably
close to where she lives.

121
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,415
Just seeing those surroundings
might spark a memory.

122
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,805
You want us to take her there?

123
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,172
No.

124
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,166
I'll take her.

125
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,039
Really?

126
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,714
It's unusual for you to spend
time with a patient, isn't it?

127
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,684
Patients are boring, as people.

128
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,310
This one, I'm sure,
was no exception,

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,221
but her situation
was interesting.

130
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,623
Besides, I was still
avoiding Wilson,

131
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,957
and no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

132
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,328
Maybe. Or were you
avoiding going home?

133
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,233
There's a reason
they tell addicts

134
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,700
to stay away from old geography.

135
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,294
I wasn't avoiding going
home. I'd already gone home,

136
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,207
<i>before I came in
to work that day.</i>

137
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,175
<i>I went straight
there from Wilson's.</i>

138
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,558
Hey! Take it easy.
You're gonna kill me.

139
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,107
God, why don't people knock...

140
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,642
House, it's you! Where
you been? Hold up a second.

141
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,319
Alvie?

142
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,353
Juan Alvarez? You let
him stay at your place?

143
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,550
Not exactly.

144
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,305
I was beginning to wonder if
you were ever gonna show up.

145
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,097
Why are you here?

146
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,698
When I left Mayfield, I went
back to the old neighborhood.

147
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,920
You know, you shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

148
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,880
Yeah, thanks for the safety
lesson. Why are you here?

149
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,457
Like I said, when I went
back to the neighborhood,

150
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,161
I found out Immigration
was looking for me.

151
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,845
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House.

152
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,684
And turn his apartment
into a giant prison jumpsuit.

153
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,053
Juan Alvarez is no freeloader.

154
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,716
I do my part, earn my keep.

155
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,125
The first week, I made you
dinner, but you never showed up.

156
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,924
The second week, I
organized your stuff.

157
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,130
My stuff?

158
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,342
But still, you never showed up.

159
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,844
So this week, since I'm a real
good painter, I decided to feng shui...

160
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,099
Coffee table.
Where'd you put it?

161
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
In the bedroom?

162
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,737
The paint's not cheap,
House. It's a custom color.

163
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,575
It's a mix of titanium
yellow and ochre.

164
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,923
Ochre. I don't
even like that stuff.

165
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,458
It's like a fruit,
it's got hair on it,

166
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,559
but they say it's a vegetable...

167
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,247
You sold my table to pay
for paint that I don't want?

168
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,120
I had to sell some
other things, too.

169
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,420
Get out.

170
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,090
No, papa, just give
the color a chance.

171
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,532
Look, I'm going to work now.

172
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,331
And when I come
back, the walls will be

173
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,429
a less exciting color,
and you will be gone.

174
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:33,337
So Wilson threw you out, and you
threw Alvie out. Just another week?

175
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,143
But unlike me,
Alvie didn't leave.

176
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,013
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

177
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,348
When I went home to get my car,

178
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,786
he was painting
the ceiling magenta.

179
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,854
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

180
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,585
Why?

181
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,423
To protect the apartment.

182
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,824
Whoa, déjà vu.

183
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,229
Tossing him out, or
sending him to the movies,

184
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,234
or locking him in the bathroom

185
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,736
would also minimize
Alvie's destructive force.

186
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,639
But you chose his
company deliberately. Why?

187
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,768
Obviously, because
he's a Wilson substitute.

188
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,688
You can barely tell the
difference between them,

189
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,442
especially when Wilson
raps about the 'hood.

190
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,278
I'm not suggesting
Alvie's a substitute,

191
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,318
but he would make
a great distraction.

192
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,545
From what?

193
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,349
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

194
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,355
Go on.

195
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,197
Maybe the heart rate
monitor was a gift.

196
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,631
That's why no one
recognized her.

197
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,429
Shut up, Alvie.

198
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,700
Anything familiar?
Church? Grocery store?

199
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,835
Sorry.

200
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,103
It's okay, Miss X.

201
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,041
Maybe she's never
been to this town before.

202
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,307
Bought the heart rate
monitor on the store's website.

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,508
You know that Puerto
Ricans are US citizens, right?

204
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,293
Instead of working the case,
why don't you contemplate

205
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,912
the inanity of an American with
American immigration issues?

206
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,080
I had a birth
certificate. I lost it.

207
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,090
So get a new one.
I tried that, House.

208
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,102
But the town hall had
burned down when I was a kid,

209
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,492
destroyed the records.

210
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,722
There's only one copy?

211
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,425
They tried to make me fill
out a whole bunch of forms

212
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,608
before they'd give it to me.

213
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,568
I decided it'd be quicker
and easier to do it myself.

214
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,659
How'd that go?

215
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,947
They figured out it was forged,

216
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,149
and now, for some reason,
they don't believe anything I say.

217
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,574
They actually think I'm lying
about being Puerto Rican.

218
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,476
Told me I had to go to a
special hearing to prove it.

219
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,037
What if nothing
ever looks familiar?

220
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,920
Then someone will show
up, a spouse, a friend,

221
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,285
to tell you who you really are

222
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,755
and what you should be feeling.

223
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,121
They always do.

224
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,454
I don't know who
that is, but I miss him.

225
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,032
What did they
say at the hearing?

226
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,593
I didn't go. I lied once.

227
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,865
Your mother's Puerto Rican,

228
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,149
therefore you are Puerto Rican.

229
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,717
All you gotta do is prove
your mom is your mom.

230
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,902
Find some documentation...

231
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,445
People like that don't
listen to people like me.

232
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,105
Donuts. Hey, House,
let's get donuts!

233
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,180
Alvie, the hearing...

234
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,341
Everyone loves donuts.

235
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,214
Glazed, crullers, elephant
ears, even donut holes.

236
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,529
Much better than the
sporting goods store.

237
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,181
I bet Mrs. X went
there all the time.

238
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,780
We're not here...

239
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,289
<i>And then I realized...</i>

240
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,321
You make a good point.

241
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,987
Really? I was making that up.

242
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,022
Dozen glazed,
dozen jelly-filled?

243
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,725
You want the usual, right?

244
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,970
Your old friend, the
fried carbohydrate.

245
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,506
She needed the
calorically dense food

246
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,650
to support the running habit.

247
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,506
Do you know her name?

248
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,838
Sandy or Shelley, I don't know.

249
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,816
The guy she's with
called her that once.

250
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,110
I just work here.

251
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,813
Do you know where they live?

252
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,617
He left a business card
in our free donut jar.

253
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,215
It's up on the Wall of Winners.

254
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,457
Sidney.

255
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,072
God, I was so worried about you.

256
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,007
What happened?

257
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,121
The police said it was
too soon to do anything,

258
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,623
so I started calling
hospitals on my own.

259
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,853
Princeton-Plainsboro
wasn't even on my list.

260
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,305
You really think something around
here could have made her sick?

261
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,322
Here, work, anywhere she
could have been exposed.

262
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,663
Why wasn't
Princeton-Plainsboro on your list?

263
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,398
Well, I mean, it's a long
way to run, even for her.

264
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,841
What is it I do besides run?

265
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,943
You're a lawyer. Civil
rights, class-action suits.

266
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,782
It's a stressful job, running's
the way you deal with it.

267
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,722
That doesn't sound like me.

268
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,950
Do you have any idea
what would sound like you?

269
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,957
Good point.

270
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,019
<i>So what were you
thinking during all this?</i>

271
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,656
<i>That it was a strange
position to be in.</i>

272
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,859
<i>At that moment, she
was more comfortable</i>

273
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,869
<i>with me than with her husband.</i>

274
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,064
<i>And he was picking up on it.</i>

275
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,564
What about you?

276
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,370
What about me how?

277
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:01,309
There was a sort of artificial
intimacy between you.

278
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,225
She had been dependent on you.

279
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,912
Did you find that
attractive on some level?

280
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,682
Disturbing?

281
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,984
Those are my two choices?

282
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,255
None of the above.

283
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,660
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

284
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,264
So we're really married.

285
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,837
For four years.

286
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,332
Miss X, you lead
a lemon-fresh life.

287
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,399
I found three different
cleansers under the sink.

288
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,919
Cleaned out the
medicine cabinets, too.

289
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,572
You know, she just won a
settlement for some families

290
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,343
whose housing development
was built on an old methane field.

291
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,985
A toxic exposure to
methane could explain this.

292
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,386
I surf?

293
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,752
You stopped before we met.

294
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,588
You've been too busy.

295
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,692
And we're married?

296
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,955
Yes.

297
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,590
All right, it's
nothing personal.

298
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,842
I bet she didn't think
you were her type

299
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,926
back when you first met either.

300
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,680
We'll take her
back to the hospital,

301
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,367
test her blood and
urine, start treatment.

302
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,875
Are you okay? I'm all right.

303
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,669
What happened?

304
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,340
I don't know. My foot
suddenly went numb.

305
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,948
Her pants are wet.

306
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,014
Urinary incontinence.

307
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,485
She's having complex partial
seizures. This isn't methane.

308
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,657
And you can leave the bucket.

309
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,727
We need to get her...

310
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,794
<i>Seizures?</i>

311
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,841
This is the second
diagnosis you've come up with

312
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,561
that has a personal
resonance for you.

313
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,897
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

314
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,248
You think she fell down
the stairs and peed her pants

315
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,450
'cause Wilson dumped her, too?

316
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,137
You're choosing to tell me
about this case. So let's look at it.

317
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,873
First, you were fixated on a
harmful toxin from her past,

318
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,023
possibly because you're worried

319
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,224
about a harmful
toxin from your...

320
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,047
Chase had the toxin idea.
Maybe he's obsessed with my past.

321
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,762
And now you're talking
about a seizure disorder...

322
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,186
Which is also not a toxin.

323
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,214
But which is most likely caused
by an old injury to the brain.

324
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,352
Why do you see your
past as such a threat?

325
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,860
Not only am I
unthreatened by it,

326
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,050
I was trying to get it back.

327
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,031
There's a ding mark.

328
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,735
It's a piece of junk. It was
dinged when it came in.

329
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,603
Sure. The cup marks, the scuffs,

330
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,951
and the paint, and
those three chips.

331
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,307
This fourth one is new.

332
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,346
I run a pawn shop, not a storage
company. Do you want it or not?

333
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,076
That should be it.

334
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,485
You said you pawned five
books. There's only four.

335
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,317
That's all there is.

336
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,017
Where's <i>Approach to
the Acute Abdomen?</i>

337
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,453
Sold it.

338
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,425
To? I can't tell you.

339
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,262
It's the law, and it should be.

340
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,735
Crazy bastards like you
try to hunt down their stuff.

341
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,534
How much for the pile?

342
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,073
$500.

343
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,373
You said it was junk.

344
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,145
No, no. It's your
junk, you want it.

345
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,015
$500. Take it or leave it.

346
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,225
Why is it so important
that you get your stuff back?

347
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,434
Unlike the rest of humanity,

348
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,095
who's okay when their
belongings are taken?

349
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,181
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

350
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,367
Everyone doesn't pay
five times what it's worth.

351
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,604
I like my stuff. I hate it
when Wilson moves...

352
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,736
Oh.

353
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,474
This is not about Wilson!

354
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,719
Say it.

355
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,728
I wasn't gonna say anything.

356
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,771
Thirty-one, thirty-one! Hike!

357
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,742
First down!

358
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,995
One more, you get a touchdown.

359
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,180
Whoo!

360
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,450
Hike!

361
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,398
House, you can't
run for the touchdown.

362
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,968
And hike!

363
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,096
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

364
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,551
You seriously thought you're
gonna tell me that Wilson showed up,

365
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,735
but not tell me what he said?

366
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,301
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

367
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,313
who didn't need the
obvious spelled out to him.

368
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,681
Wilson noticed that I didn't
come to my office all day.

369
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,911
He came to find me.

370
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,920
Wanted to make sure I'm
okay. Boring, boring, boring.

371
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,920
But you thought it was important
to tell me about Nerf football?

372
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,493
Sorry, your story. Continue.

373
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,326
House! House!
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

374
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,027
You okay?

375
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,229
Yeah.

376
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:57,273
It was my mother's. She died
when I was four. It's all I have left.

377
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,102
That's very sad, Alvie.

378
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,011
Listen, I set up an
immigration hearing.

379
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,175
No, House. I'm
gonna end up in jail.

380
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,220
Or worse, the Dominican or
someplace, <i>qué sé yo qué.</i> No.

381
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,516
<i>That is interesting.</i>

382
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,615
You present yourself
as not giving a damn

383
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,920
about other people's emotions,

384
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,518
but your actions
indicate otherwise.

385
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,621
You dismiss Alvie's
story about his mother,

386
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,462
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

387
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,059
I cared for eight seconds.

388
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,331
Then I got distracted.

389
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,800
Yeah.

390
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,188
<i>We've kept the patient
up for 12 hours now.</i>

391
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,875
<i>No hint of seizure-like activity.
We should shut this down.</i>

392
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,144
Try a strobe light,
add more stress.

393
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,879
<i>I think there's plenty
of stress in here.</i>

394
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,512
Don't we ever do
anything but work?

395
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,046
You run.

396
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,455
That's just more work!

397
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,461
What about fun? God,
how can we be this boring?

398
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,429
Apparently, without her memory,

399
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,261
the patient's
personality has returned

400
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,769
to what you might
call its natural state.

401
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,500
Seems she had a wake-up
call while she was at college.

402
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,936
Her brother died
in a car accident.

403
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,707
She decided to make her life
mean something, went to law school.

404
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,344
Now that's all gone.

405
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,986
The thing that caused
the change is gone,

406
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,453
so the change itself is gone.

407
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,719
Yeah. I knew the
psychological aspects

408
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,453
of this case would interest you.

409
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,360
Bet you got a theory
already. What is it?

410
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,624
It's not relevant.

411
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,797
What is it?

412
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,666
Why do you care about my theory?

413
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,639
I think he just bores her.

414
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,674
I think she's at an earlier
stage of development,

415
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,839
she's looking at her grownup
future, and it puts her to sleep.

416
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,476
If he just bored her,
she'd hide it to be polite.

417
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,652
Their problem is synchronicity.

418
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,280
Just like you and me, House,
they're not on the same page.

419
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,884
He talks to her like someone
he shares history with.

420
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,003
But from her point of view,

421
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,428
he's a stranger
forcing intimacy on her.

422
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,227
Of course she doesn't
like him. He's not helping.

423
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,463
He can feel he's
losing his wife,

424
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,856
and it makes him
come on stronger.

425
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,469
He almost did lose his wife.

426
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,099
The breathing problem was
caused by fluid overload in the lungs.

427
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,607
Diabetes insipidus.

428
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,042
And the DI came from
damage to the hypothalamus.

429
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,613
Hypothalamus here, that's
the DI and incontinence,

430
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,808
they mingle here, that's
the global amnesia,

431
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,626
and the motor cortex,
that's the foot paralysis.

432
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,828
What do they all have in common?

433
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,052
<i>Okay, now you're just
doing this to mess with me.</i>

434
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,256
What possible relevance does this
differential have to your problems?

435
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,527
It ends with a diagnosis
of Spongiform Encephalitis.

436
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,463
I convinced the team to cut
out part of this woman's brain.

437
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,295
That's not interesting
to you? No.

438
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,092
Not even if it's the amygdala?

439
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,195
She'll lose all her
long-term memories.

440
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,448
Well, this is where you tell me

441
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,983
that being cavalier
with someone else's past

442
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,272
has nothing to do with
avoiding your own past.

443
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:21,212
The case is irrelevant,
you just found it interesting.

444
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,843
Aren't therapists
supposed to be nurturing?

445
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,179
Nowhere is that in the manual.

446
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,320
Look, you've been
in therapy for a year.

447
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,735
You know when I ask
you to talk about anything,

448
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,625
I mean anything
that affects you.

449
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,696
What upset you, what made
you mad, or relieved, or joyful.

450
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,395
You want me to believe
that this case means nothing?

451
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,598
Then

452
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,440
why should I listen to it?

453
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,060
Are you charging
me for this time?

454
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,226
Yes.

455
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,633
This is ridiculous.

456
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,877
What's that? On
the back of your arm?

457
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,908
It's just a bruise. I fell.

458
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,215
You remember falling?

459
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,578
No. I was drunk.

460
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,154
Hence the balance issues.

461
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:41,888
It looks like you fell on
the tip of someone's boot.

462
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,463
I said something that
someone objected to.

463
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,315
Well, if you don't
remember, then how...

464
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,673
It's usually the way it is
when someone hits me.

465
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,242
People who kick when
you're down are jerks,

466
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,610
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

467
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
You got drunk enough to get
into a bar fight and not remember,

468
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,381
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

469
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,650
Why go out and get blind drunk?

470
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,248
Were you looking for a fight?

471
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,258
I don't know.

472
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,124
What have you screwed up?

473
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,294
What?

474
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,463
You say that when
you've been hit in the past,

475
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,371
it's because you've provoked
it with something that you said.

476
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,466
Which means you're
well aware of the risks.

477
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,511
So, on some level,
you were in that bar

478
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,945
looking for someone to hurt you.

479
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,379
Logically, people punish
themselves for something they did,

480
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,579
or something they didn't do.

481
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,221
So, what did you screw up?

482
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,957
I don't know.

483
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,880
Okay, there may be a problem.

484
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,221
All right.

485
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,993
Let's talk about Wilson.

486
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,232
I told him your book was
contaminated with anthrax spores.

487
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,462
Then I gave him $300.
The address of the buyer.

488
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,064
Maybe I was hasty in
asking you to move out.

489
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,835
Why don't you stay with
me and Sam for a little while?

490
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,605
There's no need to hurry things.

491
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,275
What prompted this?

492
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,715
Look, the whole idea was that after
Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own.

493
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,430
I can touch base with
you a lot more easily

494
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,854
if you're staying
with me than...

495
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,356
For God's sake, Wilson.

496
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:55,116
You really span the
chasm from wishy to washy.

497
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,790
If you're gonna be an
ass, be an ass. Stick with it.

498
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,028
Why were you being
so hard on the guy,

499
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,466
when he was being conciliatory?

500
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:07,802
Come on, Cuddy played on
his guilt. She put him up to this.

501
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,398
How do you know that?

502
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,706
How do you know this
wasn't entirely his own idea?

503
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,542
Two reasons. First,
he wants to create

504
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,548
the perfect environment
to be with Sam.

505
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,375
He's been thinking about
asking me to leave for a while.

506
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,944
Finally, he does it, and immediately
turns around and changes his mind?

507
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,320
No. He talked to somebody.

508
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,522
Maybe it was Sam.

509
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,854
<i>Yeah, that's a possibility.</i>

510
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:34,666
I want this to be the last
serious relationship I ever have.

511
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,258
I want this to be the one.

512
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,428
Me, too.

513
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,740
Where's House? It's not
as meaningful without him.

514
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,770
Okay, not Sam.

515
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,780
That still doesn't
answer why Cuddy.

516
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,545
Because they've
been talking about me.

517
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,214
She called me to
check on the patient,

518
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,449
which she never
does without a reason.

519
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,218
I asked why, and she said...

520
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,624
She's a barracuda
attorney, House.

521
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,855
These are the kind of
patients we like to keep happy.

522
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,488
Right now, the patient's lucky

523
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,556
if she can spell
"jurisprudence."

524
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,762
Yeah, but when she
gets that memory back,

525
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,202
which we're trying
to make happen,

526
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:16,072
she'll be able to spell
"lawsuit." I'm just touching base.

527
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:22,272
"Touching base." Wilson
used exactly the same phrase.

528
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,816
Colluding about me is
their favorite pastime.

529
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,178
Okay, you think they talked.

530
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,287
How do you think that
conversation went?

531
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,931
I'm worried about House.

532
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,097
Me, too. Couldn't
you have waited?

533
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,472
It's way too early for him to be on
his own, back in the old apartment.

534
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,018
What makes you
think he can handle it?

535
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,567
I offered to find
him a new place.

536
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,054
You have to let him
back into your condo.

537
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,944
Sam and I just got
him out of the condo.

538
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,983
You know what House is
like, he's self-destructive.

539
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,313
Without constant supervision,

540
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,853
he's gonna slide
back into drugs.

541
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,822
If you're not watching
him, I've got to.

542
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,017
Yeah.

543
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,193
So they don't trust you.

544
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,787
They assume you'll fail.

545
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,129
Are these their fears or yours?

546
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,797
Let's turn on the lights. Hmm?

547
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,198
In your brain.

548
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,141
Maybe they did talk about you,

549
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,740
but how do you know it
didn't happen like this?

550
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,810
I'm worried about House.

551
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:33,944
Why?

552
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,030
It's the first time he'll be
on his own since Mayfield.

553
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,386
No, you're being
over-protective.

554
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,584
House doesn't need to
be wrapped in cotton wool.

555
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,651
But you know that, or you wouldn't
have asked him to move out.

556
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,527
Okay. I guess this
is really about me.

557
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,964
It's just I feel like a jerk.

558
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,899
Sure, Sam and I are gonna
wanna be on our own eventually,

559
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,665
but I kind of
sprang this on him.

560
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,384
The right way would've
been to just tell him

561
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,485
to take as long as he needed,

562
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,410
that there's no hurry.

563
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,973
So it's not what you
did, but how you did it?

564
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,678
That matters in a
friendship. I need to fix this.

565
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,485
Why don't you talk to
him about moving back in?

566
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,657
Just touch base.

567
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,651
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

568
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,788
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.

569
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:19,923
Yeah, he is.

570
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,743
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

571
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,498
What's Taub doing in
my imaginary version

572
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,647
of a scene with
Wilson and Cuddy?

573
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,334
Your version needed to
be ended. Because it's crap.

574
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,467
It's all sweetness
and light and faith

575
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,982
that I'm gonna
choose the right path.

576
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,146
Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.

577
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,512
I have as much evidence
for mine as you do for yours.

578
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,385
I know Wilson's your friend,

579
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,619
so he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

580
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:47,902
And I know he
wouldn't have asked you

581
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,070
to move out in the first place

582
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,375
unless he was convinced you
could handle life on your own.

583
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,366
And I know that he and Cuddy
have gone behind my back before

584
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,426
to strategize about
"the House problem."

585
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,698
So there's truth
in both versions.

586
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,535
But you choose to
focus on the parts

587
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,076
that make you
uncomfortable. So...

588
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:15,581
Why are you and Wilson friends?

589
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,316
Do you think this friendship
is the best you can do?

590
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,929
Wilson is not a
consolation prize.

591
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,524
There, you're defending him.

592
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,545
And a minute ago, he was
skulking around in the background

593
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,198
like some sort of
manipulative Iago.

594
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,969
He's my friend.

595
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,335
So what do you value in him?

596
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,649
I can say whatever I want
to him, and he'll never leave.

597
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,551
He's sort of leaving.

598
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,350
At least, he won't
be around as much.

599
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,986
Because he's putting Sam first.

600
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,391
For now.

601
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,497
After the divorce, he'll probably
ask me to move in again.

602
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,092
I take the long view.

603
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,267
You say that to Wilson?

604
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,339
Are you kidding?

605
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,741
That's the kind of remark
that leads people to hit you.

606
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,327
Maybe you've been
right from the beginning.

607
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,717
Maybe this isn't about Wilson.

608
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,113
You say that now that
I finally agree with you?

609
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,249
Do you just argue the
opposite of whatever I say?

610
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,124
I don't mean the Wilson
thing doesn't bother you.

611
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,753
But it sounds like
he's the closest

612
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,559
you could come to
a safe relationship.

613
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,260
You'd have to do something
major to screw it up.

614
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,900
What else have you
been involved in this week?

615
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,471
What would you want
to punish yourself for?

616
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,336
I told you I don't know.

617
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,481
Okay, let's approach it
from a different angle.

618
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,514
Have you gotten any other
people angry at you over anything?

619
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:02,219
Well, yeah. That's why I
called it an ordinary week.

620
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,795
Okay. Tell me about it.

621
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,930
You'd be losing a
part of your brain.

622
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,238
It is my brain. Why is it
not my right to consent?

623
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,237
I'm sorry, but I'll take this to
court, if necessary, all right?

624
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,079
Sidney's in no position to make
decisions about herself right now.

625
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,516
She doesn't even
know who she is.

626
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,453
I read your consent form and I
understood it. I want the surgery.

627
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,682
Why wouldn't she?

628
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,817
Of course she's willing to risk
losing her memories permanently,

629
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,987
she has no idea how
important those memories are.

630
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,860
Does she even
know what "risk" is?

631
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,455
She's never lost anything!

632
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,366
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

633
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,370
The prion infection
will continue to advance

634
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,632
and destroy her whole brain.

635
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,936
There has to be another way.

636
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,101
Please.

637
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,340
I'm speaking for my wife,

638
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,239
the wife I lived
with for four years,

639
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,114
who isn't here and
can't defend herself.

640
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,949
Dr. House, are you listening?

641
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:07,389
Well, you can stop arguing
'cause it doesn't matter anymore.

642
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,293
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

643
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,661
The SE's spread
into the brainstem.

644
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,457
Wherever it is, you
can still cut it out.

645
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:20,528
No. We can't cut the brainstem.

646
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,016
This thing's moving too quickly.

647
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,373
Surgery is no longer an option.

648
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,436
Which, I guess, means
you've won. Congratulations.

649
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,949
Put in a pacer, and start
her on chemo and radiation.

650
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,144
It won't cure her, but
it'll buy a couple weeks,

651
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,619
so she can find out who
she is before she dies.

652
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,115
<i>That was pretty rough.</i>

653
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,619
<i>Do you always break the
news to your patients that way?</i>

654
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,256
Or were you
shorthanding it for me?

655
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,356
Husband was being an idiot.

656
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,900
Well, he was asking for it.

657
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,503
But to punish him, you
had to punish the wife, too.

658
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,730
Why did he make you so angry?

659
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,743
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

660
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,879
He'd rather risk his wife's
life than their marriage.

661
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,575
People's brains stop
working when they think

662
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,175
they're gonna lose
someone they love.

663
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,315
Your leg hurting?

664
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,421
It's all right.

665
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,455
Okay.

666
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,561
Anyone else you pissed off?

667
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,766
Fifty bucks for the book.

668
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,002
Forget it.

669
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,143
You paid $25.
That's 100% return.

670
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,305
That's what I paid.

671
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,145
But it's a rare surgical
text, nearly 100 years old,

672
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:42,586
plates in mint condition. That
book's worth several thousand dollars.

673
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,850
$2,000. I'll write you a check.

674
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:45,982
Nice try.

675
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,424
Face it. I had the
wit to recognize

676
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,359
something valuable
when I saw it.

677
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:55,731
In the great Darwinian race, I get
my just reward, you become roadkill.

678
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,440
Yo, House, you wanna
stop by the library?

679
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,715
'Cause I got a book to return.

680
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,411
<i>Old professor tried to hoard/hog</i>

681
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,047
<i>You can't stop Alvie
with no guard-ass dog</i>

682
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,215
Anyone see you?

683
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,011
Yeah, Prof saw me
walking down the driveway.

684
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,789
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

685
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,560
I didn't know there was a
section of the brain just for hope.

686
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,299
It's very, very tiny.

687
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,638
We used fluoroscopy to guide
pacemaker placement in the patient's heart.

688
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:38,870
Hello.

689
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,539
Hello. Rapidly progressive
dilated cardiomyopathy.

690
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,106
This isn't SE,
and whatever it is,

691
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,276
it's not just in her brain,

692
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,842
it's attacking her whole body.

693
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,515
You work for House? I guess
we're teammates. Isn't that cool?

694
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,551
Hello.

695
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,918
Juan Alvarez?

696
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,018
What the hell?

697
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,724
We're taking you into
custody. Deportation order.

698
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,290
I'm a citizen. You're
disrespecting Puerto Rico.

699
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,269
If you're a citizen, why
did you miss your hearing?

700
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,604
You called them?

701
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,839
What's going on?

702
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,983
We're trying to
stabilize her heart.

703
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,551
She's still tachy
and hypotensive.

704
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,765
Brain, heart, and
rapidly progressing.

705
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,844
<i>Endocarditis. Slow-moving
infection in her heart</i>

706
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,427
<i>throws clots to her brain.</i>

707
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,838
I'm not talking to you.

708
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,098
How could you turn me in?

709
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,153
<i>Her extreme exercise
suppresses her immune system,</i>

710
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,770
allows the infection
to smoulder.

711
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:51,078
<i>Or allows an old
infection to re-activate. TB.</i>

712
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,251
Start her on a
multi-drug regimen.

713
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,585
I don't like you,
House. I hate you.

714
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,921
<i>Even IV antibiotics
will take time to work.</i>

715
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,559
A gentle reminder, the use
of cell phones is prohibited.

716
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,393
Give her the first dose
directly into the lungs in the OR.

717
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,524
Before the less-gentle
arrest for contempt.

718
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,592
Put her in an isolation
room with UV light.

719
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,798
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

720
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,576
Docket number 4378.

721
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,616
You are?

722
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,551
I'm Mr. Alvarez's doctor.

723
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,023
Your Honor, DNA evidence proving

724
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,861
the matriarchal
lineage of Juan Alvarez.

725
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,094
My mother's DNA
was still on that cross?

726
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:47,366
It could be.

727
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,742
You faked it?

728
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,779
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them, too.

729
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,579
But I'm better
at it than you are.

730
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,596
<i>I'm gonna re-paint your
whole apartment now</i>

731
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,555
<i>Make the drapes
match the carpet now</i>

732
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,490
Lungs sound wet.
O2 sats are dropping.

733
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,429
We may need to tube her.
Grab some IV furosemide.

734
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,694
Wait. Wait.

735
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,793
She's crashing.

736
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,270
We need to get her on a vent.

737
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,289
There's something on her ankle.

738
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,183
A tattoo.

739
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,449
"Eddie would go."
It's a surfing phrase.

740
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,255
Must be from her earlier life.

741
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,120
She tried to get it removed.

742
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,028
But they only took off
the top layers of skin.

743
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,794
The ink is still in
the deeper layers.

744
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,725
It set off an allergic reaction.

745
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,771
She was fine until she started
the long-distance running.

746
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,307
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system

747
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,740
and set off the
allergic reaction.

748
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,679
We did a full-thickness
skin graft and she'll be okay.

749
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:09,115
So, you were right in
the end. It was her past.

750
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,348
Did she get her memory back?

751
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,754
Not yet.

752
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,054
Will she?

753
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,053
No way to know.

754
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,065
I think roses are my favorite.

755
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,864
But I guess I told
you that at some point.

756
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,564
I don't remember.

757
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,709
He's treating her as
though they've just met.

758
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,876
He's courting her.
Whose idea was that?

759
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,361
He was doing the opposite
of everything he should,

760
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,478
suddenly he's changed.

761
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:42,714
Taub thought it might...

762
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,551
That was your idea.

763
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,123
And you asked me what I thought
was going on between them.

764
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,287
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

765
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,421
That's why you've been
thinking about this case.

766
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,988
Relationships.

767
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,660
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with Alvie...

768
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,293
<i>Not exactly.</i>

769
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,899
Alvie!

770
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,419
You gonna tell me
what the note said?

771
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,297
Alvie was very grateful that
I'd gotten him out of trouble.

772
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,514
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

773
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,100
without worrying about
Immigration looking for him there.

774
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,511
You didn't think he
was gonna stay forever?

775
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,637
No.

776
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,111
What happened next?

777
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,588
<i>Nothing happened next.</i>

778
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,780
That's all I got.

779
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,948
Relationships.

780
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,521
Bergman. What do
you want me to say?

781
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,623
I don't know, you're the
one who set the theme.

782
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,158
Something about relationships

783
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,965
made you go out
and provoke a fight.

784
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,767
Wilson and Sam
have a relationship.

785
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,437
You're not thrilled about it.

786
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,773
They're happy.

787
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,875
Why should I screw that
up? Everyone's happy.

788
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,048
Everyone's moving in together.

789
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,280
Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and
Lucas, even Alvie and his...

790
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,656
Cuddy and Lucas are
moving in together?

791
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,719
You didn't mention that.

792
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,855
They've talked about
moving in together before.

793
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,899
It's not big news.

794
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,197
Cuddy.

795
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,872
Cuddy.

796
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,308
<i>Approach to the Acute Abdomen.</i>

797
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,860
Written by Ernest T. Cuddy, M.D.

798
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,328
Any relation to your Cuddy?

799
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,232
Her great-grandfather.

800
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,567
I've had it for years.

801
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:49,005
Always meant to give it to
her for a special occasion.

802
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,808
Like her housewarming?

803
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,171
It's just a gift.

804
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,310
A woman you care about has
taken one step further away from you

805
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,476
and closer to someone else.

806
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,075
I think I can safely say, yes,

807
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,280
it's significant if
you don't mention it.

808
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,119
You were willing to punish
the husband of your patient

809
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,523
because you identified with him.

810
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,420
He was also losing
someone he loved.

811
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,907
I'm not gonna go out
and get hammered

812
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,958
because a woman I'm not even
with is moving in with someone.

813
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,799
That'd be pathetic.

814
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,168
To hell with this.

815
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,471
When I first came to you,

816
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:31,076
I told you that I
wanted to be happy.

817
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:35,484
I followed your advice, and
instead I'm just miserable.

818
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,314
How is this working for me?

819
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,884
It takes time.

820
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,484
For a year, I've done
everything you've asked,

821
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,689
and everybody else is happy.

822
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,394
I run my treadmill, you
just sit there and watch.

823
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,536
You're a faith healer.

824
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,669
You take advantage of
people who want to believe.

825
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,411
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

826
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:05,843
House!

827
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,819
Whatever the answer
is, you don't have it.
