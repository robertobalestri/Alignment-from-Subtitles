1
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,262
Mr. Randall? They're here.

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,575
Fifty-two million
includes over six million

3
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,117
already issued pursuant
to the over-allotment option.

4
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,515
When can we close?

5
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,078
It would be subject to regulatory
approval in both Toronto...

6
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,818
I didn't say how,
Oliver, I said when.

7
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,820
What?

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,795
You sure this is a direction
you want to go, Roy?

9
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,423
This would move us from
energy service into energy...

10
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,899
You don't think oil's going up?

11
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,061
Of course it's gonna go
up. The question is when.

12
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,297
The question is always when.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,839
And if we wait until the deal
makes sense to everyone else,

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,876
we're gonna be waiting in
line behind everyone else.

15
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,002
All I'm saying is...

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,979
The same cover-your-ass
crap you always say.

17
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,878
We're gonna have to
wrap this up. I gotta go.

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,418
Where are you going? - Upstairs.

19
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,663
Get the regulators on it. I want
to close by the end of the month.

20
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,765
Come on, Roy. There are
10 other items on the agenda.

21
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,166
Which'll have to
wait until next week.

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,091
You can't drag us
all out of the office,

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,560
get halfway through,
and then just kick us out.

24
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,028
Yeah, I can.

25
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,568
The antibiotic
treatment had no effect.

26
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,959
Both the fever and the
pain are getting worse,

27
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,021
which means it's not
Clostridium difficile.

28
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,194
But you said that was the
only diagnosis that made sense.

29
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,931
It was. We need to
get him to a hospital.

30
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,166
Dad.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,840
I don't want to go.

32
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,350
I know, buddy. But
we may need to.

33
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,443
Am I gonna die?

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,354
No. Of course not.

35
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,750
How do you know?

36
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,822
Well, I just do.

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,298
And I'm always right, aren't I?

38
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,063
Yeah.

39
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,066
I want House.

40
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,578
I understand, but I told
you Dr. House isn't available.

41
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,738
Dr... Call him.

42
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,909
Tell him I'll have a private jet
pick him up from whatever island...

43
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,976
He isn't on vacation. Dr. Foreman
is one of our best doctors.

44
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,544
Is House in jail?

45
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:46,116
No. Foreman is currently working with
two of House's most veteran associates.

46
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,456
Rehab?

47
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,688
No.

48
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,797
Mr. Randall, your son
will be in good hands.

49
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,333
My son

50
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,403
has already been in good
hands, and he's still dying.

51
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,564
I'm through dealing with good.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,839
I want the best, and everyone
I've asked says that's House.

53
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,008
So unless he's dead,
comatose, or insane,

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,281
I want him treating
my son today.

55
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,991
You could have said
no in good conscience.

56
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,031
The kid'll still be
Foreman's patient,

57
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,589
but his dad wants you
making the decisions.

58
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,032
Then he's not my patient.

59
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,765
You want to give me none of the
responsibility and all of the liability?

60
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,704
Which means I get...

61
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,873
Oh, cool.

62
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,172
Don't let him do anything crazy.

63
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,376
When is he getting his license back
so we can stop playing this game?

64
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,783
Maybe never. This game is fun.

65
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,851
You also need to prepare
President Dibala's case

66
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,949
for this week's Morbidity
and Mortality conference.

67
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,892
Oh, unfortunately, I'm overdue
on a mani-pedi appointment.

68
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,363
Not you, Foreman's department.

69
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,265
Oh, right. Well, he's got
all the time in the world.

70
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,771
We made the wrong call, he
died, there's nothing to present.

71
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,807
It obviously garnered
a lot of curiosity.

72
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,618
And we don't have more
important things to do

73
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,168
than satisfy everyone's
idle curiosity?

74
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,712
It's not idle.

75
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,943
The question of how we deal
with two possible diagnoses

76
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,578
whose treatments are
contraindicated is worth discussing.

77
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,457
Abdominal pain increasing
in severity and frequency,

78
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,494
fever, dehydration,
diarrhea, weight loss.

79
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,087
Mom died from kidney failure
caused by type 1 diabetes,

80
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,187
which has been ruled out.

81
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,130
Seventeen doctors.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,830
Everything's been ruled out,
which means we have to re-rule out.

83
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,398
Get a new history and physical.
Unless that's crazy, boss.

84
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,742
Been out of the country or
on any recent camping trips?

85
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,341
No camping. But we were
in Montreal back in January.

86
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,114
We went to see the NHL
All-Star Game for my birthday.

87
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,484
Awesome.

88
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,354
Where's Dr. House?

89
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,949
In his office.

90
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,722
He's really more of
a decider than a doer.

91
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,787
He's decided we
should start over.

92
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,198
You never know what previous
doctors may have missed.

93
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,234
Like this.

94
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,932
Does that hurt more
when I push there?

95
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,305
Not really.

96
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,843
What is it?

97
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,370
I'm not sure.

98
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,807
Just keep it clean, simple.

99
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,579
We did a test that called into
question our initial diagnosis,

100
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,085
so we changed our mind.

101
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,621
And if they ask how
the test was done?

102
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,850
Why would they do
that? It's a routine lab test.

103
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,383
Routine lab tests don't involve
blood you stole from a corpse

104
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,521
to trick me into giving the
guy the wrong treatment.

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,121
Yes, and if you brought that up,

106
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,723
it'd certainly make
for a lively debate

107
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,132
about the morality of
murdering murderers.

108
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,113
But since you burned
the only evidence of that...

109
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,038
To cover for you, not me.

110
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,974
You're protected. The
decision was a coin flip.

111
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,534
There was no right
or wrong answer.

112
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:56,573
The body's underground, 8,000
miles away. Nobody can prove anything.

113
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,279
That room will be filled,
not because of a coin flip,

114
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,119
not because of the patient, but
because House's department screwed up.

115
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,125
They're gonna be like sharks
in a chum-filled swimming pool,

116
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:10,152
and there's no way I'm jumping
in unless I'm in a steel cage.

117
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,226
So what do you want?

118
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,030
I want to know you
have everything covered.

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,729
Got what covered?

120
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,403
We're just reviewing
the Dibala case.

121
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,033
Making sure we
didn't miss anything.

122
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,637
We didn't. Except, of course,
the thing that killed him.

123
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,912
He's constipated.

124
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,748
Physical revealed a mass in his
abdomen, so I repeated the X-ray.

125
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,381
Old one was clean, new one shows that
his colon is almost completely impacted.

126
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,290
Obstruction would
explain the pain.

127
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,022
You think they just
screwed up the old X-ray?

128
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,256
Nope.

129
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,590
Hirschsprung's?

130
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,501
It's a congenital disorder
of the nerves in the colon.

131
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,334
Very rare in a
child your son's age.

132
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,998
Most doctors would
never think of it.

133
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,337
And you came up with this?

134
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,432
It's House's idea.

135
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,671
We need a barium enema
and biopsy to confirm.

136
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:02,341
Let me guess, it
tastes really bad,

137
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,316
but it's gonna make
me feel a lot better.

138
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,178
Actually, you're
not gonna taste it.

139
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,331
You should try searching
for "Misty May digs for gold."

140
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,903
Make sure you put it in quotes.

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,334
I'm making travel plans.

142
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,868
I just need to get away,
have some time to myself.

143
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,477
You getting the hint?

144
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,407
So that's it?

145
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,653
You're done with your little
experiment with Foreman?

146
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,521
It wasn't an experiment,
it was a relationship.

147
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,720
You may wanna look
into the difference.

148
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,696
I'm glad you're better, House.

149
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:56,862
I actually liked working for
you, but I'm not coming back.

150
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,097
Good.

151
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,333
Because if you came back,

152
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,740
Foreman would try and
save the relationship,

153
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,142
and he'd give up being the boss.

154
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,639
Are you here to try to save
my relationship with Foreman?

155
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,345
God, no. I'm trying to save
my relationship with Foreman.

156
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,914
Right now, I'm Kobe, playing the
game I love, however the hell I want,

157
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,924
and Phil Jackson has to listen
to everyone else bitch about it.

158
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,394
Enjoy Cabo.

159
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,965
I'm going to Thailand.

160
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,464
Really?

161
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,696
Interesting.

162
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,263
Goodbye, House.

163
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,071
Goodbye, Thirteen.

164
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,841
Last week, yesterday, today.

165
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,975
I can't believe it.

166
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,817
He's pain-free for the first time
in months, he's even hungry.

167
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,253
I'm starving.

168
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,833
We're still waiting
for the biopsy results,

169
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,291
but obviously it's a good sign.

170
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,724
You're gonna
want to take it slow.

171
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,127
Don't try to regain all the
lost weight in one meal.

172
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,125
What's wrong?

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,295
The abdomen feels
normal, but looks bigger.

174
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:08,639
Jack, are you feeling...
Jack? Hey, Jack, you okay?

175
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,644
Right eye is fixed.
Lateral rectus palsy.

176
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,313
He's seizing. Need five
milligrams of diazepam.

177
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,117
What's happening?

178
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,763
Hold down his head
and turn off the lights.

179
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,085
I need to see his optic disk.

180
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,124
Heart rate's elevated.
Come on, hold his head.

181
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,886
I'm trying. Wait. Where's House?

182
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,236
Mr. Randall, we
need you to step back.

183
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,780
His optic disks are swollen.
He's got intracranial hypertension.

184
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,457
Furosemide, 20 milligrams, IV.

185
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,611
If we could intubate him...

186
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,464
Need five more
milligrams of diazepam.

187
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,505
DC the monitors. Push
500 milligrams of phenytoin.

188
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,616
You can't push that much.
We gotta relieve the pressure,

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,699
or his brain can herniate.

190
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,208
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,479
Fifty milligrams
of phenytoin in.

192
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,750
Page Chase. Tell him
to meet us in the OR.

193
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,577
We need your consent.

194
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,950
What's happening to him?

195
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,460
The pressure in
his skull's too high.

196
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,666
If we don't reduce it, it could
irrevocably damage his brain.

197
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,352
But he was just
talking. He was smiling.

198
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,688
We need to drill burr holes.

199
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,955
Drill into his head?

200
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,894
Phenytoin's not
working. Paralyze him.

201
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,243
Three milligrams of pancuronium.

202
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,630
Then intubate
and hyperventilate.

203
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,193
Where's House?

204
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,636
House isn't here. Do
we have your consent?

205
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,375
Do we have your consent?
Ready? One, two, three.

206
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,676
Injecting three
milligrams of pancuronium.

207
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:31,114
Look at the monitors. He's still
seizing. We need to do this now.

208
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,252
Go!

209
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,138
Electrical seizure
activity's stopped.

210
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,873
Intracranial pressure's
declining. Come on, keep going.

211
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,943
Pressure's down to eight.

212
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,653
I'll go tell the dad.

213
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,958
What happened?

214
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,323
I have no idea.

215
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,563
He hasn't had any more seizures,

216
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:17,229
and cytological examination of the
subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.

217
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,535
Don't usually see brain
damage after a rectal biopsy.

218
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,075
He was fine after the procedure.

219
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,042
No headaches, no
mental status change.

220
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,305
It wasn't anything we did.

221
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,641
It's not just his brain.

222
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:30,411
He's continuing to build up fluid in his
abdominal cavity as well as the dura.

223
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,384
We've inserted
shunts to drain it.

224
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,580
It's got to be some sort
of systemic infection.

225
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:38,716
Not after spending the last week
getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.

226
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,761
You notice anything odd about
the shape of the fluid collection?

227
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,091
Oh, God.

228
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,964
Virgin Mary!

229
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,132
The edge should be
tapered, lens-shaped.

230
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:59,438
Unless the dural layer was
already separated from the brain

231
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,004
when the fluid
started to build up.

232
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,617
Get a dural biopsy to
confirm brain cancer.

233
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,254
Nice catch.

234
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,487
Bangkok. Flight 799.

235
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,728
Wow, Bangkok. That
sounds awesome. How long?

236
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,290
Not sure yet.

237
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:27,502
Luckily, I have a friend who's staying
at my place taking care of my dog.

238
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,066
He's really big, so he
needs a lot of exercise.

239
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,546
Remy Hadley. H-A-D-L-E-Y.

240
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,810
What, you think I'm
gonna rob the place?

241
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,408
No. Of course not.

242
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,087
In case you haven't
noticed, I have a job.

243
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,588
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't know you.

244
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,420
You're either honest or dishonest,
I figured the safer choice is to...

245
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,551
Is to treat a
stranger like an ass.

246
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,324
Nice way to live
your life. Bitch.

247
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,556
I said I'm sorry.

248
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:56,228
Oh! Hello. I was wondering if there
are any Business Class seats open

249
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,033
that I could use my
miles to upgrade to.

250
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,696
I don't know you,

251
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,039
but I assumed I could trust
you, welcomed you into my car.

252
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,942
Okay, you're a saint.

253
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,942
That's impossible, I confirmed
my reservation last night.

254
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,609
So re-book it.

255
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,114
Well, obviously, it was a
mistake on your end, not mine.

256
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,159
No. I'm on my way to
the airport right now.

257
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,558
They didn't believe you, huh?

258
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,095
Brain cancer?

259
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,038
We should know for
sure by the morning.

260
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,469
Our luck just keeps
getting worse, huh?

261
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,323
Treatment options are
getting better every day.

262
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,146
There's no visible mass, so even
if the biopsy comes back positive,

263
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,378
we've caught it early.

264
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,613
Oh, so, you're telling
me this is good news?

265
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,282
I'm saying we will
do whatever we can.

266
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,185
Right.

267
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,727
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,092
I gotta go. Foreman needs
more help with the M&M prep.

269
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,172
Okay. I'll come up and
help after I finish the biopsy.

270
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
We can handle it. I'll
see you at home later.

271
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,468
If you're here, I
might as well be.

272
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,603
Go home. Get some rest.

273
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,546
'Cause I'm gonna be waking
you up as soon as I get home.

274
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,519
Stay out of my life.

275
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,885
Okay.

276
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,621
I know you canceled
my reservation.

277
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,960
You obviously saw me log in when
you were spying on me in the coffee shop.

278
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,397
I was talking to you.

279
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,306
I was spying on the
MILF in the running shorts.

280
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,734
I'm not coming back on the team.

281
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,980
I don't want you
back on the team.

282
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,668
I cannot work for, with,
or around Foreman.

283
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,472
Which is why I don't
want you back on the team.

284
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,789
Now that you're out of the
picture, he's better than ever,

285
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,690
which is gonna make me
less miserable than ever,

286
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,376
which is why neither
of us gives a damn

287
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,682
how, when, or on what island in the
Bahamas you wanna get away from it all.

288
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,221
The Bahamas?

289
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,250
Costa Rica?

290
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,916
I told you, Thailand.

291
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,119
I assumed you were lying

292
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,255
because it would have been
idiotic of you to tell me the truth.

293
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,062
Yet another reason I
have no use for you.

294
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,496
We've got a problem.

295
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,507
When Cameron sent
Dibala's blood to the lab,

296
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,476
she specifically asked for the
anticentromere antibodies test.

297
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,738
So?

298
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,213
The printout they sent you included
just the anticentromere antibodies,

299
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,614
but the lab also did
a full blood panel.

300
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,619
So? I'm not an idiot.

301
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,846
I obviously made sure the cadaver I got
the sample from had the same blood type.

302
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,858
You apparently didn't
check his cholesterol.

303
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,484
How far off?

304
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,585
Twenty percent.

305
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,416
Dibala didn't die
of high cholesterol.

306
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,495
Why would anyone even bother
to compare the two reports?

307
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,078
The same reason I did.

308
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,265
Because they're looking for
anything we might've screwed up.

309
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,882
We could claim the
blood analyzer broke.

310
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,050
We can't.

311
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,095
Cameron documented that it was
perfectly calibrated when she did the test.

312
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,858
So the numbers are
off. It's weird, who cares?

313
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,365
If it comes up,
just act surprised,

314
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,298
like it's some
irrelevant curiosity.

315
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,362
I can't do this. I can't go in
there and stack lie upon lie.

316
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,138
You've got to figure
out a way to explain this.

317
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,576
Hey. Hey.

318
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,803
Missed you this
morning. Yeah, sorry.

319
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,491
I needed to get in early.
I didn't want to wake you.

320
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,835
I thought you did
want to wake me.

321
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,694
At least that's what you
said last night. I'm out of here.

322
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,052
No, no. I got the biopsy
results. It's not cancer.

323
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,491
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

324
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,032
Since when is cancer
being considered nothing?

325
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,966
I just said it's not cancer. The
cell morphologies were all normal.

326
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,731
And so are the most
recent CT scans.

327
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,203
On the other hand,

328
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,298
adenocarcinoma of the
stomach would cause pain,

329
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,539
constipation, and nutritional
deficiencies that could cause seizures.

330
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,706
And wouldn't show on a CT.

331
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,148
You were right about the
cancer, just wrong about the place.

332
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,150
Continue to say
nothing if you agree.

333
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,594
Go scope him, get
another set of biopsies.

334
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,728
I get canceling her ticket,

335
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:29,003
if you then showed up with
two more to somewhere better.

336
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,155
What are you talking about?

337
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,075
Or showed up at all.

338
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,081
But how does just ruining her
plans get her to agree to yours?

339
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,084
You talking about Thirteen?

340
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,450
Where's she going?

341
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,045
Nowhere this
week, thanks to you.

342
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,921
I didn't stop her. I'm
not gonna stop her.

343
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,126
I've already done all I could.
Now all I can do is move on.

344
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,895
I think I actually believe you.

345
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,340
If you're telling the truth,

346
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,536
you're even more
rational than I...

347
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,169
Well, not more.

348
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,949
Then again, more sane.

349
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,144
You're gonna be
a good boss, boss.

350
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,114
I told you, there's
nothing wrong.

351
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,556
There's obviously
something wrong,

352
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,603
and I'm not even saying we
need to talk about it right now.

353
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,119
I just don't see why
you have to deny it.

354
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,630
I'm not.

355
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,963
Now you're denying
you're denying.

356
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,367
No. I'm denying that
there's anything to deny.

357
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,031
Robert, you can't do this.
You can't hide things from me.

358
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,113
There's a problem
with the Dibala M&M.

359
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,309
The HDL numbers on one of his early
blood panels don't match a later panel.

360
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,682
That's weird.

361
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,615
Yeah.

362
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,855
It's no big deal.

363
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,924
Cholesterol didn't have
anything to do with his death,

364
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,432
but after being
let go from Mercy,

365
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,900
and then that thing
with Thirteen's drug trial,

366
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,614
Foreman's paranoid about people
questioning the way he handled the case.

367
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,050
Well, that's ridiculous. If anything,
Foreman should be feeling secure.

368
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,585
He's the one who had the right
diagnosis, we talked him out of it.

369
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,408
I know. Don't
tell him I told you.

370
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,724
He doesn't want to show
any signs of weakness,

371
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,651
especially now that House is
claiming he wants him to stay in charge.

372
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,880
All right.

373
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,048
So it's still cancer. It's
just somewhere else.

374
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,233
That's what we're looking for,

375
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,351
but it would explain
all the symptoms

376
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,657
and all the normal tests
and imaging studies.

377
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,324
Got biopsies of the
mucosa and the submucosa.

378
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,390
I'm moving towards the pylorus.

379
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,526
It's my fault.

380
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,230
Adenocarcinomas aren't caused
by diet or environmental factors.

381
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:47,346
I inherited a $10 million
pipeline business when I was 24.

382
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,346
By the time I was 30, it
was worth over a billion.

383
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,120
Since then, I have been
involved in over 50 deals

384
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,214
that make that first
one look like a loser.

385
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:03,226
Everything I do, everything
I touch, turns to gold,

386
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,494
except my family.

387
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,270
First, my wife and now my son.

388
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,075
This is my fault.

389
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,817
It's karma.

390
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,247
That's obviously not true.

391
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,017
He's seizing again.

392
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,391
Get the scope out.

393
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,396
We need five
milligrams diazepam.

394
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,829
How's the ICP?

395
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,423
It's eight.

396
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,297
But the shunt's open and clear.

397
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,337
This isn't
intracranial pressure.

398
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,463
Then what the hell is it?

399
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,280
Seizure's stopped, but he
hasn't regained consciousness.

400
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,649
No sign of any masses in his
stomach or esophageal lining.

401
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,917
And he's still accumulating
subdural and peritoneal fluid.

402
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,858
And every time we look to see where
it's coming from, he starts seizing.

403
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,725
You think we're
setting this off?

404
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,922
I think something is.

405
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,694
One of his stomach biopsies
shows an arteriole partially occluded.

406
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,511
But with no abnormality
in the other layers,

407
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,061
and no evidence of a
cellular inflammatory reaction.

408
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,299
It's definitely not cancer.

409
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,238
Then it has to be
some sort of infection.

410
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,901
We already ruled out infection.

411
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,639
Only because he was
treated for it and got worse.

412
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,805
Seems like a sound reason.

413
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,247
Unless it's a
drug-resistant strain.

414
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,649
Drug-resistant strain of what?

415
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,085
Bacterial cultures,
viral serologies,

416
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,486
ANA and ANCA were all negative.

417
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,922
Everything's negative. We
obviously missed something.

418
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,018
Maybe the seizures aren't a
new symptom, they're an old one.

419
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,790
No doctor noticed
a thrashing kid?

420
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,491
Abdominal epilepsy.

421
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,966
The seizures would just look like
pain until it spread to his motor cortex.

422
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,263
Wouldn't explain the fevers.

423
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,328
Protein malnutrition
can cause fevers.

424
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,602
And nothing causes malnutrition
like excruciating stomach pain

425
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,200
that gets worse
every time you eat.

426
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,646
I'd be a lot more certain if it was
my idea, but it's the best we got.

427
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,417
Start him on gabapentin,

428
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,286
hook him up to an intracranial
EEG for continuous monitoring.

429
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,295
I gave him statins.

430
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,461
What?

431
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,047
If they ask about the cholesterol,
just say I prescribed a statin

432
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,182
and forgot to
put it in the chart.

433
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,750
You want to solve a
problem in the records

434
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,970
by creating another
problem in the records?

435
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,153
There's no problem
with the records,

436
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,907
there's a problem
with my recordkeeping.

437
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,845
There's no way anyone
can prove me wrong.

438
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,384
How did you get
access to the statins?

439
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,476
You gonna get someone
in the pharmacy to confess

440
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,021
to yet another
recordkeeping problem?

441
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,648
I saw an open
cart. I just took it.

442
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,319
Why would you steal a drug
you can just as easily ask for?

443
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,387
'Cause I'm trying to
get you off the hook.

444
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,090
A story that raises more
questions than it answers

445
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,034
only puts the hook
deeper down my throat.

446
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,764
It's all right. I'll handle it.

447
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,228
How?

448
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,340
By telling the truth.

449
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,036
The truth is, I
don't have the time,

450
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,078
I'm not in the mood,
and I don't see the point.

451
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,614
You don't want to do the M&M
because you're not in the mood?

452
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,681
This kid is dying,

453
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,388
and I've got House trying to push
all his responsibilities onto me.

454
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:15,013
They're not his
responsibilities, they're yours.

455
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,398
You're the one who
wanted to be in charge.

456
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,857
I wanted to be in
charge, not a figurehead.

457
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,916
Then do the M&M, it's all yours.

458
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,894
You want me to get
flogged? For what?

459
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,430
So you can have
an academic debate

460
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,160
about a diagnostic dilemma
no one's ever gonna face again?

461
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,731
What the hell's going on here?

462
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,069
I just don't want to do the M&M.

463
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,477
Did it work?

464
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,706
Not even close.

465
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,994
Everything okay?

466
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,431
Just waiting for whatever
is about to go wrong.

467
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,661
Thirteen called.

468
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,728
She have a theory that makes
more sense than abdominal epilepsy?

469
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,330
She said someone hacked
into her e-mail account

470
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,070
and canceled her
airline reservation.

471
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,475
I'm guessing Foreman.

472
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,568
Really?

473
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,177
You're accusing
Foreman, not me. Cool.

474
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,978
You really want Foreman
to stay in charge of the team?

475
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,647
Makes sense.

476
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,385
He loves power, I love puzzles.

477
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,487
You love power and puzzles.

478
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,289
True.

479
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,758
And when I had them both...

480
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,667
It wasn't Foreman.

481
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,767
How do you know?

482
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,209
He said he's moved on.

483
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,179
And you believe him?

484
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,307
I believe that he believes him.

485
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,055
Looks like it's time for
me to get off the bench.

486
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,132
What's up?

487
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,530
Are you Dr. House?

488
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,332
I understand you're a big fan.

489
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,566
I'll have my guy send
over a signed glossy.

490
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,668
Continuous EEG shows no interictal
spikes. It's not abdominal epilepsy.

491
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,337
You paged me to
tell me what it's not?

492
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,041
I paged you to show you this.

493
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,744
That, I did not expect.

494
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,188
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

495
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,885
Darn it. I knew I
should've stayed outside.

496
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,770
The fantasy is always
much better than the reality.

497
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,786
You think this is a
joke? That's my son.

498
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:42,392
He's dying, and not one of you
seem to have the slightest clue why.

499
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:45,632
I know. That's why
it's so interesting.

500
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,268
Fever, stomach pain, seizures,

501
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,213
peritoneal and subdural
fluid collection and now spots.

502
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,307
Could be an allergic
reaction to one of his meds.

503
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,217
That suddenly developed eight
hours after he started the meds?

504
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,585
If it's not cancer or infection,
it has to be autoimmune.

505
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,124
Systemic lupus complicated
by a CNS vasculitis

506
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,888
would explain the
rash, fever, ascites...

507
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,795
CNS vasculitis would cause a
stiff neck along with the headache.

508
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,663
And would've showed
up on the dural biopsy.

509
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,827
What about polyarteritis
nodosa? It can occur in kids.

510
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,635
Except you can't have
arteritis without inflammation.

511
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:24,438
Okay, you come up
with something better.

512
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,005
Go on.

513
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,981
There was some
inflammation in the skin biopsy.

514
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,984
Plus he's got elevated
diastolic pressure.

515
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,519
It's barely elevated,

516
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,065
which you'd expect given the
number of procedures he's undergone.

517
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,752
Well, barely is
more than not barely.

518
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,057
Not my decision.

519
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,564
But if it was, I'd say
start him on prednisone

520
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,603
and get a testicular biopsy.

521
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,376
If he's gonna have any real
inflammation, it'll be down there.

522
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,498
Cameron and I will do it.

523
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,667
Why? It was Chase's idea.

524
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,439
Kid's father is not gonna be
happy about a fourth set of biopsies,

525
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,980
and you've got a better rapport.

526
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,346
What's really going on here?

527
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,015
You need Chase to help
you over-prep for the M&M?

528
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,212
Yes.

529
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,488
Then say so, don't be a child.

530
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,388
Is it on his penis?

531
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,324
The kid's rash?

532
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,797
Yeah, why?

533
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,233
Means it's most likely
affecting the small blood vessels.

534
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:27,034
That's why we didn't see any
inflammation on the biopsies.

535
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,542
It's not polyarteritis,
it's Degos disease.

536
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,252
I'll do it.

537
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,661
Your son has Degos disease.

538
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:00,004
It causes micro-blood
vessels in the brain,

539
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,839
skin, and GI tract to
break down, clot off.

540
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:11,483
It sometimes manifests early on
with atrophic papules on the penis.

541
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,011
In your son's case, we don't know
why, but they came much later.

542
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,954
What's the treatment?

543
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,887
There isn't one.

544
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,920
It's incurable.

545
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,828
You're wrong.

546
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,000
You've already been
wrong a bunch of times.

547
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,711
We rechecked the
biopsies. It's definitely Degos.

548
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,619
I'm sorry. I wish there
was something we could do.

549
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,593
How long?

550
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,526
Not much longer.

551
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,600
What does that mean?

552
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,434
A day at the most.

553
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,514
All right. Great.

554
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,213
We need to talk.

555
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,198
Unless it's life or death,
it's gonna have to wait.

556
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,986
It's about Dibala.

557
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,889
Let me rephrase,
unless it's a current...

558
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,622
Foreman can't present
the case at the M&M.

559
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,059
I know you guys are busy, but he's just
gonna have to suck it up and make the time.

560
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,133
It's not the time.

561
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,692
Then what is it?

562
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,568
The anticentromere
antibodies test,

563
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,539
the test that caused us
to change the treatment

564
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:20,841
from blastomycosis to
scleroderma, it wasn't...

565
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,175
It wasn't what?

566
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,118
Dr. Cuddy, they need
you in the Pediatric ICU.

567
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,676
Who's they? I don't know,

568
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,018
but I think they're lawyers.

569
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,552
If you guys screwed
something up, just come clean.

570
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,791
It's not gonna be that bad.

571
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,161
With all due respect, you
don't know what's at stake here.

572
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,069
What's going on?
You need to stop him.

573
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,259
He's about to ruin his life.

574
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,740
Like you give a
damn about my life.

575
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,003
Roy, he's right.

576
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,137
You're borrowing money to buy
options that are already out of the money.

577
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,044
Even you won't be
able to cover the losses.

578
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,516
Your house, cars, bank
accounts, you'll lose everything.

579
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,246
That's the point.

580
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:06,814
The billionaire thinks that the gods
will treat him better if he's broke.

581
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,155
I suggested he give it to me...

582
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,525
There has got to be
some sort of balance.

583
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,759
You can't have all the good
fortune in just one area of your life.

584
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,734
That's not how the
world's supposed to work.

585
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,312
Who said the world
was supposed to work?

586
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,856
Don't just wipe everything out.

587
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,874
Put your assets in a trust,

588
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,518
give it to a charity... I
can't get anything back.

589
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,773
He's insane. He's irrational,

590
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,973
so are most people. Unfortunately,
it doesn't make them insane.

591
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,814
If he signs that paper, he's not
only gonna destroy his own life,

592
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,286
but the lives of thousands of people
who rely on this company to make a living.

593
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,118
If he is insane, we
will sue this hospital...

594
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,091
Mr. Randall,

595
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,497
I know you're upset, but you shouldn't
make a decision like this right now.

596
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,260
Give it some time.

597
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,298
My son doesn't have any time.

598
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,770
Your son's dying from an
incurable disease, not bad karma.

599
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,775
No. He's not dying.

600
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,901
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

601
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,105
Roy.

602
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,512
Please.

603
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:10,552
I'm sorry. I can't let him die.

604
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,689
People don't get
what they deserve.

605
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:17,354
They just get what they get, and
there's nothing any of us can do about it.

606
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:29,908
Deliver it, or I'll make sure you
end up the ones with nothing.

607
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,552
Call a code. He's flat-lining.

608
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,202
Thanks.

609
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,867
You're welcome. For what?

610
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,772
For thinking I was worth
breaking the law to keep around.

611
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,580
That's just the way I am.

612
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,460
But still don't know
what you're talking about.

613
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:17,218
Cuddy had IT trace all the IP addresses
who've logged into my e-mail account.

614
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,623
There were two. Mine and yours.

615
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,772
Obviously House decided he
needs you more than he's willing to...

616
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,355
I already asked House.

617
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,664
And he'd certainly never lie.

618
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,170
No, he'd lie. Except
he wants me gone.

619
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,106
And he'd do a lot better
job of lying than you just did.

620
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,666
Really? It was that bad?

621
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,405
No, actually.

622
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:47,475
But it doesn't matter anymore.
Why? Because of House or Foreman?

623
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,517
You're good for both of them,
but Foreman's not my best friend.

624
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,355
House will be fine.

625
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,025
Maybe.

626
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,393
But with you on the
team, he'd be better.

627
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:03,128
He needs someone
who doesn't need him.

628
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,764
You're the only one he's never really been
able to suck into his crazy House vortex.

629
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,707
Keeps him grounded,
his ego in check.

630
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,243
Why didn't you just come to me?

631
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:20,482
I figured you'd only stay if House
asked. And I knew he would, eventually.

632
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,556
Bye, Wilson.

633
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,692
This is a great job.

634
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,489
Maybe even better, now
that House is at least trying

635
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,035
to have real
relationships with people.

636
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,327
I said trying.

637
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,064
It doesn't matter.

638
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,404
The job you love doesn't matter?

639
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,634
Don't throw it all away just
because of a bad breakup.

640
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,149
Bye, Wilson.

641
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,557
I just confessed.

642
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,633
I told Thirteen I was the one
who canceled the plane ticket.

643
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,724
Why?

644
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,066
You mean why did I
confess, or why did I do it?

645
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:15,369
I know you didn't do
it, so I guess the first.

646
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,344
You want her to stay because you
want her back, or because Foreman does?

647
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,645
Why would I care
what Foreman wants?

648
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,479
Because you're not as big
a jerk as everyone thinks.

649
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,574
Yes, I am.

650
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,983
No, you're not.

651
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,455
I just made a $10,000 short sale
on a stock I know is gonna crash

652
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,154
because of what I saw a grief-stricken
dad do on his son's deathbed.

653
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,525
No, you didn't.

654
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,619
Yes, I did.

655
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,424
You are a jerk.

656
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,393
She's making a mistake.

657
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,801
So you did it for her?

658
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,361
She's a good doctor.

659
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,340
So you did it for you?

660
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,376
I'm not the one in
charge any more.

661
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,469
So you did it for Foreman?

662
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,243
She's a smoking-hot,
newly-single bisexual.

663
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,080
Why don't you just admit that
you like having her around?

664
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,813
She's good for
you. You need her.

665
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,482
Because I was born with a
heart three sizes too small.

666
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,253
No, you weren't. Yes, I...

667
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:11,662
What?

668
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,679
He still alive?

669
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,908
Yeah.

670
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:33,916
Good. Start him on heparin
and IV immunoglobulin.

671
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,578
For Degos? The cardiac arrest

672
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,350
wasn't just an "everything goes
to hell in a hand basket" arrest.

673
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,915
It was a coronary event.
Coronaries are large vessels.

674
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,654
Means it can't be Degos.

675
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,871
But the biopsies confirmed...

676
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,591
Obstructed blood vessels.

677
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,189
They can't be obstructed
because of Degos.

678
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,236
Means it's primary
antiphospholipid syndrome.

679
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,104
Are you sure? Nope.

680
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,877
But I will be if he responds to
the heparin and immunoglobulin.

681
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,843
By the way,

682
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,012
someone screwed
over your girlfriend,

683
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,546
and she ran to me, Cuddy,
and Wilson, everyone but you.

684
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,390
She's not over you.

685
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,494
Or she is.

686
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,460
Where did you find it?

687
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,586
Find what?

688
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,527
Niacin-bound
chromium supplements.

689
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,398
It was right on top of the
file. You don't know about it?

690
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,461
No, been here all night.

691
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,399
One of Dibala's previous docs
was prescribing ultra-high doses

692
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,138
of niacin-bound
chromium to boost his HDL.

693
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,407
So?

694
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,471
So, it gives us
something to point to.

695
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,347
We can explain the wide
variation between the HDL numbers.

696
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,081
We're safe. We're covered.

697
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,148
You really didn't
request the info?

698
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,551
No.

699
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,960
And obviously you didn't either,

700
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,022
which means...

701
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,535
It worked.

702
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,867
The medicine worked.

703
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,438
It worked.

704
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,688
How did you find it?

705
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,224
Fat, old, black guy.

706
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,423
I knew he had to be taking
something for his cholesterol.

707
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,991
And what now?

708
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,735
I'm not the boss.

709
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,568
You don't think I
should be fired?

710
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,800
Why?

711
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:46,538
I doubt we'll ever be treating
a genocidal dictator again.

712
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,738
Better a murder
than a misdiagnosis.

713
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,849
Whether you want
to be in charge or not,

714
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,988
you are.

715
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,892
And you always will be.

716
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,712
75-year-old African man
presented to our hospital

717
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,579
following a rapid
onset of hemoptysis.

718
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,744
He had been fine prior to onset.

719
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,017
No chest pain, fever,
coughing or chills.

720
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:34,726
He does note a
nine-hour plane flight...
