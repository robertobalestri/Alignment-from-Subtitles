1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,904
We will anger the Americans
slipping out like this.

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,934
If your son was a student

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,411
at one of the greatest
universities in the world...

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,573
So make him come to you.

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,680
We are protected near the UN.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,150
But once we cross 42nd Street...

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,382
As always, I appreciate
your caution, Joseph.

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,516
But as always, you
have far too much of it.

9
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,806
Stay down, sir.

10
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,255
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

11
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,085
I'm just serving process!

12
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,357
Your boss is being
sued under Title 18

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,127
of the United States
Code, section 1350,

14
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:10,830
for genocide, crimes
against humanity, and torture.

15
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,306
Mr. President, this
is only a civil lawsuit.

16
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,972
We can ignore it.

17
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,547
Mr. President.

18
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,087
You want us to work for Foreman?

19
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,718
Not permanently.

20
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,989
He is setting up interviews

21
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,360
to replace Taub and Thirteen,

22
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,898
but it might take
a couple of weeks.

23
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, what happened to them?

24
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,494
He quit, and I
had to let her go.

25
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,471
You actually fired
your girlfriend?

26
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,631
Yes.

27
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,867
You two are both competent,

28
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,118
and I know I can work with you.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,202
You really do know how to woo.

30
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,075
I need you.

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,546
It would be interesting.

32
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,775
And we could work together.

33
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,579
Did you see who the patient is?

34
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,711
That's one of the
reasons it'll be interesting.

35
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,654
Dibala is one of the most
repressive dictators in the world.

36
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,748
You had no problem
treating a guy on death row.

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,669
Who was still in prison
after we patched him up.

38
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,025
We fix Dibala,
he gets on a plane

39
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,392
and executes half his country.

40
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,693
He's been repressing an
ethnic rebellion in the south,

41
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,859
the Sitibi people.

42
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,725
It's getting worse.

43
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,237
Dibala is a guest of
the US government,

44
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,500
and he's been invited
to speak at the UN.

45
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,041
I'm not asking you to love him,

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,407
I'm asking you to do your job.

47
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,339
Utterly incomprehensible.

48
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,585
And, of course, I'm talking
about you firing your girlfriend.

49
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,652
We weren't getting along
with her working under me.

50
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,622
This'll help. Cameron
and I worked together.

51
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,885
But you weren't her boss,

52
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,619
and you stopped
working together.

53
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,504
Why don't you just tell
her you were wrong and...

54
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,258
Because I wasn't.

55
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,888
I know how this looks.

56
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,762
I know it might break us up.

57
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,611
But that's better than
definitely breaking us up,

58
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,434
which is what would've
happened otherwise.

59
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,201
Hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.

60
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,909
Oh, my God, it's
three years ago.

61
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,608
Does that mean I'm still crazy?

62
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,684
You're back?

63
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,118
You look good.

64
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,088
We're just helping
out because... I know.

65
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,521
I just ran into Thirteen

66
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,491
while she was
clearing out her locker.

67
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,925
My condolences.

68
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,172
Although it's not like she's
the hottest woman in the world.

69
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,132
We haven't broken
up. Are you back?

70
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,065
Sort of. You get
your license back?

71
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,466
Not for a month or so.

72
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,165
So you'll be in charge, I'm
just gonna pitch in a little.

73
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,138
Dibala thinks it was an
assassination attempt.

74
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,042
Polonium, like the
Russian guy in London.

75
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,446
FBI checked the service of
process forms and his hotel room.

76
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,143
No radioactivity trails.

77
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,310
Acid reflux?

78
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,512
No history of
asthma or heartburn.

79
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,021
He has a bug bite on his hands.

80
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,332
Malaria's endemic
in his country.

81
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,984
Let's start him on Coartem.

82
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,399
I don't want to
step on any toes,

83
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,745
but I guess I do have a
higher duty to the patient.

84
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,397
If you have something
to say, say it.

85
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,836
You're rushing to a diagnosis

86
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,049
because you're
rushing out of this room

87
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,632
because you're
rightly upset with me.

88
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,019
Although I wasn't the one who
made that asinine decision to...

89
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,569
Do you have anything
medical to say?

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,545
Poison fits better
because of the vomiting.

91
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,209
Bug bite might not be a bite,

92
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,877
it might be the
start of chloracne.

93
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,820
Assassination attempt
through dioxin poisoning.

94
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,290
It's hard to detect. Fits.

95
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,795
Start him on olestra.

96
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,267
You couldn't have just
said dioxin up front?

97
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,102
I was hoping you'd
get there on your own.

98
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,605
So, I guess we
should talk to Cuddy.

99
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,345
You are sure it is dioxin?

100
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,247
Nope.

101
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,723
It's our best guess. The
olestra here binds to the poison,

102
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,419
flushes it out of your system.

103
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,722
Where are you from, doctor?

104
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,194
I'm Australian.

105
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,288
Do I hear a bit of British?

106
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,128
Most people don't notice it.

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,169
Yeah, I kicked around
there for a while.

108
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,033
You went to
medical school there?

109
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,867
Actually, a year of seminary.

110
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,170
And you left. Uh-huh.

111
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,407
There was a Catholic mission
near my childhood village.

112
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,177
I liked the priests.
They were good people.

113
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,654
But when my two younger sisters
were dying from consumption,

114
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,156
it wasn't more
priests we wanted.

115
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,762
I fired my girlfriend because
he said he was gone for good.

116
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,428
I need this in my life.

117
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,494
A week ago, it was the
last thing you needed.

118
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,563
It's a process. I'm learning.

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,074
And screwing me over as you go.

120
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,372
Yeah, that's why I did it.

121
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,212
Sorry.

122
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,442
If you want, I'll
explain it to Thirteen.

123
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,610
He's not ready. He
doesn't have his license.

124
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,487
Then he can't practice. But
we'd be idiots not to listen to him.

125
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,584
You're in charge. He sits
in on all the differentials.

126
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,653
Until you get your license
back, this is all unofficial.

127
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,165
No procedures,
no patient contact.

128
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,094
I think I can probably
deal with that last one.

129
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,667
The only reason I let you go

130
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,440
is because our
relationship wouldn't work

131
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,538
if I was in charge.

132
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,848
But I won't be in charge soon

133
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,512
so I came to offer
your old job back.

134
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:07,094
I know I look bad, but
circumstances have changed.

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,321
I don't want the job.

136
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,419
Why not?

137
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,955
Because there's a much simpler
explanation for you firing me.

138
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,143
You wanted to break up with me,

139
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,329
but you were too
weak to do it yourself.

140
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,271
Then why would I
try to hire you back?

141
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,309
Can we please get
some dinner tonight?

142
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,468
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,581
Uh...

144
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,108
You're a follow-up?

145
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,484
You must not treat him.

146
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,092
Dibala killed my wife.

147
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,754
She was a trade unionist.

148
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,925
They took her from our
home while I was at work.

149
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,026
Who took her?

150
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,470
Dibala's Youth Labor League.

151
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,202
He pretends it's to get
young people off the street,

152
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,837
but he takes teenage
boys from the provinces

153
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,905
and feeds them drugs and alcohol

154
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,644
and teaches them how to torture.

155
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,480
They dumped her body
in my yard two weeks later.

156
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,922
They raped her.

157
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,920
They carved
<i>"inyenzi",</i> cockroach,

158
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,965
onto her stomach
because she's Sitibi.

159
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,762
I'm very sorry, but I can't
discuss other patients.

160
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,360
You should talk to a
lawyer, talk to the UN...

161
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,634
So they can sit and watch
like they did in Rwanda?

162
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,675
There are two million Sitibi.

163
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,270
He is planning to
massacre them all.

164
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,975
His radio stations
are talking about

165
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,780
a final war to exterminate
the cockroaches.

166
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,519
He can't recover.

167
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,927
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,933
How was your
first day of school?

169
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,206
Didn't pee once in the sandbox.

170
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,467
How was it with Cuddy?

171
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,702
What did you think
I was talking about?

172
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:03,800
Hmm.

173
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,008
You didn't use garlic. You
didn't use it last night either.

174
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,812
We always use garlic
on Chicken Florentine.

175
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,079
It tastes fine this way.

176
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,882
You seem to be losing
your sense of smell.

177
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,650
I think you're losing
your sense of mind.

178
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,193
I can check right now
if you pull my finger.

179
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,852
No, it's the...

180
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,464
Are you inventing some
big medical mystery here?

181
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,969
Because if you're
imagining things again...

182
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,198
You weren't wearing
shoes last night either.

183
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:39,010
Yes, shoes, garlic, I
am vampire, Sookie.

184
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,917
I told you to get
that echo fixed.

185
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,687
My downstairs neighbor,
after you moved in,

186
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,787
started complaining about the
extra noise and the cooking smells.

187
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:57,956
What's his name?

188
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,023
I don't want you
making things worse.

189
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,193
He's on the condo board,

190
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,147
and I'm trying to get the
back garden renovated.

191
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,762
The white coats taught
me a whole bunch

192
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,501
of fun coping
and relating skills.

193
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,803
He's not only a total jerk,

194
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,835
he's a decorated war hero
who lost an arm in Vietnam.

195
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,746
I mean, there's no
winning with this guy.

196
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,785
Coping skill number
one, complete avoidance.

197
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,943
You happy?

198
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,489
Booty call? Give me 20
minutes to not shower.

199
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,802
Patient's having a heart attack.

200
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,826
Mask and 15 liters.

201
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,174
Just thought you'd like to know.

202
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,423
Streptokinase. Heparin.

203
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,339
Lassa fever.

204
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,487
You were mad that
I withheld it last time,

205
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,980
so I'm saying it right up front.

206
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,380
He's already stabilized,
so 40ccs of ribavirin,

207
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,975
and we're home
in time for <i>Ellen.</i>

208
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,816
I checked. There's no
Lassa in Dibala's country.

209
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,481
Oh. The rash is gone.

210
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,525
It rules out your dioxin theory.

211
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,718
He's running a slight fever,

212
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,057
which we can add to the
heart, plus the lung ulcers.

213
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,357
Ebola? Marburg?

214
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,897
Too long an
incubation period and...

215
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,193
Yes?

216
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,327
Don't people sometimes travel
to places that have, you know,

217
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,338
a fever that originated in
the Nigerian town of Lassa?

218
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,874
He's been to three other
countries in the last two years.

219
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,400
Here, Zimbabwe and Sharm
el-Sheikh, Egypt. No Lassa there either.

220
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,743
Oh. Again.

221
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,076
Trypanosomiasis?

222
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,346
No sleep disturbances, but
it fits best with his symptoms

223
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,546
and it's geographically
the most... What?

224
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,112
The Egypt visit was for
the African Union meeting,

225
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,217
where I'm guessing he was
"meeting" people from "Africa",

226
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,625
which includes Liberia,

227
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,472
which sent some members
of their foreign ministry

228
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,728
which has itself just been
hit by an outbreak of jock itch.

229
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,258
No, wait, not jock
itch. Lassa fever.

230
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,667
I'll start the ribavirin.

231
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,368
I did say it up front.

232
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,470
It's great to have the old
team back together again, huh?

233
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,453
Yesterday, it's poisoning,

234
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,818
today, Lassa fever.

235
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,981
Maybe a specialist...

236
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,117
Joseph, leave him alone.

237
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,755
These people know
what they are doing.

238
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,291
Are you married, doctor?

239
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,459
No.

240
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,866
You have a girlfriend?

241
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,570
Yes.

242
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,472
Judging by your tentative answer

243
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,978
and the complicated
expression on her face,

244
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,344
I believe that is she
standing in the hallway.

245
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,313
I got a call from Douglas'
department at Princeton General.

246
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,586
They want me to
interview with them.

247
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,499
Which is weird because
when I called last week,

248
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,871
they said they had
nothing available,

249
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,558
so I never sent in my resume.

250
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,498
Douglas owes me a favor.

251
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,035
Most people send chocolates.

252
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,780
And I'd stand outside your apartment
all night holding up a boom box

253
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,501
except you told me
you hate '80s music.

254
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,410
So about dinner, I'm
free tomorrow night.

255
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,338
I was wondering what that
noise was. It's the damn cane.

256
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,538
And I'm Greg.

257
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,343
And I can't sleep with you
banging around with that thing.

258
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,918
You're not actually saying
that I have too loud a cane?

259
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,546
Is that hard for
you to understand?

260
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,523
Well, only in the sense
that it has a rubber tip

261
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,024
on the end, not a tap shoe.

262
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,618
Now you're getting cute with me.

263
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:53,463
Okay, we started badly.
I apologize for the noise

264
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,559
and we will try to figure
out a way to be quieter.

265
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,195
And a thousand other things
I don't give a crap about.

266
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,833
Now you keep it down or
we're going to have trouble.

267
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,741
Wow.

268
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,180
You paged me?

269
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:19,521
This is Ama. She is from our
country, but she lives here now.

270
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,390
We'd like you to use her blood.

271
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,690
For what?

272
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:27,063
She recovered from
Lassa fever two years ago.

273
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,931
Our Health Minister
has advised us

274
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,460
that plasma from one
who has the antibodies

275
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,598
is much more
effective than ribavirin.

276
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,234
This is a signed consent form.

277
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,939
Will you take her blood, please?

278
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,106
No.

279
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,214
I want to do this.

280
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,119
You understand that we
will be using your blood

281
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,089
to cure President Dibala.

282
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,682
I know.

283
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,421
Are you from the Sitibi people?

284
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,655
I am Sitibi.

285
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,005
Did they threaten
you in some way?

286
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,207
Your family members back home?

287
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,395
Please let me give
the blood. Please.

288
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,968
Do it.

289
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,336
She's being coerced.

290
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,239
If she is,

291
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,300
I'd rather have a needle
prick on my conscience

292
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,937
than the death of
her family members.

293
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,538
Hey! Don't let him in there!

294
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,447
That's enough, we got him.

295
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,614
Hey.

296
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,026
You all right?

297
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,891
Who is that man?

298
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,198
He shot him?

299
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,329
No.

300
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,044
You need a lawyer.

301
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,877
You can get a court-appointed.

302
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,110
I can help you.

303
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,243
I can't be helped.

304
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,655
You did a stupid,
terrible thing.

305
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,824
But given the
circumstances with your wife,

306
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,657
you could get a
reduced sentence.

307
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,489
She wasn't my wife.

308
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,964
Well, who was she?

309
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,699
They never told us her name.

310
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,040
What his men made
us do to that woman,

311
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:03,884
he is now going to
do to all the Sitibi.

312
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,303
You could have gotten killed.

313
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,404
He wasn't going to hurt me.

314
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,727
He fired a gun in the hospital.

315
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,664
Come here.

316
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,366
Maybe next time, don't
yell out that warning.

317
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,939
The bloody eye was from an enlarged
lymph node blocking the retinal vein.

318
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,417
We restored circulation,

319
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,229
but it means we've got
to add lymph involvement

320
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,052
to the heart and
lungs, and rising fever.

321
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,317
I'm just going to
sit here quietly.

322
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,022
Why?

323
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,859
I feel like I've been inadvertently
undermining your authority.

324
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,299
So I'm just gonna observe.
I'm not gonna say a word.

325
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,796
The heart could
point to sarcoidosis.

326
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:04,207
I'm thinking the X-rays indicate
a lack of hilar adenopathy,

327
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,649
which rules it out.

328
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,155
Staph aureus?

329
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,149
No.

330
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:18,191
Because he smokes?

331
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,764
He's miming a thermometer.

332
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,463
He says the fever's
not high enough.

333
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,532
So some other infection.

334
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,699
He's wrong.

335
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,265
The fever could be misleading
us into thinking infection.

336
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,573
Talk.

337
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,283
It could all fit with lymphoma.

338
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,324
I need you to spread your
legs so I can do an "H".

339
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,765
Can't be lymphoma.
LDH is normal.

340
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,993
He's got good liver function,

341
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,162
it's masking the
elevated levels.

342
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,762
Biopsy the lymph
node. Check it out.

343
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,103
Makes sense. Guess
you don't need me.

344
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,773
Oh. By the way, you might
want to close the blinds.

345
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,342
It's really bright in here.

346
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,720
It's just a wild coincidence

347
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,458
that he thought
you were a rude jerk.

348
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,908
Come on, give me
the benefit of the doubt.

349
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,833
You said he's a
jerk. I barely talked.

350
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,267
You talked!

351
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,369
All I wanted was to
sip morning espresso

352
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,273
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

353
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,108
You could be sipping Courvoisier

354
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,273
next to a replica of
the Playboy grotto

355
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,180
if you tell him what
you got on him.

356
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,946
I don't have anything on him.

357
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,213
I don't want anything on him.

358
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,687
Closest he's been to Vietnam,

359
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,953
ordering the Mee Krob
at that place on the corner.

360
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,425
Mee Krob is from Thailand.

361
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,552
Exactly.

362
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,893
What did you do? Why
do you think he's faking?

363
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,158
I saw his mail.

364
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,290
You broke in?

365
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:05,498
No. He was holding it. Private
medical insurance, not from the VA.

366
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,739
Plus he's gotta be early 50s.

367
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,039
He's too young to be a
vet. So, I looked further.

368
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,110
You did break in.

369
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,271
Online.

370
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,210
There's no reference to
him in any of the vet records.

371
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,648
Why would he fake
being a veteran?

372
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,982
Well, just look
how you're acting.

373
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,079
People have been tiptoeing
around this jerk for years.

374
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,784
Normally, we'd all tell the
amputee to go screw himself.

375
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,851
Victims get pity. Heroes
get adulation. It's way better.

376
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,008
Thank you for trying to help
me out with my neighbor.

377
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,326
Now forget the Vietnam stuff.

378
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,491
I could prove this.

379
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,330
But you won't because
you'll be too busy

380
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,892
writing him a letter of apology

381
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,303
and dropping it at his door,
without knocking at his door.

382
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,932
I didn't do anything.
That guy's a total ass.

383
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,240
Which is the point. It's easy
to be nice to people you like,

384
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:50,306
but being nice to people
you hate, that's a skill. Do it.

385
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,784
Thank you for saving my life.

386
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,685
The man that tried to kill you,

387
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,059
he said that you were
preparing a massacre.

388
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,236
The Sitibi are my countrymen.

389
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,431
I am fighting a guerrilla war.

390
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,998
In a way that's being
called genocide.

391
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:22,280
Twenty years ago, these same
Sitibi rebels took over the south.

392
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,783
They massacred
tens of thousands,

393
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,614
and they would
happily do it again.

394
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,622
I'm trying to impose order.

395
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,818
I'm trying to prevent
a genocide. Genocide.

396
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:42,024
My own son, my youngest,
he is a student here.

397
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,831
He hasn't spoken to me in years

398
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,702
because of what he
read in your newspapers.

399
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,901
But what he read is not true.

400
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,444
What about your
Youth Labor League?

401
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,178
There, I was at fault.

402
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,451
I hired men who, in their
zeal, stepped over the line,

403
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,524
and there were abuses.

404
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,463
But that will not happen again.

405
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,543
Hello?

406
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,543
How's it going?

407
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,551
Normal-looking nucleus.

408
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,484
How's it going with you?

409
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,664
It worried me when you joked

410
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,088
about letting that
man shoot Dibala.

411
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,818
I wasn't joking.

412
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,793
You can't want to kill anyone,

413
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,938
especially not your own patient.

414
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,487
It's only natural to feel...

415
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,156
No, it's completely unnatural.

416
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,825
Only psychopaths
can kill other people

417
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,459
without having some
sort of breakdown.

418
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,367
Not when it's justified.
Look at soldiers.

419
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,872
Even when it's justified.

420
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,500
Am I trying to kill our
patient? Of course not.

421
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,253
But if he died, am I
supposed to just pretend

422
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,008
that wouldn't be
good for the world?

423
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,683
The cells are neatly
differentiated. This isn't lymphoma.

424
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,157
I thought I had detected the
sickly sweet smell of maple syrup

425
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,624
and socialized medicine.

426
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,787
It smells like victory.

427
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,301
That big flag in your place prompted
me to chat with your housekeeper.

428
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,100
Turns out you're a citizen
of the Great White North.

429
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,572
You broke into my apartment?

430
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,974
Technically, no.
Well, technically, yeah,

431
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,568
but two steps, hardly...

432
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,669
You're going to jail.

433
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,544
Speaking of, you
know what can get you

434
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,550
six months and a $100,000 fine?

435
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,082
Falsely claiming that you
won a medal in Vietnam.

436
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,247
You think I'm faking?

437
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,986
Canada did not send troops
to fight in Vietnam, you idiot.

438
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,390
They sent troops to reinforce
the '73 Peace Accords,

439
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,629
which is where I tried
to free a 12-year-old boy

440
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,637
who stepped on a land mine.

441
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,367
Thirty-six years later, every
second I feel pain in my hand

442
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,102
like I'm still grabbing
that boy's arm

443
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,735
even though my arm isn't there.

444
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,679
So, no, I'm not faking.

445
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,409
Oh.

446
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,782
On a related note,
go Maple Leafs.

447
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,302
Did you get the biopsy results?

448
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,496
Is it lymphoma?

449
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,661
No.

450
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,604
So we have to move on.

451
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,574
Infection, perhaps autoimmune...

452
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,703
Did you get the biopsy results?

453
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,680
Yes, I just told you.

454
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,375
Is it lymphoma?

455
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,451
Cameron and Chase?

456
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,354
They both really
like diagnostics,

457
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:02,088
and I think they both really
like watching House torture me.

458
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,495
Anyway, thank you for
understanding about the job.

459
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,903
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

460
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,200
There was a third.

461
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,468
What's that?

462
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,406
You could have stepped aside.

463
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,977
We both would
have lost our jobs.

464
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,191
You could have asked Cameron
or Chase to take your place.

465
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,444
They wouldn't have wanted to.

466
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,645
You just said they both
really like diagnostics.

467
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,421
You want to go back in time?

468
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,481
I want to make this work.

469
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,587
I want to understand you. I mean,
you know how you made me feel.

470
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,492
If you could do it again...

471
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,394
I made the right decision.

472
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:01,877
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

473
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,788
Is the President capable
of thinking clearly?

474
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,560
Obviously not right now.

475
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,723
Will he ever be?

476
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,964
I think...

477
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,730
Neurons don't grow back,
and he's already in his decline.

478
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,217
Anything he tells you, any command
he gives, how will you ever know

479
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:26,201
it's not just the delusions of
a sick, mad, dying, old man?

480
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,922
<i>He just started spiking a fever.</i>

481
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,457
It's scleroderma.

482
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,891
You don't have some clever
way of telling me this time?

483
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,527
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

484
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,471
Look at his skin. It's
tight for a 75-year-old.

485
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,738
Based on his admission
photo? Bit subjective.

486
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,334
Fever points to infection.

487
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,903
And now he's got nodules on
his fingers. That's blastomycosis.

488
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,712
Nodules? You're calling
tight skin subjective?

489
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,808
I'm with Foreman.

490
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,596
We would have seen
fungus balls on the head CT.

491
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,054
Fungal lesions can be missed.

492
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,232
We could settle
this with a test.

493
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,418
Anticentromere antibodies
would point to scleroderma.

494
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,724
Point to, not prove. And his fever's
too high. We have to treat him now.

495
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,232
If we treat wrong, we could
send this disease into overdrive.

496
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,790
You're with me on
the scleroderma?

497
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,811
I guess. I just don't care
enough about the patient

498
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,613
to waste my time trying to
convince anyone. We get it.

499
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,815
You don't like the guy, you
don't want to work on this case.

500
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,205
And yet you're still here.

501
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,354
Why don't you take a stand?

502
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,173
Either do something
about it or shut up.

503
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,645
Treat him for
blasto if you want.

504
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,747
I'll get Cuddy. I can
convince her to...

505
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,341
This isn't a democracy.

506
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,852
I don't care who you get.

507
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,616
At least for right now,
this is my department.

508
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,889
We're treating him for blasto.

509
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,426
Start him on amphotericin B.

510
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,637
Inject my IV with an air bubble.

511
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,798
What are you doing?

512
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,363
I will have another
heart attack.

513
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:03,441
No one will know.

514
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,771
Let her go.

515
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:09,611
You tell my colonel I'm a sick,
dying old man who can't be trusted.

516
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,705
I didn't say...

517
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,648
You were trying to
put a gun in his hand

518
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:16,485
and point it at my head.
The gun is now in your hand.

519
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,992
That is a practical
difference, not a moral one.

520
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,857
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

521
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,895
It is not so easy when
you have to do it yourself.

522
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,876
Allison.

523
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,325
I guess I didn't want you dead.

524
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,400
If you touch my wife again,

525
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,199
I'll kick your ass
out onto the street.

526
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,500
I don't care who you are.

527
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,771
I did her a favor. I showed
her her true character.

528
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,243
She's a better
person than you are.

529
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,010
She is too weak to
act on her beliefs.

530
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:21,175
But that is not her
fault. Almost everyone is.

531
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,690
Even my own advisers,
my own colonel.

532
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:31,727
All they do is negotiate
and debate and sign treaties.

533
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,425
They are appeasers.

534
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:38,129
All the while, we are beset by
assassins and traitors, the scum...

535
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,694
Cockroaches?

536
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,575
What are you gonna
do about them?

537
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,635
What is an enemy to you?

538
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:51,713
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

539
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:57,279
In my world, there are dangers
and bloodshed and death,

540
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:02,488
and that makes you a
man. And men make choices.

541
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:07,192
And your choice is to send
bands of drunk, crazed children

542
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,029
to massacre an entire people?

543
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,935
Don't ask me questions you
don't want to know the answer to.

544
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:16,168
I saved your life. I deserve to
know what you're planning to do.

545
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,700
Whatever it takes
to protect my country.

546
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,686
You broke into his apartment?

547
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,488
I didn't break in.

548
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,825
I wish I believed you.

549
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,524
I can fix this.

550
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,191
I already did.

551
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,669
He was gonna press charges,

552
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,365
but I promised him you'd leave.

553
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,935
You're kicking me out?

554
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,002
I'll explain it to
your psychiatrist,

555
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,777
but, yeah, you gotta
go somewhere else.

556
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,378
House, I know when
things go wrong,

557
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,650
usually you just double
down and get more involved.

558
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:08,057
But here, you could go to jail.

559
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,823
And I truly believe

560
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,365
that you've changed enough
to know this is the right thing.

561
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:21,919
We need a blood sample.

562
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,533
We gotta do the
anticentromere antibody test.

563
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,408
It'll show House is
right. It's scleroderma.

564
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,573
Why are you doing this now?

565
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,644
Because I didn't
want to kill him.

566
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,881
And you're right. I
have to take a side.

567
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,691
So I'm gonna do what
I can to keep him alive.

568
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,194
I'll get you the blood.

569
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,459
Positive for
anticentromere antibodies.

570
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,000
We gotta get him
off the anti-fungals

571
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,501
and onto steroids immediately.

572
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,901
I told you before.

573
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,496
This only points to
scleroderma. It doesn't prove it.

574
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,132
You're just gonna
ignore the test?

575
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,302
Blasto still fits best.

576
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,021
I know it's not conclusive,
but when you put it

577
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,122
with all the other evidence...

578
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,513
I've made my decision.

579
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,555
Have you told Thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

580
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,321
What does that have
to do with anything?

581
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,828
I've worked with you long
enough to know you're reasonable.

582
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:21,025
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

583
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,159
But there's some
deep part of you

584
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,545
that when you find
you're wrong about

585
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,334
the most important
decisions you've made,

586
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,136
you get insecure
and you just retrench.

587
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,487
If you wanna mess up your
relationship that's your right,

588
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,140
but you mess this
up, our patient dies.

589
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,188
Switch him to steroids.

590
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,699
Hi, honey.

591
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,095
How was your day?

592
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,272
Morning.

593
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,441
First of all, my bad.

594
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,550
I've gone through this whole thing
recently. I don't want to bore you.

595
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,454
Short version, I'm really
trying to do work on some stuff.

596
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,516
This is a definite setback.

597
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,322
Although, in fairness, you
really did make it tough.

598
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,329
Phantom pain in
your missing arm,

599
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,302
the five different kinds of
painkiller in your medicine cabinet,

600
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:40,311
that's what this magic box
of neurological trickery is for.

601
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:46,617
This'll be a lot easier if you do what
the crazy guy who tied you up says.

602
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,018
Put your hand in there.
Put your hand in there.

603
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,828
Now look.

604
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,190
Mirror magic.

605
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,427
Your arm is back.

606
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,398
Now clench both your
fists at the same time.

607
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,999
Clench. Real hard.

608
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,983
If you believe in God,

609
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,481
pray that this is gonna work.

610
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,548
You might also want to ask
him why he blew off your arm.

611
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,454
Ready?

612
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,464
Now let go.

613
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,743
Oh, my God.

614
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,279
You relaxed it.

615
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,785
For 36 years I've been in
pain, and it's finally gone.

616
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,949
Oh, my God.

617
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:04,829
Thank you.

618
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,698
O2 sat's down to 88.

619
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,260
Going through the main stem
bronchus into the right upper lobe.

620
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,930
Get them out of here! No!

621
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,029
It's okay.

622
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,404
Bleeder.

623
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,874
Cauterizing.

624
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,835
Got it? Yeah.

625
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,976
Get the paddles.

626
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,077
I'm going back in.

627
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,154
What is happening?

628
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,966
He's bleeding into his lungs.
- Charging.

629
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,788
Another bleeder. I can get it.

630
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,225
Hold on. There's a third.

631
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,194
God, there's a dozen.

632
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,498
Shock him.

633
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,728
Clear.

634
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,769
Charging. Clear.

635
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,086
You want to curl up and cry,

636
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,493
the lounge chair's
a little more comfy.

637
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,360
I switched his meds.

638
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,158
I thought I was wrong, so I
took him off the antifungals,

639
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,568
put him on steroids
like you said.

640
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,936
You know what that means.

641
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:59,273
I was too late or I was
right in the first place.

642
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,375
So, either you killed him

643
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,249
by not having
confidence in your opinion

644
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,056
or you killed him by being
too attached to your opinion.

645
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,117
If you're anything like me,
and by the way, you are,

646
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,789
you need to know which.

647
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,458
He's under lock and
key in the morgue.

648
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,503
His government wants their
own doctors to do the autopsy.

649
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,403
They're taking his
body out tomorrow.

650
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,634
There's a reason I hired you.

651
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,937
You used to know what
to do with a locked door.

652
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,686
I went down to the morgue
to rerun the antibodies test.

653
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,123
You ran it twice.

654
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,424
Turns out, I couldn't get in.

655
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,622
They had an armed guard.

656
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,289
But I saw this.

657
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,031
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

658
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,101
Your signature,
9:45 this morning.

659
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,202
That's right before
you guys ran the test.

660
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,073
What were you doing there?

661
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,946
Follow-up on a clinic case.

662
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,315
What case?

663
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,462
You think this is
really important?

664
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,920
One of the patients
in the morgue

665
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,890
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

666
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,493
You and Cameron, if you
took that woman's blood,

667
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,394
you could have messed
up the test results

668
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,696
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

669
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,462
Cameron had
nothing to do with it.

670
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,201
You son of a bitch!

671
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,766
He was going to kill the Sitibi,

672
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,102
every last one of them.

673
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,341
I don't care what
he was gonna do.

674
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,578
He came to us and
put his life in our hands.

675
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,745
All the good we've done,

676
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,119
every life we've saved, it
would have meant nothing

677
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:57,993
if we just sent him off to kill
hundreds of thousands of people.

678
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,655
Look at the news.

679
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,061
The moderates are taking over.

680
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,466
There's hope for peace talks.

681
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,705
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

682
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,507
Dibala becomes a martyr.
The massacres begin.

683
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,871
I cover this up, I
become your accomplice.

684
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,577
You think you can
guilt me into that?

685
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,584
If the cops are
going to come for me,

686
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,586
please warn me

687
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,264
so that I can
tell my wife first.

688
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,439
Chase,

689
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,008
you really think you can
kill another human being

690
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,674
without any
consequences to yourself?

691
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,382
No.

692
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,890
My neighbor called.

693
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,800
He sounded happy.

694
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,266
That's nice.

695
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,901
Even nicer, he's approving
the garden expansion.

696
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,336
Huh.

697
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,005
And even more nicer,

698
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,515
he's not going to press charges,

699
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,278
even if you don't move out.

700
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,620
