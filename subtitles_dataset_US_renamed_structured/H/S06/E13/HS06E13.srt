1
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,780
Hey. Slow down, sister.

2
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,480
Actually, I need to speed up.

3
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,749
Rachel woke up
early with a fever

4
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,282
and she's been
terrorizing me all morning.

5
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm already late.

6
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,993
Sorry, the stakeout went
longer than I thought.

7
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,258
Have you ever been to a rave?

8
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,355
Goodbye.

9
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,799
You're already late,
and Rachel's sick.

10
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,702
Neither of which can be solved
by you leaving right this second.

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,404
The entire hospital's depending
on a proposal I have yet to finish

12
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,840
and need to present at 8:30.

13
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,035
It's 7:30.

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,202
It's 7:37.

15
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,973
I'll have you on the
road in 10 minutes.

16
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:30,814
Come on, you don't wanna get into your
meeting all tight and stressed out, do you?

17
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,698
It's yours.

18
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,699
It's House. Ignore it.

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,291
It says, "Emergency page."

20
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,734
I said ignore it.

21
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,997
Sweet.

22
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,308
I'm sorry, it's hard
to pace yourself

23
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,528
when you've been thinking
about it for 10 hours straight.

24
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,680
That's great,

25
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,191
now I'm late, stressed
out and frustrated.

26
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,424
So, if you give me
a minute, I can...

27
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,553
It'll wait.

28
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,701
You can do it.

29
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,500
Do what?

30
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,292
I thought you were
coming in at 7:30.

31
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,784
Rachel woke up with a fever,

32
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,447
and then I just couldn't
get here any sooner.

33
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,113
There's a problem
in the pharmacy.

34
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,885
Hey, boss lady!

35
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,083
You don't answer
emergency pages anymore?

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,822
Tell them all I'll be
by as soon as I can.

37
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,262
And tell him I assumed it
was either about the wolf again

38
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,632
or the procedure I refused
to approve yesterday.

39
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,501
Turned out it wasn't
a resistant staph,

40
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,268
but I still say if it had been,
infecting him with malaria...

41
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,572
Seriously, House, I
don't have time for this.

42
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,612
You're lying. I have a
meeting in 20 minutes.

43
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,078
Not talking about your meeting.

44
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,424
I'm talking about
the phone call.

45
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,282
I didn't ask what you were
talking about because I don't care.

46
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,620
I was with your boy toy
on the stakeout last night.

47
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,458
You were with Lucas?

48
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,587
He needed someone who could diagnose a
soft tissue injury from across the street.

49
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,995
Apparently he doesn't
know any good doctors.

50
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,125
Or the ones he does know
actually have lives outside of work.

51
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,797
Things got a little slow,
so we made some wagers.

52
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,834
One being whether I could get
you to stop the miscegenation

53
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,510
with an emergency page.

54
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,773
What made you think we'd...

55
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,509
He said you guys
do it every morning.

56
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,981
Everybody lies, remember?

57
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,090
So you weren't actually...

58
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,312
Goodbye, House.

59
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,788
I'm gonna need a definitive answer
before any money changes hands.

60
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,451
Sorry to interrupt, but the
GRC called about the budgets,

61
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,962
the pharmacy is still waiting, and
your 8:30 just arrived on campus.

62
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,895
He should be here in 10 minutes.

63
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,899
Figures this would be the
one day he comes early.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,468
Can you proofread this for me?

65
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,979
When are you gonna
find your own assistant?

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,996
Not today. Thank
you. I'll be back in five.

67
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,871
Dr. Cuddy.

68
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,879
I know we're usually
fine with two CS reps,

69
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,380
but I want a few extra
hands today, just in case.

70
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,211
And have IT recheck the network.

71
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,494
I don't want to hear later that

72
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,647
the new lines can only dial
out or the computer crashed.

73
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,189
What's going on?
Hopefully, nothing.

74
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,420
Just make sure you're
ready if people start calling.

75
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,989
You wanted to see me?

76
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,224
Hey, Dr. Cuddy, yeah.

77
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,709
I wanted to let you know there's
a problem with one of the orders

78
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,167
that came in last night.

79
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,498
Which is?

80
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,729
They sent double the
amount of meds we ordered.

81
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,862
Did you call and ask why?

82
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,379
Yeah. They insist
it's not a mistake.

83
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,773
So fax them the original PO.

84
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,244
Yeah, that's what I was planning
on doing, but I can't find it.

85
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,213
Actually, I can't
find any of them.

86
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,377
Oscar, I don't have time to
straighten out your paperwork.

87
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,092
Where's Stan? He
doesn't get in till 9:00.

88
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,849
And it's actually
not my paperwork,

89
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,802
it's Gail's paperwork,
and she's out sick today.

90
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,537
So put it on her desk and let her
figure it out when she comes back.

91
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,037
All right, but it's
not my problem if...

92
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,860
Oscar, not today, okay?

93
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,263
Was it the whole
shipment or just one med?

94
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,530
It's just one.

95
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,603
Vicodin?

96
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,833
No, 25-milligram
ephedrine tablets.

97
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,643
What? Call Gail.

98
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,738
Tell her I want to see
her in my office ASAP.

99
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,043
But she's sick.

100
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,227
This place is full of sick
people, just get her in here.

101
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,550
Dr. Cuddy, your 8:30
is waiting in your office.

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,747
Now.

103
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,991
I gotta make a
quick trip upstairs.

104
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,220
Can you get the guy in my office
a cup of coffee? I'll be right back.

105
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,662
I've gotten you coffee before.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,761
What's wrong?

107
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,326
<i>It's freezing in here. I
can hardly feel my fingers.</i>

108
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,770
Please tell me you
didn't send a 911 page

109
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,467
<i>to tell me the heater's broken.</i>

110
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,667
It's not broken.

111
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,838
House bribed the physical plant
to turn on the AC so I'd hurry up.

112
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,947
<i>So hurry up.</i>

113
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,915
This man's abdomen is wide open.

114
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,747
<i>His core temp is down to 95!</i>

115
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,616
Fine, I will deal with it.

116
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,679
You better, or I'm gonna file...

117
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,526
I don't care what he told
you. Turn it back up, now.

118
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,163
Thought you had
an important meeting.

119
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,527
You're an idiot.

120
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,871
What are you gonna do the next time one
of your patients needs a liver transplant?

121
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,928
Go talk to Wilson about something
completely unrelated and see what happens.

122
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,270
Mystery infection guy
is now covered in boils

123
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,038
and has an abscess big
enough to put your fist in.

124
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,510
He needs to get into
an OR <i>tout de suite.</i>

125
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,410
Hourani will be done soon.

126
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,642
Good.

127
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,708
I'll have some hot
chocolate waiting.

128
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,150
Marina. Hey, how is she doing?

129
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,121
She vomited?

130
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,492
Give her some more ibuprofen
and put her in the bath for a bit.

131
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,540
And call me in a half
hour if it doesn't go down.

132
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,275
Sorry, Marina, I
have another call.

133
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,996
Just call me in a
half hour either way.

134
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,965
Hey, what's up?

135
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,468
Tell him I'm halfway there.

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,075
He's the one who insisted
on the early meeting.

137
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,536
All right, I'm coming.

138
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,052
Morning, Eli. Sorry
about the wait.

139
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,387
That's all right.

140
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,757
I hear you've got a sick kid.

141
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,038
Yeah, I know what that's like.

142
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,657
Or, I should say, my wife does.

143
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,867
So, you guys ready to give some
ground so we can make this deal?

144
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,401
Why would we do that?

145
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,166
We've been going at
this for eight months.

146
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,867
As soon as you decide
to get reasonable.

147
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,068
I'm the one that's unreasonable?

148
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,656
You've taken weeks to respond
to every proposal I've presented.

149
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,012
AtlanticNet Insurance is the largest
healthcare provider in New Jersey,

150
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,574
and you're not the only
hospital whose contracts are up.

151
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,362
So is your team ready
to come back to the table?

152
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,685
Yeah. We're not going to.

153
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,180
This is our final offer.

154
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,902
We're willing to go with
a capitated structure,

155
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,827
but we need at
least a 12% increase

156
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,592
in reimbursements
across the board.

157
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,099
Well, good news is I can
give you a quick response.

158
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,260
Not a chance.

159
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,067
But as always,
nice talking to you.

160
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,732
Say hi to your sister for me.

161
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:43,174
If you don't accept the offer,
we're gonna terminate the contract.

162
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,762
Gonna be hard to
keep this place open

163
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,756
if all your patients
have to pay cash.

164
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,816
Princeton-Plainsboro is the
smallest hospital in our entire network.

165
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,724
We're also the best.
It doesn't matter.

166
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,922
We are responsible for
covering 13 million people.

167
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,941
We don't have enough cash
to buy them all Maseratis.

168
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,732
I know what you pay Bergen, Newark
Beth Israel, Robert Wood Johnson...

169
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,430
It's because they have leverage.

170
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,497
You can be expensive or
small, but you can't be both.

171
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,974
I've engaged Jones/Curtin
to handle the PR

172
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,808
and I'm prepared to make the
announcement at 3:00 p.m. today.

173
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,650
First lesson every good poker
player learns is don't get emotional.

174
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,413
You don't have the cards.

175
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,564
And the sooner you realize that,

176
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,649
the sooner a reasonable
contract will get signed.

177
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,356
You have until 3:00
p.m. to change your mind.

178
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,534
I always did like your style.
Gonna be sad to see you go.

179
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,519
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

180
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,921
Thanks.

181
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,268
Take this up to the call center

182
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,321
and tell Claudia to
give one to each CS rep

183
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,560
and to start going over the
answers to each question.

184
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,726
Okay.

185
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,862
And under no circumstances is any
of this info to go outside that room.

186
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,850
The scripts are numbered, and I want
a list of every person she gives one to.

187
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,139
Got it. Anything else?

188
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,337
No.

189
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,806
If you really wanted
to make a deal,

190
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,162
you should've
ditched the push-up

191
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,879
and gone with the demi.

192
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,080
Nothing makes a guy
wanna close like highbeams.

193
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,247
What have you heard?

194
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,847
Your meeting with the weasel
lasted less than five minutes,

195
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:35,885
which means you either agreed to a
completely sensible 30-day extension

196
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:40,457
or one of you issued a
completely ridiculous ultimatum.

197
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,228
Oh, goody, you or him?

198
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,364
Me.

199
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,533
Way to go, boss. You
said it was ridiculous.

200
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,975
Ridiculous to
make, fun to watch.

201
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,036
As long as it's
not just a bluff.

202
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,323
Please tell me it's not a bluff.

203
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,317
It's not a bluff, and
it's not ridiculous.

204
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,046
Just because we're
not some huge...

205
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,199
Mr. Pluta started hallucinating
before we could put him under.

206
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,223
His BP's plummeting, he
has an elevated heart rate.

207
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,055
Looks like congestive
heart failure.

208
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,287
Interesting.

209
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,939
I don't care how
interesting it is,

210
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,762
you are not infecting
him with malaria.

211
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,063
Since when is malaria
a cure for heart failure?

212
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:19,936
It's not. It's not congestive heart
failure, it's gotta be one of the...

213
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,079
I just got off the
phone with Hourani.

214
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,124
I'm sorry, Dave, I
don't really have time...

215
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,344
You think I had time to
listen to him go for 20 minutes

216
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,885
about the damn
temperature in the OR?

217
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,079
I took care of it.

218
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,782
It's not an "it," it's a "him"
you need to take care of.

219
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,291
You've got the entire staff
catering to House's every whim,

220
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,158
and I can't get approval to hire
a replacement for the surgeon

221
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,958
he stole from my department.

222
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,742
A doctor I only took on in the first
place because of pressure from you.

223
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,862
So you didn't want Chase, but now
you're pissed you can't have him?

224
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,181
You want to convene
a search committee

225
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,949
and start looking for a
new chief of surgery?

226
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,100
No, Dave.

227
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,685
Then you better stop
spending all your time

228
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,305
putting out his fires and
start doing your damn job.

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,785
There a problem with Dr. Thomas?

230
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:13,349
No, just refereeing a
dispute about the OR.

231
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:19,131
So, we don't yet have a
contract with AtlanticNet.

232
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,000
We gave you an extra week. And you
assured us you'd have a deal by today.

233
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,006
We could have a deal,
just not the deal we deserve.

234
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,372
So, what do you want,
approval for an extension?

235
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,000
We've been at this
for eight months,

236
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,376
an extension isn't going
to change anything.

237
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,538
So what's your plan?

238
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,877
I presented a final offer.

239
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,781
I told them that we would
agree to a capitated structure

240
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,015
if they increase
reimbursements by 12%.

241
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,388
A final offer. What
does that mean?

242
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,120
If they don't accept it by
3:00, we're gonna terminate.

243
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,956
Are you out of your mind?

244
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,056
If we don't accept
AtlanticNet Insurance

245
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,192
we'll lose 80% of our patients.

246
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,612
We'd be lucky to
last three months.

247
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,731
We're not asking for
anything they can't afford.

248
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,638
Their last offer
was a 4% increase,

249
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,007
and you're demanding 12?

250
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,478
They're paying even
more at some places.

251
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,208
Units that have lower
ratings than ours.

252
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,192
In a perfect world that
would definitely matter.

253
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,048
Sanford, they're
all about growth,

254
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,849
and they know they don't get new customers
by marketing themselves as the biggest.

255
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,686
They do it by claiming
they're the best,

256
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,989
and they can't do that if
their patients can't come to us.

257
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,196
What was Morgan's
reaction when you told him?

258
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,201
He didn't give in. But he will.

259
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,604
I told him I'd make the
announcement at 3:00.

260
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,936
He'll call back before then.

261
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,068
They need us.

262
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,806
No, we need them.

263
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,677
We need each other.

264
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,585
The negotiation is
your responsibility,

265
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,588
so we can't stop you if
this is what you want to do.

266
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,956
But just so we're clear, if we don't
have a contract with AtlanticNet,

267
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,655
you're not gonna
have a contract with us.

268
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,602
Guess who didn't
show up for clinic duty.

269
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,469
Don't tell me,

270
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,551
the guy with all the boils
needs a liver transplant.

271
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,168
No, his doctor needs a nap.

272
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,506
You want me to try to find him?

273
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,046
You really need
him? I need someone.

274
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,641
I have cancer.

275
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,117
Why do you think
you have cancer?

276
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,520
I don't think I have cancer,
I know I have cancer.

277
00:15:56,856 --> 00:16:00,952
I had surgery to remove a malignant
polyp in my colon six months ago,

278
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,121
and now it's spread to
my liver and lymph nodes.

279
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,597
So you're under the
care of an oncologist?

280
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,691
Yeah, but he won't give
me the prescription I need.

281
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,428
You need more pain killers?

282
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,664
No, I need breast milk.

283
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,567
Human breast milk?

284
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,974
Yes, it has
cancer-fighting qualities.

285
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,344
Well, in newborns it's been
shown to reduce future risk...

286
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,384
No. In adults with cancer,
too. I've read studies.

287
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,119
Look, I even know a
place where I can buy it.

288
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:36,686
I just need a prescription so I can get
reimbursed by my insurance company.

289
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,995
They said they'd reimburse the cost
of breast milk as a cancer treatment?

290
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,932
They reimburse prescriptions.

291
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,179
So, if you write
me a prescription,

292
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,603
then they have no
choice but to pay.

293
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,540
Well, actually,
they have a choice.

294
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,372
What are you, some type of
shill for the insurance company?

295
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,174
No. I've been paying
premiums for 30 years

296
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,717
and I've never been sick a
day in my life till this happened.

297
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:01,276
Now I can't work.
I got no money,

298
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,198
and you want to help
them screw me over.

299
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,281
I'm not screwing you over.

300
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,001
Well, then give me the
script. It won't help you.

301
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,357
Will it hurt me? No, but...

302
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,022
Okay, so it won't harm
me and it won't harm you,

303
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,308
but it's this insurance company...
This is not about insurance.

304
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,631
Then give me the damn script!

305
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,399
I'm sick.

306
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,206
I need help.

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,309
I need something.

308
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,317
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,920
Bitch.

310
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,096
Anyone call?

311
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,295
Yeah.

312
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,068
The ER. They said the vascular
who's on call doesn't have privileges.

313
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,767
Then why is he on call?

314
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,554
Dowd's at a conference
and got him to fill in.

315
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,276
Be nice if he got somebody who could
actually work here. Call Ereshefsky.

316
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,282
Ereshefsky? She's
not gonna do it.

317
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,407
She owes me a favor.

318
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,782
She's still not gonna do it.

319
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,513
All right.

320
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,167
Oh, and there's a guy in your
office. I think he's a lawyer.

321
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,284
Why is he in my office?

322
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,070
Said he didn't want to sit
around a bunch of sick people.

323
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,222
I tried to stop him.

324
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,733
Hi. I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

325
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,964
Ronald Westbrook.

326
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,015
I appreciate your taking
the time to meet with me.

327
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,099
Hard to avoid, since
you're already in my office.

328
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,643
Sorry about that, I just
got over a wicked cold.

329
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,255
I didn't want to...
How can I help you?

330
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,475
I represent Martin Acevedo.

331
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,608
He's filed a suit against
PPH and Dr. Robert Chase

332
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,983
for performing surgery
without consent.

333
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,649
Yes, I saw that. I also
saw the consent forms.

334
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:45,816
They were all signed.

335
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,291
Yes, but my client was assured

336
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,056
that the procedure would
just be a few minor sutures.

337
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,894
Wait, your client
accidentally cut his thumb off

338
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,433
with a table saw, right? Yes.

339
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,196
And Dr. Chase reattached it?

340
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,463
Yes.

341
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,705
You're saying he didn't
want it reattached?

342
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,640
No, he most certainly did not.

343
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,510
His insurance only covered
60% of inpatient expenses,

344
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,513
so he would only agree
to the cheapest option.

345
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,638
So what did you tell him?

346
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,742
I said I'd sew up the skin
over the exposed bone.

347
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,013
Then I put him under,

348
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,250
got his thumb from the
paramedics and reattached it.

349
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,849
What's he gonna do?

350
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,416
Tell a judge that I harmed
him by reattaching a vital digit?

351
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,488
Both he and the insurance company
are suing to get out of paying the bill.

352
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,089
It's over $80,000.

353
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,566
It was his thumb.

354
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,669
I couldn't just let him toss it in
the trash to save a few bucks.

355
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:40,238
The pharm tech who called in sick
is here. She's waiting in your office.

356
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,679
He barely even
looks at me anymore.

357
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,480
We haven't had sex in months.

358
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,514
You don't need
pills to lose weight.

359
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,354
There are healthier
ways, legal ways.

360
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,327
You don't understand
how hard it is.

361
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,497
Ever since our second
child, no matter what I do...

362
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,763
I just wanted to lose 10 more
pounds, and then I was gonna stop.

363
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,597
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,764
Forging pharmaceutical
orders, stealing...

365
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,139
Don't fire me, Dr. Cuddy.

366
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,872
Please, I'm begging you.

367
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,314
If Sam finds out, he'll divorce
me for sure. And my kids...

368
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:22,483
I will never do it again, I swear.
Just give me a second chance.

369
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,518
I won't report the
theft to the DEA.

370
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,185
But I have to fire you.

371
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,468
Just take a few minutes
to compose yourself,

372
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,803
then go down to HR, and
they'll give you your last check.

373
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,503
I've been a perfect
employee for seven years.

374
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,240
I know, but this is too big.

375
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,547
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,771
How's it going?

377
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,537
I've got three hours to save
this place from bankruptcy,

378
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,306
I just fired one of
my best employees,

379
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,870
and the woman taking care of
my sick child isn't returning my calls.

380
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,975
Rachel's gonna be fine, I'm sure
whoever he or she is deserved it,

381
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,112
and we're not going
bankrupt. Are we?

382
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,367
Don't worry. The board will fire
me before they allow that to happen.

383
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,292
They'd never fire you.

384
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,625
I just told AtlanticNet Insurance I'd
terminate unless they give us a 12% bump.

385
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,667
They might fire you.

386
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,165
Marina, hey, it's me.

387
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,581
I haven't heard back from you.
Can you call me as soon as you can?

388
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,971
Thank you.

389
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,174
You try Lucas?

390
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,609
He's either sleeping
or avoiding me.

391
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,805
You in a fight?

392
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,245
Not yet, but we're gonna be.

393
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,902
What do you think I
should do about AtlanticNet?

394
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:10,624
You're asking a guy who paid
full sticker price for his last car.

395
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,358
You ask House?

396
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,961
He is a master manipulator
who always gets what he wants.

397
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,129
This situation is out of
control enough already.

398
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,470
House is the last person
I want to get involved.

399
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,877
Get out of my chair,
and the answer's no.

400
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,717
Have you noticed how many porn
sites have "mom" in the domain name?

401
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,951
Hot moms, hungry
moms, mature moms.

402
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,557
That ought to make
you feel pretty good.

403
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,895
What do you want?

404
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,061
Looks like boils, altered
mental status and heart failure

405
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,798
was caused by
renal cell carcinoma.

406
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,001
I need your signature to
start treating it with malaria.

407
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,452
Don't worry. I'm
giving him chemo, too.

408
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,308
What is your sudden
obsession with malaria?

409
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,041
Just trying to play
my part, cutting costs.

410
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,242
Malaria is the simplest, cheapest
method of delivering hyperthermia.

411
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,185
Right, the only money
you care about...

412
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:12,216
You bet someone you could
use malaria as a diagnostic tool?

413
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,754
That doesn't sound like me.

414
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,351
Forget it.

415
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,905
Okay, let me see if
I've got this straight,

416
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:19,899
a bet that puts one patient
at minor risk is juvenile...

417
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,558
And irresponsible and dangerous.

418
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,729
But going all-in
against AtlanticNet...

419
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,596
Is not a bet.

420
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,506
That is a carefully
considered negotiating position.

421
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,436
I'm gonna put
this in your in-box.

422
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,844
I just hope it doesn't get lost

423
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:39,010
underneath all the other stuff
you're carefully considering.

424
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,501
Can you take a look at
these per diem schedules,

425
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,391
let me know if you see
any conflicts? Got it.

426
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,191
Oh, and Ereshefsky
actually did come in.

427
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,275
You catch her leaving a
sponge in a guy or something?

428
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,200
Wasn't a medical
mistake. What was it?

429
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,895
Can't tell you now. She came in.

430
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,736
Hey, Stan, have you audited
the ephedrine orders, yet?

431
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,638
Why? You told me
she confessed. Stan!

432
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,852
All right, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

433
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,902
Today.

434
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,555
You know he's
cussing you out now.

435
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,924
I don't care, as
long as he does it.

436
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,109
What a bitch.

437
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,309
What are you doing here?

438
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,361
Sounded like you were gonna
be too busy for lunch, so...

439
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,751
My specialty. Spinach lasagna.

440
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,364
Sure you didn't come
looking for more people

441
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,755
you could brag
about our sex life to?

442
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,122
Okay, sorry.

443
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,560
From now on I've got nothing but
bad things to say about our sex life.

444
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,427
Or nothing to say.

445
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,076
And what's going on with
Marina? She hasn't called me back.

446
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,298
She was gonna call, I told her I'd
let you know everything was okay.

447
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,837
So her fever broke?

448
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,498
What exactly does that
mean, when a fever breaks?

449
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,270
Lucas, I'm very busy, does
she have a fever or not?

450
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,312
That was gonna be your lunch?

451
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,575
And you didn't have
breakfast either.

452
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,241
No, she doesn't have a fever,

453
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,785
and the rash was just
like a little diaper rash.

454
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,944
What rash? She has a rash?

455
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,784
A little one.

456
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,151
Lisa, don't worry,
I'm telling you.

457
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,261
Come on.

458
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,323
Oh, God. I must have grabbed
Marina's cell by mistake.

459
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:09,639
And I turned the ringer off on
the home phone so I could sleep.

460
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,070
What are you doing to me?

461
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,384
I take it your deal's not done.

462
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,936
Not yet.

463
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,314
How about I take a quick look into the
guy who's in charge of the negotiations,

464
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,409
or better yet, the CEO.

465
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,046
If I get some dirt, you
can use it as leverage.

466
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,023
There's no time.

467
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,692
How do you even find these guys?

468
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,934
You should've
seen the guy's face.

469
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,130
I thought he was gonna have a
damn coronary right there in the tee box.

470
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,673
Excuse me, you're
Keith Tannenbaum,

471
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,834
CEO of AtlanticNet
Insurance, right?

472
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,501
That's me. How can I help you?

473
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,355
Well, actually, I think
we can help each other.

474
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,339
I am Dr. Lisa Cuddy, Dean of
Medicine at Princeton-Plainsboro.

475
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,849
Oh, yeah. Well, how are you?

476
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,353
Well, I'm a little unhappy.

477
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,014
You're aware that our contract
with your company is up this week.

478
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,468
Yes, and we have a negotiating
team that's working all that out.

479
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,519
Princeton-Plainsboro has the
highest rated ER in the state,

480
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,291
the most advanced ICU,

481
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:09,358
and the most innovative diagnostic
medicine department in the entire country.

482
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,468
Good to know. Now if
you don't mind, I'd like to...

483
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:14,063
While AtlanticNet Insurance
has a marketing budget

484
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,666
that is more than our pediatric
ICU's and transplant unit's combined.

485
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,144
Your PGA sponsorship
could pay for our walk-in clinic,

486
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,292
and the money you spend
to fuel your two private jets

487
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,875
could fund our air ambulance
service for the next three years.

488
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,008
Your point being?

489
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,730
Your growth may be
good for your bottom line,

490
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,746
but ours allows
us to save lives.

491
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:34,054
And I would rather not have
to announce to the press

492
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,392
how selective your company appears
to be when it comes to cutting costs.

493
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,337
Morgan was right.
You are one tough gal.

494
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:53,009
You can portray me as a rich
bastard in the press all you want,

495
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,047
just as long as I stay rich.

496
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,718
Stan is looking
for you. I'm busy.

497
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,696
He said it's urgent.

498
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,896
I don't understand how it's even
possible. I've checked it twice.

499
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,030
How much?

500
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,198
Ten cases.

501
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,101
Ten cases?

502
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,700
Going back three years.

503
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,454
What the hell have
you been doing, Stan?

504
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,310
You're supposed to
be managing this place.

505
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,858
All the paperwork I
signed was correct.

506
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,044
She must have altered
the orders afterwards.

507
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,110
Didn't you ever cross check
it with the bills that came in?

508
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,449
I delegated it.

509
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,322
To whom?

510
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,854
To Gail.

511
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,271
Well, she seemed perfectly
trustworthy, how was I supposed to know?

512
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,093
By doing your job! Sorry.

513
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,156
Have you notified
the DEA? The DEA?

514
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,962
Jeez, Stan, hello!

515
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,231
You don't steal $50,000 worth of
pills because you want to lose weight.

516
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,763
She's supplying a meth
lab. Just get her back in here.

517
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,605
All right. Now.

518
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,479
Well, you ever
want a job, trust me.

519
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,349
He'll double whatever
you're making here.

520
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,943
I take it he liked my proposal.

521
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,480
Enough to tell me to get
my ass back over here today.

522
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,755
Here. He's willing to go to 8%.

523
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,588
Eight? We were at four.

524
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,660
Your board's gonna
think you walk on water.

525
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,867
I want 12.

526
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,503
You're not gonna get
12. There's just no way.

527
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,873
8% barely covers
our cost inflation.

528
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,970
The capitated structure should
allow you to hold down inflation.

529
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,811
And shifts all
your risk onto us,

530
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,282
which is why we deserve 12.

531
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,374
Lisa, come on.

532
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,977
The guy who mows my lawn
makes more than my kid's teacher.

533
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,365
Hell, the two guys whose lunch
you interrupted could get fired,

534
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,292
their severance would be more than
most of their employees make in a lifetime.

535
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,626
It doesn't have anything to
do with what you deserve.

536
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,389
This is it.

537
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,501
Take it or leave it.

538
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,466
What are you doing? Hey.

539
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,400
Know any good
transplant surgeons?

540
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,166
Turns out his kidneys
aren't the only thing failing.

541
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,516
And I know what you're thinking,

542
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,339
but malaria wouldn't
destroy his liver that fast,

543
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,845
especially since we
never infected him.

544
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,557
I thought you said...
Apparently Foreman now thinks

545
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,447
that he has the authority
to overrule my orders

546
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,745
just because the
FDA wouldn't approve.

547
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,218
Don't worry, I'll deal with him.

548
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,722
If you could just
talk to Hourani...

549
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,223
What would you do?

550
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,054
If you paged me during sex?

551
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,793
About the contract
with AtlanticNet?

552
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,465
I got them to come up to 8%,
but we should get at least 12.

553
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,134
It's all numbers, do the
math, and nothing else.

554
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,310
It's not about my pride,
it's about the principle.

555
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,123
They're trying to screw us
over because we're small.

556
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,257
That's what they're
supposed to do.

557
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,079
They should be
pressuring other hospitals

558
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,645
to be more like us, not trying to
make us more like them. It's stupid.

559
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,234
And putting your job on the line

560
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,191
in an effort to stamp
out stupidity isn't?

561
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,758
You would.

562
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,825
Probably.

563
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,163
But then I also wanted to try to cure
cancer by infecting a guy with malaria

564
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,635
to win a $50 bet. You
really want to be like me?

565
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,790
As you know, for
the past eight months,

566
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,392
we've been trying to renegotiate our
contract with AtlanticNet Insurance.

567
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,736
It's been a difficult process,
but I wanted to let you all know

568
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,334
before we made the formal
announcement, that, as of 5:00 p.m. today,

569
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,311
our contract with
AtlanticNet will be terminated.

570
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,941
We've doubled the number

571
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,984
of customer service
representatives in our call center,

572
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,987
current patients will still be allowed
to remain in our care for 30 days,

573
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,581
but starting tomorrow we will
no longer be accepting patients

574
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,184
with AtlanticNet
health insurance.

575
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,020
Dr. Cuddy!

576
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,433
Why weren't we told
about this sooner?

577
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:51,810
Come on, Marina,
pick up the phone.

578
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,945
I'm busy.

579
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,743
We found a liver match.

580
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,013
All right.

581
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,264
Get him prepped. I'll straighten
things out with Hourani.

582
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,689
Hourani's not the
problem. House is.

583
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,555
Now he wants Chase
to do the surgery.

584
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,389
To prove to Hourani
he doesn't need him?

585
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,521
To prove to Thomas that Chase
was his department's best surgeon.

586
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,709
And what does Chase want to
do? Chase wants to do the surgery.

587
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,877
And you don't want
him to do it because?

588
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:16,994
I don't care who does it.

589
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,092
So what's the problem?

590
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,347
In order to get our
patient into the OR,

591
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,848
we have to get him on
the surgery schedule.

592
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,884
In order to do that we need
someone to put him there

593
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,139
who neither House nor
Thomas can overrule.

594
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,554
What?

595
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,323
Would you rather I
go back on Vicodin?

596
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,762
She's not massaging your leg.

597
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,323
She will eventually.

598
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,364
Why am I the only person here who
cares what happens to this hospital?

599
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,430
Get off your ass and get
your department under control,

600
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,509
at least for the next few days.

601
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,238
It's gonna take
longer than a few days

602
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,542
for a company the
size of AtlanticNet

603
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,777
to start feeling the squeeze
of your PR campaign.

604
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:05,907
If they ever do.

605
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,145
And you know this how?

606
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,189
From all the time you spent
researching them and their other contracts,

607
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,732
the way they handle
their press relations?

608
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,748
I know they have a NASCAR team.

609
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,387
Despite what you may have learned
at Hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff,

610
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:21,593
sometimes the bigger they
are, the harder they kick your ass.

611
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,103
I'm not trying to be greedy.

612
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:35,408
But he's also not interested in being
forced into a medical bankruptcy.

613
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,780
Mr. Acevedo, I'm sorry you're
having financial difficulties,

614
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,319
but because of us
you still have a thumb.

615
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,752
I assume that's something
a carpenter might need.

616
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:48,624
And I assume you didn't ask for this
meeting so you could lecture my client.

617
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,252
You have insurance,

618
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:54,595
but by filing the suit you've caused
us to get paid nothing by them either.

619
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,725
That's not our problem.

620
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,428
Actually, it is, since
he's responsible

621
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,630
for any expense
we're not reimbursed.

622
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,832
But if you drop this
suit and make it clear

623
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,000
that Dr. Chase was
acting in your best interest

624
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,011
when he reattached your thumb,
then we'll be able to resubmit the claim.

625
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:09,604
And you'll cover his
deductible, attorney's fees,

626
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,411
and 50 grand for
pain and suffering.

627
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,817
Actually I was thinking more
like we'd cover half his deductible,

628
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,947
which means you'd
only owe $16,000.

629
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,181
You want him to pay you? Yes!

630
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,193
Do you have any
idea how much it costs,

631
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:26,095
how many years it takes to
train someone in microsurgery?

632
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,326
We gave you back your life.

633
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,866
You can still work, you can
button your own shirt, hold a fork...

634
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,768
Martin, let's go.

635
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,634
I'm sorry, I know I
should pay, but I just can't.

636
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,042
I still cannot work, I'm already
under water on my house,

637
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,550
and I have two kids with braces.

638
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,379
You think you'd be in better
shape without a thumb?

639
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:54,687
Right now, financially?
Yeah, I would be.

640
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,894
Well, so would we,
but when you came in,

641
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,831
we didn't think about that,
we just took care of you.

642
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,369
Made sure we did whatever
you needed to get well.

643
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,529
Yeah, right.

644
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,882
All you doctors
care about is healing.

645
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,384
That's why there are all those
BMWs and Porsches in the parking lot.

646
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,467
Damn it.

647
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:12,909
Come on, we're out of here.

648
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,240
We'll see you in court.

649
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,144
You're right, you will.

650
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,244
You still have a
thumb because of us,

651
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,252
and like everyone else in this
world, we don't work for free.

652
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:25,688
We earn this money, and if we have
to take your house to get it, we will.

653
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:33,723
What's going on?

654
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,891
I think they're fighting.

655
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,259
Out of my way.
Now! Out of the way!

656
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,738
What the hell is going on?

657
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,606
I told them to use
their words, but...

658
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,856
That pharm tech is
back. She's in your office.

659
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,187
You, there. You, over there.

660
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:04,025
I don't want to hear a word out of
either one of you until I get back.

661
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,093
You lied.

662
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,761
So? What are you
gonna do about it?

663
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,301
Well, for one, notify the DEA.

664
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,535
Good, I'm sure they'll
be very interested to hear

665
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,408
how Dr. House forced me
to help him steal the meds

666
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,540
and the administrator who he's having
sex with has been helping him cover it up.

667
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,476
You really think you can
lie your way out of this?

668
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,486
Yeah, I do.

669
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,250
Anything else you
want to know, bitch?

670
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,710
The hospital board's
chairman wants to speak to you.

671
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,259
Tell him I'm busy.
I did, but he...

672
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,270
Then tell him I quit.

673
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,876
You owe Lucas the money.

674
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,478
We were having
sex when you called.

675
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:41,216
The breast milk guy finally found a
doctor who'd give him what he wanted.

676
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,387
If it works, that's way
better than malaria.

677
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,997
It's worth a shot.

678
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,162
Great.

679
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,732
I thought they were
the ones bluffing.

680
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,243
No way they'd let us terminate.

681
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:08,345
They're not gonna fire you,
and you're not gonna quit.

682
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,090
Why not?

683
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,019
Because you're an idiot.

684
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,528
This place needs you,
and that matters to you.

685
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,732
What do you think of
that pharm tech, Gail?

686
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,107
She's a sociopath.

687
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,440
You knew she was stealing meds?

688
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:37,539
No. But have you seen
the way she opens the mail?

689
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,047
Why didn't you ever tell me?

690
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,213
Figured it might come
in handy one day.

691
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,334
Gail, I like you. I always have.

692
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,439
And I know you must've
gotten sucked up into a situation

693
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,065
you weren't able to control.

694
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:06,202
Really? Is that what
happened with you and House?

695
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,012
I'm not gonna back down just
because you threaten to smear me.

696
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,246
Now, if you agree
to tell the truth,

697
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:16,015
there are things
I can do to help.

698
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,514
Think about your
husband, your kids.

699
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,822
I know you're a good
person, deep down inside.

700
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:28,465
You can't completely hide everything
about yourself in seven years.

701
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,866
You're an idiot.

702
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:38,174
I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.

703
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:42,436
You still don't even know the
half of it, and you never will.

704
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,483
You wouldn't have even found
out about this if I hadn't gotten sick.

705
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,611
And you aren't as tough
as you think you are.

706
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,054
There's no way you'd
let this job get taken away.

707
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,494
And if I go down,
you're going down.

708
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,274
Hey, can you tell Stan to give this
to the DEA agent when he comes by?

709
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,640
A flower?

710
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,842
Yeah, Lucas gave it to me.

711
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,782
Thought it might
come in handy one day.

712
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:24,721
<i>I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.</i>

713
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,791
Nice.

714
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,123
Least I came out
on top once today.

715
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,593
Where you going?

716
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,154
To hand the board
my resignation.

717
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,231
Hopefully whoever they hire to
replace me can still get the 8%.

718
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,875
Marina, I've been trying to
get in touch with you all day.

719
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,311
It's all right. I understand.
How is Rachel?

720
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,845
And the rash?

721
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,151
Great. I'll be home early.

722
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,323
Perfect.

723
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,519
You bitch.

724
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,924
I didn't think
you'd actually do it.

725
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,196
I told you I would.

726
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,235
Call the dogs off.

727
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,109
You got your 12.

728
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,077
Congratulations.

729
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,785
Yes!

730
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,752
Yes!

731
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,614
You gonna get that?
