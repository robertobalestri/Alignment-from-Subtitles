1
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,488
Good explosion!
Drive it, drive it, drive it!

2
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,652
You watching 77?

3
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,820
I'm watching everybody.

4
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,763
You don't need to watch
everybody, you need to watch 77.

5
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,695
You his agent?

6
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,200
Just an objective mom.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,427
His explosion is impressive.

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,563
It's not just burst,
he can pull, too.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,550
You know, the only reason
he went to a double A school,

10
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,703
he was a bit of a late bloomer,
but he's a big man now.

11
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,268
You should be his agent.

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,871
Nice pancake, Seven Seven.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,740
You're moving up
those draft boards.

14
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,875
Thank you, sir.

15
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,886
01, 01, ready? PLAYERS: Break!

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,350
Set!

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,884
Blue 90. Hike.

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,422
Good job! Second level, nice!

19
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,965
Get off my quarterback!

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,807
Play's over! The play is over!

21
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,463
Save the aggression
for between the whistles!

22
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,511
Daryl!

23
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,955
All right, back to work!

24
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,755
Daryl!

25
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,957
Daryl, stop!

26
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,882
What are you doing?

27
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,861
Canoeing, but I seem
to be taking on water.

28
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,625
This is not okay. Use
your own bathroom.

29
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,031
No canoe in my bathroom.

30
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,961
My leg hurts, soaking
makes it feel better.

31
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,235
You were the one who
had to have this condo.

32
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,119
Maybe next time you
should consider amenities,

33
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,841
like two full baths, instead of
just the joy of outbidding Cuddy.

34
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,906
The guy who signs the loan
gets to pick the bedrooms.

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,746
Stay out of mine.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,612
Well, then you owe me 35 bucks

37
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,021
for the grab rail I installed.

38
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,023
Hit the kill screen,
boss is here.

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,535
It's not porn, it's
our new patient.

40
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,900
Bummer.

41
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,530
Twenty-two-year-old
male, 6'7", 310 pounds.

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,200
Clearly has brain involvement.

43
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,337
The guy has no recollection
of this entire incident.

44
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,313
Football player.

45
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,782
Those are the ones that
get hit in the head a lot, right?

46
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,976
ER CTed him.

47
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,384
No concussion, no stroke,
no cortical degeneration.

48
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,686
And he had a full psych
evaluation. He's not crazy.

49
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,225
So it's roid rage.

50
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,769
You don't think they grow
them that big naturally?

51
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,785
ER also tested for
steroids, he's clean.

52
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,364
Only proving that our guy
got his hands on the good stuff.

53
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,957
The negative test at least
means steroids is less likely.

54
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,278
We should discuss
other possibilities.

55
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,395
Why?

56
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,871
He injects his sore ankles
with lidocaine every game,

57
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,567
you think he's above
injecting steroids?

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,041
Repeated head trauma could
damage the base of the brain,

59
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,137
leading to a pituitary
adenoma, which leaks GnRH.

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,579
Pituitary damage wouldn't
be visible on a CT scan.

61
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,140
Could cause the excess
hormones that could cause the rage

62
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,550
and would elude
the ER's steroid test.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,455
Fine. Bilateral venous sampling
to find the elevated GnRH,

64
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,992
MRI to find the
pituitary damage.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,255
Unless, of course, there
is no pituitary damage,

66
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,959
in which case, our guy got
his hands on the good stuff.

67
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,736
Foreman. Let the peasants
handle the peasantry.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,474
Your brother needs to get
picked up this afternoon.

69
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,838
From prison.

70
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,976
Your older brother, in case
your confusion is related...

71
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,449
How do you know about that?

72
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,850
He left a message.

73
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,649
He said he couldn't get
you on your cell or at home.

74
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,747
I get it, you're busy,
you'll pick him up

75
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,452
the next time he
comes out of prison.

76
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,994
Is that all?

77
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:59,131
You're officially
unbusy. Family is family.

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,461
Take the rest of the
day, go see your brother.

79
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,334
I have work to do.

80
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,706
Do you feel any pain
that's deep and persistent?

81
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,212
Not just muscles or joints.

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,374
Everything hurts all
the time. That's football.

83
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,508
It might not be just football.

84
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,609
We're going to test for
damage to your pituitary.

85
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,417
If there is, it could
create excess hormones,

86
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,699
which could be
causing your pain.

87
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,487
It would also explain
your rage attack.

88
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,891
And if my pituitary is damaged,

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
how long would it take to treat?

90
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,572
I don't want to get
ahead of ourselves

91
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,996
and start promising deadlines.

92
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,032
I'm sorry, Doctor,

93
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,193
but he's playing in
front of pro scouts,

94
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,294
coaches and GMs this Saturday.

95
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,738
This is the job interview
for the rest of his life.

96
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,400
If we do find something wrong,

97
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,137
we can go in through the nose

98
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,840
and repair the damage,
nothing too invasive.

99
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,882
You'll need a couple
of days of recovery,

100
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,918
and then we can have
you back by game time.

101
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,517
Thank you, Doctor.

102
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,990
There's nothing
wrong with your eyes.

103
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,863
Well, then, your gizmo's
broken. I'm seeing spots.

104
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,766
Or you enlisted, you got the cool
haircut and the awesome pants,

105
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,313
then you realized
that your plane ticket

106
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,737
to the Middle East was coach,

107
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,773
and you decided to
rethink your promise.

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,174
No. I've already been there.

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,003
Three deployments. Now
they want me to go again.

110
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,709
But my wife's pregnant.

111
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,842
So our Homeland should be unsafe

112
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,944
because your Private was unsafe?

113
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,752
Look, my wife and I
planned this perfect.

114
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,883
My enlistment was
supposed to be over last week,

115
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,292
so we got pregnant
six months ago.

116
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,388
Now they tell me I'm
getting stop-lossed.

117
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,574
Army speak for they don't care

118
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,090
about the fact that I've
finished my contract.

119
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,295
I don't care about the
fact that they don't care.

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,864
Hey, come on, I waited an extra
hour just to make sure I got you.

121
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,573
Why?

122
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,271
I saw you limping out there.

123
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,807
Vietnam?

124
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Viet...

125
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,777
How old do you think I am?

126
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,511
I don't know. Vietnam age?

127
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,317
Well, back in my day

128
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,182
the real dodgers had the
stones to run off to Canada

129
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,624
or shoot themselves in the foot.

130
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,719
They didn't come to free
clinics whining for doctors' notes.

131
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,728
Go hug your wife, tell
her to get a babysitter,

132
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,634
and you'll be back in time
to video the kid's first steps.

133
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,396
Yeah, I don't need
to see the scan.

134
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,069
I can tell from your little puppy
dog eyes that his pituitary's fine.

135
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,170
Are you gonna
say it, or should I?

136
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,771
You were right
about the steroids.

137
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,179
You're a genius.

138
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,774
Next time, with feeling.

139
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,546
Put the cheater on a
somatostatin analogue

140
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,729
to clear it out of his system,

141
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,587
send him back to
his football game.

142
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,022
I've never done steroids.

143
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,996
Well, somehow your
GnRH got elevated.

144
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,622
This will help get it back down.

145
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,758
Mom, I swear!

146
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,392
Who's gonna draft you, Daryl?

147
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,946
You're stupid
enough to try that stuff,

148
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,914
especially the week you
know you're getting tested?

149
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,378
You guys must have
mixed up your labs

150
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,136
or got somebody else's blood,

151
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,267
because I never...

152
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,903
Okay, what is that?

153
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,539
Tachycardia. Lay
back down, Daryl.

154
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,049
Why's my heart
beating like this?

155
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,518
It's not steroids.

156
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,783
I need some adenosine, and
get that crash cart over here.

157
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,826
House, next time...

158
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,558
Marcus.

159
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,328
Oh, right. You two
know each other.

160
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,835
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,997
Interviewing.

162
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,263
Oh.

163
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,141
Who are we kidding?
Interview's over, you got the job.

164
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,377
What job?

165
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,709
My new assistant.

166
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,346
Part of his parole,
he needs a job.

167
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,545
Just trying to do my part.

168
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,818
You were wrong
about the steroids.

169
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,584
Patient had a
paroxysmal tachycardia.

170
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,591
We cardioverted him
back to sinus rhythm.

171
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,991
We're going to get a
EKG and a sestamibi scan.

172
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,361
Marcus, let's talk outside.

173
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,597
Family is family.

174
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,399
Hey, good to see you, too.

175
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,573
Did you have a hard stretch?

176
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,942
Not bad, I hardly
got raped at all.

177
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,445
You can't work here.

178
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,110
But your boss says I can.

179
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,378
I'm not playing.

180
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,353
Lighten up. I mean,
this could be fun.

181
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,388
I get to see your world. You
get me access to the pharmacy.

182
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,791
I am playing. Come
on, man. You look good.

183
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,409
I'd already know that, if you
came to visit every once in a while,

184
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,698
but whatever,
I get it. It's cool.

185
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,465
You don't wanna see me,
you don't wanna pick me up.

186
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,199
It's all justified.

187
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,635
I'll just have to
win you back over.

188
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,703
Let me explain something. This
man who's offering you the job?

189
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,009
He's not a philanthropist.

190
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,322
He seems more helpful than you.

191
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,080
He doesn't want to help you,

192
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,246
he only wants to use
you to screw with me.

193
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,557
You know how you
can screw with him?

194
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,822
Act like your brother getting
a job doesn't screw with you.

195
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,831
Trust me, it'll be better for
both of us if you go back in there

196
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,491
and tell him you
can't take the job.

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm not a person who has
the luxury of turning down jobs.

198
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,071
Well, figure something out

199
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,240
because you cannot work here.

200
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,284
House!

201
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,486
Okay...

202
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,666
We spent all night, used
all the fancy machines.

203
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,531
Patient's heart looks fine.

204
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,867
Well, if it was fine,
it wouldn't go aflutter

205
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,770
just because you
walked into the room.

206
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,775
Light whip, two extra shots.

207
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,105
Thank you, sir.

208
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,874
Judging by the
look on your face,

209
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,676
I assume you're
upset that big bro

210
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,115
didn't take your
advice and skip town.

211
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,483
You told him about
our conversation?

212
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,782
He bought me breakfast.

213
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,956
It was fun. Put lunch in
the books, just you and me.

214
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,953
Our patient could have a PFO.

215
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,294
Well, naturally you jump
right to a urinary issue.

216
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,197
PFO's not urinary,
it's a heart issue.

217
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,202
It is? Oh.

218
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,294
Well, naturally you think
it's not a urinary issue

219
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,415
because you're so embarrassed

220
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,998
about your own
past urinary issues,

221
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,973
you don't dare
broach the subject.

222
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,112
Oh, come on.

223
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,649
You spending the night
over at Bobby Samson's?

224
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,420
I did not wet the
bed, I spilled a drink.

225
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,050
We're not buying it,
Eric. We never bought it.

226
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,471
Why are you telling
him these things?

227
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:39,091
What's the big deal?
It was 25 years ago.

228
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,600
Oxygenated and
de-oxygenated blood mix,

229
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,034
the rough flow causes a clot,
explains the heart and head.

230
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,801
Like that power forward from
Loyola Marymount when he...

231
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,933
Hank Gathers? That's
not what happened to him.

232
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,911
Whoa, let your brother speak.

233
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,311
What happened to Hank Gathers?

234
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,539
Conference tournament.

235
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,141
Alley-oop dunk, jams it home,

236
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,084
then he runs up
the court and splat.

237
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,364
He dropped dead of a heart
thing right there on the court.

238
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,118
I remember that. On
autopsy they found

239
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,216
he had a hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

240
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,160
Rage and tachycardia
are warning signs.

241
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,491
Seriously?

242
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,998
Because my brother
remembers a basketball game?

243
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,431
Hey, I don't care where
an idea comes from,

244
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,027
as long as it makes sense
and embarrasses someone.

245
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,968
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,942
As a former psychiatric patient,

247
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,638
I take offense at
that terminology.

248
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,977
All I did was ban
you from my tub.

249
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,845
Whatever happened to
proportional response?

250
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,975
Whatever happened to
coherent conversation?

251
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:37,319
That thing broke tiles, gashed
the walls, and pooped everywhere.

252
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,916
Expect a bill for
repairs. And payback.

253
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,159
What was that?

254
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,531
I have no idea.

255
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:53,097
Everybody else thinks hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy makes sense?

256
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,939
Good, stick the
patient on a treadmill.

257
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,477
Stress his heart until it stops.

258
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,103
You want to induce
cardiac arrest?

259
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,359
The only real treatment is for the
patient never to stress his heart again,

260
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,478
which means we have to tell him
to retire at the ripe old age of 21.

261
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,818
Stopping his heart speaks
louder than words. Go.

262
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,029
Maybe it's a good thing. He gave
your brother a job, responsibility.

263
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,067
I'm not arguing that
he shouldn't have a job,

264
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,864
I just don't want
him having one here.

265
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,962
I understand that House
did this to annoy you,

266
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,200
but why is he succeeding?

267
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,122
You know what my brother did

268
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,172
the last time he
got out of prison?

269
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,480
He stole money from
my parents to buy drugs.

270
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,647
He robbed a liquor store, then he
moved on to jacking luxury cars...

271
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,917
Last time.

272
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,253
Every time.

273
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,329
I've known my brother
for over 30 years.

274
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,057
You haven't even
known him a day.

275
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,598
The exterminator charged 250

277
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,953
to get the opossum out of there,

278
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,911
and the contractor estimates
1,500 to fix the bathroom.

279
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,880
And why are you
jerking Foreman around?

280
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,583
Because it's fun.

281
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,730
Maybe you should give
those bills to the guy

282
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,417
who left his own
bathroom window open.

283
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,584
Your motives always run
deeper than simple fun.

284
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,924
I want to learn more
about one of my employees

285
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,987
so that I can manipulate him

286
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:29,058
and destroy him if and when I
choose. Information is power.

287
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,159
Not buying it.

288
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,236
Okay.

289
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,603
Why don't you tell
me my real evil plan?

290
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,437
I don't think there
is an evil plan.

291
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,672
You regret not having a
relationship with your own family,

292
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,270
and you don't want to see
Foreman go down that same path.

293
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,546
I think you're
actually being nice.

294
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,916
Oh, shut up.

295
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,450
You can't accuse me
of an opossum attack

296
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,493
and underhanded
kindness in the same visit.

297
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,652
Then I'll come back.

298
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,093
Treadmill test was a bust.

299
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,664
The guy's in unbelievable shape,

300
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,964
we couldn't get his
heart rate above 150.

301
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,834
Your boss is secretly
a very nice man.

302
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,773
I know.

303
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,044
If we can't recreate
the cardiac event,

304
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,844
we can't prove
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

305
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:23,217
Either we find a
bigger treadmill, or...

306
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,624
Did I miss the memo
about you being released?

307
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,723
I'm feeling fine. I
can't keep laying here

308
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,325
in this bed, missing practices.

309
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,700
All excellent points.
Give me your arm.

310
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,238
What's in the shot?

311
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,466
It's a vasodilator.

312
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,075
Since we can't exercise your
son's heart on the treadmill,

313
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,577
we're gonna have
to do it chemically.

314
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,215
What's wrong?

315
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,583
You're turning white.

316
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,245
What does that mean?

317
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,722
It means he doesn't need
football to get a good job anymore.

318
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,497
Raynaud's Phenomenon.

319
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,230
Vasospasms cut off the
blood supply to his fingers,

320
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,635
could be early onset
rheumatoid arthritis.

321
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,230
His rheumatoid
factor is negative.

322
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,775
Arterial plaque throwing clots

323
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,868
would explain the
fingers, head, heart.

324
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,377
You really think a
guy with stenosis

325
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,677
could've aced
that treadmill test?

326
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,918
You're kidding me.
You got him a desk?

327
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,584
And a nameplate. Man's got to
have a place he can call his own.

328
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,953
What about Takayasu's arteritis?

329
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,494
Lymphoma's a better fit.

330
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,688
We should remove his spleen.

331
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,526
Bold move to skip
straight to surgery.

332
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,759
His big game's coming up,
we don't have time to biopsy,

333
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,837
wait for the pathology
report, and resect.

334
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,668
Right. We should remove
his spleen without confirmation

335
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,207
so he won't miss the big game.

336
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,172
Hang an ethanol drip.

337
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,372
That won't treat for either
lymphoma or Takayasu's.

338
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,257
If it's lymphoma, the
ethanol will make him itchy,

339
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,772
and Foreman can
remove his spleen.

340
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,818
If it's Takayasu's, he'll
lose his radial pulse,

341
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,684
and Chase can
start him on steroids.

342
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,884
Marcus!

343
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,298
What are you doing here?

344
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,932
My new assignment is to
shadow you into enemy territory

345
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,738
and document your
every word to the patient.

346
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,780
Just don't say anything stupid.

347
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,646
You're not an
idiot. Don't do this.

348
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,350
Come on, man. I'm
a new person now.

349
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,389
No more drugs, no more lying.

350
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,117
And if I can't get my own family

351
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,783
to give me an
opportunity to prove that,

352
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,417
then what's the point?

353
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,395
Mom and Dad gave you a chance.

354
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,693
And a second. And a third.

355
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,461
I'm not about to
give you a 54th.

356
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,983
Why isn't your minion
fetching your lunch?

357
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,990
He's busy spying
on his little brother.

358
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,984
What?

359
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,962
That's very demeaning.

360
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,524
You obviously have a theory as to
why demeaning is not demeaning.

361
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,036
You're escalating to prove I
was wrong about you being nice.

362
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,402
Which you would
only do if I was right.

363
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,305
Do you even listen to yourself?

364
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,038
Twenty-three-year-old just
came in to the ER, asked for you.

365
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,510
What's her cup size?

366
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,845
I don't think his cup size
is relevant to his condition.

367
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,851
He accidentally shot
himself in the foot.

368
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,213
Oh, for...

369
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,222
Seriously?

370
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,124
I give you a choice
between moving to Canada

371
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,515
and shooting
yourself in the foot,

372
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,122
and you choose the bullet?

373
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,496
I didn't want to be a fugitive.

374
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,398
You think this is gonna
get you discharged?

375
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,979
We'll patch it up and
send you right back.

376
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,063
Well, don't patch it up.

377
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,067
Look, you got screwed over

378
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,078
by your own government
and that sucks.

379
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,489
But all you're going
to get out of this

380
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,073
is a five-day vacation
and a band-aid.

381
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,313
When I signed
up, I was just a guy.

382
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,082
Now I'm about to be a dad.

383
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,732
I go back over, there's a chance

384
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,726
my kid grows up
without a father.

385
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:26,131
You got a girl pregnant.
You're still just a guy.

386
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,241
How much longer we have to wait?

387
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,711
We have to keep going until
you start feeling something.

388
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,045
Might help if you told me
what I'm supposed to feel.

389
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,243
I do that, that's all
you'll be thinking about.

390
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,362
Then you'll be telling me
that's what you're feeling.

391
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,752
Power of suggestion.

392
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,985
The other black dude who was
in here earlier, he your brother?

393
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,491
What gave it away?

394
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,152
The way you looked at him.

395
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,821
I have two older brothers, and
we always want to kill each other.

396
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,106
Something wrong?

397
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,836
Not really. Just feels itchy.

398
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,097
Is that what you
were waiting for?

399
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,080
Means lymphoma's most likely.

400
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,740
But that's actually good news.

401
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,114
How can that be good news?

402
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,516
Because it's treatable,

403
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,952
we can remove your spleen
tonight laparoscopically.

404
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,649
Will I be up and
around by Saturday?

405
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,157
We can get to the
radiation in the off-season.

406
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:33,326
Hey, Ma. Wake up.
Ma, wake up. I'm itchy.

407
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,630
Means I can play.

408
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,353
What are you doing in the dark?

409
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,057
Lying in wait.

410
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,501
Jeez, what happened
to your face?

411
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,266
Right, play innocent.

412
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,340
Like you weren't
looking for revenge

413
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,684
for the prank
that I didn't pull.

414
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,542
It's karmic justice,
but I didn't do it.

415
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,206
Of course you
realize, this means war.

416
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,584
Isolating the
gastroepiploic artery.

417
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,724
Nearly there.

418
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,095
Foreman, come and
take a look at this.

419
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,465
Liver's inflamed.

420
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,864
So the itching wasn't
caused by his spleen.

421
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,239
It's not lymphoma.

422
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,082
What happened to your face?

423
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,747
Wilson annexed the Sudetenland.

424
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,081
No abnormal T-cells or B-cells,

425
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,716
it's definitely not lymphoma.

426
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,626
Liver biopsy only revealed
non-specific inflammation.

427
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,220
Kind of like the time

428
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,892
you took your mom's
birth control pills on a dare

429
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,936
and ended up with
swollen nipples.

430
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,595
That never happened. Right.

431
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,072
And your nickname all the way
up through high school wasn't Erica.

432
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,574
It wasn't.

433
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,943
Okay, I may have
made that one up.

434
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,424
With the understanding that my
brother still had his sense of humor

435
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,758
and would figure
out to play along.

436
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,876
Polymyositis would
explain the head,

437
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,647
liver, heart, even
the white fingers.

438
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,315
Would also be accompanied by a
significant decrease in muscle power.

439
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,222
Marcus, chance
to redeem yourself.

440
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,319
Does our patient
look strong to you?

441
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,166
Sorry, Eric. Big brother
disagrees with your diagnosis.

442
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,361
Felty syndrome?

443
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,768
You said the liver was
inflamed, not the spleen.

444
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,637
Can you believe they let
this guy perform surgery?

445
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,731
What are you doing?

446
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,119
Requesting permission
to share my idea

447
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,303
without being belittled in
front of your new assistant.

448
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,712
Permission denied. Continue.

449
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,507
Our patient has cartilage
damage in both ankles,

450
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,177
he gets lidocaine shots before
every game to mask the pain.

451
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,314
Team doctor uses the same
needle twice by accident?

452
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,449
Viral hepatitis.

453
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,720
Do you think he's
an idiot, Marcus?

454
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,318
I don't think he's an idiot.

455
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,455
Okay. Go test his blood.

456
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,360
Come on. We have
a lunch scheduled.

457
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,407
So you jerked me around.

458
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,535
Your allegiance lies with
your brother. I get it. Admirable.

459
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,840
But here's the problem. I
hired you to tell me the truth.

460
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,511
If you don't do that,
you no longer have a job.

461
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,497
I don't know what secret
you're looking to uncover,

462
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,513
but my brother is a decent guy.

463
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,058
He was arrested
for grand theft auto.

464
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,128
You're gonna be disappointed.

465
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,355
Try me.

466
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,296
He tell you I was with him?

467
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,526
Was it your idea?

468
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,643
We did everything together,

469
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,811
I don't know whose idea it was.

470
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,827
I was 16, he was only 14.

471
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,373
Little punk couldn't even
see over the steering wheel,

472
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,984
but he was quicker with
a flathead screwdriver

473
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:39,274
than most people with a key.

474
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,944
Sorry to interrupt my character
assassination with boring medical stuff,

475
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,542
but when we drew
the patient's blood

476
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,679
it clotted right there
in the vacutainer.

477
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,385
So the problem is not in
his blood, it's the blood itself.

478
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,499
He's been working out in
the cold, doing two-a-days,

479
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,587
it's got to be cryoglobulinemia.

480
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,224
I usually love breaking
bad news, but in this case...

481
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,102
Start the patient on warfarin.

482
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,606
I am so sorry about
that. You were saying?

483
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,504
We drove for about 10 minutes

484
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,342
before we got
caught and that was it.

485
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,812
When mom came
down to the station,

486
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,942
she didn't say a word
the whole ride home.

487
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,785
She came to the
driveway, turned off the car.

488
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,256
We're sitting in
there in silence.

489
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,534
And then, without
turning around,

490
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,585
she said, "I'll pray for you."

491
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,663
Then she got out of the car.

492
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,830
Wow. You got off easy.

493
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,930
Easy for you, easy for
me. Not easy for Eric.

494
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,370
His life mission became to never
disappoint our mother like that again.

495
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,346
Because he is a good guy.

496
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:54,050
Thought he would tell
that story at the eulogy,

497
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,519
but I heard he didn't give one.

498
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,156
Your mother's dead?

499
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,894
If he didn't tell you, I'm
sure he had a reason.

500
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:11,494
Look, you can mock him all
you want about peeing the bed,

501
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:17,033
but please don't
bring up our mother.

502
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,879
Your blood contains an abnormally
high volume of certain proteins,

503
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,246
called cryoglobulins.

504
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,010
They become thick
when it gets cold outside.

505
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,354
It's like a car trying to run
after the oil's turned to sludge.

506
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,655
We think that's what's been
causing all your problems.

507
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,924
So I just need a quick oil
change and I'm good to go.

508
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,090
This oil change isn't so quick.

509
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,759
We have to put you on blood
thinners and other medications.

510
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,894
The process will take
two to three weeks,

511
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,700
but after that, you should be
able to play without a problem.

512
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,332
After that, it's
not gonna matter.

513
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,707
Doctor, if Daryl doesn't
play in front of the scouts

514
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,678
on Saturday, he
won't get drafted.

515
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,475
Can't you wait
until after the game?

516
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,039
If we wait and let him play,

517
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,451
there's a good chance
he dies right on the field.

518
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,693
I had an epiphany.

519
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,704
Usually that precedes you
walking away with purpose, so...

520
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,568
Flathead screwdriver.

521
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,542
And then I say...

522
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,506
It's not a game, it's proof

523
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,457
that you didn't rig the
grab rail and make me fall.

524
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,813
I already have proof of that.

525
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,784
The fact that I didn't do it.

526
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,046
I can't go on that.

527
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,314
But I can go on the fact

528
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,754
that I had to borrow a
flathead screwdriver from Nora

529
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,088
to install the thing because
we only had a Phillips head.

530
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,094
Then, of course, I
returned it late that night

531
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,824
in a completely successful
effort to see her braless.

532
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,530
Whoa! Wait. Wait a
minute. Wait a minute.

533
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:50,093
Which means that you didn't have
the tool to sabotage the grab rail.

534
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,798
Braless? Under, like,
a sweater? Or, like, a...

535
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,808
Now I also have proof that I'm
not responsible for the opossum

536
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,487
because I'm absolving you of
responsibility instead of escalating,

537
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,070
which you know
is not in my nature.

538
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,675
So someone is breaking into
our place just to screw with us?

539
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,585
The opossum was meant for me.

540
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,654
I'm so tired. It was exciting
until about 2:00 a.m.

541
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,390
Now it's just torture.

542
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,094
Did you even go to college?

543
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,139
This is the
escalation, isn't it?

544
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,469
Keeping me up all night.

545
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,476
Nothing happens, then you keep
me up all night again tomorrow.

546
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,068
This is your retaliation.

547
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,478
You see, that's just illogical,

548
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,106
'cause I'm staying up, too.

549
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,481
Maybe you napped all day.

550
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,918
I gave you empirical proof
that I did not prank you.

551
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,582
No. No, you did not. You
created empirical proof

552
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,125
that I didn't prank you,

553
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,253
selling me on the notion
that you didn't prank me.

554
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,797
Maybe you self-pranked.

555
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,162
I don't masterprank.

556
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,926
Is that cut on your
cheek even real?

557
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:01,837
See? This is exactly what our
nemesis wants. Divide and conquer.

558
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,205
Can't you see that?

559
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,006
Okay. I'm going to bed.

560
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,207
I'm telling you,
if we sleep now,

561
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,906
we're going to wake up
next to severed horse heads.

562
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,416
Or worse, the rest of it.

563
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,822
Oh!

564
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,786
House!

565
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,555
The flatscreen!

566
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,980
You would never
sacrifice the flatscreen.

567
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,711
Oh, this guy's good.

568
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,893
Is there a reason for this?

569
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,396
There is a reason for
everything, <i>mes amis.</i>

570
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:09,233
I am troubled to report that
we have a criminal in our midst.

571
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,604
Guilty of what, exactly?

572
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:15,305
Last night the fire sprinklers
flooded our apartment.

573
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:19,215
And before that, I found
an opossum in my bathtub.

574
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,721
You each had motive,
you each had opportunity.

575
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,292
This is the emergency
you paged me about?

576
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,452
Not so fast, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Cuddy.

577
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,497
No one leaves here
until they can account

578
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,659
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

579
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,961
Bye.

580
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,668
Okay. No one who
is employed by me

581
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,972
leaves here until they account

582
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,736
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

583
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,040
What about you, Professor Chase?

584
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,306
Why would I?

585
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,513
Because you hold me responsible

586
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,106
for breaking up your marriage.

587
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,776
I was here all
night with Thirteen

588
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,117
monitoring our patient's
IV blood thinners.

589
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,688
Can either of you prove that?

590
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,782
The patient's alive
and improving.

591
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,053
Is that proof enough?

592
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,253
For now.

593
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,827
What about you, Colonel Taub?

594
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,161
I was out to
dinner with my wife.

595
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,632
Really? Your wife?

596
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,533
Yes, really.

597
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,299
Good enough. 'Cause I
had you pegged all along.

598
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,509
You certainly had all
the motive in the world.

599
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,638
First of all, I'm
not interested.

600
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,649
Second, I don't even
know where you guys live.

601
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,686
Yesterday, I confirmed
that you are a liar.

602
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,084
What are you talking about?

603
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,783
Well, at least a
liar by omission.

604
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:32,950
House!

605
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,786
Don't.

606
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,624
Get this, class.
Foreman's mom died.

607
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,902
He ever tell any of you?

608
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,202
House, I think you're
getting off topic here.

609
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,141
Is he serious? Did
your mom pass away?

610
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,314
About three months ago.

611
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,678
I'm so sorry.

612
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,080
Why didn't you tell anybody?

613
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,708
And to top it off,

614
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,254
he refused to say anything
nice about her at the funeral.

615
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,983
I didn't talk because it
isn't anyone's business.

616
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,016
Stop. You don't have to
explain yourself to this guy.

617
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,505
You want to hit me, don't you?

618
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,430
Marcus, don't.

619
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,233
I quit.

620
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,275
You should stop
him. He needs this job.

621
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,438
Our patient needs a fresh IV.

622
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,119
I don't need two to three weeks.

623
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,185
See? Got my color back.

624
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,106
It means you're getting
better, but it doesn't...

625
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,589
Means I am better. My coach
had the team doctor come by.

626
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,759
He cleared me to play.

627
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:53,430
Did your team doctor realize
you're on blood thinners?

628
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,141
I'm off them now.

629
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,268
You're still sick.

630
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,935
You're not ready
to go off your meds.

631
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,956
Daryl, listen to him. It
is not worth the risk...

632
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,142
I'll come back on Sunday, Mom.

633
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,893
You guys can give me
all the meds I need then.

634
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,477
The treatment
doesn't work that way.

635
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,158
Please, go with him.

636
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,005
The antibiotics aren't working.

637
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,008
We're going to switch
you to different ones,

638
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,934
but you're going
to lose your toe.

639
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,281
Outstanding, soldier!

640
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,448
As a general rule, before you
celebrate, do a little research.

641
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,215
The Army's Medical
Evaluation Board

642
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,285
is perfectly fine with
nine-toed infantrymen,

643
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,854
as long as they
can walk and run.

644
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,827
So I lost a toe for nothing?

645
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,095
Afraid so.

646
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,179
Unless you want me to
keep you on the old antibiotics.

647
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,536
We can let the infection spread,

648
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,165
then we can amputate
more than just a toe.

649
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,250
Why are you risking
your life for this?

650
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,717
Your mom doesn't want you to.

651
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,781
My mom sacrificed
everything for me.

652
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,320
Her telling me not to come here

653
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,359
is just another example of that.

654
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,154
I do good out there,

655
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,992
I could take care of her
for the rest of her life.

656
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,663
Who am I if I don't sacrifice
for her? That's family.

657
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,990
You okay?

658
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,360
Everything's blurry.

659
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,393
I can't see.

660
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,607
Take me back to the hospital.

661
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,451
The blindness means
we were wrong about...

662
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,217
<i>Actually, I'm
responsible for that.</i>

663
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,604
I spiked his water bottle with
nitrates. Dropped his blood pressure,

664
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,720
robbed oxygen rich blood
from his brain, making him blind.

665
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,389
I figured a temporarily
blind patient

666
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,229
is better than a
permanently dead one.

667
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,544
His vision was
already coming back

668
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,368
by the time I dropped
him off at the hospital.

669
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,432
Well played. If only we could
combine your medical chicanery

670
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,443
with your brother's
ability to fetch me mochas,

671
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,206
you'd be the perfect Foreman.

672
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,278
Where are you?

673
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,439
I'm busy.

674
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,009
Great, so we don't
have a new symptom.

675
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,230
Means we should just stick
him back on his blood thinners,

676
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,798
and he should be okay
to leave in a couple weeks.

677
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,984
Actually, we do
have a new symptom.

678
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,618
Any of you take a look
at his readmittance chart?

679
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,506
Between the time he checked in

680
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,641
and the time he re-checked in,

681
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,157
our patient lost a single pound.

682
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,537
Patient like that would
usually shed over 10 pounds.

683
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,630
The obvious answer
would be steroids,

684
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,676
but since we've
already ruled them out...

685
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,871
So he's not injecting, but he
could be getting them naturally.

686
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,812
Paraneoplastic syndrome,

687
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,442
the body produces
antibodies which battle cancer,

688
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,180
which could also act
like growth hormone.

689
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,314
We've eliminated lymphoma. What
other cancers mimic growth hormone?

690
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,325
Lung, pancreatic,
renal, breast...

691
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,884
It was a rhetorical
question, I don't really care.

692
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,554
Go test him for all of them.

693
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,541
What are you doing here?

694
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,169
You need a job.

695
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,145
Maybe I can talk to House,

696
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,810
see if I can get your job back.

697
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,018
As soon as he knows you're
okay with me being there,

698
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,389
he won't want me back.

699
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,925
Maybe I can help you
figure out something else.

700
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,933
I promise I won't let you down.

701
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,764
Don't do that.

702
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,405
Let's just see how it goes.

703
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:30,440
So do they mandate you to
stay here at the halfway house,

704
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,583
or can you come
stay with family?

705
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,730
It's Foreman.

706
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,998
Well, it should stop
now that Marcus left.

707
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,835
Well, that's the whole point.

708
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,911
Oh, I'm sorry. Was
my leg sticking out?

709
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,453
I'm so distracted lately, trying
to think of something funnier

710
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,915
than fire sprinklers going off

711
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,954
in the middle of the
night. Any ideas?

712
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,224
Whoa. Easy there, tiger. I know
where you live. You know how I know?

713
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,194
'Cause my girlfriend and I,

714
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,629
we tried to buy that
very same condo.

715
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,875
Why don't you
leave me out of this?

716
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,527
Wilson was the one
who bought the place.

717
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,868
And you're living there.
You deserve to suffer equally.

718
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,564
Actually, I've suffered more
now that you just tripped me.

719
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,235
Hey, hey. I'm...

720
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,075
His suffering will equal out
because he actually feels remorse.

721
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,978
Why would you out yourself?

722
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,449
You can't even
imagine the retribution.

723
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:43,818
There won't be any. I'm
ceasing all offensive operations.

724
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,154
I've both made my point and
established my superiority.

725
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,387
And if you even get to the
planning stages of retaliation,

726
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,727
I will tell Cuddy that she lost
her dream place to you two.

727
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,426
See, she's under
this odd impression

728
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,163
that you guys are her friends.

729
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,315
There's no cancer.

730
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,720
We scanned him head to toe,

731
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,281
we checked blood
smears for leukemia,

732
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,850
we even ultrasounded his
chest looking for breast cancer.

733
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,759
Maybe I was wrong
about the weight loss.

734
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,264
You weren't wrong. We
found blood in his catheter bag.

735
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,561
His kidneys are failing.

736
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,844
So it has to be cancer.

737
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,962
Paraneoplastic
syndrome is the only thing

738
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,096
that can link kidney,
heart and liver,

739
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,196
even the rage.

740
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,639
Then why can't we find it?

741
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,644
We've looked
everywhere inside this guy.

742
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,143
What if it's not inside?

743
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,627
You know why you're black?

744
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,223
'Cause God loves me
more than he loves you.

745
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,203
Hmm. What I was going for
was melanin. You got lots of it.

746
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,805
Makes your skin dark,

747
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,467
protects you from the
sun's harmful UV rays.

748
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,668
What are you doing?

749
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,211
Unfortunately, it also prevents

750
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,144
even those with
advanced medical degrees

751
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:19,309
from considering melanoma
as a diagnosis. Other hand.

752
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,311
On the rare occasion that
black people do get skin cancer,

753
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,619
they usually get it
on their white parts,

754
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,250
like the palms and
soles of the feet.

755
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,421
But your hands and feet are
so smashed up from football

756
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,129
that my team would
likely have written off

757
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,361
any skin blemish as a bruise.

758
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:41,937
But now that I know that
melanoma is the only thing that fits...

759
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,367
Come take a look at this, Mom.

760
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:54,346
There's the thorn in the panther's
paw. Paraneoplastic syndrome.

761
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,520
Your body forms
antibodies to fight the tumor.

762
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,457
<i>Those tiny little proteins travel
through your blood and wreak havoc.</i>

763
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,927
We remove the cancerous
mole, everything should be fine.

764
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,897
I'll tell Dr. Chase to
schedule the surgery.

765
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:12,169
Why bother? I missed my shot.

766
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,034
What kind of life am
I gonna lead now?

767
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,800
Did you study
really, really hard?

768
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,538
Then the same crappy life

769
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,945
that the rest of the guys you'll be
graduating with are going to lead,

770
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,108
minus the student loans.

771
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:32,917
Hey, you ready?

772
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,084
Almost.

773
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,395
And done.

774
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,242
I heard House and Wilson are
getting pranked by someone.

775
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,326
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

776
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,562
No.

777
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,768
And why should I believe you?

778
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,001
You said I had a trusting face.

779
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:53,640
I still don't understand why you
wouldn't let me retaliate, though.

780
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,236
They stole your dream.

781
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:58,078
Well, that's overstating
it. It's just a condo.

782
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:01,677
It's not because you feel
guilty about hurting House?

783
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:03,721
Or guilty for being with me?

784
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,347
We'll buy another one.

785
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,334
I just don't see the need
to make a war out of it.

786
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,758
Well, I think
you're rationalizing,

787
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,270
which a less confident
man than myself

788
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,321
might take as a sign that
you're second guessing...

789
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,596
Okay. You know what?
Forget that last part.

790
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,869
I heard Foreman and his brother

791
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,032
are trying to work things out.

792
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,165
That's nice for them.

793
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:26,336
It's nice of you.

794
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,879
You didn't provoke Marcus to
quit so the pranks would stop.

795
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,451
You were becoming the common
enemy they could bond over.

796
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:37,819
You are the diabolical, yet
benevolent puppetmaster.

797
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:42,120
I provoked Marcus to quit because
he was no longer useful to me.

798
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,287
I hired him to get
information, I got information.

799
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:45,625
Uh-huh.

800
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,688
And how are we going
to get back at Lucas?

801
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,165
We're not.

802
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,533
I win.
