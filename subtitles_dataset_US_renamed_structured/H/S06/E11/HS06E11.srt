1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,214
How am I supposed to walk into
that meeting with no presentation?

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:05,598
How the hell did
you screw this up?

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,698
It wasn't me.

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,765
She's lying. No. We agreed...

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,333
Her team had all the financials.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,003
And we were swamped
modeling them,

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,446
that's why we agreed that
you would do the slides.

8
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,635
Well, one of you screwed up.

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,344
So please try to figure it out,

10
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,561
'cause when the client dumps me,

11
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,019
I need to know who to fire.

12
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,080
I confirmed in the
e-mail. Hold on. Here.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,327
She did tell you about it, Russ.

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,702
I never got this.

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,804
Russ, are you okay?

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,910
Are you drunk?

17
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,536
I'm not drunk.

18
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,417
I'm not drunk. I'm...

19
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,220
I had no idea he
was drinking again.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,395
Well, you should have.

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,274
Give me five minutes, I'll
go to the business center

22
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,975
and print the graphs directly
from the spreadsheets.

23
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,628
Run. And bring me
some paper towels.

24
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,867
What?

25
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, it hurts.

26
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,488
Don't tell me you
were drinking, too.

27
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,912
No.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,415
My ears. Oh, my God.

29
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,650
Twenty-seven-year-old female, intense
intermittent ear pain, saw six doctors...

30
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,642
Tell her to stop
lurking in the front row.

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,158
If she wants to
hit on musicians,

32
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,990
that's what tour
buses are for. Next.

33
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,859
If I ask why we're
in Wilson's office,

34
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,092
is there any chance I'll
get a straight answer?

35
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,599
Try it, try it.

36
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,396
Fourteen-year-old boy, joint
pain and excess hair growth.

37
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,498
Tell him to masturbate no
more than three times daily.

38
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,406
With meals. Next.

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,538
Did I mention that the
27-year-old female is really hot?

40
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,878
And her husband is really not.

41
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,645
Wild guess. He's rich.

42
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:35,212
Not unless social workers have
begun pulling in the big money recently.

43
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,788
Give me.

44
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,335
You're taking the case
because she's hot?

45
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,692
No, that would be an
accident of genetics.

46
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,357
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

47
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,128
That's a fascinating window into
the mysteries of human psychology.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,032
Also, she's "really" hot.

49
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,662
Or she, you know,
loves her husband.

50
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,815
She loves something about him.

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,365
Vitamin deficiency. She changed
her diet a few months ago.

52
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,571
To a healthier diet.
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

53
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,804
It's not the ear,
it's the heart.

54
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,183
Her protein was cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

55
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,313
Hers was already elevated,
gave her arterial blockages.

56
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,416
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting
as ear pain. Very rare. Cool.

57
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,621
So Beauty and the Beast.
Who wants to go see?

58
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:39,410
Let's see. Dr. Taub,
Foreman, Chase and Hadley.

59
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,715
Four for four.

60
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,432
Wow, I can't believe
I get all these doctors.

61
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,856
And such good-looking ones, too.

62
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,393
Yeah, it's almost like we
don't all need to be here.

63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,794
Your case presented a very
interesting diagnostic challenge.

64
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:50,956
Oh.

65
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,798
You can't sleep
in your own office?

66
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,002
Or bedroom, for that matter?

67
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,841
Got to avoid my natural habitat.

68
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,043
Some idiot I went to med school
with keeps leaving messages,

69
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,585
wants to drop by for lunch.

70
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,210
So tell him "no."

71
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,345
It's complicated.

72
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,390
It's too complicated
for you to tell someone

73
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,652
you don't like to screw off?

74
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,819
That's practically your hobby.

75
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:25,696
A few months ago, he was
sort of part of my therapy.

76
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,837
My shrink told me write a letter
of apology to someone I hurt.

77
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,936
And how did you hurt him?

78
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,271
We were in a seminar
on flatworm genetics.

79
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,174
I switched my
final paper with his.

80
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,145
You plagiarized?
Doesn't sound like you.

81
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,510
I was testing a theory.

82
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,516
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

83
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,383
I assumed he'd get a
high grade with my paper,

84
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,012
and I'd get a low
grade with his.

85
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,718
Interestingly, I was
wrong. I got an A.

86
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,112
So you're in this
mental hospital,

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,061
delving into your subconscious,

88
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,222
and this is who you
choose to apologize to?

89
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,391
Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.

90
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,210
Of all the people in
the world you've hurt...

91
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,534
Not everyone has a name that's
so easy to find in the White Pages.

92
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,470
I'm in there. And so is Cuddy.

93
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,271
Yeah. Yet I picked
him. It's funny, isn't it?

94
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,469
Yes, it's hilarious.

95
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,776
Great to see what a
success your therapy was.

96
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,209
We said we'd never
to go to sleep angry!

97
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,784
We did find an arrhythmia, but it's
not from your arteries, they're clean.

98
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,016
Will the pain come back?

99
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,058
We'll start her on cardiac
meds, that should help.

100
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,856
But we still need to figure out
what's causing the arrhythmia.

101
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,419
Hey, Valerie.

102
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,691
Russ.

103
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,232
It's so nice of you to stop by.

104
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,965
I got lots of free time now.

105
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,903
You don't blame me, do you?

106
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,838
You were drunk
in front of Norris.

107
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,969
No, no, no, no,
no. I'm drunk now.

108
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,847
Then, it was like someone
poisoned me or something.

109
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,454
Maybe you should
come back later.

110
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,283
Okay.

111
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,254
I just wanna say goodbye.

112
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,025
Okay, Russ. Thank
you for coming by.

113
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,895
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

114
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,602
You poor son of a bitch.

115
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,518
She doesn't love you any
more than she loved me.

116
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,306
Okay, you need
to leave right now.

117
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,471
You're pretending you
had an affair with my wife?

118
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,744
Yeah, we're all pretending.
You got nothing to worry about.

119
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,786
Tell them where you
were six months ago, Russ.

120
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:31,589
I had a breakdown. I had some
paranoid tendencies, as they say.

121
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:35,220
But it turns out, I had
a right to be paranoid.

122
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,820
You need help.

123
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,124
Get him out of here.

124
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,828
Okay. Okay.

125
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,409
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,879
Are you okay? You okay?

127
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,212
Yeah, I'm okay.

128
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,812
We'll keep an eye out. He's
not getting back in the hospital.

129
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,549
He's making all that
up. You know that, right?

130
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,319
Yeah, of course.

131
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,276
<i>Where are you?</i>

132
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,563
Undisclosed location.

133
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,711
<i>Who are you hiding from?</i>

134
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,735
Wilson.

135
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,547
<i>And the lunch
date that Wilson is,</i>

136
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,733
<i>no doubt, right now,
trying to sic on me.</i>

137
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,800
<i>But in the great game of
chess that is our relationship,</i>

138
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,779
Wilson sees only one
move ahead, I see dozens.

139
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,507
<i>That is why he
will never mate me.</i>

140
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,083
That's a chess term.

141
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,055
<i>That's great. A co-worker
confronted our patient.</i>

142
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,684
<i>Altered mental status. Basically
accused her of poisoning him.</i>

143
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,836
We think he was projecting.

144
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,351
<i>So he's poisoning her.</i>

145
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,606
What could he get his hands on

146
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,565
to cause supraventricular
tachycardia?

147
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,529
Does he have dry
skin, thin eyebrows?

148
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,797
If you're sharing an amazed
look, please do it louder.

149
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,637
He might have. How
did you know that?

150
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,610
<i>He has hypothyroidism,</i>

151
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,955
<i>he dumped his
meds in her coffee,</i>

152
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,642
that would make her heart
go boom, in a bad way.

153
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,825
<i>We'll treat with beta blockers.</i>

154
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,613
I'm sorry, but I
totally disagree.

155
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,495
<i>- With what?
- With everything.</i>

156
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,698
Why are we assuming he's
lying and she's telling the truth?

157
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,453
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

158
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,856
and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo

159
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,370
who we just tossed
out of the hospital.

160
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,453
And she's hot.

161
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,239
<i>Maybe she picked him
because he's vulnerable.</i>

162
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,596
There's something off
about her, I can feel it.

163
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,895
If you had any evidence...

164
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,266
Why didn't she tell us a
co-worker puked on her shoes

165
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,429
right before she collapsed?

166
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,682
Because it's medically irrelevant.
He was drunk, she was sick.

167
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,850
<i>You don't think it's suspicious</i>

168
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,185
<i>she didn't mention
it to her husband?</i>

169
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,373
Yeah, Foreman, why did
you break up with Thirteen?

170
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,177
Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual
thing she was saying, why that?

171
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,444
This is about the case,

172
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,578
not some imaginary issue that
you think Foreman and I have.

173
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,316
Great. Start her
on beta blockers.

174
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,520
You'll do it?

175
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,475
I don't think he
was talking to me.

176
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,559
Well, I am.

177
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,500
I'm the only one who
thinks you're wrong.

178
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,733
Maybe that's why
I'm asking you to do it.

179
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,285
Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly.

180
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,725
Dr. Wilson said you'd
be here. How you been?

181
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,132
Check and mate.

182
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,703
Look,

183
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,708
I'm sorry this is
awkward or whatever.

184
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,957
I just thought it was nice
of you to write that letter,

185
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,543
and I wanted to tell you that
you don't have to feel bad.

186
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,549
Thanks.

187
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,987
So, where you
working these days?

188
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,722
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

189
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,960
I thought you knew. Dani's,
the organic supermarket chain.

190
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,968
As an in-house doctor?

191
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,233
I actually never got licensed.

192
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,968
I didn't graduate med school.

193
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,408
I planned on going back,
and then my father got sick

194
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,936
and I had to take care of
him, and I had some bad luck.

195
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,449
Why didn't you graduate?

196
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,575
I was one credit short.

197
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,109
And I was sort of already
on academic probation, so...

198
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,289
Which credit?

199
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,586
I got a...

200
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:32,365
He failed me on that paper
you switched. I thought you knew.

201
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,265
So I'm guessing you're the
CEO of this supermarket chain.

202
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,632
I bag groceries.

203
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,941
Life works out weird sometimes.

204
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,641
We were going to do it in Santa
Barbara because of his parents,

205
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,878
<i>but then I found this beautiful
hotel in Montauk and...</i>

206
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,215
You're testing her
for a brain tumor?

207
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,156
That's what I told her.
You can chastise me

208
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,659
after you look at the monitor.

209
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,888
Look what's lighting up.

210
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,328
Lateral frontal cortex,
Broca's area. So what?

211
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,626
I told her it was customary

212
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,894
to talk during MRIs, to relax.

213
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,870
I spent the last 30 minutes asking her
about everything in life that she loves,

214
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,238
then hates, then feels
any emotion about at all.

215
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,186
There's nothing in the
paralimbic system, amygdala.

216
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,170
Because she's using the
language part of her brain

217
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,680
and bypassing the emotional.

218
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,376
She can understand love
and pain and empathy,

219
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,315
but she can't feel them at all.

220
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,051
She's a psychopath.

221
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,860
Why do you want
to meet her so badly?

222
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,957
Psychopaths always fascinate me.

223
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,865
I think it's their
cultural literacy

224
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,167
and strong family
values. Or is that Jews?

225
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,249
We're not gonna be able
to get an honest read on her

226
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,285
unless we figure out a way to
get the husband out of there.

227
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,540
Hmm. I got an idea.

228
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,103
Can you get out of here?

229
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,147
Thanks.

230
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,388
It was the "thanks" that did it.

231
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:08,353
Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long
have you been a psychopath?

232
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,022
Are you kidding? He's not.

233
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,694
Are you saying I'm like
Ted Bundy or something?

234
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,737
Psychopathy can get a bad rap.

235
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,705
Doesn't necessarily
mean you're violent.

236
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,550
Just that you're completely
without conscience,

237
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,906
you lack any normal emotion,

238
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,467
you manipulate
everyone around you,

239
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,343
you're promiscuous,
you lie pathologically.

240
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,541
Any of this ringing bells?

241
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,427
Is that why you were asking
me all those weird questions?

242
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,886
Yeah. Well, you have
Darwin to thank for that.

243
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,888
She got the creeps around you.

244
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,084
Which, oddly, is an actual medical
phenomenon around psychopaths,

245
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,093
probably an evolved
response to predators.

246
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,325
I'm sorry. You're really freaking
me out. I have no idea what...

247
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,095
Relax. We have a
duty of confidentiality.

248
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,159
And you have an
undiagnosed heart problem

249
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,864
that could kill you
at any moment.

250
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,339
We believe that your
mental abnormality

251
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,898
is related to your physical one.

252
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,672
So if you want to
keep on "predating"...

253
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,913
What do you want to know?

254
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,625
Your co-worker's story
was true. You poisoned him.

255
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,228
No. I gave him a little
Valium and an emetic.

256
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,568
You sure you understand
what the word "no" means?

257
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,150
I've had them both
before, why can't he?

258
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,506
So you were just
helping him out?

259
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,342
I assume he was cool with the
whole seducing and firing part, too.

260
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,245
Russ knew what
he was getting into.

261
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,375
He got sex every Thursday night,

262
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,476
and I got to take
credit for his best ideas.

263
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,487
And what are you getting
out of your marriage?

264
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,352
Same thing you
get out of your job.

265
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:47,861
Bill has a trust fund, and I have a
prenup his parents made me sign.

266
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,494
Told you he was rich.
She's not that weird.

267
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,533
I'm not so different
than anybody else.

268
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,094
Everyone I've ever known, my family,
my classmates, the people I work with,

269
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,662
they're all out for themselves.

270
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,799
Difference is, I can
admit it to myself.

271
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,452
She kind of reminds
me of someone I know.

272
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,910
Tell me about it.

273
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,243
Some of my co-workers will
insult people right to their faces.

274
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,647
How long have you been this way?

275
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,244
Just how I am.

276
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,989
Are you gonna cure
my heart problems now?

277
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,254
So, psychopathy plus
cardiac arrhythmia. Go.

278
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,973
I thought you were
bluffing to get information.

279
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,693
You really think
they're connected?

280
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,462
Two rare conditions
in one patient,

281
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,025
it's a fair assumption they are.

282
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,969
Psychopathy is
generally just genetic,

283
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,199
nothing you can do about it.

284
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,918
Something that hits 30 years after
birth isn't going to be connected.

285
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,104
There are diseases that
could lie dormant that long,

286
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,736
hit her heart, warp her brain.

287
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,440
Maybe a handful of diseases.

288
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,540
It'll be super awesome
when we find it.

289
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,955
Tertiary syphilis can
cause pseudopsychopathic

290
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,417
syndrome and cardiomyopathy.

291
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,388
Fits best. Start
her on penicillin,

292
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,775
rule out Wilson's
and Hashimoto's.

293
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,752
There's your handful.
Wasn't so hard, was it?

294
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,864
You gotta do something
about Thirteen.

295
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,634
She flouted both my
authority and yours.

296
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,108
Yes. And she got it
right and you got it wrong.

297
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,872
Which just aggravates
the problem.

298
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,108
She'll do it again. Next
time, it won't work out so well.

299
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,515
You got to punish her.

300
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,212
You're her boss,

301
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,881
in some vague, never to
be usefully defined way.

302
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,150
You punish her.

303
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,249
I'm also her ex,
which, as you know,

304
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,987
makes it a little complicated.

305
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,790
The fact that you also fired her

306
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,093
takes it from a little
complicated to a little moronic.

307
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,189
It was the only way I...

308
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,977
It wasn't because you
were too in love with her,

309
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,163
it was because you were
too in love with your career.

310
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,229
We're almost at my floor, so I'll
summarize. Your problem, not mine.

311
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,604
You cut up my only
copy of that photo.

312
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,082
That rare daguerreotype?

313
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,750
You can charge me
for the effort it takes

314
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,419
to search your hard
drive for a new copy.

315
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,289
Not the one of me and
Lucas, the one from Ecuador.

316
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,850
Right, I'd forgotten about your
deep emotional attachment to lemurs.

317
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,328
To my dad.

318
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,525
You got his tail.

319
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:10,002
He was holding the camera. That
was the last trip we ever took together.

320
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,504
And I don't have a digital copy.

321
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,668
Well, I could stand
here all day apologizing,

322
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,112
but I'd rather expiate my
sins with good, clean work.

323
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,618
You ignoring my texts?

324
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,383
The crazy ones you sent, trying
to get me to make you feel better

325
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,256
about destroying your classmate's
life? No, I never got those.

326
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,335
Wibberly's got some agenda.

327
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,550
Probably trying to guilt me
into getting him a better job.

328
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,668
How pissed was he? Not at all.

329
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,440
That's how I know
he's got an agenda.

330
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,415
If you feel guilty, you
should do something to help.

331
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,322
You are responsible.

332
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,690
Thanks.

333
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,135
What? All I'm responsible for

334
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,044
is the foreseeable
consequences of switching papers.

335
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,709
A bad grade or a sleepless
night. Worst case, a retest.

336
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,718
There was no way to
know that one seminar paper

337
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,845
was gonna destroy
this idiot's life.

338
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,514
If there's any
karma in all this,

339
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,922
he's probably
happier than you are.

340
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,125
Good point. If he is happier,
there's no harm done.

341
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,459
I'll go find out.

342
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,864
That is absolutely
not what I said.

343
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,426
Always with the
modesty, this one.

344
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,627
You want something to eat?

345
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,861
I'm cool.

346
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,037
How's work?

347
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,701
You happy with it?

348
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,604
You know, it's a job.

349
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,907
I don't need to take any
work home with me at least.

350
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,749
Free time. Wouldn't have
any of that if you were a doctor.

351
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,719
Yeah. True.

352
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,155
You like chili? I
could reheat some.

353
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,957
Is that your yard? That's nice.

354
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:56,459
Yeah. That sugar
maple, 100, 150 years old.

355
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,828
The most beautiful
leaves in the fall.

356
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,135
Sit underneath on the bench,

357
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,209
it's like paradise.

358
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,336
I don't have a yard, myself.

359
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,408
You got a good thing going.

360
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,847
I know.

361
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,180
So, what are the boxes for?

362
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,453
I'm moving.

363
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,651
From paradise?

364
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,193
Well, with my
dad's medical bills,

365
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,626
and me being one of those idiots

366
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,460
that got an adjustable
mortgage, so...

367
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,432
You're losing your home.

368
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,830
Hey, could be worse, right?

369
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,766
How?

370
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,307
Even if the tests are positive,
you don't have to worry.

371
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,572
You're testing for
syphilis, not a cold.

372
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,704
Honey...

373
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,658
At this stage, it's probably
not communicable.

374
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,042
You think I'm
worried about myself?

375
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,403
I just want my
wife to get better.

376
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,919
She might have
caught it at birth,

377
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,887
so it doesn't prove
she was cheating.

378
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,098
If you were worried about that.

379
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,181
Of course not.

380
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,657
How many weeks
am I gonna have to...

381
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,550
You okay?

382
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,138
- Why is she coughing?
- I don't know.

383
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,926
You want some water?

384
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,259
Are you threatened by me?

385
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,939
Not at all.

386
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,270
Well, you should be.

387
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,673
You let him know
what I told you,

388
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,405
I will not only have
your license pulled,

389
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,312
I will sue you for everything
I lose in the divorce.

390
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,976
So the fun you get out of making
those snotty little comments,

391
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,019
is it worth $90 million?

392
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,282
Oh, wait. Will
you hold that look?

393
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,188
I'm really bad at showing
emotions. How's this?

394
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,118
Thanks, baby.

395
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,591
Can I have your arm, please?

396
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,568
My arm! You broke it!

397
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,192
- I don't know what happened.
- Neither do I.

398
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,582
But I know what happened after.

399
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,087
She called Cuddy and
demanded I kick you off the case.

400
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,587
I backed you up
because I trust you,

401
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,989
but you're gonna have
to earn that trust now.

402
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,493
Thanks.

403
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,222
Actually, he backed you up

404
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,265
because of the new
BUN creatinine numbers.

405
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,392
Brittle bones were
from kidney failure.

406
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,130
There is that. So
heart and kidneys.

407
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,262
And brain.

408
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,715
Nope. The psychopathy
is not a symptom.

409
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,798
It was yesterday.

410
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,105
In the meantime, kidney
failure ruled out syphilis,

411
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,187
and testing ruled out the
other ideas that would have fit.

412
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,339
Protein levels,
kidneys, arrhythmia.

413
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,406
Could be paraneoplastic.
I'd say lymphoma.

414
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,678
Get her to radiotherapy.

415
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,346
We can't start radiation without
immunoassays in her urine.

416
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,288
Great. So, you cast a spell
and magically fix her kidneys,

417
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,534
she can give us
some urine to test.

418
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,958
We have some
left from admission.

419
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,637
Not enough for a
completely accurate reading.

420
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,391
Then how about
partially accurate?

421
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,365
Those of you who haven't
slept together, you can go.

422
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,526
Everyone else, stay behind.

423
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,637
Oh, sorry, that was
our secret. Right.

424
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,980
Go have sex. No, thanks.

425
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,920
Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and
the lubricants, just get me a receipt.

426
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,699
We have zero
feelings for each other.

427
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,986
That's too bad,

428
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,425
'cause things worked
much better when you did.

429
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,604
Would it help if
I slept with her?

430
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,868
We were getting to a diagnosis.

431
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,922
No, we were already
at the diagnosis.

432
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,364
You were creating
a fake argument

433
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,793
about an irrelevant
treatment issue

434
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,546
'cause you can't stand
to be around each other.

435
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,335
So have sex, fight,
or quit, I don't care.

436
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,807
Whatever you're
doing now isn't working.

437
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,645
You okay?

438
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,846
Yeah.

439
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:41,160
Look, I get that you gotta
act fast, but radiation?

440
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:42,855
You definitely ruled
out everything else?

441
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,022
I'm sorry, but...

442
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,328
We could still check
for environmental toxins.

443
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,700
Where does she
spend most of her time?

444
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,796
Mostly at work, at home.

445
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,172
Hobbies? Recurring
activities outside the home?

446
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,938
No. Not really.

447
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,174
She took a landscaping
class at the Y.

448
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,510
When did it meet?

449
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,948
Every Thursday
night this summer.

450
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,680
You dig in soil, you can
be exposed to pesticides,

451
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,451
heavy metals,
lots of bad things.

452
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,651
Can you find out all about
her landscaping class,

453
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,558
where it was, details like that?

454
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,426
Yeah. I'll do it now.

455
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:29,674
So when you watch <i>Star
Wars,</i> which side do you root for?

456
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:35,314
<i>Dr. House, what are you doing?</i>

457
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,646
<i>Just checking in on
your radiotherapy.</i>

458
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,253
From what I hear,
you never visit patients.

459
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,623
And now you've come
to chat with me twice.

460
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,752
<i>I wanna know how you like
being a management consultant.</i>

461
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,625
<i>I'm thinking of getting into it.</i>

462
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,790
<i>That or psychopathy, maybe.</i>

463
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,594
Which pays better?

464
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,832
<i>I think you're already
into one of them.</i>

465
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,701
Dr. Hadley made
a joke yesterday.

466
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,673
She said I sound like you.

467
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,970
<i>You sure you understand
what "joke" means?</i>

468
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,276
So you're not just
out for yourself?

469
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,647
For example, you would never
interrupt a sick woman's treatment

470
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:14,619
just because of some
personal obsession?

471
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,386
Of course I'm self-interested.

472
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,618
We all are, we're born that way.

473
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,124
The rest of us are
born with consciences.

474
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,529
Which is something you
just sound ecstatic about.

475
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,231
I'm not saying it's logical,
I'm just saying it's human.

476
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,762
So if you know your conscience
is just an animal instinct,

477
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,002
you don't need to follow it.

478
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,837
I think you realize that.

479
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,506
That's why you're talking to me.

480
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,001
You lied about your
landscaping class.

481
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,268
Dr. Hadley thought the
soils might be poisoned.

482
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,433
You told him that?

483
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,508
I just thought...

484
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,011
Russ said you were
having an affair.

485
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,515
Was that your cover?
Every Thursday night, you'd...

486
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,308
I'm so sorry.

487
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,911
Oh, God.

488
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,456
It's not what you think.

489
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,322
Do you remember
that telecom case

490
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,122
I said that we
didn't get last year?

491
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,526
In fact, we did.
And I was swamped.

492
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,874
Every Friday morning, we had
a conference call with London,

493
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,264
so the night before I would...

494
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,997
That's your excuse? You expect me
to believe that you were at the office?

495
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,164
What's the biggest
argument we've ever had?

496
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,765
You said I spend too
much time away from home,

497
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,572
that I don't need a job, that
you would take care of me.

498
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,545
Yeah. That's all true.

499
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,411
You yelled at me.

500
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,145
You made me feel like you
didn't value anything that I did.

501
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,413
I need this job

502
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,320
to feel like I'm accomplishing
something on my own.

503
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,685
That's why I lied to you.

504
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,624
If I call your office
tomorrow and I check...

505
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,787
Call my office,
call my secretary,

506
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,024
call my clients,
interrupt their dinner,

507
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,259
wake them up, I don't care.

508
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,392
I just want you
to know the truth.

509
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,369
You know I love you.

510
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,174
Come here.

511
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,506
Please.

512
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,819
It's okay.

513
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,623
Fire her.

514
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,361
What for? You seem to have
lied your way out of any trouble.

515
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,266
Until Bill checks
up on my cover,

516
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,414
and I have to create a whole
new one to cover that one up.

517
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,134
I've done it before,
but it's a pain,

518
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,403
and I would like Dr. Hadley
to share that pain.

519
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:51,842
She didn't reveal
any confidences,

520
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,401
and she had a
valid medical reason

521
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,913
to ask about your
landscaping class.

522
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,846
We can see what a
jury says about that.

523
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,747
And admit to your
husband the truth?

524
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,615
You're not going to sue us.

525
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,246
We will remove Dr. Hadley
from all patient contact.

526
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,322
What?

527
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,723
But it's for Dr. Hadley's
benefit, not yours.

528
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,786
We have no obligation
to inflict you on her.

529
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,092
Fine.

530
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,761
But just so you know,
this is not for your benefit.

531
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,100
Dr. Cuddy is furious that
you put her hospital at risk.

532
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,371
She just knows it's a bad idea

533
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,772
to admit it in front of me.

534
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,899
Think what you want.

535
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,707
By the way, your
orderly's outside.

536
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,441
But I'd wait about
another 10 minutes

537
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,792
if you really want
your husband to think

538
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,411
you're having
radiation treatments.

539
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,321
Dr. Hadley?

540
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,384
Are you, by chance, gonna cry?

541
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,991
'Cause that's the
one I just can't do.

542
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,012
Hello? This is Dr. Hadley.

543
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,447
What?

544
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,257
You called the medical board?

545
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,387
What is she talking about?

546
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,140
"Accusations of
sexual harassment."

547
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,408
You don't think I know it's you?

548
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,491
Thirteen, come on.

549
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,264
You already got me fired from
the case, what else do you want?

550
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,397
Dr. Hadley, get out here now.

551
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,326
You're acting like an idiot.

552
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,251
She's trying to make
me lose my license!

553
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,981
She'll fail, unless
you're stupid enough

554
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,231
to go in there
and scream at her.

555
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,383
Sexual harassment
accusations are incredibly serious.

556
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,722
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

557
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:51,161
If she used her name, we
all back you up, it goes away.

558
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,698
You're completely overreacting.

559
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,892
You'd be pissed off,
too, if you were me.

560
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,044
Or maybe not, I don't know.

561
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,645
You're just about as
emotional as she is.

562
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,137
I'm doing you a favor. I know.

563
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:03,266
And even when you try to do
something nice, you sound like a jerk.

564
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,909
I'm sorry.

565
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,978
For what?

566
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,145
For firing you.

567
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,095
Don't do that. That's
not what this is about.

568
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,384
Then I'll apologize anyway.

569
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,754
I did it for me, not for you.

570
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,090
I realized that right
after I fired you,

571
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,898
but I couldn't admit it.

572
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:31,560
I screwed everything up. I hope
that we can still work together.

573
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,843
Something's
wrong with her liver.

574
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,039
Blood flow's backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

575
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,912
From the cancer?
This isn't lymphoma.

576
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,006
We don't know what it is.

577
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,194
We can wrap bands
around the veins,

578
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,895
but the bleed is so
bad, that might not work.

579
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,547
We want to try
something called the TIPS,

580
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,988
a shunt that makes the
blood bypass the liver.

581
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,150
That'll save her?

582
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,869
It should help preserve
her liver and heart.

583
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,590
But the liver cleans out
toxins, so bypass it too long,

584
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,207
she'll get brain
damage, eventually die.

585
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,509
But that's still probably less
dangerous than bleeding out now.

586
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,865
Probably?

587
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,668
Valerie usually
makes the decisions...

588
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,104
You gotta step up now.

589
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,736
Was she cheating on
me? I can't discuss...

590
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,077
Just tell me she wasn't
lying. Just tell me that.

591
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,484
I'm supposed to
make this decision?

592
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,684
I don't even know
who she is any more.

593
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,387
Either way, you
gotta do it right now.

594
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,461
Do whatever you think is right.

595
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,745
I'd give her a day,
two days at the most.

596
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:52,376
Great. You be the clock,
everyone else will be the doctors.

597
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,749
Heart, kidneys, now liver.

598
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:54,843
Amyloidosis.

599
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,084
No speckles on the MRI.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?

600
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,283
Too much kidney failure.

601
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,623
Primary hepatic fibrosis.

602
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,331
It's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

603
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,543
Even if we're right, the
liver's probably too scarred.

604
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,644
We got to list
her for a new one.

605
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,034
With an unconfirmed diagnosis?

606
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,613
Not gonna happen. FOREMAN:
How about a family member?

607
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,148
I don't think the husband's
the right blood type.

608
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,471
Even if he was, he's not
going to give his liver now.

609
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,736
He left her, I assume?

610
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,970
Not yet.

611
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,237
He says he won't abandon
her while she's sick.

612
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,112
She have any other
family members?

613
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,022
No one's going to risk
their life to save hers.

614
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,713
Man, one false accusation
from a psychopath,

615
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,756
and you turn out to
be a real bummer.

616
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,986
I'm gonna go see if
Wilson has any liver left.

617
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:47,967
What are you doing?

618
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,567
Paying Wibberly's
mortgage for a few months.

619
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,477
Congratulations on another
successful round of hectoring.

620
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,516
Wait a minute. Is that
actually a check for him?

621
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,984
No, it's a giant novelty
item for winning the lottery,

622
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,180
you're just standing
really far away.

623
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:07,022
Of all the people to go the
extra mile for, why this guy?

624
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,756
I don't know, he just kind of
smells good and makes me laugh.

625
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:14,027
Why not Cuddy? You never
apologized after you defaced her photo.

626
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,796
Maybe because I recognize that
sending someone to the poorhouse

627
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,394
is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

628
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,134
No, it's because Cuddy
actually means something to you,

629
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,335
which makes it much
harder to apologize.

630
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,442
If it'll make you shut up, I will
tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

631
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,881
Forget the photo. House,
she was in love with you.

632
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,044
And all she got in
return was abuse.

633
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,588
For years, you toyed
with her emotions.

634
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,816
She wasn't in love with me.

635
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,087
The fact that you still can't
admit it just proves my point.

636
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,958
What do you want? Helping
the guy was your idea.

637
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,089
No, help the guy, whatever.

638
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,931
I'm just pointing out that it's
much easier to soothe your guilt

639
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,731
by throwing money at a stranger

640
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,467
than by making amends to a
person you actually care about.

641
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,907
You had me at "much easier."

642
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,639
I'm going to pretend
to go to work now.

643
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,879
Ping.

644
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,935
Sarah?

645
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,234
I'm Dr. Hadley. I'm
sorry to bother you,

646
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,030
but I was told that
you're Valerie's sister.

647
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,103
Mmm.

648
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,014
I was just surprised
you came to visit.

649
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,049
So is the rest of my family.

650
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,885
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

651
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,049
Wrong blood type.

652
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:50,027
But why? I mean, you
know what she's like.

653
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,996
She's not that bad.

654
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,588
Yes. She is.

655
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:00,028
Our dad was a mean drunk.

656
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,574
I was the older sister.

657
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,601
I was supposed to stand up
for her, not the other way around.

658
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,807
She protected you
when you were kids?

659
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,374
Yeah. And then all of
a sudden, all of his crap

660
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:18,656
and all his abuse,
it just changed her.

661
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,854
It made her cold.

662
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,620
When?

663
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,726
We were wrong.
Psychopathy is a symptom.

664
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,033
I spoke to her sister.
She wasn't always like this.

665
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,040
She changed, and right
around adolescence.

666
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:44,447
So, liver, heart, brain lie
dormant, and it starts at puberty.

667
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:56,117
The raw food diet made it go
fulminant. Nuts are high in copper.

668
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,659
It's Wilson's disease.

669
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,666
We ruled that out. No
Keyser-Fleischer rings.

670
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,261
There is one other sign. I
know there are lipstick lesbians.

671
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,798
Are there
nail-polish-remover bisexuals?

672
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,871
She's not supposed to be here.

673
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,142
As a doctor.

674
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,708
You didn't say anything about her
capacity as a beautician's assistant.

675
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,501
Her fingernail's blue?

676
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,730
Yep.

677
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,795
Start her on chelation.

678
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,971
What just happened?

679
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,270
You're gonna get better.

680
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,244
Your body has an
inability to process copper.

681
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,907
It caused all of your problems.

682
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,609
Even what's wrong
with your brain.

683
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,050
That's going to change, too?

684
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,317
It's probably rewired her
neurons permanently by now.

685
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,153
But it's possible?

686
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,987
Maybe.

687
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,824
I have to go get the
chelation equipment.

688
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,797
Bill, I need you to
sign some forms.

689
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,437
You don't see what she's doing?

690
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,103
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

691
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,908
wake up a completely
different person

692
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,940
so that you and all of
your money stay with her.

693
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,883
It's a lie.

694
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,181
You said there was a chance.

695
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,053
Okay, there's a teeny chance.

696
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:36,117
But even if it cures her, it's
not going to make her love you.

697
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,428
I was happy before.

698
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:47,499
I know, and I'm
sorry, but it wasn't real.

699
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,236
It felt real.

700
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,238
I don't know...

701
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,977
Maybe that can be enough.

702
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,664
You're really doing this for me?

703
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,235
Tax shelter.

704
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,006
I'll take some
of that chili now.

705
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,747
I can't accept this.

706
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,612
Fine, forget the chili.

707
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,043
Bye, Wibberly.

708
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,921
I got an A plus with your paper.

709
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:44,160
I was an orthopedic surgeon
for 10 years at New York Mercy.

710
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,993
I had a gambling problem.

711
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:49,034
I tried to cover it by overbilling
some Medicare patients.

712
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,195
Lost my license.
That's why I'm here.

713
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,034
Not because of you.

714
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,165
Why are you telling me this now?

715
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,439
Because I thought you'd
be the same bastard

716
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,209
you were in med school, but...

717
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,384
Keep it.

718
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,555
No. I can get another place.

719
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,225
Just take it. I
screwed you over.

720
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,733
You got me an A plus.

721
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,235
Take it. No.

722
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,000
Do I have to shove it down your
throat? Take the damn check!

723
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,763
Your vitals are up.

724
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,862
Treatment's working.

725
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,463
I'm not sure we
can fix your liver,

726
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,805
but we can definitely
list you for a new one.

727
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,670
When you're better, we're
gonna take a long vacation.

728
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,578
You want to go to Vietnam,
one of the beaches?

729
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,585
We're gonna get a hut, just you
and me, nothing to worry about.

730
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,318
You're pathetic.

731
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:24,988
What?

732
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:29,660
I mean, when you had a
suspicion, fine, but you know now.

733
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,703
How can you be this pitiful?

734
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,506
You don't mean
this. You're sick.

735
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,802
I'm not sick.

736
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,136
I almost died,
and I still might.

737
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,271
And who knows, maybe
it's focusing my mind

738
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,782
because the idea of spending
the rest of my life with you...

739
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,215
Valerie...

740
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,470
Why'd you do that?

741
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,834
Because he's pathetic.

742
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,168
He hasn't changed.

743
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:19,043
But you have. The treatment
actually worked on your brain.

744
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,327
If you were still a psychopath,

745
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,115
you would have just
kept draining him dry.

746
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,210
What do you want?

747
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,280
You're feeling something.

748
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,485
What is it? What do you feel?

749
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,955
I don't know.

750
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,167
It hurts.

751
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,409
It will.

752
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,660
Heard about the
diagnosis. Nice job.

753
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,931
Thanks. Why are
you here so late?

754
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:16,498
Discharge summary. Taub's
handwriting isn't helping much.

755
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,152
Apparently on the
third day of admission,

756
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,010
the patient underwent
"rabbit thumping."

757
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,310
"Radiotherapy."

758
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,813
Ah.

759
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,558
"Third day after admission,

760
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,320
"patient underwent radiotherapy

761
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:39,057
"including external
beam radiation

762
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,764
"to treat B-cell lymphomas.

763
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,330
"First treatment was

764
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,202
"full-mantle therapy..."
