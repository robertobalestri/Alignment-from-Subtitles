1
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,858
I guess everybody else is dead.

2
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,253
Which means we're
totally outnumbered.

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,164
We gotta make up for
that in pure firepower.

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,327
You want to raid the
feeding area, don't you?

5
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,870
Two boxes of grenades in there.

6
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,406
It's our only chance
at getting out.

7
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,537
Vince, that place
is a deathtrap.

8
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,442
Lucky for you I've
got the megablaster.

9
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,076
Lee, you go right, Roy,
straight down the middle.

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,051
I'll cover you both.

11
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,185
One, two, three.

12
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,993
Where's that cover fire?

13
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,937
Megablaster, dude, megablaster!

14
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,703
What the hell?

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,579
Got it. Vince, where are you?

16
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,948
I can't get them off of me.

17
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,458
Vince, you d-bag, where are you?

18
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,154
Damn it! Damn it!

19
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,421
Damn it, Vince.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,691
That blood look funny to you?

21
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,294
Still working on it.
The code's a little janky.

22
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,070
Hey, boss, you just like watching
us get our asses shredded?

23
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,485
Yeah, not that
you're not hilarious,

24
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,638
but we hit the shelves
in three months.

25
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,948
Vince?

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,916
Vince, what's wrong?

27
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,658
My hands, they're on fire.

28
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,990
Your NCV test was normal.
Rules out carpal tunnel.

29
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,764
No evidence of trauma,
your blood work looks normal.

30
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,828
Then what is it? I don't know.

31
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,583
I'll arrange to have you
transferred to a neurologist.

32
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,372
A neurologist? Don't you have
some famous diagnostics guy?

33
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,502
What's he doing?

34
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,810
I quit.

35
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,088
You can't quit.

36
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,125
I think you're confusing
me with Jake Gyllenhaal.

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,191
House, are you okay?

38
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,956
Yeah. And I want
to stay that way.

39
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,339
I talked it over
with my therapist.

40
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,389
I need to change my
environment, my habits.

41
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,366
But he cleared you to
get your license back.

42
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,029
Which will help immensely
with my new job in research.

43
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,733
I've sent out some resumes. Research
means no patients, less pressure.

44
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,266
But you just got out, have you had
enough time to think this through?

45
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,879
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,451
I know this will
affect both of you,

47
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,545
and Thirteen, and
the one with the nose.

48
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,820
But I just can't risk
coming back here.

49
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,228
Okay.

50
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,274
That was surprising.

51
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,548
I want to run the department.

52
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,512
You consider waiting
until House clears the lobby

53
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,286
before you start
angling for his job?

54
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,883
He's not dead or sentimental,

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,223
and somebody needs to do it.

56
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,956
Not necessarily.

57
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,495
Departments of diagnostic
medicine don't exist.

58
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,194
The only reason we have
one is because of House.

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,500
You reassigned us, kept us
on payroll for three months,

60
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,815
you might as well
give me a chance.

61
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,966
You're a great doctor,

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,444
I want you to stay on in
Neuro, but House was a genius.

63
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:42,142
House was an egotistical,
pill-popping, lawsuit magnet.

64
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,511
And a genius.

65
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,680
And I worked with him longer
than anybody else. I can do this.

66
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,558
You get one shot.

67
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,026
What's House gonna do?

68
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,832
No idea, but he's gone,

69
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,100
so how about we
focus on the medicine?

70
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,473
What?

71
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,408
You're the boss,
it's kind of sexy.

72
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,813
Here I thought it
was just the pants.

73
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,346
Diabetic neuropathy?

74
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,610
HbA1c looks fine.

75
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,185
Could be hypothyroidism.

76
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,084
No fatigue or weight gain.

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,986
What about complex
regional pain syndrome?

78
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,820
That's a good idea.
Let's run with it.

79
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,951
Look at that. No House,
the job still gets done.

80
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,188
And yet, something's missing.

81
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,924
I'm short, he's
black, you're gay-ish.

82
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,090
That's it.

83
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,658
Treat for CRPS. Prep the
patient for spinal stimulation.

84
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,396
I don't buy it.

85
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,951
CRPS isn't that well
understood, but...

86
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,774
I think it's mercury
poisoning. I eat a ton of sushi.

87
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,255
And you're currently
getting mixed reviews

88
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,875
in <i>Speed the Plow</i> on
Broadway? Google it.

89
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,260
It's pretty hard to
consume enough fish

90
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,650
to give yourself
mercury poisoning,

91
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,779
and it doesn't usually
present solely with pain.

92
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,916
But it can. Check out the
<i>Atlantic Medical Journal.</i>

93
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,516
This guy came in
with burning pain

94
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,995
caused by Erythromelalgia

95
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,190
caused by mercury poisoning.

96
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,942
Who needs actual doctors
when you've got the Internet?

97
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,628
No offense, but
doctors make mistakes.

98
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,465
Medical errors are
up 30% this year.

99
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,368
You should check
the rate of patient error.

100
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,370
There's a ton of
information out there.

101
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,001
Why wouldn't I educate
myself, be my own advocate?

102
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,636
CRPS came up in my search, too,

103
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,374
but I've never had
any skin discoloration,

104
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,575
and my pain is
sporadic, not constant.

105
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,685
It's gotta be worth
one lousy blood test.

106
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,181
You know how House feels

107
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,588
about people touching his ball.

108
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,251
No, Chase refuses to tell me.

109
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,158
Right, my husband's gay. Witty.

110
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,823
I hear you're taking
over for House.

111
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,896
You're gonna be
great. Congratulations.

112
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,635
Not permanent.

113
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,571
Yet. Taub and
Thirteen cool with it?

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,767
He's older than you.
She's seen you naked.

115
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,053
Not like we haven't been
working together for two years now.

116
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,138
Working with is
different than working for.

117
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,882
You saw House, how was he?

118
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,944
He was good.

119
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,650
He was honest, took
responsibility. It was kind of weird.

120
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,621
Is Thirteen around? I need
her to sign off on her ER transfer.

121
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,222
She and Taub are
doing a spinal stimulation.

122
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,425
No, they're not.

123
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,832
I just dropped a
patient in the cath suite,

124
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,394
and your guys were not in there.

125
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,669
You know, usually,
spinal stimulation

126
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,269
is done with the
patient in the room.

127
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,406
He asked us to test
his blood for mercury.

128
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,245
It's unlikely, but
not impossible.

129
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,596
It's also not what we agreed on.

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,429
Testing doesn't hurt, and
it only takes 20 minutes.

131
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,533
I figured it didn't matter.

132
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,147
I'm thinking I should
decide when it matters.

133
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,022
If you're done
marking your territory...

134
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,861
Test results. Surprise, surprise,
Marcus Welby was wrong.

135
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,561
I'll handle this.

136
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,938
You expected not to
have mixed feelings?

137
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,737
I know it's the right call.

138
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,048
I just don't know what to
do with my time, and my leg.

139
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,084
Pain's flared up
since I left Mayfield.

140
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,949
Ibuprofen's barely
putting a dent in it.

141
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,811
You need a hobby.

142
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,289
Right. Doctors the world
over treat chronic pain

143
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,848
with collections of
Hummel figurines.

144
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,860
No, I didn't say you
need a lame hobby.

145
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,694
You need something to keep you
engaged, connected to other people.

146
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,666
You already made
me get a roommate.

147
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,894
Wilson's got one bedroom.

148
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,029
I don't think we can get any
more connected without unzipping.

149
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,097
Okay. So what does
Wilson like to do?

150
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,381
Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman,
Head of Diagnostics.

151
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,713
So you must be the
genius's replacement.

152
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,515
I prefer to think of
myself as Genius 2.0.

153
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,264
Your blood test ruled
out mercury poisoning.

154
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,018
What was my mercury
level? Two-point-eight.

155
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,234
That means for every
deciliter of blood...

156
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,591
I know what it means. I
also know it's above normal.

157
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,788
I want mercury chelation.

158
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,141
Your level isn't elevated enough
to produce your symptoms.

159
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,226
You can't know that until we
de-elevate it and see if my pain improves.

160
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,792
It's a judgment call.

161
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,100
Based on 10 years
of medical training?

162
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,903
I think you have CRPS. I
want to try spinal stimulation.

163
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:40,038
So, basically, you want to shove a needle
in my spine based on a glorified hunch.

164
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,173
I'll stick with the chelation.

165
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,719
If you don't want to get
better, I think we're done.

166
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,086
What do you mean "done"?

167
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,125
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

168
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,626
I'll move on to my next patient,

169
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,820
you'll move on to a doctor

170
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,590
willing to run all the
unnecessary tests

171
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,566
and procedures you want. Or
you can stick around and be cured.

172
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,228
Makes no difference to me.

173
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,538
I'm glad you changed your mind.

174
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,169
Don't know about that.

175
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,008
Dr. Foreman basically
strong-armed me.

176
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,870
Which is impressive.

177
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,213
Stimulating at 100 hertz.

178
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,776
Guess you found him a little
more persuasive than the two of us.

179
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,686
Probably the pants.

180
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,314
He reminds me of me.

181
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:26,985
Is it supposed to hurt?

182
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,358
Not if we're in correctly.

183
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,226
Is it your hands? Your back?

184
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,855
No, my chest.

185
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,830
Can't breathe.

186
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,597
Heart rate's 140, climbing.

187
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,331
You need to hold still.

188
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,464
What did you do?

189
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,733
Deep breaths.

190
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,544
His lungs are
filling with fluid.

191
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,313
Analysis of the fluid from Vince's
lungs shows the lung problem

192
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,719
is really a heart problem.

193
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,757
He's got a thickened
left ventricle.

194
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,468
When his heart sped
up during the procedure,

195
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,985
it jacked up the pressure in his
lungs, causing pulmonary edema.

196
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,262
Good thing I talked the
patient into spinal stimulation.

197
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,323
It did lead us to
discovering a new symptom,

198
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,211
and proved he was wrong
about mercury poisoning.

199
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,669
We lucked into that discovery,

200
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,968
and we were wrong about CRPS.

201
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,471
Ventricular thickening plus
neuropathy could equal Lyme disease.

202
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,772
Not without joint pain.

203
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,813
When's his new game coming out?

204
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,903
Couple of months.

205
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,091
He's probably working non-stop.

206
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,035
Might be using more than
coffee to power through.

207
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,881
Cocaine use explains
his symptoms.

208
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,716
So we search his
office for drugs.

209
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,154
No. We're gonna ask him.

210
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,997
In a lot of ways,
cooking is like music.

211
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,662
Different elements combine
to make a symphony.

212
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,164
Difference is that
Beethoven's <i>Fifth</i>

213
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,433
isn't going to be poop tomorrow.

214
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,940
What was my one condition

215
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,999
for allowing you to tag along?

216
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,669
Try not to be a jerk.

217
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,940
I'm trying. I'm just failing.

218
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,747
Roll your meatballs
and keep an open mind.

219
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,421
How hard are you trying not
to make a ball joke right now?

220
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,118
They're smoking.

221
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,727
Your balls.

222
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,093
Oh.

223
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,394
No, no. They're
browning way too fast.

224
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,065
Blue's the color you
gotta watch out for.

225
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,658
Enough.

226
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,637
God, they're...
They're still raw inside.

227
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,749
By the time they're cooked
through, the outside will be burnt.

228
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,766
I think there's a
medicated powder for that.

229
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,613
Although, vinegar could work.

230
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,975
My old chem prof talked about

231
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,262
theoretically you
shouldn't trust

232
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,278
the results of a
hemoglobin A1C test

233
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,756
on a chronically
acidotic patient.

234
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,992
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

235
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,086
between the hemoglobin
protein and blood sugar.

236
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,097
Browning meat is the
same chemical process,

237
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,896
which means it should
also be slowed by acid.

238
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,960
That actually makes sense.

239
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,601
You might have saved my balls.

240
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,336
That's the spirit!

241
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,303
Obviously the procedure
didn't go as planned.

242
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,757
The heart problem
was unforeseeable,

243
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,340
but I still feel responsible.

244
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,416
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,645
Okay.

246
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,415
How long have you
guys been doing it?

247
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,623
I think it's best if we
kept things professional.

248
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,868
Tough to do, now that I've seen

249
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,485
you rock a leopard-print bikini.

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,859
Congrats, by the way. Up top.

251
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,627
You hacked my profile page?

252
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,565
Your treatment nearly
gave me a heart attack.

253
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,179
Figured I'd check if you had the
credentials to go with the <i>cojones,</i>

254
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,296
one search led to another.

255
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,498
Is there a shot of just her?

256
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,801
I'm thinking screensaver.

257
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,551
We need to know if
you've been using cocaine.

258
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,635
Nope. Dude, you
just block everybody

259
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,088
or do you really only
have three friends?

260
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,740
We need you to
be straight with us.

261
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,249
We need to be able to trust you.

262
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,917
I cleaned up my
act 12 years ago,

263
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,819
after my college roommate OD'd.

264
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,054
Okay.

265
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,192
Search his office.

266
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,293
You think he was lying?

267
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,929
No, but I'm not sure.

268
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,005
It was worth asking.

269
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,617
If he'd said yes, it
would've saved us a trip.

270
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,303
But he didn't.

271
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,408
You have to forget about him.

272
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,505
The patient? House.

273
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,106
First you try acting like him,

274
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,243
that doesn't work, so
then you try the opposite.

275
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,413
Now you're mad because
you have to use his move.

276
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,991
I feel like Tom Brady's backup.

277
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,754
Tom Brady's backup
now makes $10 million.

278
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,161
Stop comparing. You
can do this by being you.

279
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,329
We should still check out his
office, talk to his co-workers.

280
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,401
I'll get Taub.

281
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,469
And

282
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,833
thanks.

283
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,798
Oh. And dinner tonight at 7:00.

284
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,899
Can we make it 8:00?

285
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,036
Already made a
reservation for 7:00.

286
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,350
Hi.

287
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,579
I'm making gnocchi.

288
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,056
Oh, I didn't mean
to intrude, I just...

289
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,687
Cecile's in my cooking class.

290
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,822
She doesn't speak English.

291
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,432
You bake the potatoes
instead of boiling.

292
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,602
Less moisture, fewer
gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.

293
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,837
You seem good.

294
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,038
Feeling better.

295
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,013
House.

296
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,965
I need to talk to you about
your leaving the hospital.

297
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,549
I do love a good groveling,
but my decision is final.

298
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,789
That's fine, as long as
I'm not the reason for it.

299
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,539
I know that sounds
completely narcissistic.

300
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,156
Yeah.

301
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,962
But it's not. We flirted,
we kissed, I fondled.

302
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,045
I hallucinated a night with you

303
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,575
and yelled it from
a hospital balcony.

304
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,543
You're not a narcissist.

305
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,107
So what am I?

306
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,307
Not the reason I'm leaving.

307
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,350
House.

308
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,854
I'm gonna miss you.

309
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,492
Lady, either kiss him or
leave. We got work to do.

310
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,788
You just couldn't
keep your trap shut.

311
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:06,992
Make the damn gnocchi.

312
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,125
Bye.

313
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,453
I guess you're not in a hurry

314
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,105
to get back to the office.

315
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,202
And you are?

316
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,845
I'm not trying to
avoid my boyfriend.

317
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,656
I'm a lizard, not an idiot.

318
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,268
You've been in a crappy mood

319
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,385
since we got in the car.

320
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,020
And you're completely okay with
being ordered around by someone

321
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,191
who 24 hours ago was
basically your equal?

322
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,997
Unlike you, I didn't
expect anything different.

323
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,664
The work part I can get used to.

324
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,539
He didn't ask me to go to
dinner, he told me we were going.

325
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,275
He's never done that before.

326
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,372
So even the score.
Go home tonight,

327
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,168
put on some heels and
break him like a pony.

328
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,482
You'll feel much better. What?

329
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,120
That's one big-ass bird.

330
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,025
Wow. That's kind of amazing,

331
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,298
the way the wings
move, it's so real.

332
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,203
Get them off me!

333
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,967
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

334
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,908
I'm going to call Foreman.

335
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,370
A little help.

336
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,149
Your partner said
you studied birds

337
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,549
to improve the game animation.

338
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,644
Did you touch them? Can't
dissect without touching.

339
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,131
It's the best way to
understand the anatomy.

340
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,319
It's also a good way to contract
an infection called psittacosis.

341
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,952
We spoke to Dr. Foreman, he
wants to start you on antibiotics.

342
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:46,329
Does that infection cause
problems in the joystick area?

343
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,833
Kind of stuck in play mode.

344
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,734
Yes, we get it. She's
very, very pretty.

345
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,602
It's not her. I mean, it was,

346
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,835
when she was here with
her boyfriend three hours ago.

347
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,909
You've had an
erection for three hours?

348
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,623
At first, it was
just embarrassing,

349
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,115
but now it's really
starting to hurt.

350
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,377
Will the antibiotics help?

351
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,511
I'm afraid not. This
isn't psittacosis.

352
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,335
His erection persisted
even with medication.

353
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,793
We had to put in
a surgical shunt

354
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,089
just to drain the blood.

355
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,462
You missed dinner. And a
shunt doesn't require both of you.

356
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:23,230
I'm dedicated. So, the holy
trinity, heart, hands, hose.

357
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,379
Could be Guillain-Barré.

358
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,032
Not with normal
nerve conduction.

359
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,464
Thrombocytosis.

360
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,305
His platelet count
isn't that high.

361
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,571
Brain tumor makes more sense.

362
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,611
I'm sorry, I just realized.
Joint pain and joint pain.

363
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,846
Honest, I wasn't laughing

364
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,049
because of the obvious
tension between the two of you.

365
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,158
Erection points to a circulatory
problem. I'm with Foreman.

366
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,705
It is possible for a
brain tumor to cause...

367
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,995
We're going with thrombocytosis.

368
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,660
Okay.

369
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,501
You're mad I didn't
ask you to dinner?

370
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,972
How long have we been dating?

371
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,167
It felt like an order.

372
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,265
Your tone of voice was...

373
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,342
My tone?

374
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,487
I'm under a little
pressure right now.

375
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,622
How about giving me a break?

376
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,308
Look, this is tough
for both of us,

377
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,247
except I haven't just
gotten a promotion.

378
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,184
So, now you're jealous?

379
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,152
No. I'm just saying
don't complain

380
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,746
about the burdens of
command to your employees.

381
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,485
I was complaining
to my girlfriend.

382
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,789
Who are those guys?

383
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,762
I have no idea.

384
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,664
Meet the competition.

385
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,103
Steve Paulson,
Neurology, St. Mark's.

386
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,172
Nice to meet you.

387
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
You called another doctor?

388
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,209
Lots of other doctors. I posted
my symptoms on the Internet.

389
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,489
You guys are 0-for-2. I
thought I'd look for some backup.

390
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,142
I can cure all your symptoms
with my papaya toxin cleanse.

391
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,548
Month's supply, $395.

392
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,996
Okay, that guy's an idiot.
That doesn't mean they all are.

393
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,489
Neither one of you have
privileges at this hospital,

394
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,991
please leave. Now.

395
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,620
Dr. Foreman, sorry
for the intrusion,

396
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,325
but I notice you haven't
done a head MRI yet.

397
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,475
Because he doesn't need one.

398
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,058
I'm pretty sure he's
got a brain tumor.

399
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,298
We considered that and concluded
thrombocytosis is more likely.

400
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,839
I'm starting him on hydroxyurea.

401
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,535
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

402
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,686
If you took an
image, I'm sure...

403
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,474
There are no signs
of increased ICP.

404
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,556
I'm not delaying treatment.
Looks like we need a tiebreaker.

405
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,811
Dr. Hadley, what do you think?

406
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,044
I think both
theories have merit.

407
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,080
So, brain tumor, otherwise
you'd back your boss/boyfriend.

408
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,750
I want an MRI.

409
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,260
Fine. I'll set it up.

410
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,304
Great, you're up.
I need a taster.

411
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,635
Ragú with pork sausage,
beef thigh, no cream.

412
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,978
It's a little early.

413
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,850
Did you even go
to bed last night?

414
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,622
Bed is for sissies.

415
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,290
Unless you're having
sex, in which case...

416
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,128
No, bed is still for sissies.

417
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,169
Doesn't this seem
a little bit obsessive?

418
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,396
You should have been here
when I was butchering the ox.

419
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,682
What do you
expect? I'm an addict,

420
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,833
I turn everything up to 11.

421
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,399
Yeah, I thought you were
trying to tone that down.

422
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,877
No, I'm just trying to find
something I can set at 11

423
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,436
without blowing out my eardrums.

424
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,380
Star anise with the
caramelized onions,

425
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,578
the sulfur compounds
bring out the meat flavor.

426
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,217
I couldn't sleep
because of my leg.

427
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,285
It was either make ragù or go
out on the street looking to score.

428
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,501
Good choice. So, so good.

429
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,507
He asked me a
question, I answered.

430
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,048
You told me to make
my own decisions,

431
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,481
I do, and you stab
me in the back.

432
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,927
I didn't even say
what I really thought.

433
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,216
I hedged, and I don't
like that I hedged.

434
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,397
If I have a
legitimate opinion...

435
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,253
You express it in private.

436
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,792
In public, the team
opinion is your opinion.

437
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,658
Except the team
opinion is your opinion.

438
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,621
That's my job. And what's mine?

439
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,394
To lie when I'm asked
a direct question?

440
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,159
You would have
done it for House.

441
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,137
Maybe you just don't
want me to succeed.

442
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,436
Maybe you just
want to kick me again

443
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,476
for not asking you to dinner.

444
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,410
At least when House was
being an unbelievable jerk,

445
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,242
I could talk to my
boyfriend about it.

446
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,910
I may be a jerk, but
you're wrong. MRI is clean.

447
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,413
Treat for thrombocytosis.

448
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,629
You're early.

449
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,160
For what?

450
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,294
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about Foreman.

451
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,168
I thought you'd hold out
for another week at least.

452
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,333
I showed up to ask if
you've seen thromobocytosis

453
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,551
with a platelet count under...

454
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,545
I went crazy, not stupid.

455
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,878
I leave, Foreman
embraces his inner Mugabe.

456
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:04,816
What's that?

457
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,080
Embryonali.
Unhatched chicken egg.

458
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,654
I'm going to suck out some of
the yolk and replace it with ragù.

459
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,250
By the way, you can
tell the other lepers

460
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,817
that their absence
has been noted.

461
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,022
Cameron didn't come by?

462
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,191
Daddy's little co-dependent
is all grown up.

463
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,335
Making room for Daddy's hot
bisexual with boyfriend problems.

464
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,531
It's not a problem, it's...

465
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,102
Okay, it's a problem.

466
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,511
I mean, I get it, the patient's a
nightmare. He posted his case online.

467
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,383
You know Foreman,
you know the situation.

468
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,544
How can I get him
to tone it down?

469
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,144
Stop being a
coward, for one thing.

470
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,531
He's the one who's
afraid of failure.

471
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,081
In a job that no one
before me has ever done.

472
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,150
His fears are justified.

473
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,355
You're just afraid of
giving him control over you.

474
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,453
Which might work at home,

475
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,692
but makes it almost
impossible for him to do his job.

476
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,667
Pass me those crackers.

477
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,135
You're saying
this is all my fault?

478
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,605
I'm saying

479
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:04,701
that you would be happier if you
learned when it's okay to give in.

480
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,036
What?

481
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,743
You just suggested that I
give in so that I could be happy.

482
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,949
What did they do
to you in there?

483
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,214
Taste this.

484
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,466
Oh, my God.

485
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,730
This might be the best
thing I've ever eaten.

486
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,010
And, yes, I'm including
what you're thinking of now.

487
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,070
You're an amazing cook!

488
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,644
I know.

489
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,320
And yet, my leg hurts.

490
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,813
Fire her.

491
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,934
I'm not gonna fire her.

492
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,069
Then stop being such a wuss.

493
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,220
I am not being a wuss.

494
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,388
Challenging you
is part of her job.

495
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,227
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

496
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,857
So you're saying
this is my fault.

497
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,435
I was trying to bury
it a little, but, yeah.

498
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,234
You gotta eliminate either
the challenge or the reaction.

499
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,639
Or we could stick
with my original plan.

500
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,973
We get drunk and talk
about how girls are lame.

501
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,309
Yeah, this problem
will go away on its own.

502
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,523
It's 8:00 in the morning.

503
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,754
Coffee ice cream.

504
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,530
No frittata, no bombolini?

505
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,157
Started thinking
about what you said,

506
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,795
about me obsessing. Started
obsessing about obsessing,

507
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,997
decided to take a day off.

508
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,336
You were enjoying cooking.

509
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,139
How like a man
to think that I enjoy

510
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,768
slaving over a hot stove all day

511
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,437
while you're off
banging secretaries.

512
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,778
You said it was keeping
your mind off the pain.

513
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,546
That was before I discovered <i>The
Biggest Loser</i> marathon on cable.

514
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,384
I like to pretend they
can see me eating.

515
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,850
And your leg?

516
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,017
It's fine.

517
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,661
My leg's killing me.

518
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,157
Cooking helped for a while,

519
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,725
then I guess I got bored.

520
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,294
My leg started hurting again.

521
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,840
Then I got worried, and
that made the pain worse.

522
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,705
What are you worried about?

523
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,641
That nothing's gonna help.

524
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,680
That I end up in
the Very Dark Place.

525
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm fine, I'm just not happy.

526
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,197
I didn't let you out
because you were happy.

527
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,461
I let you out because I believe

528
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,515
you have the skills
to cope with that.

529
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,959
You tried one thing, it
didn't work, so move on.

530
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,555
Write, play chess...

531
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,654
What if nothing works?

532
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,476
What if nothing gives
me more than a few days

533
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,628
before my brain starts
looking for the next fix,

534
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,729
before my leg feels like
someone's shoving nails into it.

535
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,865
What do I do then?

536
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,275
If nothing in the world
can hold your interest,

537
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,347
we'll deal with that
when we get to it.

538
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:58,782
But you have to trust me,
and you have to be patient.

539
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,058
I brought you a donut.

540
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,961
The florist was closed.

541
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,264
I'll get a vase
and put it in water.

542
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,837
You know I'm sorry, right?

543
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,196
I'm sorry, too.

544
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,475
Do you think

545
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,476
we could start over?

546
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,275
That's a fantastic idea.

547
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,484
We're gonna be late.

548
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,649
Your boss won't mind.

549
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,597
No way.

550
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,001
His lymph nodes blew up.

551
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,508
He's been treated
for thrombocytosis,

552
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,868
but there's been no change.

553
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:53,962
I was wrong.

554
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,405
God, you are a genius.

555
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,999
I'm adding this to
my list of symptoms.

556
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,119
That didn't work last time.

557
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,771
Because I didn't
think big enough.

558
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,314
Now I'm offering
a $25,000 reward.

559
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,960
Steroids reduced
his facial swelling.

560
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,095
Swollen lymph nodes
rule out thrombocytosis.

561
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,163
How did so many people
get my personal e-mail?

562
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,936
The Internet is a magical place.

563
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,335
Lymph enlargement
makes me think polyarteritis.

564
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,003
You were saying?

565
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,050
No point in treating the
symptom and not the disease.

566
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,348
Your stunt generated
quite a few responses.

567
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,866
Let's take a look.
I'm way ahead of you.

568
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,257
Paraneoplastic syndrome
secondary to spinal tumor.

569
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,296
No. No hypercalcemia, no
muscle spasms or incontinence.

570
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,594
You are possessed by
the Biblical demon Legion.

571
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,691
No. No jumping off a
cliff in a herd of pigs.

572
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,962
Otherwise, it did fit.

573
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,035
Graves' disease.

574
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,662
No. Thyroid levels are normal.

575
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,070
You want us to
spend next few days

576
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,483
shooting down every
theory in the world,

577
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,585
or can we do our jobs and
come up with one that works?

578
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,340
I want you to test
me for amyloidosis.

579
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,723
Is that your
professional opinion?

580
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,079
It's the wisdom of crowds.

581
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,673
Studies show that
collective decision

582
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,686
of a group can be more accurate
than any individual's decision.

583
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:50,450
I went through my e-mails,
amyloidosis got the most votes.

584
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,990
If you had amyloidosis,

585
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,992
there'd be speckling on
your cardiac ultrasound.

586
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,119
In 100% of cases?

587
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,894
Fine. I'll make you a deal.

588
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,332
We do a kidney biopsy
to test for amyloidosis.

589
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:03,511
When it comes back negative,

590
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,733
you pull your case off of the
Internet and retract the reward.

591
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,502
It's either that or I
don't test you at all.

592
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,936
Deal.

593
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,022
If you wanted a quickie,
you should have called ahead.

594
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,614
I'm a mess.

595
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,419
I came home for lunch.

596
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,486
You have lunch with
Cuddy on Tuesdays.

597
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,225
She was busy.

598
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,926
And you're checking up on me.

599
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,835
You know, you can talk
to me... Is that my laundry?

600
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,603
You were running out
of socks for me to borrow.

601
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,469
We have plenty of
underwear, though.

602
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,775
I'm fine.

603
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,158
You said that this morning.

604
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,708
And consistency proves what?

605
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:56,483
Really, I'm good. I'll
put these in your room.

606
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,821
<i>You always hurt the one you love</i>

607
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:15,171
Biopsy showed deposits in the renal
endothelium consistent with amyloidosis.

608
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,877
The Internet was right.
Start him on dexamethasone.

609
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,207
Already done.

610
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,238
This may not be the best
time for this, but I quit.

611
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,846
I got an offer to join a
friend's surgical practice.

612
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,956
You don't generally get an offer

613
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,456
unless you're looking for one.

614
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,585
I put out some feelers when I
found out House wasn't coming back.

615
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,390
I lobbied to keep
the department open

616
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,624
so you could keep your job.

617
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:43,328
Yes, that was incredibly
altruistic of you.

618
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,076
It's nothing personal. Actually,
I think you're doing pretty well.

619
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,637
But I came here
to work with House.

620
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,484
He's a jerk. We'll
be fine without him.

621
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,770
Do you know how many
resumes we get every day

622
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,353
without even asking?

623
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,160
Might be a few less after
Cuddy shuts us down.

624
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,558
The case got solved
under your watch,

625
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,501
does it really matter
how it happened?

626
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,039
It matters.

627
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,312
What if I'm just not
ready for this job?

628
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,111
Okay, you're sad.

629
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,752
I could tell you
the story about me

630
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,620
and my roommate
at Sarah Lawrence.

631
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,619
Okay.

632
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:48,690
Her name was Lindsey, and
she was a cheerleader from Iowa.

633
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,170
I broke my toilet this morning.

634
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,432
I'll get my tools.

635
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:01,378
I blocked the intake valve so I
could collect some of House's urine.

636
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,540
Cuddy, he was barely limping.

637
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:04,674
What did the lab say?

638
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,342
The urine was clean for Vicodin.

639
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,877
It did however contain
strange epithelial cells.

640
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:13,722
Further analysis showed they
were from a Labrador Retriever.

641
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,925
Damn.

642
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,787
He's using.

643
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,455
Vince, Vince. Vince, relax.

644
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,890
It's Dr. Foreman.

645
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:31,930
Kill it! Kill it! No! I
don't have my blaster.

646
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,032
He's hallucinating
'cause he's burning up.

647
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,003
Amyloidosis wouldn't do this.

648
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,175
Antipyretics didn't work.

649
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,271
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

650
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,476
Maybe we should see if
anyone's sent in other ideas.

651
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,828
Maybe the reward
money attracted...

652
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,185
No, I'm not letting
anyone else jerk us around.

653
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,519
The masses were
wrong about amyloidosis.

654
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,058
They don't know about the fever.

655
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,357
I'm going with Light-Chain
Deposition Disorder.

656
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,454
You okay with that?

657
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,589
Yes.

658
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,533
We think you have a
disease called LCDD.

659
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,704
It causes proteins to
build up in your organs.

660
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,179
You think?

661
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,250
We can't definitely
confirm the diagnosis.

662
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:27,962
And our only
chance of beating this

663
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,888
would be to start you on
high-dose chemotherapy.

664
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:35,120
But I do have to warn you that
in your condition, it might kill you.

665
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,492
Do you want me to get
you some more information?

666
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,565
You're my doctor, I trust you.

667
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,102
No, you don't.

668
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,734
You're scared, and you don't
want to make this decision.

669
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,318
My career is
riding on this case.

670
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,381
Nowhere near as
important as your life.

671
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,025
But I think the best shot for
both of us is to treat for LCDD.

672
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,328
Okay.

673
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:22,802
All right. Let's get you out
of this tub and into chemo.

674
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,774
We know you're back on Vicodin.

675
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:29,871
No.

676
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,746
The only thing you
know is that I'm a genius

677
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,149
who got a dog to
pee in your toilet.

678
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,653
You don't know how I did it,

679
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,053
or, more interestingly,
where I peed.

680
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,183
House, you've spent
the last three months...

681
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,954
<i>Et tu, Butte?</i>

682
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,070
You got no reason to be here,

683
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,305
he's the one I
was jerking around.

684
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,888
Why is your leg better?

685
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:49,059
Ow! It hurts.
Please go away now.

686
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,311
If you really think I'm using,

687
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,646
how about asking me before
taking a wrench to your plumbing?

688
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,763
House, you're an addict.

689
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,899
You can't be surprised if we
can't take you at your word.

690
00:37:56,975 --> 00:38:01,913
Fine. Let's get you some
proof. Hide your eyes, ladies.

691
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,277
House. You, too.

692
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,587
My godson made me that mug.

693
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,557
If the lab says this
is Retriever, too,

694
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,025
please let me know right away.

695
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,561
It'd explain my
overwhelming desire

696
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,188
to wipe my butt on your carpet.

697
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,069
Thank you for
dragging me into this.

698
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,419
Stop the chemo, he's
got Fabry's disease.

699
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,601
He was in a tub for an hour,

700
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,753
his fingers should have
pruned, but they didn't.

701
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,321
Already stopped chemo,
and confirmed Fabry's.

702
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:56,994
I'm glad you both agree but
could somebody loop me in here?

703
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,900
We assumed the
deposits in your kidneys

704
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,064
were proteins,
but they were fats.

705
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,507
Fabry's makes them build up in
your organs, choke your nerves,

706
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,102
keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

707
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,646
It's chronic but manageable.

708
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,739
How did you figure it out?

709
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,044
Iodide mumps.

710
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,181
His lymph nodes swelled
up after the head CT.

711
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,556
We thought it was a new
symptom, but it wasn't,

712
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,390
it was a reaction
to the contrast.

713
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,453
Iodide mumps takes
lymph nodes off the table.

714
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,692
Remove that symptom...

715
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,859
And that just came to you?

716
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,929
I looked through the
online responses again.

717
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,998
Someone posted it this morning.

718
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,554
I heard Cuddy made it official.

719
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:55,219
Department's yours. Congrats.

720
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,263
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,268
I went behind your back.

722
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,237
On a scale of one to
10, how mad are you?

723
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:12,105
A seven. And that's stupid.

724
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,742
You did the right thing.

725
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,924
It's my fault you thought
you had to go behind my back.

726
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,125
I should have stood up to you.

727
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,244
But you didn't 'cause you
didn't want to fight again.

728
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:27,155
It's our first case,
it'll take time to adjust.

729
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,793
What if by the time
we get adjusted,

730
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,459
we don't like each
other anymore?

731
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,728
That's not gonna happen.

732
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,962
Are you sure?

733
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,313
'Cause ever since
I took this job,

734
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:42,501
we've been making
each other miserable.

735
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,375
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

736
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,786
You're breaking up with me?

737
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:57,913
No.

738
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,756
The other night, when I thought
I was done, you were there.

739
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,827
I need you.

740
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,122
I don't want to lose you.

741
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,932
Then, why are you...

742
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,373
You're firing me.

743
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,218
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,491
I slipped.

745
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,822
You took Vicodin?

746
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,136
$25,000.

747
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,307
I solved my old team's case.

748
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,108
I was about to take
the pills, I went online,

749
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,012
I found people posting
medical problems.

750
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:01,416
And my leg stopped hurting.

751
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,115
Oh.

752
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,717
Oh?

753
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,720
I'm supposed to be changing
my life. This is not a change.

754
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,857
Maybe I was wrong.

755
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,265
Says the guy making
sand castles in my brain.

756
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,826
We need to keep you from using.

757
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,099
Taking your job away,
the medical puzzles,

758
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,697
nearly drove you back to it.

759
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:27,974
Maybe diagnostic medicine is
the key to keeping you clean.

760
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:33,648
So you're okay with me
going online, solving cases?

761
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,947
No.

762
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,748
You can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

763
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,382
Isolation fosters depression.

764
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,427
The hospital is
part of my old life.

765
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,895
If I go back, I might become

766
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,023
who I was before, pills and all.

767
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,034
That's a possibility.

768
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,332
But could be,

769
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,737
the only thing worse for you than
going back to diagnostic medicine

770
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,070
is not going back.

771
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,649
Guess we're gonna find out.
