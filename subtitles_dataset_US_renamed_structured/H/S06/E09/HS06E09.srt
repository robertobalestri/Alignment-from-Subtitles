1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,870
How the...

2
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:38,038
You know, most people go
for the hardwood or carpeting.

3
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,007
I think guitars and
garbage work just as well.

4
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,043
Got the urge to play last night,

5
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,621
had to go all the way
back to my apartment.

6
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,273
Thought I'd save
on future trips.

7
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,439
Hmm.

8
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,913
That's very eco-friendly of you.

9
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,351
How about keeping down
on the noise pollution?

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,413
6:33. You should
be flossing by now.

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,958
I'm not going to work today.

12
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,291
I'm going hunting.

13
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,827
After I sleep in.

14
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,376
Is it that time of year again?

15
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,847
He's a self-important jerk.

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,044
He's my friend.

17
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,815
He's a self-important jerk.

18
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,789
Seems to be what
I'm attracted to.

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,382
Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't
even know your name.

20
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,295
Jim is short for James.
Now go away, Lim.

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,960
Nice shot, Jim.

22
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,232
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,831
Oh, yeah. I nailed that tree.

24
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,969
Maple syrup for dinner.

25
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,121
We should have got a guide.

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,443
Doesn't count as a new adventure

27
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,243
if you have someone
holding your hand.

28
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,307
On the other hand,
we are holding weapons

29
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,183
and have no idea
what we're doing. Fun.

30
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,284
We need to sneak up on them.

31
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,156
I read somewhere that
the Native Americans say

32
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,023
turkeys know what
you're thinking.

33
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,085
So I should stop thinking
about German porn.

34
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,562
No, no. That'll
lure them closer.

35
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,438
We're terrible at this.

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,776
Yeah. Well, at least it's
cold and my new boots leak.

37
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,908
It's almost time anyway.
Did you bring the bag?

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,534
May 30th, 2004, 10:07 a.m.

39
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,231
Dr. Wilson informed me
that if treatment didn't go well,

40
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,705
my leukemia would give me
only six more months to live.

41
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,973
November 30th, 2004,
six months later, I didn't die.

42
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,113
As long as I am alive,

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,206
I will find new
and exciting ways

44
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,751
to thank you for
giving me another year.

45
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,152
Now move very, very
far away from there,

46
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,751
so that I can be sure and
thank you again next year.

47
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,947
Thanks, Jim.

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,880
All right. Let's see how many
more turkeys we can miss.

49
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,256
Yeah, this'll work.

50
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,053
What the hell?

51
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,361
God, sorry. I don't
know what happened.

52
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,832
I can't move my arm.

53
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,603
Am I having a stroke?

54
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,932
I don't know.

55
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,810
Good news. Head CT doesn't
show any signs of a stroke.

56
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,016
So he's gonna be okay, right?

57
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,255
I cannot believe how much you've
grown up in five years. She's...

58
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,595
She's not Emily.

59
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,132
Ashley. My girlfriend.

60
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
New life, new adventures.
Ashley, meet Jim.

61
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,859
It's good to meet you.

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,338
So this arm thing, does that
mean his leukemia's back?

63
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,274
I checked blood counts
and blood cell morphologies.

64
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,435
Everything is normal.

65
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,912
So these blood tests, that
means it's not cancer for sure?

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,073
He said I'm fine.

67
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,480
So what do you think it is?

68
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,246
Hopefully something innocuous.

69
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,482
There's a doctor I can
speak to who's great...

70
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,281
Who's great at diagnosing...

71
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,853
What?

72
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,188
Sorry, that cold sore.

73
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,854
How long have you had that?

74
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,364
Um, two weeks. I'm sorry.

75
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,309
I got the call, I didn't
have time to cover it up.

76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,333
What is it, Jim?

77
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,197
That cold sore is
caused by a virus.

78
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,037
Assuming you guys kiss,
the virus could transfer,

79
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,407
infect your spine and
cause the paralysis.

80
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,207
It's a disease called
Transverse Myelitis.

81
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,804
And is that good
news or bad news?

82
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,046
It's great news. I'll get you a
room and start you on acyclovir.

83
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,117
I just had a House moment.

84
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,181
Diagnosed Transverse
Myelitis from a cold sore.

85
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,521
How cool is that?

86
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,195
Patients really
eat that crap up.

87
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,926
It's why I'm loved.
What am I doing here?

88
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,399
Ultrasound is clear.

89
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,402
Which means he's
definitely not pregnant, right?

90
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,571
No gall stones.
Could be diverticulitis.

91
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,337
Have you eaten any seeds?

92
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,469
I'm joining you,
Antonio Aguilar.

93
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,570
We'll play in God's
Mariachi band.

94
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,445
Draw some blood.

95
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,849
The self-important jerk does
not have Transverse Myelitis.

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,548
He's got cancer.

97
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,645
How do you even...

98
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,190
Okay.

99
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,658
Maybe I paid the redhead
down in records a few bucks

100
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,786
to CC me on all your cases.

101
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,922
A few patients die,
you might get sad again,

102
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,795
make a speech that
would end your career.

103
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,335
Frankly, I'm
stalking you for you.

104
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,961
How long does a
simple blood draw take?

105
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,096
Almost finished.

106
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,504
Well, when you're finished
almost finishing it, test it.

107
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,304
My stomach was ripped
open by the hand of God.

108
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,503
He spilled my blood.

109
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,273
Confusion. Delirium.

110
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,111
Why rule out the
hand of God so fast?

111
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,879
Your guy's low white
count and right arm paralysis

112
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,684
equals a recurrence of
his leukemia. Simple math.

113
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,054
Did you look past the
first page of the file?

114
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,153
No AML cells anywhere. I
did the blood smears myself.

115
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,324
It's still cancer. You
know how I know?

116
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,732
He's got an
oncologist for a doctor.

117
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,101
And your magical
leukemia detector

118
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,764
is more powerful
than a flow cytometer?

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,799
I look for zebras because other
doctors rule out all the horses.

120
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,107
In this case, you are
those other doctors.

121
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,205
You haven't earned a zebra.

122
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,341
Hundred bucks. Are you serious?

123
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,944
Look, friends don't diagnose
friends with cancer. I get it.

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,818
Your problem is
you're not objective.

125
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,187
Your caring is
clouding your diagnosis.

126
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,386
If you just cut that out, you
could be a pretty decent doctor.

127
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,860
Just give me the
lactic acid level.

128
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,023
Twenty-seven.

129
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,906
The fact that you
can't speak English

130
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,267
is not an excuse for you not being
humiliated by what I'm about to say.

131
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,669
It's also not an excuse for you

132
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,867
not telling us that
you were a tennis pro.

133
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,701
If you had, we wouldn't
have wasted our time.

134
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,735
Fine. Hundred bucks.

135
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,715
Tucker settling in?

136
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,379
Yep. Already got his
first dose of acyclovir.

137
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,734
And don't worry, I ordered
his girlfriend the kiddie meal.

138
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,850
Next patient on deck.

139
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,654
Del Clinton, day six of chemo.

140
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,926
You just missed the grandkids.

141
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,985
Oh.

142
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:53,090
That's all right. Last time they
were here, they painted my tie.

143
00:08:56,069 --> 00:09:00,006
You're almost ready to
go home. You feeling okay?

144
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,838
I feel like I felt after
the last four rounds.

145
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,073
In oncology, familiar
pain means all is well.

146
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,205
So that's good, right?

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,304
Yeah.

148
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,459
I heard Jesse and
Zeke were by earlier.

149
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,610
Yeah.

150
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,315
I'm sorry, Del, I gotta run.

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,988
How are they doing?

152
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,758
They're fine.

153
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,767
No game-winning hits? No aced
report cards? No school plays?

154
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,496
I guess not.

155
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,495
I thought you had to go.

156
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,036
Are you depressed?

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,476
I have cancer.

158
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,810
You've had cancer
for a long time,

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
and it's never stopped you

160
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,439
from bragging
about the grandkids.

161
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,711
Oh.

162
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,050
I guess I'm feeling a little
more down than usual.

163
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,487
Can you give me something?

164
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,683
Yeah.

165
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,535
I don't want you to get alarmed,

166
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,619
but sometimes
depression can be a sign

167
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,094
that something else is going on.

168
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,462
I'm just gonna order a
couple of extra tests, okay?

169
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,072
What's going on?
It's his foot now.

170
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,201
It's nothing.

171
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,437
It's not nothing.

172
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,243
I just started getting a little
tingling feeling in my foot.

173
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,116
Is that bad?

174
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,276
Ashley, it's gonna be okay.

175
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,321
It might mean his foot fell
asleep. It might mean nothing.

176
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,083
Can you give us a few minutes?

177
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,454
Why can't you tell me?

178
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,152
Because you're
making him nervous.

179
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,991
Just give us a few
minutes, okay, hon?

180
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,542
Does this mean that it's not
the disease you thought it was?

181
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,728
It means the medicine I
gave you is not working.

182
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,794
I just might have
to hit it harder.

183
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,636
I'm going to add
ribavirin to your treatment.

184
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,868
Jim.

185
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,107
Are you sure that
this isn't a recurrence?

186
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,738
So the brave face
is just for Ashley.

187
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,510
She's young and she's terrified.

188
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,622
She's not really equipped.

189
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,117
Don't worry.

190
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:57,449
Once you've had cancer,
recurrence is your biggest fear. I get it.

191
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,435
I've looked at this thing
every which way there is.

192
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,360
That's not what's
happening here.

193
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,591
Can you call my daughter
and ask her to come down?

194
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,859
You can't do it?

195
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,458
She hasn't exactly
been talking to me

196
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,197
since I got together
with Ashley.

197
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,671
I'd really like her to be here.

198
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,441
Of course.

199
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,411
Exactly how serious
does it have to be

200
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,381
to justify you coming
to see your father?

201
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,613
No, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,452
I'd rather you regretted coming
than regretted not coming.

203
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,915
Thanks, Emily.

204
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,193
How's Tucker?

205
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,973
Well, he's made a
mess of his personal life,

206
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,898
but physically I think
he's going to be fine.

207
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,696
Transverse Myelitis.

208
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,259
What does House think?

209
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,602
What is this? Is House
my overseer now?

210
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,733
No, it's just not
always a good idea

211
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,141
for doctors to treat
their friends, that's all.

212
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,271
Well, House has got
100 bucks on cancer.

213
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,338
So unless you want
in on the action...

214
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,179
Um, is Bonnie still a realtor?

215
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,086
As far as I know.

216
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:04,284
Do you mind if I call her?
I'm looking for a new place.

217
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,460
I'm moving in with Lucas.

218
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,359
It wasn't the tennis.

219
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,822
You're moving in with Lucas?

220
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,225
Yes.

221
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,630
You're Bonnie's friend,
you know how to reach her,

222
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,764
and yet, instead of calling her,

223
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,831
you come and seek my permission.

224
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,208
You want my blessing, and,
implicitly, House's blessing.

225
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,008
I don't need House's blessing.

226
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,607
Good.

227
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,090
So when will he be able
to move his arm again?

228
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,785
Should be soon.

229
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,020
You started smoking again?

230
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,221
No.

231
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,889
What does that mean? Is
it bad that he's coughing?

232
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,900
Hi, Dad. Hey.

233
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,527
Melissa, hey. I didn't
know you were coming.

234
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,266
I was at Mom's house
when Dr. Wilson called.

235
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,619
I can go if it's gonna be weird.

236
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,669
No, no. Stay, it's fine.

237
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:58,871
Hi.

238
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,436
How are you? Is he okay?

239
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,848
Yeah, he's okay. I'm not a
big fan of his coughing, though.

240
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,579
You must be Ashley. Hi.

241
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,752
Hey, are you okay?

242
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,922
Do you think this cold sore
thing could've caused this?

243
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,839
No. Whatever is causing this is
affecting more than his nerves.

244
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,128
I need a crash cart in here.

245
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,540
Don't you guys have a dying
Mexican crooner to attend to?

246
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,080
He isn't dying any more.

247
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,911
Found out he was
on a popcorn diet,

248
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,508
eating 10 bags of
microwave popcorn a day.

249
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,053
Huffing the fumes
scarred his lungs.

250
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,922
Wow. That's very
strange. Where's House?

251
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,984
Performing his ritual
"hiding from Cuddy

252
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,654
"to avoid getting a
new case" dance.

253
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,358
It's sort of a
jazz-fusion type of thing.

254
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,032
He's probably eating
lunch in the morgue.

255
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,711
I can page him to
your office if you want.

256
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:59,536
Actually, maybe it would be
better if I talk to you guys alone.

257
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,040
House and I have a bet
about one of my patients.

258
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,078
You guys mind making
him 100 bucks poorer?

259
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,277
Forty-three-year-old male
in remission from leukemia,

260
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,818
presents with left-arm
paralysis and trouble breathing.

261
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,580
I assume House's
money is on cancer.

262
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,121
Thanks, that's very helpful.

263
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,554
Subdural hematoma
would explain...

264
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,885
CT ruled it out.

265
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,051
I thought it was TM, so I
started him on anti-virals.

266
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,118
But he got worse.
Bacterial infection?

267
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,606
Bacteria would move much faster
than this, he'd be dead already.

268
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,689
It could be fungal.

269
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,676
A fungal infection would
explain his breathing problem,

270
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,602
but not his "unable to
move his arm" problem.

271
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,472
Actually, if aspergillus fungus
balls took root in his lungs

272
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,171
and spread to his spine,
it would explain both.

273
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,745
Thanks.

274
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,320
The treatment involves
riddling the infected area

275
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,050
with BB-sized pellets
of anti-fungal meds.

276
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:54,356
I assume you don't just load up the
12 gauge and pepper me with birdshot.

277
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,295
No, we have a slightly more
humane delivery system.

278
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,800
But we do have to open
you up. It is surgery.

279
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:04,497
And like any operation,
there are risks.

280
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,630
What do you think, honey?

281
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,736
I don't know. I mean, is
surgery really such a good idea?

282
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,803
He just seems so sick. I just...

283
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,714
You should do whatever
you think is best.

284
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,984
Is this the only way
to go after this thing?

285
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,452
Because of the
rapid progression,

286
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,683
I don't think we have
time to test or try IVs.

287
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,486
And he's strong enough
to endure anesthesia?

288
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,719
Definitely.

289
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,193
I want you there
during the surgery.

290
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,320
Of course.

291
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,359
You gotta do it.

292
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,501
Good.

293
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,562
Dr. Chase will be in here soon
to get you set up for the OR.

294
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,638
Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's
room for a surgery consult,

295
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,709
and can you get me...

296
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,541
Mr. Koplovitz
wants to talk to you.

297
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,671
Is everything all right?

298
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,027
He wanted to talk to his doctor,

299
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,606
not his doctor's assistant.

300
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,379
Oh. And House
is looking for you.

301
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,476
What'd you tell him?

302
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,596
That you were in the clinic.

303
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,714
I figure that gives
you about 10 minutes.

304
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,315
Here, Mr. Koplovitz's chart, go.

305
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,189
Hello, Saul. I heard
you were looking for me.

306
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,497
I'm very tired,
but I can't sleep.

307
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,370
Today's your lucky day. I
happen to be a sleep specialist.

308
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,573
Thanks, Doc.

309
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,155
Hey, can't a guy
get a little privacy?

310
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,591
Nice hiding spot.

311
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,854
Actually, it's perfect.

312
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,022
It allows me to hide
from Cuddy and find you.

313
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,360
What did she want?

314
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,197
She was checking up
on Tucker, thanks to you.

315
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,896
That's it?

316
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,405
Like what? Something about you?

317
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,873
Something you could
interpret as being about you?

318
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,068
An anagram maybe?

319
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,440
It'd be great if you could play

320
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,988
hide and seek somewhere
else, my patient's...

321
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,278
No problem. Just give me the 100
bucks you owe me and I'm gone.

322
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,715
Tucker doesn't have cancer.

323
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,514
He doesn't have a ball of
fungus in his lungs either.

324
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,830
Next time you want
to use my team,

325
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,379
I suggest you at
least leave a tip.

326
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,254
I'm late for surgery.

327
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,851
Ah. Your assistant said you'd
be in here. I talked to Bonnie.

328
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,557
Let's take this outside.
Mr. Koplovitz just got to sleep.

329
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,275
Oh, sorry. She found
us this fantastic loft.

330
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,323
Outside.

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,878
It's not a loft, it's
just more urban.

332
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,393
Not that I'm urban,
but I used to be.

333
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,215
It's got two bedrooms, got wonderful
views. It's a really great place.

334
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,174
Procedure should
take about an hour.

335
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,277
I'll be observing
the entire time.

336
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,709
Thanks.

337
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,906
Maybe it'd be better if
you would stay with Ashley.

338
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,505
She's more scared than I am.

339
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,808
Well, she's...

340
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,120
At her age,

341
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,152
she's not supposed to be dealing
with issues of life and death.

342
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,457
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

343
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,061
Why did you leave Melissa?

344
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,863
We got married young. We...

345
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,797
I'm not sure.

346
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,383
There's nothing to talk about.

347
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,455
Why are you doing surgery when
I need you finding me a new case?

348
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,158
<i>You don't want a new case.</i>

349
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,099
Oh, right. Guess
I'm here for Wilson.

350
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,632
Obviously, you didn't tell me

351
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,401
that Cuddy was
moving in with Lucas

352
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,738
because you were protecting me,

353
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,539
which is odd, since I told you

354
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,978
that I'm fine with
their relationship.

355
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,315
So, obviously, you question
one of those assumptions

356
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,352
or you have an issue with logic.

357
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,580
Yes, you're fine
with them dating.

358
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,557
But moving in together is a
whole other level of commitment.

359
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,790
This is the 21st
century, Wilson.

360
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,229
I realize that the logical
course in any adult relationship

361
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,927
could one day
lead to fornication.

362
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,529
Although, the fact that
she wants to buy a loft

363
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,370
could actually mean
that their relationship

364
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,068
is not as serious as I thought.

365
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,668
Oh, for God's sake, House,
don't do this to yourself.

366
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,873
It's a loft, it has
no deeper meaning

367
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,041
than open-spaced
living arrangement.

368
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,709
You bought into her diatribe

369
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,879
about rediscovering
her lost city-girl roots?

370
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,651
And two bedrooms, it just
reeks of commitment issues.

371
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,919
Yeah, or she has a baby. Well...

372
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,053
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

373
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,223
This is her version of
a two-seat convertible.

374
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,698
Yep, clearly
you're fine with it.

375
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,260
<i>Wilson, he's got global lung
damage. Means it's not fungal.</i>

376
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,965
<i>It's PCP pneumonia.</i>

377
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,936
Hmm.

378
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,709
Obviously, something is
knocking out his immune system.

379
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,914
Three options:
HIV, acquired SCID,

380
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,116
or, my personal
favorite, cancer.

381
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,193
I'm sure you'll
test for all three.

382
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,433
Sixty-two-year-old
African-American man

383
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,495
with lymphoma now in remission.

384
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,507
I did a CT and
found a small lesion

385
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,440
on the upper lobe
of his left lung.

386
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,509
But if he's in remission,

387
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,136
why did you bother scanning him?

388
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,578
During a routine follow-up,

389
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,513
I realized the patient
was depressed.

390
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,074
Wow. That's quite a call.

391
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,016
Thanks. The
treatment indicated...

392
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,956
Oh, I'm sorry,

393
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,103
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

394
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:31,757
It's a conference
room with glass walls.

395
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,231
You thought I'd be alone?

396
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,359
Your patient has cancer.

397
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,996
Not that guy, who
probably also has cancer.

398
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,699
And who's probably
also your buddy.

399
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,935
Thought you'd want to know.

400
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,137
And you owe me 100 bucks.

401
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,143
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. ALL.

402
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,225
So it is a recurrence?

403
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,955
No, it's different. It's
a second leukemia,

404
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,724
probably caused
by the chemotherapy

405
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,060
we gave him five years ago.

406
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,930
That's why you didn't see it?

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,333
Maybe they can
rename it Ironic leukemia.

408
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,597
This is not the end.

409
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,105
Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

410
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,232
That's good news.

411
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,105
How can cancer in his
head be good news?

412
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,613
The blood-brain barrier
separates the blood in your head

413
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,705
from the blood in your body,

414
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,184
keeps the cancer bottled
up. We can go for a cure.

415
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,230
So give me the numbers.
What are we looking at?

416
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,621
Ninety percent chance of cure.

417
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,590
Really? What if
we're in the 10%?

418
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,152
Steady decline, but six
months of a good quality life.

419
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,596
Does he have to go through
another bone marrow transplant?

420
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,158
No. Chemotherapy. We can
go at this with drugs alone.

421
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,264
When do we get started?

422
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,135
We begin by surgically
planting a shunt,

423
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,334
so we can get the drugs
directly into your brain.

424
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,774
I already booked the OR.

425
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,335
You're the only one who can
make cancer sound like good news.

426
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,472
We get it out of your head
and you walk out of here.

427
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,949
Paralysis gone and cancer free.

428
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,888
We also need you to
sign a healthcare proxy.

429
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,515
If something goes
wrong in surgery,

430
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,791
someone needs to be appointed
to make decisions for you.

431
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,271
What are the chances
of that happening?

432
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,422
Very remote.

433
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,863
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

434
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,628
What? No.

435
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,329
Coming through.
House got a new case.

436
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:22,201
Revised OR schedule. Sorry,
Wilson, had to bump you.

437
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,152
It's not like your guy is
bleeding out of his eyes.

438
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,854
House, your guy's not
bleeding out of his eyes, either.

439
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,540
The nurse who books
the OR thinks he is.

440
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,024
Your case is no more
urgent than mine.

441
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,244
Yeah, but you're
way more patient.

442
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,978
It's okay.

443
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,512
You can talk about the
paperwork in the prep area.

444
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,552
You trust her more than me?

445
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,062
About this, yes.

446
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,508
You've been through
the good stuff,

447
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,161
but Melissa's been to
hell and back with me.

448
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,694
She gives me the best
shot of getting through this.

449
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,467
You still love her.

450
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,100
Don't be silly. I love you.

451
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,472
Please, don't make
this into more than it is.

452
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,853
Okay. Anything? No.

453
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,518
Can you feel this?

454
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,718
No.

455
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,893
How about here?

456
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,527
No.

457
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,730
Where is everybody?

458
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,199
Melissa and Emily went
downstairs to get some breakfast.

459
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,328
Ashley? She had work to do.

460
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,634
I thought she was off today.

461
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,183
Well, she didn't
really have work to do.

462
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,642
She's just pissed, so she
pretended to have work to do.

463
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,200
I let her pretend.

464
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,273
Okay.

465
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,443
Move your fingers.

466
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,251
The chemo's not working.

467
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,817
Does that mean it's not cancer?

468
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,329
No. It means the chemo from
your first round of treatment

469
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,832
has made the leukemia resistant.

470
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,596
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

471
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,538
Maybe not.

472
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,471
We just removed a
screw from a guy's lung,

473
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,343
and the weird thing
is, he didn't get better.

474
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,677
Any idea what that means?

475
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,341
It means you're
not listening to me.

476
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,646
No, it means I'm ignoring you

477
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,346
to make a point.
There is a difference.

478
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,597
The problem with that technique

479
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,351
is I have no idea what
point you're making.

480
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,450
That your idea is implicitly
not worth responding to.

481
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,894
Doubling your patient's
chemo dose is stupid.

482
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,261
Damn, now it's explicit.

483
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,891
It could swamp out the
resistance of the cancer cells.

484
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,577
The fact that it
theoretically should work

485
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,967
doesn't make it any less stupid.

486
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,505
Of course it does. It's
exactly what you would do.

487
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,438
I'm me. You're you.

488
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,379
And a table is a table.

489
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:44,406
And chemo is poison, and
double chemo is double poison.

490
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:48,554
And I can handle it when
things go wrong. You can't.

491
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,118
And things could
go very, very wrong.

492
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,822
I can handle it.

493
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,534
Sounds pretty dangerous.

494
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,132
It is.

495
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,500
What do you think, Mel?

496
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,513
I think you should call Ashley.

497
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,678
You're my family.

498
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,311
I'm sorry I forgot that.

499
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,922
I think that you should try

500
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,986
whatever could keep
you with us longer.

501
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,026
Yeah.

502
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Look.

503
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,855
I can move them.

504
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,795
Hey. Thank you.

505
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,293
What is it, Jim?

506
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,438
I'm gonna need
to run some tests.

507
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,042
Intraepidermal superficial
bullae. Could be pemphigus.

508
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,578
Or it could be from the fire.

509
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:23,207
Either way, he's dead.
We can't stop the oozing.

510
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,149
Don't care.

511
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,454
I'm here because it's 1:15

512
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,049
and Wilson started testing
at 12:45, which means...

513
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:37,586
The cancer is gone, but over
half his hepatocytes are dead.

514
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,926
In only 24 hours?

515
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,669
He needs a new liver.

516
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,406
Look on the bright side.

517
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,104
You can publish the
results of this case study.

518
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,874
No one will ever
double the dose again.

519
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,615
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer,

520
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,385
but it also trashed your liver.

521
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,859
If I don't find
you a new liver...

522
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,221
You've only got
about 24 hours left.

523
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,934
So what do we do now?

524
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,563
Your father's been moved
to the top of the transplant list.

525
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,108
But all we really
can do is wait.

526
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,176
That's it? We wait?

527
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,488
Tell me something that I can do.

528
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,741
I'm sorry, Mel.

529
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,009
You and Emily don't
match Tuck's blood type,

530
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,074
and neither does Ashley.

531
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,885
So a live liver donation is out.

532
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:39,221
The best thing to do is
just what you've been doing,

533
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,116
be together.

534
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,066
Hope he already told
you that you're gonna die,

535
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,246
'cause it's gonna make what I'm
about to say a lot more relevant.

536
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,900
House, I know it's raining
out there in the hallway, but...

537
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:59,035
I was just in the ER, testing my
patient for autonomic dysfunction.

538
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,221
It's the only department
with a shower

539
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,975
big enough for the whole team,

540
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,643
plus the cardiac monitors, plus
me, plus... Anyway, relevant part.

541
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,346
We're just wheeling the
guy out, a trauma came in.

542
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,615
Motorcycle versus semi.

543
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,812
How bad?

544
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,189
Bad for the motorcycle, good for
your liver. Blood type's a match.

545
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,283
Why wasn't I paged?

546
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,988
Because there is a problem.

547
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,792
No organ donor card.

548
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,492
Dead guy's sister
is next of kin,

549
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,364
she's refusing to
allow the donation.

550
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,458
Where is she?

551
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,559
Twenty minutes away.

552
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,770
How do you get the call
that your brother's dead,

553
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,241
and then run out the door?

554
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,676
"That reminds me,

555
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,804
"I had dry cleaning to pick up."

556
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,213
Did Cuddy buy the place?

557
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:39,847
Not yet.

558
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:41,845
You okay?

559
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,411
Just making conversation.

560
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,619
Yours was getting boring.

561
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:46,886
What are you planning?

562
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm not planning anything.

563
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,551
And I don't believe you.

564
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,272
How are you gonna
punish her for dating Lucas?

565
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,323
Okay, now this
conversation is getting boring.

566
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,294
Are you really okay? No.

567
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,237
I am not okay. Not even close.

568
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:07,371
Wow. Okay. See,
that's very adult of you.

569
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,280
No, it isn't.

570
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,280
It's just me accepting the fact

571
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,182
that there's nothing I
can do and moving on.

572
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,279
Which is, I think, the
definition of adulthood.

573
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,824
Well, if it is, being a
kid is a lot more fun.

574
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,551
It's show time.

575
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,794
I didn't speak to him for years.

576
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,840
But when my parents
died, at their funeral,

577
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,738
we made peace.

578
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,674
Our parents must
have blessed it.

579
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:46,014
And I'm sure they would
want him to do good

580
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,952
with his last act in this world.

581
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,252
They wanted us to be friends.

582
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:55,522
Our relationship wasn't
strong, but it was growing.

583
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,291
If I allow you to
defile his body,

584
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,355
it will destroy that bond.

585
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,424
The <i>itai</i> will be harmed.

586
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,061
It will save my patient's life.

587
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:13,407
What if I told you
that he wasn't dead?

588
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,116
Are you saying my
brother's still alive?

589
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,878
I'm saying you're
being an idiot,

590
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,695
but I don't have time to
talk you out of your religion,

591
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,415
so I'm stuck with
giving you a technicality

592
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,924
that will let you justify
doing the right thing.

593
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,426
What if his last living act

594
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,291
was to donate a
part of his liver?

595
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,798
Not the whole thing,
just one small piece.

596
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,491
Then I'm not
defiling a dead body.

597
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,663
House. The last generous
act of a living person.

598
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,674
House. It's too late.

599
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,507
The liver started to degrade.

600
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,046
It's no longer
viable for transplant.

601
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,751
Well played. Religion
just killed another person.

602
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:05,292
It's not fair, Jim.

603
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,392
You just helped me get
my family back together.

604
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,167
I'm not ready.

605
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,856
I would've had six
more months with them

606
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,406
if you hadn't given
me that extra chemo.

607
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,782
Now I have less than one day.

608
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,811
I'm sorry. We knew the risks.

609
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,153
I don't want to lose them again.

610
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,193
I can't lose them again.

611
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,796
There's nothing more we can do.

612
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:46,163
Five years ago, when I needed a
transfusion, you used your own blood.

613
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,269
We have the same type,

614
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,573
which means you can
give me a part of your liver.

615
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,504
I'm your doctor.

616
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,209
You're my friend.

617
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,252
Should I die because
you're also my doctor?

618
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,318
Of course not.

619
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,649
Fine then, you're fired.

620
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,781
Now you're just my friend.

621
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,384
Now you can do what's right.

622
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,719
Tucker, it's...

623
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,429
I can't.

624
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,803
Late night with
the Pigeon sisters?

625
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,277
Every now and again,

626
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,475
I'd like to come home
without getting interrogated.

627
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:37,580
Someone's cranky. And
late. Where were you?

628
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,289
Was getting a drink.

629
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,318
Why are all my frozen
dinners thawing on the counter?

630
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,695
I needed room for my
margarita jello shots.

631
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,757
I used test tubes as bottles

632
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,133
so they'll be
shaped like my cane.

633
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,472
Why did you go
out drinking alone

634
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,373
when you got such
great company here?

635
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,517
Tucker wants me to donate
a lobe of my liver to him.

636
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:11,253
You were out drinking because
you're actually considering this?

637
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,321
Yeah, I was out marinating
my liver in alcohol

638
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,191
to get it ready for
the transplant. Yeah.

639
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,855
Your mouth says no,

640
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,922
but your pathetic
attempt at a deflection

641
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,366
has guilt written all over it.

642
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,961
It's my fault. It is my fault.

643
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,665
I gave him too much chemo.

644
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,298
You cured his cancer.

645
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,741
And killed him in the process.

646
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,834
Quibbles.

647
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,909
He's had a predictable
complication.

648
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:39,713
Surprise. Bad things happen
to people who are sick.

649
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,150
Doesn't make you responsible.

650
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:46,055
Oh. Not legally,
ethically. Ethically.

651
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,558
A table is a table.

652
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,988
Don't be a doormat, Wilson.

653
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:54,089
Boy, you are... You
willfully ruined my food

654
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,497
and have taken
over my living room

655
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,059
because you already
think I am a doormat.

656
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,764
You know what?

657
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,833
You're wrong.

658
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,879
Clean up your stuff and get out.

659
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,579
You're wrong.

660
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,795
How's Tucker?

661
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:30,768
Still no dancing. But the
scans came in on Del Clinton.

662
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,167
It's good news.

663
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,466
Thanks.

664
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,098
Let me know as soon as
Tucker takes a turn for the worse.

665
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,972
I want to be there.

666
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:45,045
See that small spot
at the top of the lung?

667
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,717
That was then. This is
now. The spot's gone.

668
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,055
That tiny little spot, huh?

669
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,287
Yeah, it's not too
impressive, is it?

670
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,565
That little dot could
have killed me?

671
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,290
Yeah.

672
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,502
Fortunately, we caught it early.

673
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,968
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,304
That's amazing.
You got all this off me

675
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,742
not talking about my grandkids.

676
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,019
Thanks, Bonnie.

677
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:24,215
We're just gonna have
to sit tight for a while.

678
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,485
Okay.

679
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:34,032
I put an offer on the loft.
Seller turned me down.

680
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,195
I offered exactly what a similar
unit sold for three months ago.

681
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,403
I want to donate a lobe
of my liver to Tucker.

682
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:45,967
That's insane.

683
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,173
I'm donating a
small portion of...

684
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,341
You have hundreds of patients.

685
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,476
And until I run out
of excess organs,

686
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,713
why shouldn't I do
everything I can to help them?

687
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,780
Because you're a
doctor, not a donor.

688
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,396
Why did you make me
the head of oncology?

689
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,992
Not because you
have the most organs.

690
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,205
You're thoughtful, caring.

691
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,002
Yeah. Caring.

692
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,637
By your own criteria, a
strength and not a weakness.

693
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,441
This is coming out of guilt.

694
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,448
This is coming
out of friendship.

695
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,381
I have a friend
who's about to die.

696
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,614
And I have the
opportunity to save his life.

697
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,089
Okay.

698
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,531
Call me a doormat,

699
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,942
get it all out of your
system, but I'm doing it.

700
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,143
Why?

701
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,777
He's my friend.

702
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,152
I'm your friend.

703
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:08,192
All the pain pills I've taken?

704
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,591
What if I need your liver?

705
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,129
Right. How selfish of me

706
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:14,428
not to have considered
your possible future needs.

707
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,866
They're all dying.
They're all your friends.

708
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,836
I'm not here for an
argument, House.

709
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,099
No, right, that's room 12A.

710
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,266
So why are you here?

711
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,176
You wanna make sure that
I've called a moving van?

712
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,304
No.

713
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,477
The operation is in two hours,

714
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,610
and I'd like you to
be there with me.

715
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,418
No.

716
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,458
Why?

717
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,297
Because if you die, I'm alone.

718
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,381
Thanks, Jim.

719
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,951
How are you feeling?

720
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,052
Can't complain,

721
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,224
considering if it weren't
for you, I'd be dead. Twice.

722
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,165
You?

723
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,725
I feel good.

724
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,631
Sending out your laundry?

725
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,832
Going to rehab.
Someplace up in Katonah.

726
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,971
Up by your new house,
not near your old house.

727
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,544
Easier on Ashley.

728
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,113
I see.

729
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,582
I was thrilled to get
the family back together,

730
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,024
and Melissa's great in a crisis,

731
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,419
but the person you
want when you're dying

732
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,058
isn't the same as the person
you want when you're living.

733
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:38,634
Hi, Jim.

734
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,870
Actually, it's James.

735
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:08,188
You ready to admit that
he's a self-important jerk?

736
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,495
I still feel good
about what I did.

737
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,138
You don't feel angry?

738
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,103
Oh, I'm a little disappointed.

739
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,570
Disappointment
is anger for wimps.

740
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,812
You don't have to be so
gentle about everything.

741
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,581
It's okay to get
angry once in a while.

742
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,417
You can't change a table.

743
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,823
Actually, you can.

744
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,662
You just need a coat of
paint and the guts to use it.

745
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,846
Bonnie.

746
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,843
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.

747
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,403
You're gonna outbid her?

748
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,885
We do need a
bigger refrigerator.

749
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:42,227
She hurt my friend.
She should be punished.

750
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,160
You got mad.

751
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,256
I'm proud of you.

752
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,894
Cuddy won't share
that sentiment.

753
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,903
How are you going
to explain it to her?

754
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,935
I'm changing our
address to a PO box.

755
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,737
She'll find out eventually.

756
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:02,111
A problem delayed
is a problem denied.

757
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,142
Bonnie? I'll take it.

758
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,987
Baby steps.
