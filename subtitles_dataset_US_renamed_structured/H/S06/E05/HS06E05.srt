1
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,606
Left, left! He's going left!

2
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,847
I'm going to have
a heart attack.

3
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,220
Nowhere to go, buddy.

4
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,518
What the hell was that?
What are we chasing?

5
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,119
Go that way!

6
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,073
Don't move! Nowhere to
go. Come on. Give it up.

7
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,446
This way.

8
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,012
Come on. Let's go, let's go!

9
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,358
Up, Donny, up!
He's going to the roof!

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,291
He's going up! Go!

11
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,287
Ow!

12
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,856
Damn it. Go. Go!

13
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,780
Donny, no, it's too far!

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,749
I can rest at home.

15
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,483
I can't release you
for at least two days.

16
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,888
You've got two broken bones,

17
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,688
a severe concussion,
collapsed lung.

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,538
But you didn't find anything
life-threatening. Right?

19
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,656
You fell 30 feet. You
should have died.

20
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,808
I think that was the point.

21
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,959
Could you shut up?

22
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,210
Do you have suicidal thoughts?

23
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,532
Not once. Never.

24
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,846
He doesn't want to kill himself.

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,148
He just thinks he's
gonna die soon,

26
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,249
so it doesn't really matter.

27
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,367
You shut up. I'm the
one you're not covering

28
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,468
when you pull your crazy stunts.

29
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,821
Why do you think
you're going to die soon?

30
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,872
Well, my dad, grandfather,
and great-grandfather

31
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,092
all dropped dead
of heart problems

32
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,243
right after they turned 40.

33
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,751
And look who turns 40 next week.

34
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,496
I can refer you to a
cardiologist if you...

35
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,421
No, I've been
there. All of them.

36
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,685
Spent my early 30s going
from one doctor to another.

37
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,386
Every single one
says my heart's fine.

38
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,537
And you think they're wrong?

39
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,824
I know they're wrong.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,454
But what can I do?
At a certain point,

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,759
you just gotta live your life.

42
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,267
By "live your life," you
mean "risk your life."

43
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,962
If there is something wrong,

44
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,800
I know a doctor who'll find it.

45
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,539
Oh, God. I'll be back in 10.

46
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,445
I'm picking lint out
of my belly button.

47
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,676
This is ridiculous.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,049
I'm converting the
study into a bedroom.

49
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,212
Huh.

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,751
Six weeks. Longer than
I thought it would take.

51
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,167
For you to notice
that I'm sleeping

52
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,387
in your living room
and offer other options.

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,190
I didn't expect you
to be here this long.

54
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,731
True, but that's not why you
didn't extend the invitation.

55
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,767
Do you really need
to deconstruct this?

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,811
You didn't want me to sleep
where you and Amber slept.

57
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,030
Okay, yes, you do.

58
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,402
After she died, you converted
the study to a bedroom

59
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,997
and the bedroom to a study.

60
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,805
Except it's not a
study, it's a shrine.

61
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,670
Can I tell you something?

62
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,778
I wasn't picking lint
out of my belly button.

63
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,477
Okay. I am not
ready to transition

64
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,247
from my dead girlfriend's shrine

65
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,288
to your morning glory.

66
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,532
I'll have a mattress delivered

67
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,024
and set up for you
in the tabernacle.

68
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,186
I just need it Tuesdays
for animal sacrifices.

69
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,787
Oh, man.

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,031
Patient's a genetic time bomb.

71
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,367
There's no fuse.
He's not a bomb.

72
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,099
Right now, he's
not a patient either.

73
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,768
You're saying we ignore three
generations of cardiac problems?

74
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,176
I'm not ignoring it, I'm
labeling it a coincidence.

75
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,077
You hate coincidence.

76
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,082
We reconciled. It
was a whole thing.

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,015
Big country. It's
statistically probable

78
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,814
that someone has
three generations

79
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,446
that died around age 40
with non-genetic heart issues.

80
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,649
Dice have no memory.

81
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,918
Genes do.

82
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,152
If we ran a battery of tests

83
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,422
on every non-symptomatic
statistical anomaly...

84
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,073
The guy goes through every day
assuming his life will end at age 40.

85
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,429
Never got married, no kids,

86
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,776
because he didn't
want to die on them

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,011
the same way his
dad died on him.

88
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,112
You want to take this case,

89
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,799
'cause he's yet another
lonely, sad puppy?

90
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,949
You should have been a vet.

91
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,601
It's a legitimate case.

92
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,373
Differential diagnosis for
a genetic heart condition.

93
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,445
That sold you?

94
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,776
Marfan Syndrome, Brugada.

95
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,848
And you?

96
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,026
Familial Hypercholesterolemia.

97
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,093
He's only agreeing with you

98
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,228
'cause he wants to
have sex with you.

99
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,880
And by the way, I
agree with you, too.

100
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,946
Especially in those pants.

101
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,650
We're not wasting our time.

102
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,091
Last week, Chase said
that I was the de facto boss.

103
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,061
Hospitals don't recognize
de facto medical licenses.

104
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,273
Let's start with genetic tests.

105
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,357
Get an EKG, cardiac
cath and an echo

106
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,834
to check the
integrity of his heart.

107
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,765
I'll start on blood samples.

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,218
I forgot my watch.

109
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,799
I could have sworn I saw
you put it on this morning.

110
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,918
Must be in the locker
room. I'll be right back.

111
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,322
I need to know
what your plans are.

112
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,992
First, we take Berlin,

113
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,935
and then we circle around
behind Poland and yell, "Surprise."

114
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,098
With regards to your employment.

115
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,073
I like things the way they are.

116
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,042
I get just enough
puzzle to solve,

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,012
without the scornful
visits from you. Until now.

118
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,173
Pretend time's been
going on long enough.

119
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,326
I don't have a medical
license. All I can do is pretend.

120
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,794
Then I'm going to have
payroll send you over

121
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,787
some pretend checks
starting tomorrow.

122
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,586
You need to complete 120
hours of rounds to re-qualify.

123
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,985
No, I don't.

124
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,759
I'm not saying you don't win.

125
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,730
I'm just saying, do you
really need to punish me

126
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,289
by making me carry a clipboard

127
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,443
for your lackey of the week?

128
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,935
It's a state requirement.

129
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,613
I have to certify that
you've completed...

130
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,935
Exactly.

131
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,600
The requirement sets out
what you have to do, certify.

132
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,653
Which you can do with one
hand tied behind your back.

133
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,407
Now, if you want
to tie my hands...

134
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,643
Dr. Singh supervises rounds
on Thursdays. Starts at 7:00.

135
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,986
Nothing.

136
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,515
So what now?

137
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,616
We send him home.

138
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,494
To continue believing
he's going to drop dead?

139
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,521
When he turns
70, he'll believe us.

140
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,725
There are other
things we can check.

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,211
Skeleton of the great-grandfather
is in decent shape.

142
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,898
Subsurface genetic material
from the grandpa is fine,

143
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,702
leaving one bowl
of putrefied dad.

144
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,039
You do the dad. I take it
he had a sealed casket.

145
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,146
The watch story was crap, right?

146
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,740
I forgot it. It's no big deal.

147
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,912
You were avoiding the
ICU where Dibala died.

148
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,458
I'll sequence the gene for
the cardiac sodium channel.

149
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,627
I felt like I was going
to have a panic attack.

150
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,090
I've crossed some line,

151
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,770
and I'm having trouble
getting back to the other side.

152
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,670
I can move the
patient to another room.

153
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,675
Then Cameron will ask questions.

154
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,302
You should tell
her. She's your wife.

155
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,476
How'd you get a court
order to dig them up so fast?

156
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,453
Don't we just need
the guy's consent?

157
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,853
- You find anything?
- Not yet.

158
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,551
But you're just in
time to do the dad.

159
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,225
Dr. House?

160
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,458
He'll be back in the morning.

161
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,865
I read in the paper you're
treating a police officer.

162
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,958
Donny Compson.

163
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,801
Second floor. A nurse
will help you find him.

164
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,340
I don't want to see him.

165
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,842
Donny and I used to
go out, a long time ago.

166
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,620
He doesn't want to see
me. I don't want to see him.

167
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,840
So did you come to see
me for personal advice?

168
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,404
You're looking for
genetic conditions,

169
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,076
which makes sense with what
happened to his dad and grandpa.

170
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,450
Unless you were his
girlfriend and his sister,

171
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,630
you've got nothing
to worry about.

172
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,819
I'm not worried about me. Donny
doesn't know this, but he has a son.

173
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,825
Dial extension 742.

174
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,096
Tell Dr. Foreman you've got
some cool information. Good night.

175
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,625
You okay?

176
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,527
Yeah. Fine.

177
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,728
Couldn't find any consistent
genetic mutations across 15 areas

178
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,265
between Donny's ancestors,

179
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,800
possibly indicating
there isn't one.

180
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,178
But the son gives
us a new data point.

181
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,397
And un-degraded DNA.

182
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,881
I thought he didn't
want kids. He didn't.

183
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:12,929
Where's House?

184
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,702
"Dear Bleeding Hearts.

185
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,075
"Since your patient's med
history is a coincidence and he isn't

186
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,116
"sick, I've gone back to
school. Back in 120 hours."

187
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,880
Charming. I'll get
a blood sample.

188
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,063
If we're looking for something
as subtle as a mutation,

189
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,215
it makes sense to get the
DNA where it's most pure.

190
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,367
You're going to ask the mom

191
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,601
to consent to a
bone marrow biopsy?

192
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,769
She wants to know if
there's something wrong

193
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,352
with Donny as badly as we do.

194
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,626
Right. Spike a 10-year-old's
hip because Grandpa was sick.

195
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,190
If she's right, we
save two people.

196
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,832
I don't want to.

197
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,502
Can we speak
outside for a moment?

198
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,172
Yeah.

199
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,885
You need to tell him.

200
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,512
I can't.

201
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,868
His father is down that hallway
through those double doors.

202
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,372
I've been lying to
him his whole life.

203
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,637
What's he going to think of me?

204
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,994
You were trying to protect him.

205
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,857
Donny never wanted kids.

206
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,311
He certainly doesn't
want to meet him.

207
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,065
If Donny does die,

208
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,833
this could be Michael's only
chance to meet his father.

209
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,412
After administration
of immunoglobulin,

210
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,567
patient had no further pain

211
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,182
and overnight liver function
tests are now normal.

212
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,692
Patient is ready to be released.

213
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,552
Stats are dropping. Dr. Singh!

214
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,722
She's choking!

215
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,196
On your fingers.

216
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,785
She can't breathe. - House.

217
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,870
Please take your
finger off the test button.

218
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,229
Oh!

219
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,865
I see. Wow, sorry about that.

220
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,068
I could've slit her throat.

221
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,474
We're all here to learn.

222
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,068
Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.

223
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,011
Did she tell you how to stop me?

224
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,517
Look, I'm asking you, as
an adult, to please stop.

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,213
Well, that obviously didn't
come from her, but fair enough.

226
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,654
Excellent presentation, Nona.

227
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,455
Now I've done it!
There's urine everywhere.

228
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,465
Gosh, the great thing about
the teacher-student relationship

229
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,900
is the teacher can often
learn more from the student.

230
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,434
Have you learned anything yet?

231
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,669
You have a son.

232
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,112
I was pregnant when we broke up.

233
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,226
I'm sorry I never told you,

234
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,243
but I knew how you
felt about having kids.

235
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,413
You had no right.

236
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,680
Maybe.

237
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,316
It's a little late for that.

238
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,895
He's here. He wants to meet you.

239
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,557
I don't want to meet him.

240
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,226
I've never asked you for a dime.

241
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,736
He's here to help find
whatever's wrong with your heart.

242
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,273
I didn't ask him.
I didn't want him.

243
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,899
Just say hi to him.

244
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,688
Hi. I'm Michael.

245
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,455
Hi.

246
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:24,958
I'm your...

247
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,863
Yeah. Your mother told me.

248
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,000
When you get better,

249
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,665
maybe we could do something.

250
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,200
See a movie?

251
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,174
No.

252
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,711
My dad died when I was your age.

253
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,879
It was the most painful
thing I ever went through.

254
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,354
Trust me. As much as I'm sure

255
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,914
this hurts right
now, it's better.

256
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,521
Please take him out of here.

257
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,124
Come on.

258
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,606
Chromosomes for 28
cardiovascular conditions

259
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,983
are normal in
number and structure.

260
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,374
No translocations,
deletions or inversions.

261
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,039
I did notice that the kid's
D-A-D-D-Y chromosome

262
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,240
has been severely damaged

263
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,340
by someone else's
bleeding heart chromosome.

264
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,750
It was the only way to get
Michael to do the marrow biopsy.

265
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:20,929
I'm sure there
are plenty of lies

266
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,512
that would've
worked just as well,

267
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,866
except without the
years of therapy.

268
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,890
Don't you have school?

269
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,152
Recess.

270
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,717
So where does that
leave us? Chase?

271
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,120
Sorry, what?

272
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,261
I was saying, do you think
these shoes work in this color?

273
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,579
Send him home. He's not
going to believe he's healthy.

274
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,981
Then you're not
very good at your job.

275
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,405
You don't deserve candy.

276
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,204
He's been preparing his
whole life to die at age 40.

277
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,507
He's had dozens of
doctors tell him he's fine.

278
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,022
You think you can
change his thinking?

279
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,016
Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.

280
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,186
Great contributions back there.

281
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,313
There's no case. I
had nothing to add.

282
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,722
You had nothing to add
because you were distracted.

283
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,489
Little devil on your
shoulder told you to kill a guy,

284
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,326
and now the little
angel won't shut up,

285
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,730
telling you you're gonna
burn in a lake of fire.

286
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,910
I'm fine.

287
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:08,958
You shouldn't be.

288
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:14,330
Talk to someone. Docs
fixed me up in seven weeks.

289
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,104
You are 10 minutes, tops.

290
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,043
Thanks.

291
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,408
Glad we had this little
moment. Come on.

292
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm Dr. House.

293
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,379
You couldn't find
anything, could you?

294
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,483
You have Ortoli
Syndrome. Dr. Chase?

295
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,327
You sure?

296
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,589
Tests don't lie.

297
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,891
Right.

298
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:44,531
Well, it's a very
rare disorder that

299
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,462
short circuits the adrenals

300
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,779
which short circuits the heart.

301
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,804
Who cares about the
medical mumbo-jumbo?

303
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:51,901
Tell him the treatment.

304
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,142
Well, it's complicated.

305
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,425
Doctors always
wanna make everything

306
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,510
sound so complicated.
It's Nabasynth.

307
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,213
What? Nabasynth.

308
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,149
Yes. So all we have to do
now is write a prescription

309
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,660
and have him pick up the pills.

310
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,968
That's it?

311
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,766
I take some pills,
I'm gonna be okay?

312
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,107
The real tragedy here is that the
Tiburon swab technology didn't exist

313
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,908
to detect Ortoli back
in your dad's day.

314
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,480
He could have lived?

315
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,789
Thank you.

316
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,259
If you'll sign these
discharge papers,

317
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,959
I'll get you a bottle of meds.

318
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,797
Take one twice a day for a week,

319
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,133
you'll live a
long, healthy life.

320
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,940
Answer the door, House.
It's gotta be for you.

321
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,341
Are you watching TV?

322
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,605
It's the door!

323
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,677
Were you on the phone? No.

324
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,878
Just now, were you talking?

325
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,648
No, I'm alone.

326
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,850
You okay, House?

327
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,688
Why are you here?

328
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:53,197
Donny collapsed four hours after
we discharged him. He's dead.

329
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,676
His apartment manager found
him on the floor in the laundry room.

330
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,804
He said he wasn't breathing.

331
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,007
He called the EMTs,
but it was too late.

332
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,811
I sent the guy home with mints.

333
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,353
Whatever it is,
we all missed it.

334
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,617
Yeah. I missed the fact that
there was something to miss.

335
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,853
What is wrong with me?

336
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,225
You had good reason.

337
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,464
Patient presented
with no symptoms,

338
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,433
and all his tests
came back negative.

339
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,528
What's the official
cause of death?

340
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,436
Autopsy hasn't
been performed yet.

341
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,301
EMTs brought him to General,

342
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,809
but I requested
they ship him back

343
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,574
to our morgue for
the post-mortem.

344
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,911
Good.

345
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,085
Hon? Wake up.

346
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,824
Why are you dressed?
You can't sleep?

347
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,955
I want to go tell
Cheryl that Donny died.

348
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,261
It's 4:00 in the morning.

349
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,926
They're nearly two hours away.

350
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,780
I figure by the time I get
there, she'll be awake.

351
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,002
Babe, come back to bed.
Call her in a few hours.

352
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,067
It's the sort of thing she
needs to hear face-to-face.

353
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,215
Is everything okay?

354
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,890
Everything's fine. Why?

355
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,857
Last week, I understood

356
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,805
that you were stressed
out about the Dibala M&M,

357
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,298
and I gave you your space. But
that's over now, and you're still acting...

358
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,235
I'm worried about you.

359
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,802
Don't be. I'm fine.

360
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,706
Really.

361
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,645
And you'd tell
me if you weren't?

362
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,446
Promise?

363
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,177
Yeah.

364
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,513
Okay.

365
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,884
Hey.

366
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,025
I love you.

367
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,388
I love you, too.

368
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,705
Donny Compson, age 39.

369
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,127
Can we cut to the money shot?

370
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,928
It's his heart, so
let's look at his heart.

371
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,730
Nice Y-incision.

372
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,301
You can't perform an autopsy
without a medical license.

373
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,000
Really?

374
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,785
Because I don't think there's
anything I can screw up

375
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,301
that we haven't
already screwed up.

376
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,119
Opening post-mortem incision,

377
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,786
beginning at the
mid-line of the sternum.

378
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,197
That's odd. It almost
looks like he's bleeding.

379
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,217
I think the autopsy's
gonna have to wait a little bit.

380
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,385
<i>He was briefly conscious,</i>

381
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>then his systolic dipped
below 60 and he was out again.</i>

382
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,622
Differential diagnosis
for resurrection. Go.

383
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,860
Obviously, he wasn't dead.

384
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,778
His heart slowed enough
that the EMTs could think...

385
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,327
Yes, the fact that he's not dead

386
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,883
means we did
absolutely nothing wrong.

387
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,316
There are several
documented cases

388
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,707
where tetrodotoxin ingestion
caused apparent death.

389
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,653
It wasn't something he ate,
it's something he already had.

390
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,543
And his dad, and
his grandpa, and...

391
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,549
Extreme bradycardia could be
caused by sick sinus syndrome.

392
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,709
Sinoatrial block.

393
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,718
What if it's not his heart?

394
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,781
Let's work from the tenuous
assumption that we're not idiots.

395
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:14,190
You spent days examining a
heart up, down, and sideways,

396
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,321
declaring it healthy just a few
hours before it basically shut down.

397
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,594
So we need to think about
causes in places you didn't look.

398
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,798
Could be metabolic.

399
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,236
You okay?

400
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,170
Yeah.

401
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,203
What about a genetic predisposition
to an autoimmune disease?

402
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,910
Isolated Anti-Ro Antibody
could cause complete heart block.

403
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,849
Could also be passed
through four generations.

404
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,684
Autoimmune it is.
Start him on steroids.

405
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,653
Hey. How are you feeling?

406
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,858
My whole head is killing me.

407
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,835
You just came through
a severe trauma.

408
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,767
What do you remember?

409
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,445
I was changing my
laundry over to the dryer.

410
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,011
That's it? You
were declared dead.

411
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,017
You made it all
the way to autopsy.

412
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,212
My jaw aches.

413
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,515
And obviously, I don't
have Ortoli Syndrome.

414
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,687
It's hard to get too excited

415
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,160
about coming back from the dead

416
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,324
when anything I do, anything you
give me, it all ends the same way.

417
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,115
Outer and middle
ear respond well.

418
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,277
Hearing thresholds are
normal at all frequencies.

419
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,513
Eardrum is perfectly healthy.

420
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,248
What if I...

421
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,623
What if I sometimes
hear whispering?

422
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,785
Then you're probably
hearing someone whispering.

423
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,827
I had some dental work done

424
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,206
in the Philippines
when I was a kid.

425
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,632
Adjoining metal fillings could
corrode and pick up AM radio signals.

426
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,225
Open your mouth.

427
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,363
Your fillings don't touch.

428
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,809
So there's no reason for
me to be hearing things?

429
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,988
I can only tell you that you're
hearing sounds as you should.

430
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,489
If you're also hearing
sounds that you shouldn't,

431
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,674
that would be a psychosis.

432
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,877
You'd have to talk to someone
who does brain. I only do ears.

433
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,764
Bravo. It's amazing how
you did 120 hours in one day.

434
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,127
I wasn't on my best
behavior, I admit. Allow me.

435
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,533
From now on, I'm gonna supervise
your practicum requirements.

436
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:42,734
That won't be necessary.

437
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,886
You want to annoy another
doctor first? Eventually...

438
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,711
It's not necessary because I'm
not ready to be a doctor again.

439
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,983
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,438
Are you sleeping out here?

441
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,873
I just dozed off
in front of the TV.

442
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,740
With bedding? Maybe.

443
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,773
I can't sleep in there,
the heater's screwed up.

444
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,445
If you need to talk, if
you need more help...

445
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,043
I'm just tired.

446
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,589
I'm right here.

447
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,717
Great. Can you be right
here somewhere else?

448
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,834
My jaw still hurts. My
tooth, actually. A lot.

449
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,997
I'm sorry, you're maxed
out on your pain meds.

450
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,700
Try to sleep.

451
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,691
Dentist looked at the
tooth the guy pulled out.

452
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,531
There was nothing wrong with it.

453
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,232
So aside from him being an
idiot, what else did we learn?

454
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,173
The pain is real. It's
coming from somewhere.

455
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,767
What about bone cancer?

456
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,074
You can't connect
bone cancer to the heart.

457
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,978
House figure this can
wait till the morning?

458
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,744
Actually, he told Cuddy
he's not ready to work.

459
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,809
He quit? Apparently.

460
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,515
It's a power play.
He'll be back tomorrow.

461
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,387
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

462
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,535
which shuts down the heart.

463
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,028
Primary bone
cancer isn't hereditary.

464
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,119
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

465
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,596
It's hereditary and it increases

466
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,532
a person's risk of
having bone cancer.

467
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,834
You have another theory?

468
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,373
My theory is it's
not bone cancer.

469
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,039
Gamma survey would
locate the tumors.

470
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:18,613
I had pea soup today. You'd
love my breath right now.

471
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:23,891
I didn't get a chance to run
tonight. House is having issues.

472
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,423
I missed you a lot today.

473
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,432
All I wanna do is...

474
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,003
You know.

475
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,872
No cancers on the
lateral cuneiform bone.

476
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,679
Navicular's also clean.

477
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,149
Chase is lying to me.

478
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,986
And I know you know. Tell
me what's going on, please.

479
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,026
I'm going to tell you
the same thing I told him.

480
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,254
Talk to your spouse.

481
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,636
No breakfast?

482
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,605
Not today.

483
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,968
I'm hallucinating.

484
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,411
What happened?

485
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,470
It's nothing visual this time.

486
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,144
I hear whispering.

487
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,209
Is that why you've been acting
so weird? Is that why you quit?

488
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,777
I'm losing it.

489
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,118
I'm sure there's a
rational explanation,

490
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,886
the wind, a neighbor's TV...

491
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,085
I checked everything.

492
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,256
What's really scary is that I hear
whispering while not on Vicodin.

493
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,935
I'm gonna check myself
back in to Mayfield.

494
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,164
Okay.

495
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,569
Okay?

496
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,305
You don't think there might
be a logical explanation?

497
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,440
Something I missed?

498
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,847
You're the smartest guy I know.

499
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,614
If you haven't thought
of it, it doesn't exist.

500
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,214
I'll drive you over. I just
need to make some tea first.

501
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,025
You know.

502
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,457
That you're an ass? Yeah.

503
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,558
You overheard me talking to my
dead girlfriend and thought to yourself,

504
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,933
"Hmm. What kind of
fun can I have with this?"

505
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,164
Why are you talking to her?

506
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,518
Did you run out
of living people?

507
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,633
You can talk to
me, I'm right here.

508
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,109
I miss her. Talking to
her makes me feel better.

509
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,475
You don't.

510
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,316
Patient, Lauren Maybaum, 27,

511
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,184
presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

512
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,854
Sorry I'm late.

513
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,100
Yesterday, you said
you weren't ready.

514
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,116
Yesterday, I
wasn't. Today, I am.

515
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,321
And tomorrow? Is it possible
for me to get a five-day forecast?

516
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,262
Feeling much better,
thank you for not asking.

517
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,768
Either you did have a
problem, which I can't ignore,

518
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,531
or you were jerking me
around, which I can't ignore.

519
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,470
You are a woman,
you can do anything.

520
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,600
For example, I can
talk to you outside.

521
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,378
You sure you're only one woman?

522
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,545
This is the part where you play
the employee and I play the boss.

523
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,317
I can see your
nipples. Your turn.

524
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,652
These kids are...

525
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,556
No wonder she hates him.

526
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,152
Mmm. That's not
hate. It's foreplay.

527
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,389
It's inappropriate.

528
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,999
Gamma survey revealed no tumors.

529
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,299
So it's not bone cancer.

530
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,532
Where's Chase?

531
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,698
Don't know.

532
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,164
Hmm.

533
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,405
Two mysteries, cool. Theories?

534
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:33,044
Did I come in too soon? Okay.
I'm going to take another lap,

535
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,519
and I want three new ideas
by the time I come back.

536
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,783
One of them's got
to be not stupid.

537
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:45,320
Where there's
pain, there's nerves.

538
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,424
Hereditary Sensory
Autonomic Neuropathy, type 1.

539
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,265
Miscommunication
in the brain stem

540
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,929
mistakes nerve
pain for tooth pain.

541
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,315
That explains the
bradycardia, too.

542
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,139
And I like the word
"hereditary" in the title.

543
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,733
Carbamazepine fixes him.

544
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,754
I'll get him started on the medication.
- No.

545
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,577
Chase specifically
asked if he could do it.

546
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,345
Sleep at home.

547
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,917
So I didn't do the gamma survey.

548
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,186
Was it bone cancer?

549
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,283
No.

550
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,405
Then you should congratulate
me for not wasting your time.

551
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,091
Are you getting some help,

552
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,724
or is this the way things
are gonna be from now on?

553
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,428
What's pathetic is

554
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:27,098
you haven't gotten help
because you want to feel bad.

555
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,367
You want to suffer.

556
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,605
Because if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

557
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,441
Patient needs some
carbamazepine.

558
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,677
Now I don't care how
much that room scares you,

559
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,047
you're doing your job.

560
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,161
How long before you
cross this one off the list?

561
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,662
Couple of hours.

562
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,307
You ever shoot anyone?

563
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,704
Twice.

564
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,545
You ever kill anyone?

565
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,413
No. But I know a few
guys who did, though.

566
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,420
Did they ever get over it?

567
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:19,083
A captain I know compares
it to taking out the trash.

568
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,921
Like it's nothing.

569
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,985
Other hand, I got an ex-partner

570
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,257
who nearly drank
himself into oblivion.

571
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,423
Did he get help?

572
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,656
Yeah.

573
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,262
Help didn't help.

574
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,437
Oh, God!

575
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,003
What is it?

576
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,739
I went to the bathroom.

577
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,485
Patient's lost bowel control.

578
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,319
Means we were wrong about HSAN

579
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,915
and means he's
getting worse, fast.

580
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:56,928
Wouldn't want to be the duty
nurse assigned to his floor.

581
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,226
Get it? "Doody" nurse?

582
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,425
Fine, do the doctor thing.

583
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,944
An autoimmune
disorder could explain...

584
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,413
We put him on steroids, he
didn't respond. It's not autoimmune.

585
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,632
Could be Wilson's Disease.

586
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,503
Disease that advanced
would've hit the liver.

587
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,669
It is possible the liver is so
far gone, the labs look normal.

588
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,906
It's worth a shot.

589
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,608
Go treat with penicillamine.

590
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,727
And when he doesn't get
better, come back quickly,

591
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,186
so we can get
one more shot at it.

592
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,384
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

593
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,763
Take your time.

594
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,032
How long has it been
since your last confession?

595
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,631
I killed a man.

596
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,068
Oh.

597
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,978
But it was the
right thing to do.

598
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,478
Who lives or dies is not
your decision to make.

599
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,783
Sometimes in the
operating room, it feels like it.

600
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,722
I'm a doctor.

601
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,220
Well, then you should
know more than anybody

602
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,319
that every human life is sacred.

603
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,165
Why?

604
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,667
Tell me what's
sacred about a dictator

605
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,727
that kills hundreds of
thousands of his own people.

606
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:16,036
What is sacred about a
doctor who kills a patient?

607
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,281
Is it just the slippery
slope you're worried about?

608
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,681
Afraid that forgiving
me for killing

609
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,379
the worst person on earth
sets a bad precedent?

610
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,489
I promise, I won't tell anyone.

611
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,526
Just forgive me.

612
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:46,096
Saying 10 Hail Marys isn't
going to do you any good.

613
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,765
Then what do I have to do?

614
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,477
What does God need me to do?

615
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,172
You can't have absolution

616
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,407
without first taking
responsibility.

617
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,482
You have to turn
yourself in to the police.

618
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:03,352
What, and... And go to
jail for the rest of my life?

619
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,356
What's just about that?

620
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,088
I did the right thing.

621
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,861
There has to be another way.

622
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:15,958
You want absolution,
I told you how to get it.

623
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,088
Send this in to the
State Licensing Board.

624
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,526
I've signed off
on all your hours.

625
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,353
Why?

626
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,262
Because it's easier this way.

627
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,028
You're uncomfortable with me.

628
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,460
No.

629
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,835
Going by the book was pointless.

630
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:53,981
You were gonna learn nothing.

631
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,338
Good. I thought it was
because of the sexual tension.

632
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,527
There was no sexual tension.

633
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,599
There was tension.

634
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,703
And it made me feel funny, so...

635
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,042
Here.

636
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,053
It's too bad.

637
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,251
I was kind of getting into the
whole "hot for teacher" thing.

638
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,357
You sure you're okay?

639
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,723
Yeah. False alarm.

640
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,133
What about us?

641
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:25,400
We're good. Just like this.

642
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,847
You press my
buttons, I press yours.

643
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,863
By "buttons," you mean...

644
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,040
Huh.

645
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,114
You do make me feel funny.

646
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,929
You're not gonna die.

647
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,528
I've accepted it. It's okay.

648
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,697
In addition to high arches

649
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,299
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

650
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:08,005
you also inherited a
self-destruct button.

651
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,038
Forms in the brain stem.

652
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,380
Technically, it's an
aneurysm, presses on nerves

653
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,478
<i>that control everything
from tooth pain to heart rate.</i>

654
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,386
<i>As you get older,
it gets bigger,</i>

655
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:23,053
until finally the button, which I'll
call "intracranial berry aneurysm,"

656
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,586
because I had a friend in high
school with that name, stops the signal

657
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,463
<i>from your brain to
your heart and bam!</i>

658
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,732
How do I know you're
not still lying to me?

659
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,548
Saying I'm healthy just
to make me feel better?

660
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,632
It does sound that
way, doesn't it?

661
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,677
But this time, no sugar pills.

662
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,109
I'm going to cut into your brain

663
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,840
to make you think
that I'm fixing it.

664
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,405
And if our fake
tests confirm it,

665
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,327
I'm going to be cutting
into your son's brain, too.

666
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,877
Because I'm just that committed.

667
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,081
Michael is going to be okay?

668
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,421
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

669
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,792
in which case, I will
reconsider your fate argument.

670
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:03,430
You wanna give him a call? Visiting
hours don't apply to my patients.

671
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,295
Yeah. In a bit.

672
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,506
Yeah, that's what I thought.

673
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,769
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

674
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,824
You just don't want anything
in your life that won't let you do

675
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,025
whatever the hell you want to do

676
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,075
whenever the hell
you want to do it.

677
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,451
You've had it easy.
Sorry to screw you up.

678
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,338
Mom.

679
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,290
Maybe when we get out of here...

680
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,292
What kind of movies you like?

681
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:22,311
He's been missing for eight
hours. Robert Chase. C-H-A-S...

682
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,842
Hey!

683
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,677
Never mind. He
just walked in. Sorry.

684
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:29,753
You could've called me.

685
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,123
I forgot. To call me?

686
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,921
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Where were you?

687
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,325
You're drunk.

688
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,555
All right, I...

689
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,698
I needed to get wasted. I did.

690
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,098
And now I'm better.

691
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,337
What aren't you telling me?

692
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,633
Nothing.

693
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,551
Hi, Dad.

694
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,292
I think I've been

695
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,353
focusing on the wrong thing.

696
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:50,063
There were some good times.

697
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,371
Wilson, this is stupid!

698
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,612
You see?
