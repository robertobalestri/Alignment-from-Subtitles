1
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,352
How about the name Brooke?

2
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,795
She just doesn't seem
like a Brooke anymore.

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,526
Brooklyn?

4
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,158
She's a baby, not a city.

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,805
What do you think, bud?
Got any suggestions?

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,138
Toadette. I'm hungry.

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,778
I'll get you guys
something to eat.

8
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,038
You're okay.

9
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,546
Okay.

10
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,428
I was paged?

11
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,339
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,845
Can we talk somewhere?

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,675
I was thinking...

14
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,356
Sarah?

15
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,458
Yeah.

16
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,628
Where's the baby?

17
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,804
No one saw anyone go in or out,

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,405
and the baby's
not in the nursery.

19
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,212
What was her condition?
Five weeks pre-term.

20
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,980
C-section because of
mom's preeclampsia.

21
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,247
Is that the father?

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,916
Mr. Lozinski, I'm Dr. Lisa
Cuddy, Dean of Medicine.

23
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,687
How long were
you out of the room?

24
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,086
Fifteen, 20 minutes, tops.

25
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,282
Was there a proximity alarm?

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,389
No alarms.

27
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,592
What's that?

28
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,501
The bracelet on your baby's ankle
has a microchip that would set off alarms

29
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,196
if she were carried
through an exit.

30
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,231
Call the police, shut down all
the exits. We're on lockdown.

31
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,006
Nobody moves until
we find that baby.

32
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,210
Why won't you sign
the divorce papers?

33
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,547
It's been on my
to-do list, sorry.

34
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,455
Will you sign them?

35
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,790
Not until we have a real
conversation about our marriage.

36
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,394
Okay, I made a mistake
coming here. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,228
I'm gonna leave this copy here.

38
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,638
<i>Code Seven. Code Seven.</i>

39
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,806
<i>All non-essential
personnel and guests,</i>

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,042
<i>please remain where you are.</i>

41
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,812
<i>Security personnel should
report to their staging areas</i>

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,116
<i>and await further instructions.</i>

43
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,680
<i>All patients, please
remain in your rooms</i>

44
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,727
<i>and use call buttons if you
need medical assistance.</i>

45
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,594
<i>Please remain calm and wait for
hospital personnel to come to you.</i>

46
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,099
<i>Do not try to leave your
room until the Code Seven...</i>

47
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,159
It's clear all the way
down. Nurse, just leave it.

48
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,329
But it's... Leave it.

49
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,581
You need to get
into the room now.

50
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,783
<i>Please notify hospital
personnel or police immediately</i>

51
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,537
<i>if you see anything suspicious.</i>

52
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,444
<i>We cannot allow anyone to
leave the hospital at this time.</i>

53
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,243
<i>All personnel should
remain in their staging areas</i>

54
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,909
<i>unless otherwise
instructed by security.</i>

55
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,617
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gotta clear the...

56
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,383
<i>Thank you for your
patience and cooperation.</i>

57
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,908
And did anyone
other than your nurses

58
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,592
ever come by asking
about your daughter?

59
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,863
No. No, just those two.

60
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,397
I'll check in soon.

61
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,683
Wait. Hon, what are you doing?

62
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,107
No, I need to help them look.

63
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,666
You have to stay in bed.

64
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,974
You pulled a stitch,
lay back down.

65
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,103
I've got it.

66
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,758
Why don't I give you
something to help you relax?

67
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,616
No, no. I don't want to
relax. I want to find my baby.

68
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,311
The police are
searching room by room.

69
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,650
Who would take her?
What if she needs to be fed?

70
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,916
We're gonna find her.

71
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,892
Why aren't the police
talking to our nurse?

72
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,757
What now? Truth or Dare?

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,893
Oh, no, you don't
want to mess with me.

74
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,766
Truth or Dare queen
at Newton North.

75
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,135
I was kidding.

76
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,983
I'm sure we can find something
interesting to talk about

77
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,135
without relying on
some juvenile game.

78
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,268
Sure.

79
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,981
Truth.

80
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,619
They think I took the kid? Do
you think I would do something...

81
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,319
I'm just asking questions.

82
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,391
The dad let the older brother
hold the baby for the first time,

83
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,400
so I put her in his lap. After
a few seconds, she shrieked.

84
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,867
I'm pretty sure he pinched her.

85
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,134
I need to know this stuff,
anything out of the ordinary.

86
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,335
It was sibling rivalry. I
thought it was kind of ordinary.

87
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,110
Hey.

88
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,495
What are you doing down here?

89
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,317
I was looking for
McKenna's patient file.

90
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,649
Oh. You mean this file?

91
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,482
The one I said I'd
get? Two hours ago.

92
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,857
Seriously, you don't trust me

93
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,328
with the immense
responsibility of fetching a file?

94
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,541
If you already found it, what
are you looking through those for?

95
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,864
Do you know what these are?

96
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,635
The staff credentials files.

97
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,934
Those should all be in HR.

98
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,235
Down here to be digitized.

99
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,709
And we're locked in, and whoever's
supposed to be watching them is locked out.

100
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,406
We could look up
anything on anyone.

101
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,314
Malpractice records,
felony histories...

102
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,874
Put them away. Come on.

103
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,389
We have a tiny window of opportunity
to gain some insight into our colleagues.

104
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,387
Okay. What if we just
snoop on our boss?

105
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,157
I think I can live with that.

106
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,182
You're on two milligrams
of morphine an hour.

107
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,081
How the hell are
you still awake?

108
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:00,686
No, don't tell me.

109
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,921
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.

110
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,785
If the blood's not
reaching your gut,

111
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,229
you'd have intestinal
hypoperfusion,

112
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,529
that'd be stronger
than the narcotics.

113
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,900
The nurse said I might
only have a day or two left.

114
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,666
She was being kind.

115
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,947
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

116
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,777
Oh, God, don't tell
me we used to date.

117
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,120
The limp, yeah, I read
about you. I sent you a letter.

118
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,091
Before they knew what was wrong,

119
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,255
I tried to get you
to take my case.

120
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,599
Yeah, well, you should
have kept reading.

121
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,225
Heart disease is kind
of below my pay grade.

122
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,901
It started as tooth pain.

123
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,137
No one got it that it
was a heart problem

124
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,974
until I had a series of
massive heart attacks.

125
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,219
This doesn't bother you?

126
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,093
You talking with your
mouth full? A little.

127
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,531
I meant the fact that you're
standing in here watching me die

128
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,399
because my file bored you.

129
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,269
I take maybe one in 20 cases.

130
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,137
A lot of the people I
turn down end up dying.

131
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,210
It's really a good argument for
there being more than one me,

132
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,215
when you think about it.

133
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,717
Truth.

134
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,886
All right.

135
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,658
Have you ever had a threesome?

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,925
No.

137
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,525
You haven't?

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,569
What, just because I'm bisexual?

139
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,604
Well, yeah.

140
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,732
Do you understand
what bisexual means?

141
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,886
It doesn't mean you have
sex with two people at once.

142
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,620
And by the way, you didn't
ask me if I'd had a foursome.

143
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,771
Truth or dare?

144
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,279
Wait, you've had a foursome? No.

145
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,658
But now you've asked me two
questions so I get to ask you two.

146
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,446
You see why I was the queen.

147
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,821
Walker wouldn't do
anything, he's my son, too.

148
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,057
I don't mean to sound
cold, but he's your stepson.

149
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,002
We can't ignore any possibility.

150
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,943
Walker's been getting in
fights a lot at school, lately.

151
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,382
Last week, he hit another kid with
a book, hard enough to draw blood.

152
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,013
If he did something
to the baby...

153
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,634
We were working on it.

154
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,233
We failed.

155
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,554
No. You had a
conversation with House,

156
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,673
then came back, informed me
I'd been forever poisoned by him

157
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,079
and started packing.

158
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,027
It's interesting how your
story leaves out the part

159
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,986
where you murdered
another human being.

160
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,181
A dictator who was
committing genocide.

161
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,883
You thought about
doing it yourself.

162
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,049
But I didn't.

163
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,890
Right, because you're
not toxic like I am.

164
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,460
What do you think is
gonna happen here?

165
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,557
You're going to logic
me into coming back?

166
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,841
There must be over 30
malpractice settlements in here.

167
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,937
He did a brain biopsy
without CT mapping

168
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,742
"causing brain
herniation and death."

169
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,015
Look at this one.

170
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:55,249
"Patient lost four liters of blood
from a botched penisectomy."

171
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,186
On a patient named Lisa Cuddy?

172
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,256
Damn it, they're all
named Lisa Cuddy!

173
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,628
He's not even here and
he's screwing with us.

174
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,792
Where's the joy in that?

175
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,396
You really wanna
get into his head?

176
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,568
Yeah, but I decided against
stabbing myself in the leg

177
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,271
or getting addicted
to pain pills.

178
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,109
You can skip the stabbing.

179
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,394
Where did you...
Confiscated them

180
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,651
from a drug seeker in the clinic.
Didn't get a chance to turn them in.

181
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,552
It is after-hours.

182
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,626
I'll take one.

183
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,664
Walk in House's
shoes for a night.

184
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:42,258
One? I believe he
wears a larger size.

185
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:56,512
No cards, no flowers,
not even a phone call.

186
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,614
Let me guess, lighthouse keeper?

187
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:02,247
I was a classics professor
at Princeton for 26 years.

188
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,984
Mostly research.

189
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,425
So, your closest colleagues died
2,000 years ago, that must be it.

190
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:14,293
Not that you have no friends because,
say, you're a miserable bastard.

191
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,502
What do you care?

192
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,704
The next few hours
are gonna be grim.

193
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:24,472
There'll be nausea, pain, no company
as soon as I get myself out of here.

194
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:30,373
I can unlock the regulator, you
can put yourself into a narcotic haze,

195
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,714
sleep blissfully to the end.

196
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,880
Is that a favor to me or to you?

197
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,357
Win-win.

198
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,827
No, thanks.

199
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,088
You're trying to guilt me
for not taking your case?

200
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,758
You think a classicist
doesn't believe in fate?

201
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,702
You think Odysseus would lie
whimpering like a loser in a hospital bed?

202
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,697
Come on, take my offer.

203
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,735
Take the drug holiday,
numb yourself out.

204
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,177
I think you're the one who
wants to numb himself out.

205
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,561
Truth.

206
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,993
How did your dad react
when you came out to him?

207
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,662
He made me tea.

208
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:29,641
Seriously. Doesn't matter what I tell
him, he smiles, tells me he supports me,

209
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,768
and makes me
some peppermint tea.

210
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,903
Truth or dare?

211
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,174
Truth.

212
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,973
Are you dating anyone?

213
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,245
Now? No.

214
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,313
Interesting, you
added a modifier. Truth.

215
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,089
When you were dating
Foreman... No, no, no.

216
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,355
What?

217
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,953
If it was something
personal about him or us,

218
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,342
I just don't think that's right to
answer. We all work together.

219
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,566
That's the whole point of this
game, something personal,

220
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,346
preferably embarrassing.
Just pick something else.

221
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,770
You see, this is your problem.

222
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,830
You act like you're
so liberal and open,

223
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,964
but you are the least...

224
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,306
I changed my mind.
Dare. Just no nudity.

225
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:09,042
Yes, nudity. I want you
to show your breasts

226
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,648
to Taub.

227
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,652
That is the most
idiotic dare ever.

228
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,486
Have you ever played this game?

229
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,452
Well, I thought showing me your
breasts would be a little exploitative.

230
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,962
Your dare is in
the future, genius.

231
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,307
Hey, if you're saying
you won't do it...

232
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,390
No, no, no, no.

233
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,561
Of course I'll show
my breasts to Taub,

234
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,571
tomorrow, perhaps, or
maybe sometime next year,

235
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,335
you know, because
I'm honor-bound.

236
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,501
Truth or dare?

237
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,215
It's understandable that you
wouldn't be happy right now.

238
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,583
Your world is changing.
Are you scared?

239
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,254
And how do you
feel about your sister?

240
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,992
I hate her.

241
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,900
Walker, this is important. Did
you do anything to the baby?

242
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,336
Did you move her
somewhere? Hide her?

243
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,430
No.

244
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,634
Nobody'll be mad at you.

245
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,234
I said no, so stop asking me.

246
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,347
Bad pain day?

247
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,279
Bad pain month.

248
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,881
And since I'm not using it...

249
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,223
If you don't want the morphine,

250
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,889
you must have
something of your own.

251
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,795
I was in rehab.

252
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,300
Had a little problem with
the "something of my own."

253
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,098
Now all I take is ibuprofen,
and that's two flights up.

254
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,399
For the whole month?

255
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,102
The pain's migrated, I think
the arterial wall is damaged.

256
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,643
And what? You don't know?

257
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,975
I haven't had an
arteriogram yet.

258
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:51,776
You don't want the test in
case the arterial wall is fine,

259
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:56,049
which would mean that the pain
is coming from something else.

260
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,252
What's her name?

261
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,962
Interesting that you'd jump from
physical pain to long-lost love.

262
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,495
You're projecting.

263
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,864
So, what's her name?

264
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,570
What time is it?

265
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,669
What does it matter to
you? It's T-minus four hours.

266
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,611
8:20. Now tell me who she is,

267
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:31,021
and what are the pathetically long
odds that she's gonna visit or call.

268
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,388
Only that's a reason
not to take the morphine.

269
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:44,864
Dude.

270
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,097
Dude.

271
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,170
Is the room still spinning?

272
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,778
Mine is.

273
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,548
Maybe we shouldn't
have taken so many?

274
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm gonna try to stand up.

275
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,318
You be careful.

276
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,226
Oh, yeah, that's working.

277
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,300
I can't feel my face.

278
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,009
No way.

279
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,670
Way. Hit me.

280
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,277
What?

281
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,249
Hit me in the face.

282
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,547
Seriously?

283
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,420
You know you've always
wanted to. Now's your chance.

284
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,824
That's a great idea. We can
start a fight club, maybe we...

285
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,158
Oh, my God, you're
right. That is so cool.

286
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,725
Okay, I'll even...

287
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,898
I can still feel my hand.

288
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,074
I wasn't ready.

289
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,613
What were you gonna do,
flex your goatee muscle?

290
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,408
Wait a minute.

291
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,214
This is your credentials file?

292
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,846
Give me that.

293
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,088
That's why you came down
here, not for the patient file.

294
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,199
You wanted... You wanted...

295
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,875
Okay, Robert. I will answer
whatever questions you want.

296
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,176
But then you're gonna
have to sign the papers.

297
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,707
Did you ever love me?

298
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,047
How can you even ask that?

299
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,833
The first time you slept with me was
because you were on crystal meth.

300
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,383
I was on the drugs
because I was emotional.

301
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,571
It was the emotions that
led to the sex, not the drugs.

302
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,927
Not true.

303
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,024
After that, you refused to
let it go further than just sex.

304
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,345
Because I knew I was falling
for you and I didn't want to.

305
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,860
And that never changed.

306
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,372
You broke off our vacation
because I bought you a ring.

307
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,067
I got cold feet,
I'm not proud of it.

308
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,619
And then you almost
called off our wedding

309
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,441
because you couldn't
give up the idea... No.

310
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,955
Don't. of having your
dead husband's baby.

311
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,572
Don't bring him up.
Because even then

312
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,173
you weren't sure about me.

313
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,727
Maybe if I was dying
when you married me,

314
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,894
it would've been
a bit different.

315
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,918
That's not fair.

316
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,682
It's not only fair,
it's exactly the point.

317
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,453
He was dying when you met him and
he was gone just a year into the marriage.

318
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,049
So, it was all a
honeymoon with him,

319
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,959
and I could never
match up to that.

320
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,122
The first time reality
intruded on... Stop this.

321
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,223
Just tell me the
truth. About what?

322
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,358
Did you ever love me?

323
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,959
I don't know!

324
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,569
Thank you for
finally telling me.

325
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,590
Truth.

326
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,290
You said you weren't
dating anyone now.

327
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,733
Does that mean you
recently were or soon will be?

328
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,969
Oh. Look who's guarded now.

329
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:12,409
You had no problem talking about
your sex life, but your love life...

330
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,474
Fine, dare it is.

331
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,277
No nudity. Now or in the future.

332
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,656
You're too much of
a nice boy, Wilson.

333
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,087
Let's let the bad
boy out for a bit.

334
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:36,625
You have to go steal
one dollar, right now.

335
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,736
From who?

336
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,975
Oh, come on.

337
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,343
"Interned at Hopkins," old news.

338
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,578
Here we go!
"Academic probation."

339
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,679
I'm asking you to
please stop reading.

340
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,583
I'm afraid I can't do that.

341
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,685
"Faked a lab
result." Very wrong.

342
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,833
And you came down to destroy
the record before it gets digitized.

343
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,695
Permanentized. Even wronger.

344
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,437
I needed to beat all those
elite, spoiled kids around me.

345
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,548
To show no weakness,
to win at everything.

346
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,411
Why'd I just tell you that?

347
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,682
I always talk too
much when I'm stoned.

348
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,114
Why'd I just tell you that?

349
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,529
It was stupid.

350
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,877
You had great grades. One lab
result shouldn't have mattered.

351
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,597
Except I didn't think I deserved

352
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,798
to be at a top med
school in the first place.

353
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,135
Again.

354
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,399
Faking a lab
result is one thing,

355
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,173
but you needing to come
down here to destroy the records

356
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,374
12 years after the fact...

357
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,050
This isn't about med school.

358
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,822
You don't think you
belong here at the hospital.

359
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,722
"Dr. Taub, comma,
Christopher Michael."

360
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,168
So, this is what it comes
down to in the final hours.

361
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,841
Deifying some lost love.

362
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,347
Hoping to get her on the phone
and make everything perfect.

363
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,780
It's pathetic.

364
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,308
Either you left her for a reason
or she left you for a reason.

365
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,796
A phone call is not gonna...

366
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,914
It's my daughter.

367
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,890
So, why isn't she here?

368
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:46,994
I left my family
when Gracie was six.

369
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,398
I was sort of
forced out, actually,

370
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,531
after I had had an
affair with a student.

371
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,301
For sex or love?

372
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,743
Neither.

373
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:05,210
I'd only married Gracie's
mother because of the baby.

374
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,047
But I didn't think I could
handle the commitment,

375
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:13,582
and just like any decent
academic, I proved myself right.

376
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,629
And what time it is
matters because...

377
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,097
She's a dance
teacher in Atlanta,

378
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,066
she gets home from work at 9:00,

379
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,195
and I just wanted to
speak to her one more time.

380
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,230
That's my story.

381
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,970
What's yours?

382
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,346
Same thing, pretty much.

383
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,778
I'm gonna be
dead in a few hours,

384
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,980
your secrets couldn't be safer,

385
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,990
unless you're keeping
them from yourself.

386
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,228
I like being alone.

387
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,831
At least I convinced myself
that I'm better off that way.

388
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:04,876
And then I met someone in a
psychiatric hospital of all places.

389
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,940
She changed me.

390
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,980
And then she left.

391
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:19,848
We're better off alone. We
suffer alone, we die alone.

392
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:24,158
Doesn't matter if you're a model
husband or father of the year,

393
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,463
tomorrow will be
the same for you.

394
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,203
But yesterday
would've been different.

395
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,137
Hey, Daria.

396
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,307
Dr. Wilson.

397
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,380
Could you cook me
up a chicken sandwich?

398
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,819
Grill's closed.

399
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,287
It's important, medically.

400
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,815
Dr. Hadley needs a
high-protein meal right now.

401
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,693
She doesn't like to talk about
it but she has hypoproteinemia.

402
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,322
We got chicken salad.

403
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,026
Yeah, that's cold.

404
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,763
She needs to eat warm
protein for this disease?

405
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,701
Well, we could
give her cold protein

406
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,933
whose uptake enzymes
haven't been activated,

407
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,909
as long as you don't mind her risking liver
and kidney failure and eventual death.

408
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,846
But, hey, it's worth it so you
don't have to flip on the grill.

409
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,850
You don't have to
be obnoxious about it.

410
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,565
How do you look so okay?

411
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:12,401
I spent months wondering
how I made it go bad.

412
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:19,441
If you never loved me, then
I didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,907
Hey.

414
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,117
Allison, come on.

415
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,016
It's all right.

416
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,988
Still don't know
why I said that.

417
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,329
It's not even true.
I did love you.

418
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:45,669
Just not in a way that
would have ever worked.

419
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,506
Why not?

420
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:52,204
Because everything
you said is true.

421
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,347
I'm a mess.

422
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,348
I married a man
I knew was dying,

423
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,889
so God knows how
screwed up I already was.

424
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,824
Him dying messed
me up even more.

425
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,461
I pushed you out of my life.

426
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:19,169
And I'm unfixable.

427
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,599
Not you.

428
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,748
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,184
I'm sorry, too.

430
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,056
Truth.

431
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,353
Shut up.

432
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:14,926
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,086
It's not your fault.

434
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,061
No, I didn't even play fair.

435
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,393
You asked me how my dad reacted
when I told him I was bisexual.

436
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,129
And the Huntington's.

437
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,236
No tea party?

438
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,533
I never told him.

439
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,039
He's been through enough.

440
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:32,378
So, he just visits his
heterosexual, healthy daughter,

441
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,073
and you go out to dinner and a
movie and talk about your garden?

442
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,616
I work late. He's
staying at my house.

443
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,709
It's easier if I stay
elsewhere as much as I can.

444
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,551
You can't suppress your
life for his convenience.

445
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,887
You don't see a
little irony in that?

446
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,790
That's exactly what
you do for House.

447
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,795
When he moved in with you,
you bought a bigger place for him.

448
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,831
No wonder you're
not dating anyone.

449
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,632
You're right.

450
00:28:55,801 --> 00:29:00,603
That woman, the woman
I'm not involved with,

451
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:06,475
her name is Sam Carr. But in
1990 and 1991, it was Sam Wilson.

452
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,807
Your ex-wife?

453
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,714
No, my mother. Yes, my ex-wife.

454
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,345
Ex number one. She
friended me a few weeks ago.

455
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,618
We started e-mailing, turns
out she's recently divorced,

456
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,057
and I wanted to ask her out.

457
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,890
You can't take a woman to dinner

458
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,161
or else House will go running
straight back to the loony bin?

459
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,545
You're not worried about House,
you're worried about yourself

460
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,867
because she's an ex,

461
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,134
so even dinner will mean
it's immediately serious.

462
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,245
What are your favorite
parts that you remember?

463
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,749
I liked how, when I'd wake
up in the middle of the night,

464
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,175
you'd put your arm around me
and you wouldn't even wake up.

465
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:57,754
I liked watching you stand up to your dad
at Christmas when he yelled at your mom.

466
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:02,358
How you didn't even know
you were strong, but you were.

467
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:06,737
What do you miss?

468
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,068
I miss a lot.

469
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,376
But when I think
about missing you,

470
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:17,405
I think about that dance class
that we took, for our wedding.

471
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,051
It's weird.

472
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,257
I think, "He's never going
to hold me like that again."

473
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,977
Oh, God.

474
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,317
Come on.

475
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,332
I'm gonna miss this, too.

476
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,012
"Published in <i>The New
England Journal</i> at 26"?

477
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,777
I finished all the lab
work a year earlier.

478
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,646
"Led a group of surgeons to
fix cleft palates in Bangladesh"?

479
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,248
What can I say? That
concert was very moving to me.

480
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,792
I have to take a knee.

481
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,127
I don't get it. This has gotta be
the most spectacular file down here.

482
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,792
Why are you pretending
to be ashamed?

483
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,860
I'd trade mine for
yours in a second.

484
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,429
When I was in med school, I
thought I'd be House someday.

485
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,736
Instead, I'm a
fellow, working with...

486
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,082
Working for people
years younger than me.

487
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,845
So, we both have a few regrets.

488
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,391
You should be proud of yours.
Your life's been trending up.

489
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,430
No news.

490
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,168
How you holding up?

491
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,836
You let them sedate you.

492
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,036
Yeah.

493
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,306
Do you have kids?

494
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,608
A little girl.

495
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,907
I adopted her last year.

496
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:35,613
I adopted Walker right after
Donald and I got married.

497
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:42,785
What if I can never love Walker
the way I love my daughter?

498
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,565
Does that make me
a horrible person?

499
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,096
Let me get you some tissues.

500
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,807
Did you request
some extra towels?

501
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,320
No. What? Why?

502
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,787
There are eight
towels in Sarah's room.

503
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,056
Okay.

504
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,562
There should only be four.

505
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,792
Housekeeping handles towels.

506
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,299
I need you to track
down their logs.

507
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,927
Figure out who was
up there and when.

508
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,235
Because they got extra towels?

509
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,796
Just find the logs. Now.

510
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,243
Adrienne, you okay?

511
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,906
Sure.

512
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,941
What's wrong?

513
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,585
Adrienne, give me your arm.

514
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,126
The hair on her left
arm is standing up.

515
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,718
Asymmetric
neurological function.

516
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,491
She's having a
pilomotor seizure.

517
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,895
She seemed fine a minute ago.

518
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,959
She was, she's probably been
having complex seizures all day.

519
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,469
She'd be basically functional,

520
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,439
but more or less
acting on autopilot.

521
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,408
She probably dropped
the towels off twice.

522
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,345
She could have taken the baby.

523
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,346
We never really did
have a proper goodbye.

524
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,321
It's 9:00.

525
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:47,042
<i>It's Gracie, I can't come to the
phone, so please leave a message.</i>

526
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,020
I guess she's running late.

527
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,024
You don't seem that surprised.

528
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,197
That's what you expected to get.

529
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,533
You waited until you
knew she'd be out.

530
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,910
Her aunt said that
she starts work late.

531
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:25,047
Every now and then, I just call
to hear her voice on the machine.

532
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,554
I was never there
when she needed me.

533
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,461
What right do I have
to need her now?

534
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,791
None.

535
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,096
Which just means you're a
hypocrite. Because apparently you do.

536
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:53,139
Forget about rights. Just tell
her what you need to tell her.

537
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,317
<i>It's Gracie, I can't come to the
phone, so please leave a message.</i>

538
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,586
Gracie?

539
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,060
This is

540
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,663
your father.

541
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,266
I love you.

542
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,701
Anything?

543
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,832
We've covered every
room on Maldonado's logs.

544
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,428
Been everywhere she's been.

545
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:02,271
Where's the other cart? Isn't
there usually another cart in here?

546
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:24,763
Hey.

547
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,135
Okay. Okay.

548
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,539
Okay.

549
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,111
Hi.

550
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,928
Anyone in there?
Lockdown's over.

551
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,629
I should go.

552
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,273
Yeah.

553
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,350
I just asked Sam to dinner.

554
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,049
Little baby's all growed-up.

555
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,118
You gonna tell your dad?

556
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,592
I'll stop by his
hotel, talk to him.

557
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,195
Hotel? You said he was
staying at your apartment.

558
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,471
Was there any truth
in anything you said?

559
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:10,531
The part about it being a good idea
for you to call Sam. That was true.

560
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,873
Good night, Remy.
Good night, James.

561
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,673
<i>Code Seven has been lifted.</i>

562
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,271
<i>Repeat. Code
Seven has been lifted.</i>

563
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,043
You want your file?

564
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,813
Nah.

565
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,911
<i>All hospital personnel</i>

566
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,732
<i>can leave their staging
areas...</i> Good for you.

567
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,918
<i>And report back
to their department.</i>

568
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,323
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

569
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,259
We don't have to tell
anybody what we...

570
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,328
Mmm-mmm.

571
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,423
You got the patient file?

572
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,559
I'll grab it.

573
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,798
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

574
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:19,937
I think I'm ready to take
you up on your offer.

575
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,662
Dr. House? Lockdown
ended a few minutes ago.

576
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,894
Yeah, I know.

577
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,507
I'm sorry I didn't
take your case.

578
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,586
Me, too.

579
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:18,132
Gracie was the cutest
six-year-old you ever saw.

580
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,765
Interesting night, huh?

581
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,909
Interesting night.
