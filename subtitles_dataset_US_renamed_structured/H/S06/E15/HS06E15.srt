1
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:38,616
It's estimated the observable universe

2
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:41,603
is 93 billion light-years across.

3
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:46,660
- It's probably more accure...
- I'm gonna be so far away.

4
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,056
I don't care. I don't want to break up.

5
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:51,760
I'll come on the weekends.

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,059
Stanford's on the other
side of the country.

7
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:57,626
My dad has, like, ten million
frequent flyer miles. He won't care.

8
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:10,415
- Are we all right over here?
- Yes, Mr. Damon.

9
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,871
I just had something caught in my throat.

10
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,449
You're not supposed to have
any food or drinks in here.

11
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,285
It's just water. I have a cough.
I didn't want to disturb anyone.

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,331
We can only observe 4% of the universe.

13
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:24,406
The rest of it is unaccounted for.

14
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,544
I never knew you were such a good liar.

15
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,547
More vodka, and you might find out
some things you didn't know about me.

16
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,095
Really?

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,463
- Nicholas.
- Yes, sir?

18
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:37,345
What conclusions can we draw from
the incredible number of stars?

19
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,933
That the movie's either gonna
be really good or really bad.

20
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:44,723
I was thinking more about the implications

21
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:46,648
for extraterrestrial life.

22
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,943
I guess if there's an
infinite number of stars,

23
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:54,029
odds are there's at least one
galaxy with life other than our own.

24
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,287
Or?

25
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:57,786
Or... not?

26
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,631
Or our solar system is somehow unique.

27
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,582
The question then becomes, "in what way?"

28
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,424
The question then becomes, "could
you teach us anything more useless?"

29
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:12,311
What are you looking at?

30
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:19,388
My God. Something's
wrong. She's not breathing.

31
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:24,257
Call 911.

32
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,794


33
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,907


34
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,236


35
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:16,581
Would you mind at least putting
a napkin under your jelly toast?

36
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:20,055
Get a table, and I won't
eat it on the couch.

37
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,380
Yes, you will.

38
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,824
But I won't have a good excuse.

39
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,381
Why don't you go get a table?

40
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,898
Not my condo.

41
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,645
You have my permission.
Pick out whatever you want.

42
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,672
It would be a reflection of me,
not you. That wouldn't be right.

43
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,228
It would be a reflection of the fact

44
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:40,219
that the guy who's been mooching off
of me for as long as I can remember

45
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:42,221
isn't a complete ingrate.

46
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,144
You've never furnished a home.

47
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,229
I have furnished a bunch of homes.

48
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,691
No, you've married a bunch of women
who furnished a bunch of homes.

49
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,653
You want to eat off something? Fine.
Move your piano in here, eat off that.

50
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,823
- You're afraid.
- Of a dining table?

51
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,144
You know, they don't actually come to life

52
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,495
when you put a knob off
your bedpost on them.

53
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,358
You are what you sit in.

54
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:12,167
Your friends, your job, your
furnishings... It all defines you.

55
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:15,714
You don't really believe that. You
just don't want to do the shopping.

56
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,522
Buy some furniture,

57
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,962
or admit that you're empty inside.

58
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:34,198
X-rays confirm the fluid that
almost suffocated her to death

59
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,642
was from pulmonary edema.

60
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,918
Means the problem is either
in her heart or lungs.

61
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,287
Tox screen's clean for
everything except the alcohol,

62
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,327
and her B.A.C. was barely .05.

63
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,765
That means she only had
one or two drinks, tops.

64
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,890
And there's no sign of trauma.

65
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,975
How'd you know?

66
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,207
Because if there was, Cuddy wouldn't
have needed me to take the case.

67
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,701
- How do you...
- Foreman's the only one with the balls

68
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,843
to take a case without checking with
me, and he's still working on breakfast,

69
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,521
which means that the...

70
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:02,835
18...

71
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,887
No, 17-year-old
honor student...

72
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,681
Cuddy has a soft spot

73
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,458
for smart girls, and
they don't start drinking

74
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,698
until second semester, senior year.

75
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,839
So either you think that smart women

76
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:17,214
look out for each other,
which means you're an idiot,

77
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,401
or you think Cuddy's
not smart, which means...

78
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,488
- I guess it's the same both ways.
- Then how did you...

79
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,207
Picture fell out of the
file. She looks smart.

80
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,618
- Where's Taub?
- You don't already know?

81
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:31,487
He's at home in a fight with his wife.
I'm curious what he wanted me to know.

82
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:33,707
His car has a flat tire.
He's waiting for a tow truck.

83
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,877
What about rising blood
pressure from binge drinking?

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,296
It could set off a hypertensive
crisis, cause heart failure.

85
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:42,675
- Two drinks is hardly a binge.
- Certainly not if you're an Aussie.

86
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:46,280
But when an American schoolgirl
has two drinks before 10:00 am,

87
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:49,181
it's a pretty sure bet that
the plan is to have a lot more.

88
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,933
Probably wasn't the first time.

89
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,687
We'll get a C-13-pyruvate MRI to
check for cardiac lactic-acid levels.

90
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,368
Someone call Taub.

91
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:59,191
Tell him to cut the ball
and chain on his own time.

92
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,615
We're arguing about couples yoga?

93
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,531
We're arguing because we don't
ever do anything together anymore.

94
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,908
We don't ever do anything together?

95
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,078
I love you, but I swear,
if you start talking to me

96
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,496
like I'm on the witness stand
again, I break your neck.

97
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,748
- We do stuff together all the time.
- Really? Like what?

98
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:19,662
Besides sleeping, watching
TV, going out to dinner,

99
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,213
what do we do together,

100
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,601
just the two of us?

101
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:23,726
We...

102
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:28,059
You don't like going out to dinner?

103
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,181
All right, I'll do the yoga.

104
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,865
- Forget it.
- Now you don't want me to do it?

105
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:35,436
Go to work.

106
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,106
I'm not leaving until we work this out.

107
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,351
I'm fine.

108
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:41,624
Please,

109
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:42,568
just go.

110
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,956
Where's Abby Nash?

111
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,722
I'm Nick, her boyfriend. This is my dad.

112
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,433
- You can wait in...
- Where is she?

113
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,186
Is she okay?

114
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,624
- She's having some tests run.
- Is she okay?

115
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,611
We think her drinking may
have damaged her heart.

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Her heart?

117
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,368
- She doesn't drink, not that much.
- Just when she's at school?

118
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,079
Nick, what's he talking about?

119
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,864
It was a field trip. One
of the kids had a fake I.D.

120
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,044
- But, Dad, you know Abby. Tell him.
- I know her when you're with me...

121
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:45,143
If you're right, the tests
will come back negative.

122
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:47,199
Can you give her a message?

123
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,118
I brought her homework...

124
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:51,493
and I love her.

125
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,109
Sorry I'm late.

126
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,249
Nick loves you.

127
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,280
House doesn't believe you got a flat tire.

128
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,622
- What does he think I was doing?
- Fighting with the wife.

129
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,685
Why would I lie about that?

130
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:24,889
She wants me to do yoga.

131
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,366
We need thinner cuts.

132
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,715
When you and Cameron had disagreements...

133
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,790
I'm probably not the best guy

134
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,476
- to go to for marital advice.
- Sorry.

135
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,648
- Punch in to the mitral valve.
- All right, I get the message.

136
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,870
No, I'm serious.

137
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:49,166
What is that?

138
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,473
Could be a fungus.

139
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,949
E.R. drew blood cultures... all
negative, no parasites, no fungus.

140
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,075
It could be fastidious enteric bacteria.

141
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:11,833
You think she's been
eating your wife's cooking?

142
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,137
I'm on your side, man.

143
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,182
I am not fighting with my wife. I
had a flat tire. It's in my trunk.

144
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,951
- You can go look at it if you want.
- Don't need to.

145
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,754
Face tells me you're bluffing.

146
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,523
- Not yours... Chase's.
- If she was infected

147
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,859
through the intestinal
tract, she'd have symptoms.

148
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,528
There are other ways to get
bacteria into the bloodstream.

149
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,031
She's not an intravenous
drug user, she has no tattoos,

150
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,241
and no scars that would
indicate she's not a cutter.

151
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,376
Transesophageal echo could give us a
better idea of what we're looking at.

152
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,456
If that valve is about to dehisce,
echo could trigger a heart attack.

153
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:46,011
So come up with a better idea
or have a crash cart ready.

154
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,184
Why are you lying to House?

155
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,221
- Chase told me. What's the big deal?
- We can talk about this another time...

156
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,212
Or never.

157
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:00,461
I really don't think
she's gonna tell anyone.

158
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:03,644
If I admit we're fighting, he's
gonna want to know what about.

159
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,230
So tell him, or tell him
it's none of his business.

160
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:10,192
- This is easier.
- Really? Because it seems much harder.

161
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,213
What do I know? I'm not a guy.

162
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:15,530
If only I could be as open about
my emotional life as you are.

163
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,090
- It's not about the yoga.
- Really? I thought it was,

164
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:23,341
since we spent an hour talking about
it, but what do I know? I'm not a girl.

165
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,723
My guess is she thinks you
don't want to spend time with her

166
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:27,942
because you're spending
it with someone else.

167
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,587
If she thinks I'm cheating, she would ask.

168
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,375
Because you'd tell the truth?

169
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,717
- I'm not seeing anyone else.
- Doesn't matter. You have a history.

170
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,751
- And that's not her fault.
- So what am I supposed to do?

171
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,848
- I can't prove a negative.
- That is a problem.

172
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,383
There's the heart.

173
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,773
Valves look fine... No
vegetations, no myxomatous changes.

174
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,328
Can you give her a little more sedative?

175
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,825
- She's dissecting.
- She's rupturing. Get the scope out.

176
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:05,415
This doesn't make sense. B.P. is
normal, her heart rate was controlled.

177
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,042
We'll figure it out later. We've only
got about 30 seconds to get her open.

178
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,979
No leakage from cannulation site.

179
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,104
Nice.

180
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:17,516
- Let's see if she'll start up.
- Cardiac paddle.

181
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:20,918
Charging.

182
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:22,918
And go.

183
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,267
- Come on.
- Again.

184
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:26,775
Go.

185
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,563
Pushing five CCs adrenaline.

186
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,067
Zap her again.

187
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,492
It's not working. Clear.

188
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,038
Clear.

189
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,583
Normal sinus rhythm.

190
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:53,618
Thank God.

191
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,597
TEE and intra-operative visualization

192
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:09,603
showed no vegetation on the valves.

193
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,546
No structural abnormalities.

194
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:13,669
The dissection means alcohol didn't cause

195
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,108
the hypertensive crisis.

196
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:16,856
By "we", you mean "you".

197
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,526
You didn't have any better ideas.

198
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,948
It's not my fault. I was
busy trying to judge Taub.

199
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,401
Since we already ruled out trauma,
the dissection is probably genetic.

200
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:29,456
- She's not marfanoid.
- What about an allergy?

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,126
A severe enough one could set
off a systemic immune reaction,

202
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,628
cause fluids in the lungs

203
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,587
and inflammation weakening the aorta.

204
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,550
If it was an allergy, she'd
be getting better, not worse.

205
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,176
Unless it was inside her.

206
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,396
Meaning?

207
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,026
You want my sperm?

208
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:51,964
We think a severe allergic reaction
could be causing systemic breakdown.

209
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,489
To my son's sperm?

210
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:55,524
His semen is more likely the problem.

211
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:59,432
Which I realize is not
what you were reacting to.

212
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,696
When's the last time
you had unprotected sex?

213
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,635
Never, I use a condom.

214
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:08,286
You always use a condom? For everything?

215
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,084
- For most everything.
- When?

216
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,138
The night before she collapsed.

217
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,539
I'm placing a drop of Nick's
semen protein onto the skin.

218
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:25,657
Then I'll abrade it with a needle,
check for a rash in an hour or so.

219
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,560
Mom, come on... We've been
dating for three years.

220
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,807
I'm not mad, sweetheart.

221
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,711
I'm just confused.

222
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,541
A systemic reaction can be
triggered by the protein in semen.

223
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,904
In most cases, the
reaction is fairly minor.

224
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,406
But in rare cases,

225
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,823
repeat exposure can trigger
a hypersensitivity response.

226
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,536
Repeat exposure?

227
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,510
I know, I know, three years.

228
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:55,000
Is it supposed to hurt?

229
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:59,171
- The reaction should take longer...
- No, it's not that.

230
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,047
- What's wrong?
- My stomach.

231
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,489
Blood in the urine.

232
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,769
No allergic reaction. But,
her kidneys are failing.

233
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:19,325
Could be some kind of neuropathy.
Syphilitic lightning pains?

234
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,967
It's not syphilis.

235
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,151
VDRL and enzyme
immunoassays were negative.

236
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:25,697
Blood clot?

237
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,074
While she's on anticoagulants
from the surgery?

238
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,743
Interstitial nephritis?

239
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,940
Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.

240
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,413
But cancer could.

241
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,208
Would you care to be more specific?

242
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,168
If I could, I would have.

243
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,463
We could do a full-body scan.

244
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,633
We hate full-body scans.

245
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,718
And by "we" you mean "you".

246
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:48,750
We also hate when a patient dies

247
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,889
before we figure out
what's wrong with them.

248
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,132
Do the scan.

249
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,180
How can you convince
someone you're not cheating?

250
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,405
Don't cheat.

251
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,632
- After a while, they'll catch on.
- What if I don't want to wait?

252
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:06,821
Take them with you for 24 hours.

253
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,991
So your wife's a little
insecure. Is that so bad?

254
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,327
You know she still cares.

255
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,016
I know she cares.

256
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,743
What I want is for her to be happy.

257
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:21,211
What?

258
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:23,710
You don't think I want
my wife to be happy?

259
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:24,835
Sure...

260
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,633
As long as it makes you happy.

261
00:15:58,481 --> 00:15:59,881
What do you think?

262
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,491
I think you work quickly.

263
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,305
Piece of cake.

264
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,327
Give them money, they give you furniture.

265
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,991
Not bad, huh?

266
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:13,087
It's not bad at all.

267
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,365
It's taking a really long time.

268
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,986
<i>Just hang in there and try
not to talk unless you have to.</i>

269
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:30,647
<i>It can affect the images.</i>

270
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:33,325
What was that?

271
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,160
Are you still there?

272
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,756
There's something wrong with the machine.

273
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,904
<i>It's not the machine, it's an earthquake.</i>

274
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:44,252
<i>We'll get you out.</i>

275
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,670
Get me out now.

276
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,092
Oh, my God!

277
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:27,712
I can't hold on!

278
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:42,191
- It's a black hole.
- She's hallucinating.

279
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,816
I certainly hope so.

280
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,016
Hallucination means brain problem.

281
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:54,978
Brain problems don't split your aorta.

282
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,740
A vascular problem could explain both.

283
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:59,983
Inflammation in the blood-vessel walls

284
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,903
leads to dissection in the aorta

285
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:05,490
and could cause an aneurysm in the
brain that could cause the visions.

286
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,215
It's a bit convoluted,

287
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,587
but brain and heart
function are susceptible.

288
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,798
If there was any sign of inflammation,

289
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,548
that would make sense.

290
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:55,783
It's not funny.

291
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,989
- I got enough problems already.
- Trust me, this is gonna help.

292
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,848
An aneurysm explains the hallucinations.

293
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,850
It's the one thing we haven't
excluded from the differential.

294
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,228
Your texting doesn't
prove you're faithful.

295
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,856
Just proves you know she
thinks you're unfaithful.

296
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:11,813
Can't force trust.

297
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,902
What did she hallucinate?

298
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:17,165
The content of the
hallucination isn't relevant.

299
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,140
- Not usually.
- Not ever.

300
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:22,494
We know nothing, brain knows all.

301
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:24,672
You get an ulcer, you don't know it,

302
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,879
but the brain increases mucin secretions.

303
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:29,584
It knows what the problem
is, where the problem is.

304
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,209
It's a big logical jump
from a body's immune response

305
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,506
to the brain giving
subconscious diagnostic clues.

306
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,634
What about dreaming about waterfalls,
if you need to go to the bathroom?

307
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:40,804
That's the same as the brain
shouting, "You have cancer".

308
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:44,022
Her subconscious is trying
to tell her something.

309
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,697
We need to eavesdrop.

310
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,216
She was screaming she was
being sucked into a black hole,

311
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,356
so we should look for a tumor in her anus?

312
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:53,364
We need the whole story.

313
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,069
The cognitive pattern recognition program

314
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,404
might tell us what's going on in her head.

315
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,495
Or we could act on something

316
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,285
based on science, not sci-fi.

317
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,580
Get an MRA with contrast to
see if she has an aneurysm,

318
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:10,166
unless you think Cuddy's
gonna go for the mind reading.

319
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,043
Fine, do the MRA.

320
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,587
When it comes back negative,
we can move on to the...

321
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,358
Crazy but possible ideas.

322
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,834
What did you do with the furniture?

323
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,508
I returned it.

324
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:03,136
You told me to buy it.

325
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,763
But you didn't buy it. You rented it.

326
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:08,507
You made one phone call

327
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,125
"Economy furniture supply".

328
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,700
"We get it done so you don't have to."

329
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,412
So what? We had a table, chairs...

330
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,151
But no clue what any of it meant.

331
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:20,695
Fine, I'll hire a decorator.

332
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:22,171
Perfect.

333
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:25,158
- Another woman to tell you who you are.
- I'll hire a male decorator.

334
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,703
Step inside one furniture store
and find one thing you like.

335
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:30,781
I like not doing this.

336
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:32,624
One.

337
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,013
Where's my mom?

338
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:54,162
She went down to get some breakfast.

339
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:56,501
How are you feeling?

340
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,325
Well, besides the fact
that I can barely breathe

341
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,950
and I ache all over,

342
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:03,075
not good.

343
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:06,538
Anything I can do?

344
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,290
Just don't go.

345
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:12,199
I'm not going anywhere.

346
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:30,159
Been a while since we've gone
more than a day without doing that.

347
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,557
<i>Not going anywhere.</i>

348
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,045
What'd you say?

349
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,071
I've been thinking.

350
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:41,901
<i>Been a long time since we went
more than a day without doing that.</i>

351
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,096
We have a secret.

352
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,979
You don't need to answer right now.

353
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:06,676
Abby, I want to marry you.

354
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,764
Tell him.

355
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:13,615
It's okay.

356
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:18,112
Something's wrong.

357
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,808
- What are you feeling?
- I don't know.

358
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,317
Your secret is killing you.

359
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,485
I see...

360
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,202
Maybe it's all the medication.

361
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,377
I'm just...

362
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:35,856
Can you hear me?

363
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,431
You deserve to die.

364
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,044
Four milligrams of lorazepam.

365
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:53,084
She seized for over a minute.

366
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:56,209
Inner-ictal EEG showed
no synchronous discharges.

367
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:57,989
And the MRA?

368
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:01,933
No aneurysms or arterial or
venous malformations in the brain.

369
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:03,263
As predicted.

370
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:06,212
What did we say we'd move on to?

371
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,274
Out-of-body experiences
can be induced

372
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,656
by sensory overload in the
temporoparietal junction.

373
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,285
Which was clean on MRI,
MRA, and whole-body scan.

374
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,549
Which just leaves us with the question

375
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:20,374
of what happened during
the out-of-body experience.

376
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:24,406
If I say her BP shot up over
200 and she bit her tongue,

377
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,313
would that be a satisfactory answer?

378
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:29,290
Sure. If you then went on
to answer the following...

379
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,719
Did she float above her
body? Did she see Jesus?

380
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,651
Did she bathe in the Ganges?

381
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:36,808
No, no, and no. Can we get
back to the medical science?

382
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,026
She claims she emerged from her body

383
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,355
as a younger version of
herself and started talking.

384
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,454
She couldn't remember what was discussed.

385
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:46,779
I'm sure it wasn't a differential.

386
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,584
Cognitive pattern recognition

387
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,780
is 50 years from being a diagnostic tool.

388
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:54,084
Even if we can get the equipment, it
takes hours for the initial mapping.

389
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:55,759
She could stroke out.

390
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:59,038
Coincidentally, she could also
have a stroke if we do nothing.

391
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,517
I'm not telling a mother
who's scared out of her mind

392
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:03,262
our best shot is a magic trick.

393
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:05,601
It's not magical, it's experimental.

394
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:08,714
Just like washing your
hands after pooping once was.

395
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,968
Technically, it's not our
best shot, it's our only shot.

396
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,348
Perfect.

397
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:17,932
Foreman, get her consent.

398
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,476
The rest of you go
down to the cog sci lab.

399
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,603
Equipment should already be there.

400
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:33,955
I'll catch up.

401
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,270
Thanks for the invite.

402
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:43,166
Not sure I'm up for the hospital food.

403
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:45,626
Good, 'cause I wasn't planning on lunch.

404
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,644
While you watch video clips,

405
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:52,425
a computer maps how your
brain processes the images.

406
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,607
How long will it take?

407
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:56,971
Six hours. But that's
really just the prep.

408
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,264
Once the computer maps how
she processes the information,

409
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:01,851
we'll put her under sedation,

410
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,313
use the same equipment to
monitor her unconscious thoughts.

411
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,150
Hopefully, it'll spit out a basic
video of what's going on in her head.

412
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,310
What will that tell you?

413
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:13,020
Hopefully, it'll give us a clue

414
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:15,031
as to where your brain
thinks the problem is.

415
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,201
- A lot of "hopefullys".
- Could it hurt her?

416
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:23,080
We're at a diagnostic dead
end. We gotta try something.

417
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,174
This is much better than lunch.

418
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,530
I agree.

419
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:41,265
What made you think of this?

420
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:42,763
I missed you.

421
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,644
No, I mean this...

422
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,688
car, in the parking lot.

423
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,901
I don't like feeling maybe this
isn't the first time you've done this.

424
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:53,573
It's the first.

425
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,030
I love you. You know that, right?

426
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:03,520
I want you to be able to trust me.

427
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,743
And I want to, but...

428
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:15,758
Inspiration point doesn't
open till after dark.

429
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:18,928
Got a real cool magic show about to start.

430
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:24,214
Also, I'm gonna need to check your spare.

431
00:27:50,555 --> 00:27:52,724
<i>Abby, can you think of something specific?</i>

432
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,190
Like what?

433
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,483
Doesn't matter. Just
make it a single image.

434
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:17,862
- What are you thinking?
- About Nick playing baseball.

435
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:19,750
Holy crap.

436
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,407
That's amazing.

437
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,911
Now all we have to do
is read her subconscious

438
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,952
and hope that it's completely
rational and went to med school.

439
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:32,915
Does anything get you excited?

440
00:28:40,374 --> 00:28:42,026
Can I help you with something?

441
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:47,183
I was wondering if you could tell me
a little bit about this dining table.

442
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:50,431
It's made of wood, and you eat off it.

443
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,795
- So you're paid by commission?
- It's furniture.

444
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,552
Find something you like.
Let me know. I'll ring it up.

445
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,151
Thank you so much.

446
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:31,611
Okay, that's... that's not the one.

447
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,537
That is a remarkable collection,
if I can show it to you.

448
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:41,862
I'm Gabriella.

449
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,991
I'm really just looking for
a nice dining-room table.

450
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,411
I see. You're daring.

451
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:51,939
Yes, I do that sometimes, but...

452
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:54,792
Right now why am I daring?

453
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,002
You're not constrained by rules.

454
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,505
What attracts you in the patio section?

455
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,884
Wait, this is a patio tab... For outside?

456
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,988
Well, it's taken us just over an hour

457
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,906
to prove that she has a
very boring subconscious.

458
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:29,910
Anyone ever tell you you
can be a real buzzkill?

459
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,332
Stars?

460
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,344
Maybe that's a stripe?

461
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:39,712
It's the sky.

462
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,799
She's thinking about the moon
and the stars and the sky.

463
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,879
She's going to Stanford to study physics.

464
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:48,220
It's not a big revelation
that she'd think about the sky.

465
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:51,307
Or... star could be a white blood cell.

466
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,719
Leukemia?

467
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,434
Who's that?

468
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,151
Her dad? He died when she was eight.

469
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,777
What did daddy die of?

470
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,363
Private-plane crash, no connection.

471
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,676
Stars, moon, sky,

472
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,208
white blood cells, heart valves,

473
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,747
black holes, or anus

474
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,499
or a million other circular
passageways into the body

475
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:18,083
and her dad.

476
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:19,951
What do you think it means?

477
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,712
She likes school, and
she has daddy issues...

478
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,842
Neither of which helps us.

479
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,255
So now what do we do? Start over?

480
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:35,800
We obviously missed something.

481
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:38,395
- What about the liver?
- What about her left toe?

482
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,215
Sorry, I thought we were
randomly picking out body parts

483
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,109
that had nothing to do with her symptoms.

484
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,111
Liver's responsible for proteins,

485
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,614
immunological effects,
production of red blood cells.

486
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,201
Might be able to explain the
lungs, the hallucinations.

487
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,827
Not the aortic dissection.

488
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,383
Kidneys are also failing.

489
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,235
We add in polycystic disease,
could explain the dissection.

490
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,754
So that's one imperfect
theory, plus a rare complication

491
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,138
of a second theory, which
gives us a complete explanation.

492
00:32:09,223 --> 00:32:10,923
Don't polish the notion.

493
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,467
Pineal gland is calcified.

494
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,397
It'supposed to be calcified.
Happens after puberty.

495
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:19,572
What if it's obscuring a tumor?

496
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,604
It's the only place we
couldn't look inside.

497
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,402
Get a better look at her pineal gland
with three Tesla fast spin echo MRI.

498
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:37,650
You're pacing my office
'cause you're buying furniture?

499
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:38,988
I'm pacing your office

500
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:41,576
`cause I'm physically
incapable of buying furniture.

501
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:43,043
For Amber's old place?

502
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,526
- It needs some new...
- I know you bought the place I wanted.

503
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:51,010
You're a jerk. Let's
move on. Hire a decorator.

504
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:54,346
I'm supposed to find me.

505
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,223
Backpack through Europe.

506
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:58,183
It's hard to believe,

507
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:00,894
but you know what says even more
about who you are than your furniture?

508
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,815
The fact that you are letting
House tell you how to buy furniture.

509
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,685
Call Beatrice.

510
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:23,782
MRI revealed no remarkable
features on her pineal gland.

511
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:27,546
But there were slightly elevated levels
of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.

512
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:31,774
Which we would expect to see if
there was an allergic reaction.

513
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:33,385
There's definitely no allergy.

514
00:33:35,397 --> 00:33:38,132
Parasite? There's this middle eastern...

515
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,351
How exactly do you want to be shot down?

516
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:42,019
On the basis of the fact

517
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,676
that she's never been within
6,000 miles of the middle east,

518
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:46,690
or on the basis of the
fact that all our scans

519
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,630
and urine samples came back clean?

520
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:52,910
And yet she's still failing,

521
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:54,535
system after system.

522
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,860
So either we find the answer at autopsy

523
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:01,400
or...

524
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:06,970
What?

525
00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:12,216
I got nothin'.

526
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,758
I was gonna head out.

527
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,290
If there's any change,
I assume you'll page me?

528
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,446
Are you having an affair?

529
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:01,509
Does it bother you that your wife

530
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,059
doesn't have the guts to actually
ask that question, and I do?

531
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,130
On both ends, yes.

532
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:08,767
Difference is, I'm not
afraid of the answer.

533
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:10,399
And I might believe you.

534
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:13,152
- I'm not having an affair.
- But you want to.

535
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:16,640
No, I don't. I'm through living like that.

536
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:17,666
Why?

537
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,121
You finally got to the point

538
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:22,786
where half your age plus
seven just isn't young enough?

539
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,047
Talk to you later, House.

540
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:28,441
Or is it because you now really
are old enough to be their...

541
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:33,659
The dad.

542
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:37,426
Does he travel for work?

543
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:40,929
What do you mean, "does he"?
He died almost ten years ago.

544
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,703
Not hers, her boyfriend's.

545
00:35:47,429 --> 00:35:49,329
He's the one in her visions.

546
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:56,378
I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor.

547
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,742
It's a mouthful, but probably
not as tricky as your title.

548
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:05,954
- Is Abby gonna be all right?
- Do you travel a lot?

549
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:08,123
I have a food-import business. Why?

550
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:09,684
Where'd you go?

551
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,795
All over, France, Italy,
the Mediterranean. Why?

552
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:15,756
I think you exposed her to a parasite.

553
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,512
- I thought the scans didn't show any.
- Because she doesn't have any.

554
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:24,304
- But you just said.
- It's cool.

555
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:28,428
My theory is that her body was
able to kill off the parasite,

556
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,165
but what it couldn't do
was get rid of the shell,

557
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,233
which doesn't show up on the scans.

558
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:37,186
That little piece of microscopic garbage

559
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,314
set off an allergic reaction

560
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:42,001
called cerebellar schistosomiasis

561
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:44,243
delayed hypersensitivity allergy,

562
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,390
or cusdehaaa.

563
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:50,082
Risky, unpleasant treatment,
but completely curable.

564
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,167
That's fantastic.

565
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,813
You'd think so, wouldn't
you? Only thing is,

566
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:58,457
did you ever have sex
with your son's girlfriend?

567
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:03,470
- Where the hell do you get off ask...
- Shut up.

568
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:08,809
See, I can't treat this
unless I can confirm it,

569
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:12,145
the only way she could've been
exposed to this parasite is sexually,

570
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:15,691
which means she's gonna die soon unless
you admit that you slept with her.

571
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:21,167
Dad?

572
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:23,749
- What's going on?
- Gee, this is bad,

573
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:26,309
because you now have to
choose between her living

574
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:28,412
and the truth becoming public.

575
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:30,664
And frankly, given what the truth is,

576
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,700
it's a tough call.

577
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,348
You'd broken up.

578
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,048
She was crying.

579
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,872
Your girlfriend is not
allergic to your semen.

580
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,990
She's allergic to the Egyptian parasite

581
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:46,805
swimming around in your dad's semen.

582
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,959
- You slept with Abby?
- I was drunk.

583
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,622
We both...

584
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,733
No need to explain.
Technically, she was legal.

585
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,946
Wait, wait, wait.

586
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:09,357
All things considered,
it's actually great news.

587
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:26,328
So what do you think?

588
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,556
You wussed out, and you used a decorator.

589
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,140
Why can't that be me?

590
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,019
- The wuss who loves decorators?
- 'Cause it's not.

591
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,421
Okay. It's not.

592
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,023
But don't return it. I
can't keep doing this.

593
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:39,695
You have to.

594
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,726
You can't keep letting
other people define you.

595
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,580
Not another elephant.

596
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:06,068
Decorator didn't pick this.

597
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,829
You're gonna have to buy your own cape.

598
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,997
I like what this says about you, Wilson.

599
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,802
I don't remember him
at the wedding. Do you?

600
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:58,622
I don't remember most of the
people who were at our wedding.

601
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:03,616
Which is why...

602
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:09,116
I thought I'd ask the love
of my life to marry me.

603
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:13,261
We're already married.

604
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:16,807
I want to be better at it.

605
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:22,854
It's beautiful.

606
00:41:51,797 --> 00:41:53,297
What'd you tell him?

607
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:55,804
That it doesn't mean she doesn't love him.

608
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,680
And he bought it?

609
00:42:00,174 --> 00:42:01,174
It's true.

610
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:07,418
Your wife say yes?

611
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:11,543
- How did you know...
- Monkey see, monkey do.

612
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:15,574
At least he has the
young and stupid excuse.

613
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:17,231
She said yes.

614
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:21,779
Good for you.
